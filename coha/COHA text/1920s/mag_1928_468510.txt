have advanced 50 per cent , junior re ? porters and book reviewers the same , poets 25 per cent , whereas , rather oddly , space writers get actually 10 per cent less than before . I am told that writers for the high-grade magazines get about double . Comparing the flat price paid for scholarly volumes in two similar works twenty years ago and now , I found that the scholars working to-day were paid no more than before the War . On a royalty basis , owing to higher book prices and larger sales , authors probably fare better than fifteen years ago , though strict comparison for many reasons is difficult . On the whole , taking the or ? dinary man of letters who lives by his output and who writes books , articles , reviews , and does the other various liter ? ary jobs , it would seem that in order to maintain himself in the same relative position in the social and economic scale he would have to increase his output materially . This would seem to be borne out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few cases . A.

Works on a literary job every week-day and four evenings ; writes Sundays . C.

A scholar and important cultural influence , died of a stroke caused by overwork . These are or were all people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national and , in several eases , international reputations . There has been no question of aspiring to compete with the incomes of business executives , merely an effort to provide to some ex ? tent for the future and to live with some ? thing approaching the decency easily open to them before the high standard hit the country . Business rewards are greater than ever for those who are successful , but granted the social value of the business man 's services and granted also the " dignity of labor , " it may well be asked whether a standard of living is really intrinsically high which thus places additional bur ? dens on the shoulders of whole classes of the country 's spiritual and intellectual leadership , its clergymen , its leachers , ' and writers , in order to lighten the load of the carpenters , cooks , and chamber ? maids ? It may be truly said that So ? ciety has always expected the intellectual classes to content themselves to a great extent with rewards that are not pecuni ? ary . That is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tremendously increased gulf between the man of large income and the man of a moderate one has served to depress these classes in the comparative scale far below the point of two decades ago . I have every sympathy with labor , but its increased share of the national income should come from the accumulating sur ? plus , the location of which is very clearly indicated from the income tax lists , and not from mulcting the professional and clerical classes scarcely a step now in the economic scale above labor itself . I can not see that the standard of life for the community as a whole is going to be made higher by taking a vacation and a cook away from the college professor and giving them to the conductor or the bricklayer , while the rich business men get incredibly richer . Before we leave this phase of the question , let us glance at some of the office workers under the new standard . What mass production methods have done in the way of deadening routine for the factory workers is too well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work may be less generally understood . The new idea of the relations between employer and employee in mass produc ? tion is that the employer buys " produc ? tion , " that is , " output , " from the em ? ployee . Thus we read in a book on office technic how improvement was made in an up-to-date office . Motion pictures were taken of the clerks opening the morning mail . As a result of a study of these pictures , the motions of the clerks were " reduced from thirteen to six and the output increased from 100 pieces an hour to 200 an hour . A further refine ? ment in the manner of arranging the opened and unopened letters on the table brought the rate to 250 an hour . Out ? put was still further increased by the use of a ' motion studied table ' to 300 an hour . " Stenographers , of course , have been included in this speeding-up process . We read that " in measuring production of this kind several systems are in use . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a transparent cellu ? loid , but in most cases a cyclometer is used , which is attached to the machine and records the number of strokes . " Production is counted by " points , " each " point " being equal to a certain number of strokes , and pay is given accordingly . 250 strokes are deducted for an ordinary error and 1275 strokes for an error on the envelope . 10,000 strokes arc added for " a perfect desk , " that is one on which , every minute of the week , every imple ? ment is so placed as to permit of the greatest speed . Medals and vacation allowances are given for records , and contests are held ? though , as to these last , the expert admits that " as a general rule , office contests are not to be recom ? mended . Spurts of speed of any kind are bound to have their reactions and the contest is often succeeded by a certain amount of lethargy after the goal has been won . Italics mine . But for clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force they may be very effec ? tive . " One rubs one 's eyes and wonders whether he is reading about America under the highest standard of living ever attained or England at the beginning of the industrial revolution . Stenogra ? phers share in the high standard to the extent of from $1250 to $1800 a year . It would be possible to go on almost indefinitely listing our by-products . For example , having everything from furniture to buildings always of the latest is doing away with a whole range of human emotions . When I was at Yale in 1898 I lived in a new dormitory then one year old . Twenty years later when I went back to see what memories the old place might bring to me , I found that the dormitory had been torn down and replaced by a " modern " building . Our schools and their furnishings , altered or rebuilt every few years , make an Eton or a Harrow look painfully shabby perhaps and " unprogressive " ; but the boy who sits at the same desk where Shelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat , or lives in their rooms , will dream dreams and gain an inspiration never afforded by the latest efficient furniture from Michigan . It is the law of compensation at work , and what is gained is not always better than what is lost . So far , what has been gained under the high standard is mostly material and what has been lost is mostly spiritual . It might be thought that with a really high standard , the extra nerve strain of life would be compensated for by extra opportunity for rest , leisure , and quiet , but exactly the reverse is the case . There is less leisure , except perhaps for the old poor and the new very rich , than there was twenty years ago . It is also infinitely harder than it was to find any quiet spot in the country at possible cost to which one can retire to rest one 's tired mind and soul . The automobile offers an instructive example of how an end can be defeated by its apparent means . When there were few cars they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them during long , sunny afternoons , his head pillowed against the fragrant comfort of a haystack . He memorized stray quota ? tions from Shakespeare and Tennyson . He discovered Joan of Arc , a girl who commanded an army from a horse and got burned for her trouble in an un ? pronounceable town in France . An octopus was a kind of eight-footed fish , and the amber stem of his pipe was once a yellow mass floating in the Baltic Sea . And so it went until September . Then Mike began to feel uneasy . There were frosty warnings in the air , and the shorn fields reminded him that granaries were full and that the fields were empty . Time to look out for a haven . He began eying the farms as he passed and several times he caught himself eying one as if he were the owner of it . Why not ? His father would be glad to have him spend the money that way . Mike felt elated . He would push on to Crittenden , one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten miles this side of it , he was stopped by Miss Beatrice O'Brien . It was a yellow afternoon in Septem ? ber . The sun rained down from a cloudless sky , puddling the clipped land and showering the roofs with honey-tinted radiance . The road was warm under the glittering dust . Then out from the shadow of a weatherbeaten wall rode Miss O'Brien . She rode Iike a young Joan who had forgotten her destiny and was content to be just charming . And how charming she was , mounted high on a sorrel horse , her lithe legs emerging from a short skirt of brown corduroy , her breast curving under a blouse of bronze silk , her amber eyes sparkling under brown brows , and her shining hair shadowed by the tip-tilted cockiness of a brown hat ! A troop of untidy school children clamored after her , and at her side dangled a coil of new rope , rope which glistened knowingly in the slanting sun , as if it shared a subtle secret with the gleaming girl who had hung it there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow her down the shimmering road . As he tramped along behind her he mused about her in terms of those romantic clippings he had pored over during the past weeks . She was Rosalind . . . the Lady of Shalott . . Joan . . . a Russian princess who had dipped amber from the Baltic Sea ... . Now , Mike had seen other girls astride horses , pretty ones too , but they had never affected him beyond a temporary marveling at their soft way of being pretty . Why did this particular one affect him this way ? Was it because she had in the most sudden and perfect way possible climaxed a summer that had unshackled his body and put a luminous promise upon his soul ? Per ? haps . At any rate , Mike lived a thou ? sand rosy hours in one as he followed Beatrice O'Brien along that cooling road and through the Seeley gate . She was there when he entered , motionless on her bright horse , ab ? sently fingering that pale coil of rope . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped the bridle rein over his arm . " You 're the new hired man , I guess ? " she said . " 1 guess so , " answered Mike , un ? certainly , wishing he could rim and leave his voice there alone with her . She laughed , and as she laughed Mike felt relieved . Angels could talk , but he had never heard of one laughing . He breathed more easily as he led his divinity 's horse toward the barn . He emerged twenty minutes later , the Seeley 's hired man . The Seeleys were one of the most prosperous couples in the county . Ephraim was big and hairy and honest , with one of the loudest voices ever given by God to a man . Martha , his straight , starched wife , dwindled into meek silence under the impact of it . Not that Martha was the meek type . Had n't she dreamed and brought all but one of her dreams to pass ? As a girl in a little village in Ohio , she had Now Beatrice O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of a Crittenden lawyer . But Mr. O'Brien had invested too much money in sterile Dakota land , and if Beatrice wanted to wear silk on week days and dangle topazes about her slim neck , she must earn them herself .. . . Here she was doing the only thing she could do , which was teach school , and in the country at that . It was dull . The Seeleys where she boarded were nice but dull too . Now here was this new hired man , this Irishman with his tali , broadly shouldered body and his sensitive face under the bold red waves of hair and something in his eyes that made her think of a word she had come across in a book once ? troubadour . It might be fun . But there was no fun . For five months there was nothing warmer be ? tween them than the steaming dishes on the supper table and a hastily tossed bridle rein . And it was Mike 's fault , for he met every attempt of hers to lessen the constraint between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the barn with her tawny wreath of rope over his arm and dream . And thus it was that there was five months of dawn that reminded him of her faintly flushed purity ; five months of sun that he faced reverently because it was the color of her hair ; five months of stars , two of which lived in her eyes . Then came that complicated Saturday in March when that other poet entered into it . It was raining . The Seeleys had driven Beatrice into town and had stayed there to do the marketing . Mike was sitting in the kitchen reading a book which he had filched from the parlor . It was a bulky treatise on etiquette , and as Mike read he sighed . The road a gentleman traveled was an intricate one . A gentleman jumped to his feet when a lady entered the room . He pulled out chairs for her . It was all so beyond him that he dropped the book and relaxed into somnolence . He felt better floating off into a high , white place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's lady on a pedestal . He was aroused by a violent knocking at the door . In reply to his shouted " Come in ! " it opened , and a black-coated , genteel-looking little man en , tered . He seemed to drip hair and water . Both trickled down from under his rusty derby hat and rivuleted across the stiff bosom of his smudged shirt . " Wife home ? " he asked , blinking his weak eyes at Mike . " I 'm the hired man , " explained Mike . " Folks are in town . " " I see , " drawled the stranger thought ? fully . " I see . " " Bad day , " volunteered Mike , pushing a chair toward his visitor . " Yes , " he answered , taking the edge of the chair as if contamination lurked in the back of it . " It 's hard on my busi ? ness . " He paused and coughed im ? portantly . " Lightning rods ? " hazarded Mike . The little man 's sandy hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant finger in Mike 's face . " It 's only the ignorant who sell lightning rods . My line , my dear sir , is books , " and he drew a large volume bound in black leather from a green cloth bag and laid it reverently on Mike 's knees . Gems from the World 's Best Literature marched across the cover in heavy gilt . The agent tapped it knowingly . " When you 've read that , my dear sir , you 've read something from everything . " Mike turned the thin leaves gingerly . It looked too complete . He was about to hand it back when this caught his eye : " When first the glorious Lady of my mind was made manifest to mine eyes , even she who was called Beatrice . . . " " How . .. how much ? " stuttered Mike , trying not to tremble . " Ten dollars , " answered the little man slyly . Mike thrust a ten-dollar bill into the bands of the agent , who faded from sight as precipitately as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a name . When he grew calmer he read around it . It seemed that one May day along about 1274 an Italian named Dante Alighieri met a certain Beatrice Portinari at a party in Florence . He worshipped her on the spot and when he got home he began writing a piece which he called " The New Life . " It was marvellous stuff . Just think , in Italy , over six hundred years ago , this Dante had been up against the same thing as he , Mike Tobin , was up against on this Dakota farm right now ! Only Dante had been able to express his feelings . Mike could n't express his , but there would be no harm in allowing this poet to do it for him , and did n't the girls have the same name , that rare , lovely name , which Dante said meant " she who confers blessing " ? And how true they were , these splendid almost unsayable things that Dante seemed so easily to say ! No sooner do I lift mine eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all my pulses beat at once and stop . Mike read this over and over , and each time it wrenched him with wonder . Dante had said it all in about two dozen simple words said it forever . And it clarified things even if it did make Beatrice O'Brien more of a golden blur than ever . She was pinnacles above him , and it was up to him to allow her to stay there . And when Monday evening came , and he saw her once more under the flickering lamplight , a pale wisp in a fragile frock , gently buttering one of Martha Seeley 's flaky biscuits , he thanked God for making a poet who could sing like that . It made things so much easier for the inarticulate fellows who came after him . But one Sunday afternoon in May something happened . Mike was sitting under a cottonwood tree in the yard with Gems from the World 's Best Literature propped up on his knees , dozing over Dante . He was awakened by a tickling sensation across the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playfully threatening him with a handful of long , fringed grasses . " Oh , " he groaned , going flame down into his very boots , " I was asleep , I guess . " " I guess you were , with your nose in a book too . What were you reading ? " and she knelt down beside him to look . He made an attempt to cover the page with his hands , but she took the volume and bent over it . " What drivel , " she scoffed ; " it must be terrible to be as crazy about a girl as Dante was . " " Yes , " admitted Mike in a muffled voice , " it is . " " She had the same name as mine , " elucidated Beatrice , tossing her brown hat from the glory of her hair . " Yes , I know , " stuttered Mike , wishing she were n't so near him . " And I know something , too , " she lisped , pirouetting before him on one foot , " something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike , how funny you are ! " And she sped houseward to the tune of her rippling laughter . Mike stumbled down to the gate where she had left Prince and took him blindly to the barn . Why had she laughed ? Dante was n't funny . It must be his ? a mere hired man 's knowledge of him ? that was funny . Mike , forking hay down to her horse in the barn , afterward tried to reason himself back into his old serenity . Who was he that he should resent her altitude ? And did n't she have the right to lean down if she wanted to and laugh a little ? The following week Beatrice 's school was out . Ephraim Seeley was boister ? ously relieved . He had not liked the teacher 's fool notions . Martha was sorry for she had mothered Bee , as she had learned to call her , and Bee had liked it . Mike , seeing her go , books and baggage , one Saturday morning in June , felt numb . There were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " continued Martha smoothly . " Her experience with that spineless Dudley has taught her to appreciate a real man when she sees one . " " I 'm . . . I 'm not fit for her , " said Mike , going very white under his tan . " Why , I 'd like to know ? " she flared . " There 's the way Belle acted and . . . " " Oh , pshaw ! The way you acted would make any girl proud to know you . It made Bee proud . Remember that day she saw Milicent in the wagon ? She told me about that . She thought you were wonderful . Bee 's always liked you , only you always acted scared to death of her . Now , Mike , " she coaxed , laying her hand maternally on one of Mike 's trembling knees , " just get together a little gumption and ask her . " " I 'll . . . I 'll think it over , " mut ? tered Mike , " and let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down to the barn and threw himself on a pile of hay and tried to think . So Beatrice liked him ? liked him well enough to . . . It could n't , simply could n't be true . Martha was mis ? taken . Her affection for both of them had blinded her . But what if she was n't mistaken ? Mike lay there and allowed this possibility to descend and enfold him like a golden cloud . IIe would be more blessed than Dante . . . . Then another thing assailed him . How could he ever so much as touch her white forehead with his lips ? Her mere physical perfection alone was enough to paralyze his lips and hands . Perhaps it had paralyzed Dudley Watson 's and that was why he had taken refuge in that bank in Chicago . He looked down at his own hands , coarse , brown , fumbling things . Oh , it was impossible . impossible . He would n't dare . . . As the days went on Mike tried to keep his mind off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold was too much for him . One night hesaw her in a dream , standing in the doorway of his yellow house , her arms full of sheaves . The next morning as he came up from the barn he saw Prince champing his bit by the gate , and up on the porch there was a golden head silhouetted against the dark green of the vines . His first impulse was to leap on the back of that dancing horse and gallop westward across the shielding mountains and into the cool oblivion of the sea . " Lady out in front to see ye , " an ? nounced Heppy Yarrow , as he slunk around to the back door with his pails . He stumbled around to the vine-hung porch . They looked at each other , his dazed glance searching hers under the blinding halo of her hair , and her large eyes staring upward from the thin pallor of her face . Then she began to cry . She cried softly through her fingers , on one of which gleamed a topaz like a drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike , helplessly . " Oh . . . " " I 'm . . . I 'm terribly lonely since Papa died , " she whispered and managed a smile . Mike made a little movement toward her and was stopped by the whiteness of her skin as it emerged from the bronze silk of her blouse . She was expecting something , something besides his groaned sympathy . It men ? aced the air between them like a spar ? kling storm . " Have a drink , " he said finally . " The water in the well is very nice . " She shook the tears from the corners of her eyes , and they strolled over to the well behind the willows . He held the dipper while she drank , and the sounds she made as the water bubbled between her lips were so much like kisses that the dipper fell from his hand , spattering them both with gemlike drops . She smoothed her skirt and tilted her face toward his . Mike 's fingers burned and his heart churned . Would he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection of her body ? " Oh , Mike , " she breathed , very close to him now , " why are you so afraid of me when you are so good and I like you so much ? " He took her proffered hands between his , and his lips worshipped hers without touching them . " Oh , " she cried , rosy relief tingeing her white anxious cheeks , " let 's go right over and tell Aunt Martha . We 'll walk and lead Prince . " They were married the next day . " Why wait ? " asked Beatrice trem ? ulously . " Why , indeed ? " echoed Martha , who with Ephraim drove with them to the Methodist parsonage in Crittenden . Mike did n't speak and scarcely breathed through the ceremony . Every ? thing closed down around him like a fragile golden bell which a word of his might shatter . Even the circlet which he slipped on Beatrice 's finger had no substance . The wedding supper , which Martha cooked for them afterward , might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was conscious of but one thing ? the triangu ? lar whiteness of her face under the weary gold of her hair . " Be good to her , Mike , " whispered Martha , as she bade them good-night on the dark steps . " She 's been through so much and she 's so tired. - " Yes , ma'am , " mumbled Mike , " and thank you kindly for everything . " A half hour later Mike turned the key in the yellow door of his house and stepped shyly aside so that Beatrice could enter . He lighted a small lamp and led her past the door behind which Heppy Yarrow was snoring gently and stopped at the door of the spare room . " I . . . I thought , " explained Mike , " that after so much , you 'd rather be alone , " and he put the lamp down on the bureau top between them . A spasm not unlike fear twitched at her mouth and shadowed her eyes . He saw it . " I 'll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anything , " he explained . She smiled wryly , and her hand fluttered for a moment near one of his . He went over to the window and looked out into the warm , starry evening . He had been dreading this awkward mo ? ment , and it was over . Her smile told him she understood ? understood that he worshipped her so much that his hands and lips must learn their way toward hers . He breathed for the first time since that moment yesterday by the well . Then a sharp cry sent him stumbling to her . She lay crumpled on the floor before an open drawer of the bureau , and in her hand was one of the tiny shirts Milicent had worn . Mike strode over and gathered her up , wondering as he did so how a person as ethereal looking as Beatrice could weigh so much . " Oh , oh , " moaned Beatrice as he placed her tenderly on the bed , " I . . . I ca n't bear the sight of those . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know , " soothed Mike , mentally cursing Heppy Yarrow for leaving Milicent 's things in that drawer , " I know . . .1/ " You do n't , you do n't , " she sobbed , wiping her streaming eyes on the clutched shirt as if it were a handker ? chief , " you do n't . . . " " But ? I do . I do , " Mike almost sobbed back , cursing Belle now and all her works . " You do n't , " contradicted Beatrice , relaxing her hold on the shirt and gripping his hand in both of hers . " You do n't because you 're so good , and I ca n't bear it a minute longer without telling you . " And she told him , clinging hard to his hand as if it were the only thing to cling to in the dark waters that had all but closed over her . And then , little by little , her hold on his hand loosened , and her sobs grew fainter as she slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own hand went up and she pillowed her pale cheek on it and morals and manners . " With the long inheritance of English tradition and cul ? ture behind it , why did the old South ( and this is especially true of Virginia ) provide almost every mortal dwelling except a retreat for the imagination of man ? It soon becomes clear that there are more answers than one to this question , and that each answer contains at least a germ of the truth . From the be ? ginning of its history the South had suffered less from a scarcity of literature than from a superabundance of living . Soil , scenery , all the color and animation of the external world , tempted a con ? vivial race to an endless festival of the seasons . If there was little in nature to inspire terror , there was still less in human lot to awaken pity in the hearts of oak . Life , for the ruling class at least , was genial , urbane , and amusing ; but it was deficient in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural pomposity of man . Even slavery , a depressing spectacle at best , was a slight impedi ? ment to the faith that had been trained to enjoy the fruits rather than to examine the character of peculiar institutions . Though in certain periods there was disseminated a piquant flavor of skew ticism , it was a flavor that lingered pleasantly on the tongue instead of lubricating the mind . Over the greater part of the old South ( and this applies forcibly to Virginia , where the plantation group was firmly united ) a top-heavy patriarchal system was adjusting itself with difficulty to unusual conditions . While this industrial process required men of active intelligence , it offered little hospitality to the brooding spirit of letters . It is true that in the latter years of the eighteenth century much able writing in politics began to appear . Jefferson , who touched with charm and usually with wisdom upon almost every subject that has engaged the mind of man , created not only the political thought but the greater part of the Southern literature of his period . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Civil War , political sagacity withered beneath a thick increment of prejudice . Philoso ? phy , like heresy , was either suspected or prohibited . Even those Southerners ( and there were many of these in Vir ? ginia ) who regarded slavery as an anach ? ronism rather than an iniquity , and looked ahead reluctantly to a doomed social order , lacked either the courage or the genius that rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm . Before approach ? ing disaster pleasure became not merely a diversion but a way of escape . In the midst of a changing world all immaterial aspects were condensed for the Southern planter into an incomparable heartiness and relish of life . For what distinguished the Southerner , and particularly the Virginian , from his severer neighbors to the north , was his ineradicable belief that pleasure is worth more than toil , that it is worth more even than profit . Though the difference between the Virginian and the far Southerner was greater than the dis ? tance between Virginia and Massachu ? setts , a congenial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confederacy of the spirit . Yet in this agreeable social order , so benevolent to the pleasure-seeker and so hostile alike to the thinker and the artist , what encouragement , what opportunity , awaited the serious writer ? What free ? dom was there for the literature either of protest or of escape ? Here , as else ? where , expression belonged to the articu ? late , and the articulate was supremely satisfied with his own fortunate lot as well as with the less enviable lots of others . Only the slave , the " poor white , " or the woman who had forgotten her modesty may have felt inclined to protest ; and these negligible minorities were as dumb and sterile as the profes ? sion of letters . And even if they had protested who would have listened ? Even if they had escaped , either in fiction or in fact , where could they have gone ? Complacency , self-satisfac tion , a blind contentment with things as they are and a deaf aversion from things as they might be : all these cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and the truth of life , had settled like a cloud of honey bees over the creative faculties of the race . For the airy inquisitiveness that frolicked so gracefully over the surface of thought questioned the Everlasting Purpose as seldom as it invaded the barren field of prose fiction . Religion , which made so much trouble in New England , had softened in a milder climate to a health ? ful moral exercise and a comfortable sense of divine favor . A sublime cer ? tainty that he was the image of his Maker imparted dignity to the Southern gentleman while it confirmed his faith in the wisdom of his Creator . Al ? though the venom of intolerance had been extracted but imperfectly , the Protestant Episcopal Church was chari ? table toward almost every weakness except the dangerous practice of think ? ing . Moreover , the civilization of the old South was one in which every mem ? ber , white or black , respected the un ? written obligation to be amusing when it was possible and agreeable in any circumstances . Generous manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon morals ; but generous manners exacted that the artist should be more gregarious than sedentary . It is true that " Poe passed his early life in Virginia . " Nevertheless , Mr. Cooke reminds us sadly that " this great and somber genius was rather a cosmopolite than a citizen of any particular State . " After the Civil War , pursued by the dark furies of Reconstruction , the mind of the South was afflicted with a bitter nostalgia . From this homesickness for the past there flowered , as luxuriantly as fireweed in burned places , a mournful literature of commemoration . A pros ? perous and pleasure-Ioving race had been thrust back suddenly into the primitive struggle for life ; and physical resistance had settled slowly into mental repression . Already those desperate po ? litical remedies which , according to the philosopher , begin in fear and end in folly , were welding the Southern States into a defense and a danger . Out of po ? litical expediency there emerged a moral superstition . What had begun as an emergency measure had matured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas the romantic memories of the South ripened and mel ? lowed and at last began to decay . That benevolent hardness of heart so neces ? sary to the creative artist dissolved ? if it had ever existed ? into the simple faith which makes novels even less successfully than it moves mountains . To defend the lost became the solitary purpose and the supreme obligation of the Southern novelist , while a living tradition decayed with the passage of years into a sentimen ? tal infirmity . Graceful , delicate , and tenderly reminiscent , the novels of this period possess that unusual merit , the virtue of quality . Yet charming as they are in manner , they lack creative passion and the courage to offend which is the essential note of great fiction . The emotions with which they deal are formal , trite , deficient in blood and irony , and as untrue to experience as they are true to an attitude of evasive idealism . In the end this writing failed to survive be ? cause , though faithful to a moment in history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this serious defect , the first sustained literary movement in the South can not be dismissed as undeserv ? ing of criticism . Had it been addressed to a race as self-sufficing both in litera ? ture and in the sphere of abstract ideas as the people of New England , much that is charming , if not vital , might have endured . But the new South , like the old , is self-sufficing only in the twi ? light region of sentiment . Always it has remained invulnerable alike to the written word and to the abstract idea . Though it gave its life for a cause , it was wanting in the subjective vision which remolds a tragic destiny in the serene temper of art . Not the word that stands , but the conversation that ripples has been always the favorite art of the Southerner . Never has his preference varied from the vocal sound to the printed letter . Content to bor ? row both his literature and his opinion of literature , be has clung through all his courageous history to the tender sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cherishing its own after the provident habit of New England , the South has hesitated to approach Southern writers until they also could be safely borrowed from that alien world in which all ac ? credited Southern reputations are won . With diminishing fortunes , books be ? came the first prohibited luxury ; with increasing wealth , they have remained the last acknowledged necessity " I am not really extravagant , " remarked a Southern lady , with a virtuous air , " I never buy books . " Yet , in spite of this natural impedi ? ment to literature , the South in the nineteenth century was able to produce the incomparable folk-lore of Uncle Remus ; and nothing better or truer than Uncle Remus has appeared in the whole field of American prose fiction . It is not without significance , perhaps , that when ? ever the Southern writer escaped from beneath the paw of the stuffed lion into the consciousness of a different race or class , he lost both his cloying sentiment and his pose of moral superiority . Some literary magic worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been born , by the grace of God , a South ? ern gentleman . The early dialect stories of Thomas Nelson Page are still firm and round and as fragrant as dried rose-leaves ; the humorous mountain folk of Charles Egbert Craddock are perennially fresh and delightful ; the simpler persons , portrayed without august idealism , of James Lane Allen , are vital and in ? teresting ; the youthful romantic tales of AmClie Rives have exuberant vitality . A little later , in the historical pageant of American fiction , Mary Johnston ap ? peared to wear her fancy dress with a difference . She also had grace , charm , quality , and the delicate touch upon manner as distinguished from manners . Moreover , as her books soon proved , Miss Johnston is endowed with the courage of her philosophy and the mystic rather than the romantic vision . Like Mar ? garet Prescott Montague , another sin ? cere artist , she has steadfastly refused to compromise with reality . Long and steep is the journey from John Esten Cooke in his happy valley to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way has been won by a struggle ; every struggle has widened , however imperceptibly , the boundaries of American fiction . To those of us who are and have been always in accord with the artistic im ? pulse we are pleased to call Modernism it is a relief to find that the horizon even of the American novel is fluid , not fixed , and that there is a way of escape from the artificial limitations of material and method . It is fortunate for Mr. Cabell that he came not too far ahead of his time . It is fortunate that he is allied in his maturity with the general revolt against the novel of sterile posture and sentimental evasion . This fresh literary impulse in the South ? which is merely a single curve in the broad modern movement toward freedom in art ? has broken not only with its own formal tradition but with the well-established American twin conventions of prudery and platitude . For Mr. Cabellspinning his perfect rhythms from iridescent illu ? sions , is still in harmony with the natural patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not of it , his genius is rooted deep below the concrete pavements of Richmond in the dark and fertile soil of Virginia 's history . A long tradition and a thick deposit of human hopes and fears have flowered again in the serene and mellow disenchant ? ment of his philosophy . Even the austere perfection of his art , with its allegorical remoteness and that strangely hollow ring which echoes the natural human tones of pity and passion , could have sprung only from a past that has softened and receded into the eternal outline of legend . Certainly it is an art which belongs by inheritance to the South , though it appears to contain no element that we may narrowly define as Southern except , perhaps , the roman ? tic richness of its texture and the gaiety and gallantry of its pessimism . But its roots are firmly embedded , though they may draw nourishment from nothing more substantial than fable . For even with a novelist of philosophy rather than of life there must be a fourth dimension in every fiction that attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stillness of vision as well as an upward springing into the animation of the external world . And because this is true of every Southern novelist , and especially of those Southern novelists who are still to come , it is well to remind ourselves that , if the art of the South is to be independent , not derivative , if it is to be adequate , com ? pact , original , it must absorb heat and light from the central radiance of its own nature . The old South , genial , objective , and a little ridiculous ? as the fashions of the past are always a little ridiculous to the present ? has vanished from the world of fact to reappear in the permanent realm of fable . This much we have already conceded . What we are in danger of forgetting is that few possessions are more precious than a fable that can no longer be compared with a fact . The race that inherits a heroic legend must have accumulated an inexhaustible resource of joy , beauty , love , laughter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pur 0 suit of a standard utilitarian style is , for the Southern novelist , pure folly . Never should it be overlooked that the artist in the South will attain his full stature , not by conforming to the accepted American pattern , but by preserving his individual distinction . Sincerely as he may admire the flat and vig orous novel of the Middle West , he can never hope to subdue his hand to the monotonous soil of the prairies . That impressive literary movement has as little kinship with the Southern scene as with the stark poetic outlines which express so perfectly the frozen land ? scapes of New England . But in the vivid profusion of Mr. Cabell 's art we find a genuine revelation of the beatity which , however neglected and debased , is indigenous to the mind and heart of the South . It is easy to remind ourselves that this artistic inheritance was lost upon a race that has persistently confused emotions with ideas and mistaken tradition for truth . , It is easy to re ? mind ourselves that a logical point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in philosophy . But , like most other reminders , these are not only offensive but futile . After all , what the South has known and remembered was a lavish , vital , and distinctive society which , for want of a better phrase , we may consent to call an archaic civilization . Imper ? fect , it is true . For as long as the human race remains virtually , and perhaps es ? sentially , barbarian , all the social orders invented by man will be merely the mirrors of his favorite imperfections . Nevertheless , there are arts , and the novel is one of them , which appear to thrive more vigorously upon human imperfection than upon machine-made excellence . Commercial activity and industrial development have their uses , no doubt , in any well-established society ; but genius has been in even the most civilized periods a vagabond . And , with or without genius , the novel is more vital and certainly more interesting when it declines to become the servant either of sentimental tradition or pa ? triotic materialism . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we may call , without too much enthusiasm , an
