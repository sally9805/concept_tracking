When workers in the silk mills of Paterson , N. J. , were on strike in 1924 , some of them met in a local hall to rehash their grievances . The police forbade them to hold another such meeting . Roger N. Baldwin , an angular idealist from New York , whose mission in life as a director of the American Civil Liberties Union includes attending and abetting important strikes , was in Paterson at the time . When he heard of the police order , he marshalled some young women , gave them a U. S. flag to carry and with several others started marching to Paterson 's City Hall . <P> In the City Hall Plaza were hundreds of idlers . Baldwin 's marchers halted and one began a speech . " Fellow workers- , " he said , and a policeman arrested him . Baldwin and others protested . They too were arrested . <P> " Unlawfully , routously , riotously and tumultuously " were the adverbs used in the indictment brought against Baldwin &; friends for their assembly . " The defendants ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatenings <P> . . etc. etc . " Baldwin was sentenced to six months in jail . The rest were fined . The Supreme Court of New Jersey upheld the verdicts . <P> But above the Supreme Court in New Jersey is a Court of Errors and Appeals . This court , reviewing the evidence , noted that only two of the 40 policemen at the scene had feared a riot ; that the only hint of trouble " which would be entertained by a person of a firm and courageous mind " was when some of Baldwin 's marchers had , perhaps accidentally , brushed against policemen in passing . " Judgment reversed , " said the high court last week , unanimously .
