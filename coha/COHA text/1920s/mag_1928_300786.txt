Following the retirement of James Joseph Tunney , champion with a mind of his own , from the prize ring with $2,000,000 in his wise old sock , three schools of thought developed : <P> 1 ) He quit because he wanted liberty-liberty to eat pie , all kinds of pie . This school founded its major premise on Tunney 's shout in the office of a Wall Street broker , as he did a merry dance : " I am free , free . Yes , free to eat lemon meringue pie-or anything else for that matter . " <P> 2 ) He quit because he was afraid of going stark , staring mad . This school had faith in the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune . These potent papers quoted Tunney as he expanded on an incident which occurred while he was training for his second fight with Jack Dempsey : <P> " I went into a clinch with my head down , something I never do . I plunged forward , and my partner 's head came up and butted me over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> ' ' Then this fool stepped back and swung his right against my jaw with every bit of his power . It landed flush , and stiffened me where I stood . Nobody saw the punch but Eddie Eagan who was standing there . And that was the last thing I remembered for two days . <P> " They tell me that I finished out the round , knocking the man out . I punched him so hard he rolled under the ropes . Then I boxed two rounds with Eddie Eagan . But I do n't remember it . I walked around dazed and almost in the dark . <P> " I did n't know where I was . I did n't know my own name . When I looked out of the window at the landscape it looked dark and unfamiliar . Nobody will ever know how I struggled with myself to remember things . It took me 48 hours before I could win back enough reason to know I was Gene . <P> " Strangely , the subconscious took the place of the conscious . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember to minute details things that happened then , things I had said and places where I had been . But the present was gone . . . . <P> " From that incident was born my desire to quit the ring-forever , the first opportunity that presented itself . I wanted to defend my title . I wanted to make enough money , but most of all I wanted to leave the game that had threatened my sanity before I met with an accident in a real fight with six-ounce gloves that would permanently hurt my brain . <P> " And here is the strangest thing . Do you know what finally cleared up my head ? Those seven socks to the chin Dempsey hit me in the seventh round in Chicago . From that time on I never had that tight feeling in the head or that haziness before the eyes . <P> " But I had learned my lesson . I feel that my mind is clear and free and as keen as it ever was . I want it to stay that way . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the future . <P> " The same thing drove Dempsey out . Dempsey is a rich man now , but he knows that if he ever fought me again his money would n't be worth a nickel . <P> " The beating he would have to take around the head and eyes would impair him for life . I think I was lucky to have had the accident that warned me in time . And that is why you will never see me back in the ring again . "
