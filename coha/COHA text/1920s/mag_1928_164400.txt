" The biggest pair of shoes that ever walked out of Mississippi " belonged , according to Senator Pat Harrison of that State , to John Sharp Williams , onetime ( 1911-23 ) U. S. Senator , who now dozes in gardenia-scented retirement on his plantation near Yazoo City , Miss . To fill the Williams shoes , Mississippi sent to Washington Hubert Durett Stephens , a man who was considered brilliant as a youth because he started practicing law at the tender age of 20 , but who has yet to distinguish himself either as a shoe-filler or as a Senator . <P> Last week , almost in spite of himself , Senator Stephens found himself in the public eye . He did not get up in the Senate , where his voice is seldom heard , but in the press , to which he released a correspondence he had been having with Secretary of Commerce Hoover . <P> Secretary Hoover had ordered the U. S. Census Bureau to discontinue its custom of segregating Negro clerks from white clerks . Senator Stephens called this an " unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . " He said it was a grave injustice to both races and that certain white men and women would have a Negro for their superior officer . <P> " Foolish untruths , " replied Secretary Hoover , " I have received no complaint from either group . " <P> Senator Stephens replied : " A good position has often been lost for a smaller offense than protesting the action of a superior . " He reported an instance he had heard about Negroes who had been assigned to desks among white men and women . The Negroes , he said , were " all grins , and congratulated . . . on the recognition that had been given them . " He further charged that white and Negro women were obliged to use the same washroom . Senator Stephens said his protest was " in the interest of decency and the welfare of Government . Whenever there has been a step toward social equality between the races , dire results have followed . " <P> The matter might never have come to public notice and the Stephens-Hoover exchange might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephens whose faith and skill in oratory are great . <P> Senator Coleman Blease of South Carolina , who " loves all the citizens of America , " made a speech quoting an anonymous woman in the Census Bureau as having written : " We call these colored Census Bureau employes ' Hoover Chocolates ' and all wish we could make him eat them . " <P> And Senator James Thomas ( " Tom-Tom " ) Heflin , who mortally hates and fears the Roman Pope , made a speech , saying : <P> " Such a thing is a shocking outrage upon these fine American girls , and a shame on any Administration . . . . <P> " Senators , Mr. Hoover can not play with this question in this fashion . . . . And you have no business , Mr. Hoover , to undertake to interfere with the handiwork of the Almighty . . . . <P> " Just as the eagle is the King of all fowls , just as the lion is the King of all beasts , and just as the whale is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white race is the crowning glory of the four races of black , yellow , red and white ! . . . " <P> But the Census Bureau 's Negroes remained unsegregated , except of their own volition . Southerners continued to be vexed .
