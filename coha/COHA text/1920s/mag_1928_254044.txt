In 1925 , the triennial general convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church resolved to delete , from the Protestant Episcopal prayer manual , that section known as " the Thirty-nine articles , " which among other things , defines some of the differences between Protestant and Roman Catholic creeds and practices . This resolution , to be effected , must be ratified at the next general convention , to be held at Washington , in October . Last week 105 more or less consequential lay members of the Protestant Episcopal Church from 45 of the 72 U. S. dioceses , signed a memorial to the House of Bishops petitioning that the Thirty-nine articles be retained in the Prayer Book . The signers of the memorial omitted to specify certain Romish practices which they regarded with much disfavor ; but they made reference to " an organized movement wishing the Protestant Episcopal Church to adopt some of the doctrines and forms of worship now observed in the Roman Catholic Church . . . .
