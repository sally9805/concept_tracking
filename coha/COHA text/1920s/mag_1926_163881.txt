The attraction of the sins of Manhattan for ministers of the Gospel from the hinterland is periodically demonstrated , and never more clearly than last week when the Chairman of the Sabbath Crusade Committee of the Tennessee Synod of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , opened his mouth in the Bible House , Manhattan : <P> " Churchmen who condone Sabbath-breaking are as wicked in God 's sight as bootleggers , robbers , bank breakers , adulterers , drunkards and liars ' whom they condemn . . . . <P> " Anybody who buys a Sunday newspaper is helping the devil to ruin America . <P> " God 's word is my authority . <P> " Every one of our 20,000,000 Sunday papers is Satan 's ambassador and a decoy to ruin America . <P> " Every one of our 2,500 Sunday trains is hurrying America toward the Hell of God 's wrath . Every Sunday train is hurrying somebody to ruin , some soul to Hell . . . . <P> " All the virtues , freedom and wealth of New York and America will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American editor to show an error in my statement . " <P> With Methodist money the Sabbath Chairman telegraphed every railroad president , asking cooperation . One replied . Frederick D. Atterbury President of the Erie , said he would be delighted to abolish Sunday trains ; they lose money . <P> Down in Doyers St. , Manhattan , the miserables of the island , unostentatiously mouch along . Drunks muse on the likelihood of panhandling the price of a finger or two of " likker " ( anything with alcoholic content ) . Drug addicts deviously ponder methods of getting another " shot of morph " ( hypodermic injection of morphine ) , or a " sniff of snow " ( nasal inhalation of crystalline cocaine ) . Homeless and friendless they are for the most part , and normally mindful of their own fuzzy , vague affairs . <P> To such , in a paid newspaper advertisement as blatant as any circus poster , last week spoke one Thomas J. Noonan , superintendent of the Rescue Society , holding a nightly mission in the Old Chinese Theatre on Doyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic , extraordinary , " ballyhooed the ad with circus alliteration . " Drunkards , drug addicts , the homeless and friendless especially invited . " <P> Nearly as noisy yet more circus-like was the " Parade of Warning , " advertised similarly by " The Famous Welsh Evangelists , Clark and Bell . " The " parade " was to start from the Gospel Tabernacle at 44th St. and 8th Ave. , and in circus similitude proceed therefrom " to 34th St. ; thence to 59th St. via 7th Ave . and Broadway , returning to 44th St. by 8th Ave . Bring your autos or come on foot . "
