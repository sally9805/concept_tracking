At mid-September the farmer pauses an instant in his harvest race against crop-withering frosts , to consider his year . Spring broke tardily everywhere in the U. S. Summer was generally satisfactory , in spite of brief searings of drouth in the central plains and musty weather in the south . At present boll weevils and hopper fleas are damaging the cotton crop to a small extent . In the northwest and in Canada rains worry the prairie farmers , as he prepares to harvest his grains . Elsewhere crop conditions are satisfactory . <P> Specifically , the U. S. corn crop this year will be slightly less than last , oats less , potatoes more , hay less , wheat considerably more . The wheat crop will exceed 840,000,000 bu. , whereas last season it was 669,365,000 bu . <P> <P> The biggest farm in the world , run analogously to Henry Ford 's factory , is the wheat farm of Thomas D. Campbell out in the dryland region of southern Montana . <P> When the U. S. entered the World War , the late Franklin K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by keen-eyed Mr. Campbell , who had a proposition . His idea was that untold quantities of wheat could be grown upon Indian reservation lands lying idle . <P> Mr. Lane , impressed , gave him contracts whereby on each 10,000 acre unit he was to turn over one-tenth of the crop to the Indians without cost . Manhattan bankers backed able Mr. Campbell financially , eventually turned the whole proposition over to him . Today his idea is embodied in the Campbell Farming Corporation , covering some 95,000 acres . This year he cultivated 38,000 acres of wheat , yielding some 500,000 bushels ; cultivated 7,000 acres of flax . <P> And now on this vast farming factory fleets of 75 horsepower tractors plow 1,000 or harvest 2,000 acres a day . Mechanical engineers control the machine systems , and report cards on the mileage covered by each tractor are daily handed to managers , who base pay bonuses upon mileage covered . New and improved methods of disking , plowing , seeding , harvesting , threshing have taken this farm far away from story book sentimentality and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to mass production methods .
