Poet Rudyard Kipling insulted Queen Victoria with a Barrack Room Ballad . It hailed , " the Widow at Windsor , " rollicked that she sent her soldiers to " barbarious wars , " bellowed that she had bought " ' alf ' o Creation " with English blood . <P> Of course hard-boiled men in barracks do rollick and bellow , especially at the Sovereign and the Empire they love . But Victoria , no Hard-Boiled Queen , missed the too-blunt point and was irrevocably insulted . <P> Therefore a news furore stirred , last week , when Queen Insulter Kipling went up to the royal Scottish estate at Balmoral , and there settled down as the house guest of George V. <P> An ignorant world press blared that at last King-Emperor George V had forgiven the poet who insulted a widow by calling her " widow ! " <P> Actually the reconciliation took place some years ago . Poet Kipling 's cousin , Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , presented him at a Royal Levee in 1925 . By pure accident , George V was ill on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by Edward of Wales ( officially representing His Majesty ) . The function was , in every social particular , the exact equivalent of a reception by the King-Emperor . Thus the story that Rudyard Kipling was not " forgiven " until last week is tosh . <P> Public libraries throughout the English speaking world were hard pressed to supply insult-snoopers with the poem .
