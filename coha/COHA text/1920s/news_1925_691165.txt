" " Absolute Rot , " lie Says . This quotation , Admiral Shoemaker branded as " absolute rot , " as he was tot accustomed to using such language to a subordinate officer and another alleged conversation between hint and Col. Schauffler he attributed to the latter 's imagination or a dream . " If anybody thinks he can nix a ort of Gen. John J. Pershing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignortot of the man and his history . Gen. p .. rshing is entirely capable of handling his own statements . The fact is that the statement did not entirely state the case . It was written from an aviation standpoint . The people who wrote it did not know naval matters and , as written , it might have had the effect of erroneously influencing public opinion . " Admiral Shoemaker went on to say he had not chdnged the statement as to fact , but merely had added two Paragraphs , showing that the " water tight integrity of these ships had been destroyed by the removal of doors and piping , " and that the tests could not be considered conclusive of the effect of bombs on modern ships equipped for defense against such attacks both above and below the water .

" The witness later admitted that " any bomb dropped on the deck of a ship with the backing of the one that exploded on the Virginia foremast probably would put her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ire stated that the bomb likely to do the most damage , however , would be one dropped alongside the ship . This , he agreed , made the ship a still larger target for aviators to shoot at . Ile said any modern battleship could be sunk from the air " if you hit her often enough , " but expressed the opinion four hits would be necessary to sink a modern ship . As to the relative cost of defense by the air and sea , he pointed out that the life of a plane is only three years , while the life of a battleship is twenty . He said it would take two airplane carrers to sink a battleship and that in addition to the cost of the carrier there must be reckoned the cost of the planes at $47.000 each .
