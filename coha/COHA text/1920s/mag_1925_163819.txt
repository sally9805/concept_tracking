To the ears of a stolid Scandinavian peasant came cries of anguish . Rushing through the woods toward the sound , he discovered a powerful bearded forester in the act of drubbing in the back with clenched fists , the popular Prince Carl of Sweden . Bewildered , the peasant recognized the two tall figures who stood laughing beside the screaming Prince as their Majesties Gustav V , King of Sweden , and Christian X , King of Denmark . <P> For ten minutes the screams , the laughter , and the peasant 's bewild- erment continued . Then the forester desisted . Prince Carl , ceasing to howl , admitted that his lumbago had apparently vanished under this violent form of treatment advocated by King Christian . <P> The royal hunt continued . In good health , Carl shot two elk ; laughed last at Christian , who bagged none .
