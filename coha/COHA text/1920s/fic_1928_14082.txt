The exterior of a " walk-up " apartment house in a mean quarter of New York . It is of ugly brownstone and was built in the nineties . Between the pavement of large gray flagstones and the front of the house is a deep and narrow areaway , guarded by a rusted , ornamental iron railing . At the right , a steep flight of rotting wooden steps leads down to the cellar and to the janitor 's apartment , the windows of which are just visible above the street level . Spanning the areaway is a " stoop " of four shallow stone steps flanked on either side by a curved stone balustrade . Beyond the broad fourth step another step leads to the double wooden outer doors of the house ; and as these are open , the vestibule and the wide , heavy glass-paneled entrance door beyond are visible . Above the outer doors is a glass fanlight upon which appears the half-obliterated house number . At the left side of the doorway is a sign which reads : " Flat To Let . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stoop are the two narrow windows of the ground-floor apartments . In one of the windows , at the left , is a sign bearing the legend : " Prof. Filippo Fiorentino . Music for all occasions . Also instruction . " Above are the six narrow windows of the first-floor apartments , and above that the stone sills of the second-floor windows can just be seen . To the left of the house , part of the adjoining building is visible : the motor entrance to a storage warehouse . Crude boarding across the large driveway and rough planks across the sidewalk and curb indicate that an excavation is in progress . On the boarding is painted in rude lettering : " Keep Out " ; and at the curb is a small barrel bearing a sign with the words : " Street Closed . " To the wall of the warehouse is affixed a brass plate bearing the name : " Patrick Mulcahy Storage Warehouse Co . Inc . " To the right of the house , scaffolding and a wooden side-walk indicate that the house next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large wooden sign reading : " Manhattan House-Wrecking Corp . " In the close foreground , below the level of the curb , is a mere suggestion of the street . At rise of curtain the house is seen in the white glare of an arc-light , which is just offstage to the right . The windows in the janitor 's apartment are lighted , as are also those of the ground-floor apartment at the right and the two windows at the extreme left of the first floor . A dim red light is affixed to the boarding of the excavation at the left . In the lighted ground-floor window , at the right of the doorway , ABRAHAM KAPLAN is seated in a rocking chair , reading a Yiddish newspaper . He is a Russian Jew , well past sixty : clean-shaven , thick gray hair , hooked nose , horn-rimmed spectacles . To the left of the doorway , GRETA FIORENTINO is leaning out of the window . She is forty , a blonde , ruddy-faced , stout German . She wears a wrapper of light , flowered material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ample , uncorseted bosom . In her right hand is a folding paper fan , which she waves languidly . Throughout the act , and , indeed , throughout the play , there is constant noise . The noises of the city rise , fall , intermingle : the distant roar of El trains , automobile sirens , and the whistles of boats on the river ; the rattle of trucks and the indeterminate clanking of metals ; fire engines , ambulances , musical instruments , a radio , dogs barking , and human voices calling , quarreling , and screaming with laughter . The noises are subdued and in the background , but they never wholly cease . A moment after the rise of the curtain an elderly man enters at the right and walks into the house , exchanging a nod with MRS . FIORENTINO . A man , munching peanuts , crosses the stage from left to right . A VOICE offstage.Char-lie ! EMMA JONES appears at the left . She is middle-aged , tall , and rather bony . She carries a small parcel . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , Mrs. Jones . EMMA JONES stopping beneath MRS . FIORENTINO 'S window.Good evenin ' , Mrs. F. Well , I hope it 's hot enough for you . GRETA FIORENTINO Ai n't it joost awful ? When I was through with the dishes , you could take my clothes and joost wring them out . EMMA JONES Me too . I ai n't got a dry stitch on me . GRETA FIORENTINO I took off my shoes and my corset and made myself nice and comfortable , and tonight before I go to bed , I take a nice bath . EMMA JONES The trouble with a bath is , by the time you 're all through , you 're as hot as when you started . As OLGA OLSEN , a thin , anemic Scandinavian with untidy fair hair , comes up the cellar steps and onto the sidewalk . Good evenin ' , Mrs. Olsen . Awful hot , ai n't it ? OLGA OLSEN coming over to the front of the stoop.Yust awful . Mrs. Forentiner , my hoosban ' say vill you put de garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ! I did n't hear him vistle . As MRS . JONES starts to cross to the stoop . Do n't go ' vay , Mrs. Jones . She disappears from the window. p. 4 OLGA OLSEN pushing back some wisps of hair. I tank is more cooler in de cellar . EMMA JONES sitting on the stoop and fanning herself with her parcel.Phew ! I 'm just about ready to pass out . OLGA OLSEN My baby is crying , crying , all day .

EMMA JONES Do n't tell me ! If you was to know what I went t'roo with my Vincent . Half the time he used to have convulsions . WILLIE MAURRANT , a disorderly boy of twelve , appears at the left on roller skates . He stops at the left of the stoop and takes hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and bawling.Hey , Ma ! EMMA JONES disapprovingly.If you want your mother , why do n't you go upstairs , instead o ' yellin ' like that ? WILLIE MAURRANT without paying the slightest attention to her , bawls louder.Hey , Ma ! p. 5 ANNA MAURRANT appearing at one of the lighted first-floor windows.What do you want , Willie ? She is a fair woman of forty , who looks her age , but is by no means unattractive . WILLIE MAURRANT Gim me a dime , will ya ? I wan na git a cone . ANNA MAURRANT to MRS . OLSEN and MRS .

FIORENTINO reappears and leans out of the window again . p. 6 ANNA MAURRANT Catch it ! She throws out a twist of newspaper . WILLIE scrambles for it , hastily extracts the dime , drops the newspaper on the pavement , and skates off at the left . GRETA FIORENTINO twisting her neck upward.Good evening , Mrs. Maurrant . ANNA MAURRANT Good evening , Mrs. Fiorentino . Calling after WILLIE . And do n't come home too late , Willie ! But WILLIE is already out of earshot . GRETA FIORENTINO Why do n't you come down and be sociable ? ANNA MAURRANT I 'm keeping some supper warm for my husband . A slight pause . Well , maybe I will for just a minute . She leaves the window . The lights in her apartment go out . GRETA FIORENTINO She has her troubles with dot Willie . EMMA JONES I guess it do n't bother her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things . OLGA OLSEN looking about cautiously and coming over to the left of the stoop between the two women.He vas comin ' again today to see her . p. 7 EMMA JONES rising excitedly , and leaning over the balustrade.Who  --  Sankey ? OLGA OLSEN nodding. Yes . GRETA FIORENTINO Are you sure , Mrs. Olsen ? OLGA OLSEN I seen him . I vas doostin ' de halls . GRETA FIORENTINO Dot 's terrible ! EMMA JONES Would n't you think a woman her age , with a grown-up daughter  --   --  ! OLGA OLSEN Two times already dis veek I see him here . EMMA JONES I seen him meself one day last week . He was comin ' out o ' the house , jest as I was comin ' in wit ' de dog . " Good mornin ' , Mrs. Jones , " he says to me , as if butter would n't melt in his mouth . " Good mornin ' , " says I , lookin ' him straight in the eye  --   --  Breaking off suddenly as the vestibule door opens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURRANT comes out of the house and stops for a moment on the top step . ANNA MAURRANT Goodness , ai n't it hot ! I think it 's really cooler upstairs . She comes down the steps to the sidewalk . EMMA JONES Yeah , jes ' what I was sayin ' meself . I feel like a wet dishrag. p. 8 ANNA MAURRANT I would have liked to go to the Park concert tonight if Rose had got home in time . I do n't get much chance to go to concerts . My husband do n't care for music . But Rose is more like me  --  just crazy about it . EMMA JONES Ai n't she home yet ? ANNA MAURRANT No . I think maybe she had to work over-time .

She goes down the cellar steps. p. 9 EMMA JONES What them foreigners do n't know about bringin ' up babies would fill a book . GRETA FIORENTINO a little huffily.Foreigners know joost as much as other people , Mrs. Jones . My mother had eight children and she brought up seven . EMMA JONES tactfully.Well , I 'm not sayin ' anythin ' about the Joimans . The Joimans is different  --  more like the Irish . What I 'm talkin ' about is all them squareheads an ' Polacks  --  with a glance in KAPLAN 'S direction  --  an ' Jews . DANIEL BUCHANAN from a third-story window.Good evening , ladies . THE WOMEN in unison , looking upward.Oh , good evening , Mr. Buchanan . DANIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMMA JONES I 'll say ! DANIEL BUCHANAN I was just saying to my wife , it 's not the heat I mind as much as it is the humidity . EMMA JONES Yeah , that 's it ! Makes everything stick to you . ANNA MAURRANT How 's your wife feeling in this weather ? p. 10 DANIEL BUCHANAN She do n't compain about the weather . But she 's afraid to go out of the house . Thinks maybe she could n't get back in time , in case  --  you know . EMMA JONES to the other women.I was the same way with my Vincent  --  afraid to take a step . But with Mae , I was up an ' out till the very last minute . GRETA FIORENTINO craning her neck upward.Mr . Buchanan , do you think she would eat some nice minestrone  --  good Italian vegetable soup ? DANIEL BUCHANAN Why , much obliged , Mrs. F. , but I really ca n't get her to eat a thing .

GRETA FIORENTINO with a sigh.Well , that 's the way it goes . The little skinny ones have them and the big strong ones don't. p. 11 ANNA MAURRANT Do n't take it that way , Mrs. Fiorentino . You 're a young woman yet . GRETA FIORENTINO shaking her head.Oh , well ! EMMA JONES My aunt , Mrs. Barclay , was forty-two  --   --  Breaking off . Oh , good evenin ' , Mr. Maurrant ! FRANK MAURRANT appears at the left with his coat on his arm . He is a tall , powerfully built man of forty-five , with a rugged , grim face . GRETA FIORENTINO Good evening , Mr. Maurrant . FRANK MAURRANT Evenin . He goes to the stoop and seats him-self , mopping his face . Some baby of a day ! ANNA MAURRANT Have you been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 've been workin ' .

There 's some people that just naturally do , and then there 's others that do n't . FRANK MAURRANT to Mrs. Maurrant.Is anybody upstairs ? ANNA MAURRANT No . Willie 's off playing with the boys . I ca n't keep him home . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's working overtime . FRANK MAURRANT I never heard o ' nobody workin ' nights in a real-estate office . ANNA MAURRANT I thought maybe on account of the office being closed tomorrow  --   --  To the others . Mr. Jacobson , the head of the firm , died Tuesday , and tomorrow 's the funeral , so I thought maybe  --   --  EMMA JONES Yeah . Leave it to the Jews not to lose a workin ' day without makin ' up for it . FRANK MAURRANT to MRS . MAURRANT.She should n't be stayin ' out nights without us knowin ' where she is. p. 13 ANNA MAURRANT She did n't say a word about not coming home . FRANK MAURRANT That 's what I 'm savin ' , ai n't it ? It 's a mother 's place to know what her daughter 's doin ' . GRETA FIORENTINO soothingly.Things are different nowa-days , Mr. Maurrant , from what they used to be . FRANK MAURRANT Not in my family , they 're not goin ' to be no different . Not so long as I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover ! Red Rover ! Let Freddie come over ! GEORGE JONES , a short , rather plump , red-faced man , cigar in mouth , comes out of the house as MAURRANT enters the vestibule . GEORGE JONES Hello , Mr. Maurrant . FRANK MAURRANT curtly.Evenin . He enters the house . JONES looks after him in surprise for a moment . MRS . MAURRANT seats herself on the stoop . GEORGE JONES Good evenin ' , ladies . MRS . FIORENTINO AND MRS . MAURRANT Good evening , Mr. Jones . GEORGE JONES seating himself on the left balustrade.What 's the matter with your hubby , Mrs. Maurrant ? Guess he 's feelin ' the heat , huh ? p. 14 ANNA MAURRANT He 's been working till just now and I guess he 's a little tired . EMMA JONES Men are all alike . They 're all easy to get along with , so long as everythin 's goin ' the way they want it to . But once it do n't  --  good night ! GRETA FIORENTINO Yes , dot 's true , Mrs. Jones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ANNA MAURRANT I guess it 's just the same with the women . I often think it 's a shame that people do n't get along better together . People ought to be able to live together in peace and quiet , without making each other miserable . EMMA JONES The way I look at it , you get married for better or worse , an ' if it turns out to be worse , why , all you can do is make the best of it . ANNA MAURRANT I think the trouble is people do n't make allowances . They do n't realize that everybody wants a kind word , now and then . After all , we 're all human , and we ca n't just go along by ourselves , all the time , without ever getting a kind word . While she is speaking STEVE SANKEY appears at the right . He is in his early thirties and is prematurely bald . He is rather flashily dressed in a patently cheap , light gray suit and a straw hat with a plaid band . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swift , significant look . p. 15 STEVE SANKEY stopping at the right of the stoop and removing his hat.Good evening , folks ! Is it hot enough for you ? THE OTHERS Good evening . ANNA MAURRANT self-consciously.Good evening , Mr. Sankey . Throughout the scene MRS . MAURRANT and SANKEY try vainly to avoid looking at each other . STEVE SANKEY I do n't know when we 've had a day like this . Hottest June fifteenth in forty-one years . It was up to ninety-four at three P.M. GEORGE JONES Six dead in Chicago . An ' no relief in sight , the evenin ' paper says . MAURRANT appears at the window of his apartment and stands there , looking out . GRETA FIORENTINO It 's joost awful ! STEVE SANKEY Well , it 's good for the milk business . You know the old saying , it 's an ill wind that blows nobody any good . ANNA MAURRANT Yes . You hardly get the milk in the morning before it turns sour . EMMA JONES I 'm just after pourin ' half a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 GRETA FIORENTINO You should n't throw it avay . You should make  --  what do you call it ?  --  schmier-ks ' . STEVE SANKEY Oh , I know what you mean  --  pot cheese . My wife makes it too once in a while . ANNA MAURRANT Is your wife all right again , Mr. Sankey ? You were telling me last time , she had a cold . MRS . JONES and MRS . FIORENTINO exchange another look . STEVE SANKEY Was I ? Oh , sure , sure . That was a couple weeks ago . Yes , sure , she 's all right again . That did n't amount to anything much . EMMA JONES You got a family too , ai n't you ? STEVE SANKEY Yes . Yes , I have . Two little girls . Well , I got to be going along . He goes to the left of the stoop and stops again . I told my wife I 'd go down to the drugstore and get her some nice cold ginger ale . You want something to cool you off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes her.If you ask me , all that gassy stuff do n't do you a bit of good . STEVE SANKEY I guess you 're right , at that . Still it cools you off . Well , good night , folks . See you all again . He strolls off at the left with affected nonchalance ; but when he is almost out of sight he casts a swift look back at MRS . MAURRANT . A dowdy WOMAN , wheeling a dilapidated baby carriage , appears at the left and crosses the stage . p. 17 GEORGE JONES What 's his name  --  Sankey ? EMMA JONES Yeah  --  Mr. Sankey . ANNA MAURRANT He 's the collector for the milk company . AGNES CUSHING comes out of the house . She is a thin , dried-up woman , past fifty . AGNES CUSHING coming down the steps.Good evening . THE OTHERS Good evening , Miss Cushing . ANNA MAURRANT How is your mother today , Miss Cushing ? AGNES CUSHING passing at the left of the stoop.Why , she complains of the heat . But I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . I 'm just going down to the corner to get her a little ice cream . As she goes off at the left OLSEN , the janitor , a lanky Swede , struggles up the cellar steps with a large , covered , tin garbage barrel . The others look around in annoyance as he bangs the garbage barrel upon the pavement . CARL OLSEN Phew ! Hot ! He mops his face and neck with a dingy handkerchief , then lights his pipe and leans against the railing . EMMA JONES significantly , as she crosses to the center of the stoop and sits.Between you and I , I do n't think her mother 's got long for this world . Once the heart starts goin ' back on you  --   --  ! p. 18 GRETA FIORENTINO It 's too bad . ANNA MAURRANT Poor soul ! She 'll have nothing at all when her mother dies . She 's just spent her whole life looking after her mother . EMMA JONES It 's no more than her duty , is it ? GRETA FIORENTINO You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICE offstage.Char-lie ! ANNA MAURRANT It 's not a matter of neglecting . Only  --  it seems as if a person should get more out of life than just looking after somebody else . EMMA JONES Well , I hope to tell you , after all I 've done for mine , I expect ' em to look after me , in my old age . ANNA MAURRANT I do n't know . It seems to me you might just as well not live at all , as the way she does . Rising , with affected casualness . I do n't know what 's become of Willie . I think I 'd better walk down to the corner and look for him . My husband do n't like it if he stays out late . She goes off at the left . They all watch her , in dead silence , until she is out of earshot . Then the storm breaks . EMMA JONES rising excitedly.Didja get that ? Goin ' to look for Willie ! Can ya beat it ? p. 19 GRETA FIORENTINO It 's joost terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out lookin ' for this guy Sankey ? EMMA JONES scornfully.Ai n't men the limit ? What do you think he come walkin ' by here for ? Mincingly . Just strolled by to get the wife a little ginger ale . A fat lot he cares whether his wife has ginger ale ! GRETA FIORENTINO Two little girls he 's got too ! GEORGE JONES Yeah , that ai n't right  --  a bird like that , wit ' a wife an ' two kids of his own . GRETA FIORENTINO The way he stands there and looks and looks at her ! EMMA JONES An ' what about the looks she was givin ' him ! Seating herself again . You 'd think he was the Prince of Wales instead of a milk collector . And didja get the crack about not seein ' him for two weeks ? GRETA FIORENTINO And joost today he was upstairs , Mrs. Olsen says . OLSEN approaches the stoop and removes his pipe from his mouth . CARL OLSEN pointing upward.Someday her hoosban ' is killing him . He replaces his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIORENTINO Dot would be terrible ! GEORGE JONES He 's li'ble to , at that . You know , he 's got a wicked look in his eye , dat baby has . EMMA JONES Well , it 's no more than he deserves , the little rabbit  --  goin ' around breakin ' up people 's homes . Mockingly . Good evenin ' , folks ! Jes ' like Whozis on the radio . GEORGE JONES D' ya think Maurrant is wise to what 's goin ' on ? EMMA JONES Well , if he ai n't , there must be somethin ' the matter with him . But you never can tell about men . They 're as blind as bats . An ' what I always say is , in a case like that , the husband or the wife is always the last one to find out . MISS CUSHING , carrying a small paper bag , hurries on at the left in a state of great excitement . AGNES CUSHING breathlessly , as she comes up the left of the stoop.Say , what do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! EMMA JONES rising excitedly.What did I tell you ? GRETA FIORENTINO Where did you see them , Miss Cushing ? AGNES CUSHING Why , right next door , in the entrance to the warehouse . They were standing right close together . And he had his hands up on her shoulders . It 's awful , is n't it ? p. 21 GEORGE JONES Looks to me like this thing is gettin ' pretty serious . EMMA JONES You did n't notice if they was kissin ' or any-thin ' , did you ? AGNES CUSHING Well , to tell you the truth , Mrs. Jones , I was so ashamed for her that I hardly looked at all . GEORGE JONES sotto voce , as the house door opens.Look out ! Maurrant 's comin ' . A conspirators ' silence falls upon them as MAURRANT , pipe in mouth , comes out of the house . AGNES CUSHING tremulously.Good evening , Mr. Maurrant . FRANK MAURRANT on the top step.Evenin . To the others . What 's become of me wife ? EMMA JONES Why , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie . FRANK MAURRANT grunts.Oh . EMMA JONES They need a lot of lookin ' after when they 're that age . A momentary silence . AGNES CUSHING Well , I think I 'd better get back to my mother . She goes up the steps. p. 22 MRS . JONES , MRS . FIORENTINO , AND JONES Good night , Miss Cushing . AGNES CUSHING Good night . As she passes MAURRANT . Good night , Mr. Maurrant . FRANK MAURRANT ' Night . She looks at him swiftly and goes into the vestibule . A BOY 'S VOICE offstage.Red Rover ! Red Rover ! Let Mary come over ! As Miss CUSHING enters the house SHIRLEY KAPLAN appears at the ground-floor window , at the extreme right , with a glass of steaming tea in her hand . She is a dark , unattractive Jewess , past thirty . She wears a light housedress . KAPLAN goes on reading . SHIRLEY KAPLAN to the neighbors outside ; she speaks with the faintest trace of accent.Good evening . THE OTHERS not very cordially.Good evenin ' . SHIRLEY KAPLAN It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND MRS .

Notting but deevorce , skendal , and moiders . He speaks with a strong accent , overemphatically , and with much gesticulation . He puts his paper away , removes his glasses , and starts to drink his tea . SHIRLEY KAPLAN There does n't seem to be a breath of air any-where . No one answers . SHIRLEY goes away from the window and puts out the lights . EMMA JONES sotto voce.You would n't think anybody would want to read that Hebrew writin ' , would ya ? I do n't see how they make head or tail out of it , meself . GEORGE JONES I guess if you learn it when you 're a kid  --   --  EMMA JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. ! He 's sure got his hands full ! She looks toward the left , greatly amused . SHIRLEY reap-pears at the window at the extreme right and seats herself on the sill . GRETA FIORENTINO leaning far out.Joost look at him ! Calling . Lippo , be careful you do n't drop any ! p. 24 FILIPPO FIORENTINO offstage . ' Allo , Margherita ! They all watch in amusement as FILIPPO FIORENTINO , a fat Italian , with thick black hair and mustache , comes on at the left . He is clutching a violin in his left arm and balancing five ice-cream cones in his right hand . FILIPPO FIORENTINO shouting.Who wantsa da ice-cream cone ? Nica , fresha ice-cream cone ! GRETA FIORENTINO Lippo , you will drop them ! EMMA JONES going up to him.Here , gim me your violin . She relieves him of the violin , and he shifts two of the cones to his left hand .

Coming over to the stoop and calling into the vestibule . If you 're lookin ' for Mrs. Hildebrand , she ai n't home yet . ALICE SIMPSON coming to the doorway.Do you know when she 'll be back ?

CARL OLSEN calmly.She 's comin ' now . FILIPPO FIORENTINO rising to his feet and calling vehemently.Mees Hil'brand ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! Ees a lady here . He motions violently to her to hurry . LAURA HILDEBRAND appears at the right with her two children , CHARLIE and MARY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner of perpetual bewilderment . Both children are chewing gum , and MARY comes on skipping a rope and chanting : " Apple , peach , pear , plum , banana . " CHARLIE carefully avoids all the cracks in the sidewalk .

HARRY EASTER Then what is it , hm ? ROSE MAURRANT turning and facing him.You know very well what it is . You 've got a wife , have n't you ? HARRY EASTER What of it ? I tell you , I 'm clean off my nut about you . ROSE MAURRANT nervously , as the house door opens.Look out ! Somebody 's coming . EASTER goes to the other side of the stoop and they fall into a self-conscious silence as MRS . JONES comes out of the house , leading an ill-conditioned dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenin ' . She stares at EASTER , then goes toward the right . ROSE MAURRANT Good evening , Mrs. Jones . It 's been a terrible day , has n't it ? EMMA JONES Yeah . Awful . Stopping . I think your father 's been kinda worried about you . ROSE MAURRANT Oh , has he ? p. 58 EMMA JONES Yeah . Well , I got ta give Queenie her exercise . Good night . She stares at EASTER again , then goes off at right . ROSE MAURRANT Good night , Mrs. Jones . To EASTER . I 'll soon have all the neighbors talking about me . HARRY EASTER going over to her again.What can they say , hm ? That they saw you saying good night to somebody on the front doorstep ? ROSE MAURRANT They can say worse than that  --  and what 's more , they will , too . HARRY EASTER Well , why not snap out of it all ? ROSE MAURRANT Out of what ? HARRY EASTER indicating the house.This ! The whole business . Living in a dirty old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , for a measly twenty-five a week . You 're not going to try to tell me you like living this way , are you ? ROSE MAURRANT No , I ca n't say that I like it especially . But maybe it wo n't always be this way . Anyhow , I guess I 'm not so much better than anybody else . HARRY EASTER taking her hand.Do you know what 's the matter with you ? You 're not wise to yourself . Why , you 've got just about everything , you have . You 've got looks and personality and a bean on your shoulders  --  there 's nothing you have n't got . You 've got It , I tell you . p. 59 ROSE MAURRANT You should n't keep looking at me , all the time , at the office . The other girls are beginning to pass hints about it . HARRY EASTER releasing her hand , genuinely perturbed.Is that a fact ? You see , that shows you ! I never even knew I was looking at you . I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've got to do something about it . ROSE MAURRANT nervously snapping the clasp of her handbag.I guess the only thing for me to do is to look for another job . HARRY EASTER Yes , that 's what I 've been thinking too . As she is about to demur . Wait a minute , honey ! I 've been doing a little thinking and I 've got it all doped out . The first thing you do is throw up your job , see ? ROSE MAURRANT But  --   --  HARRY EASTER Then you find yourself a nice , cozy little apartment somewhere . As she is about to interrupt again . Just a minute , now ! Then you get yourself a job on the stage . ROSE MAURRANT How could I get a job on the stage ? HARRY EASTER Why , as easy as walking around the block . I 've got three or four friends in show business . Ever hear of Harry Porkins ? p. 60 ROSE MAURRANT No . HARRY EASTER Well , he 's the boy that put on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal of mine , and all I 'd have to say to him is  --  Putting his arm around her shoulder.  --  " Harry , here 's a little girl I 'm interested in , " and he 'd sign you up in a minute . ROSE MAURRANT I do n't think I 'd be any good on the stage . HARRY EASTER Why , what are you talking about , sweetheart ? There 's a dozen girls , right now , with their names up in electric lights , that have n't got half your stuff . All you got to do is go about it in the right way  --  put up a little front , see ? Why , half the game is nothing but bluff . Get yourself a classy little apartment , and fill it up with trick furniture , see ? Then you doll yourself up in a flock of Paris clothes and you throw a couple or three parties and you 're all set . Taking her arm . Would n't you like to be on Broadway ? ROSE MAURRANT I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth trying ? What have you got here , hm ? This is no kind of a racket for a girl like you . Taking her hand . You do like me a little , do n't you ? ROSE MAURRANT I do n't know if I do or not . p. 61 HARRY EASTER Why , sure you do . And once you get to know me better , you 'd like me even more . I 'm no Valentino , but I 'm not a bad scout . Why , think of all the good times we could have together  --  you with a little apartment and all . And maybe we could get us a little car  --   --  ROSE MAURRANT And what about your wife ? HARRY EASTER letting go her hand.The way I figure it is , she does n't have to know anything about it . She stays up there in Bronxville , and there are lots of times when business keeps me in New York . Then , in the summer , she goes to the mountains . Matter of fact , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROSE MAURRANT shaking her head and going toward the stoop.I do n't think it 's the way I 'd want things to be . HARRY EASTER Why , there 's nothing really wrong about it . ROSE MAURRANT Maybe there is n't . But it 's just the way I feel about it , I guess . HARRY EASTER Why , you 'd get over that in no time . There 's lots of girls  --   --  ROSE MAURRANT Yes , I know there are . But you 've been telling me all along I 'm different . p. 62 HARRY EASTER Sure , you 're different . You 're in a class by your-self . Why , sweetheart  --   --  He tries to take her in his arms . ROSE MAURRANT pushing him away.No . And you must n't call me sweetheart . HARRY EASTER Why not ? ROSE MAURRANT Because I 'm not your sweetheart . HARRY EASTER I want you to be  --   --  A sudden yell of pain is heard from upstairs . They both look up , greatly startled . My God , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Mrs. Buchanan . She 's expecting a baby . HARRY EASTER Why does she yell like that ? God , I thought somebody was being killed . ROSE MAURRANT The poor thing ! With sudden impatience she starts up the steps . I 've got to go now . Good night . HARRY EASTER taking her hand.But , Rose  --   --  ROSE MAURRANT freeing her hand quickly.No , I 've got to go . Suddenly . Look , there 's my father . There 'll only be an argument if he sees you . p. 63 HARRY EASTER All right , I 'll go . He goes toward the left as MAURRANT appears at the right . ROSE MAURRANT going up to the top step.Good night . HARRY EASTER Good night . EASTER goes off at the left . ROSE begins searching in her handbag for her latchkey . ROSE MAURRANT as MAURRANT approaches.Hello , Pop . FRANK MAURRANT stopping at the foot of the steps.Who was that you was talkin ' to ? ROSE MAURRANT That 's Mr. Easter . He 's the manager of the office . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out wit ' him ? ROSE MAURRANT Yes , he took me out to dinner . FRANK MAURRANT Oh , he did , huh ? ROSE MAURRANT Yes , I had to stay late to get out some letters . You see , Pop , the office is closed tomorrow , on account of Mr. Jacobson 's funeral  --   --  FRANK MAURRANT Yeah , I know all about that . This is a hell of a time to be gettin ' home from dinner . p. 64 ROSE MAURRANT Well , we danced afterward . FRANK MAURRANT Oh , you danced , huh ? With a little pettin ' on the side , is that it ? ROSE MAURRANT rather angrily , as she seats herself on the left balustrade.I do n't see why you can never talk to me in a nice way . FRANK MAURRANT So you 're startin ' to go on pettin ' parties , are you ? ROSE MAURRANT Who said I was on a petting party ? FRANK MAURRANT I suppose he did n't kiss you or nothin ' , huh ? ROSE MAURRANT No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  FRANK MAURRANT It 's your own business , is that it ? Going up the steps . Well , I 'm gon na make it my business , see ? Is this bird married ? ROSE does not answer . I t'ought so ! They 're all alike , them guys  --  all after the one thing . Well , get this straight . No married men ai n't gon na come nosin ' around my family , get me ? ROSE MAURRANT rising agitatedly as the house door opens.Be quiet , Pop ! There 's somebody coming . FRANK MAURRANT I do n't care ! BUCHANAN hurries out of the house . He is a small and pasty young man  --  a typical " white-collar slave . " He has hastily put on his coat and trousers over his pajamas , and his bare feet are in slippers. p. 65 DANIEL BUCHANAN as he comes down the steps.I think the baby 's coming ! ROSE MAURRANT solicitously.Can I do anything , Mr. Buchanan ? DANIEL BUCHANAN as he hurries toward the left.No , I 'm just going to phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me do it , and you go back to your wife . DANIEL BUCHANAN Well , if you would n't mind . It 's Doctor John Wilson . Handing her a slip of paper . Here 's his number . And the other number is her sister , Mrs. Thomas . And here 's two nickels . Tell them both to come right away . She 's got terrible pains . Another scream from upstairs . Listen to her ! I better go back . He dashes up the steps and into the house . ROSE MAURRANT Oh , the poor woman ! Pop , tell Ma to go up to her . Hurry ! FRANK MAURRANT Aw , all right . He follows BUCHANAN into the house . ROSE hurries off at the left just as MAE JONES and DICK McGANN appear . MAE is a vulgar shopgirl of twenty-one ; DICK , a vacuous youth of about the same age . MAE is wearing DICK 'S straw hat and they are both quite drunk . p. 66 MAE JONES to ROSE.Hello , Rose . What 's your hurry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to phone to the doctor . She hurries off . DICK MCGANN as they approach the stoop.Say , who 's your little friend ? MAE JONES Oh , that 's Rose Maurrant . She lives in the house . DICK MCGANN She 's kinda cute , ai n't she ? MAE JONES seating herself on the stoop.Say , accordin ' to you , anythin ' in a skirt is kinda cute  --  providin ' the skirt is short enough . DICK MCGANN Yeah , but they ai n't any of ' em as cute as you , Mae . MAE JONES yawning and scratching her leg.Yeah ? DICK MCGANN Honest , I mean it . How ' bout a little kiss ? He puts his arms about her and plants a long kiss upon her lips . She submits with an air of intense boredom . Removing his lips . Say , you might show a little en-thoosiasm . MAE JONES rouging her lips.Say , you seem to think I ought a hang out a flag every time some bozo decides to wipe off his mouth on me. p. 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another little snifter . He reaches for his flask . MAE JONES Nope ! I ca n't swaller any more o ' that rotten gin o ' yours . DICK MCGANN Why , it ai n't so worse . I do n't mind it no more since I had that brass linin ' put in me stomach . Well , happy days ! He takes a long drink . MAE JONES rising indignantly.Hey , for God 's sake , what are you doin '  --  emptyin ' the flask ? DICK MCGANN removing the flask from his lips.I t'ought you did n't want none . MAE JONES Ca n't you take a joke ? She snatches the flask from him and drains it , kicking out at DICK to prevent his taking it from her . DICK MCGANN snatching the empty flask.Say , you wan na watch your step , baby , or you 're li'ble to go right up in a puff o ' smoke . MAE JONES whistling.Phew ! Boy ! I feel like a t'ree alarm fire ! Say , what de hell do dey make dat stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part Army mule . Dey use it for blastin ' out West . p. 68 MAE JONES bursting raucously into a jazz tune.Da-da-da-da-dee ! Da-da-da-da-dee ! She executes some dance steps . DICK MCGANN Say , shut up , will ya ? You 'll be wakin ' the whole neighborhood . MAE JONES boisterously.What the hell do I care ? Da-da-da-da-dee ! Da-da-da-da-dee ! Suddenly amorous , as she turns an unsteady pirouette . Kiss me , kid ! DICK MCGANN I 'll say ! They lock in a long embrace . SAM , coat-less , his shirt collar open , appears at the window , watches the pair for a moment , and then turns away , obviously disgusted . They do not see him . DICK takes MAE 'S arm . Come on ! MAE JONES Wait a minute ! where y ' goin ' ? DICK MCGANN Come on , I 'm tellin ' ya ! Fred Hennessy gim me de key to his apartment . Dere wo n't be nobody dere . MAE JONES protesting feebly.I ought a go home . Her hand to her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk , will ya ? DICK MCGANN Come on ! ROSE appears at the left . p. 69 MAE JONES Sweet papa ! She kisses DICK noisily , then bursts into song again . Da-da-da-da-dee ! Da-da-da-da-dee ! As they pass ROSE . Hello , Rose . How 's de milkman ? DICK MCGANN raising his hat with drunken politeness.Goo ' night , sweetheart . They go off at the left , MAE 'S snatches of song dying away in the distance . ROSE stands still for a moment , choking back her mortification . DANIEL BUCHANAN Miss Maurrant , did you get them ? ROSE MAURRANT looking up.Why , yes , I did . The doctor will be here right away . And Mrs. Thomas said it would take her about an hour . VINCENT JONES appears at the right and stops near the stoop . He is a typical New York taxicab driver , in a cap . ROSE does not see him . DANIEL BUCHANAN She 's got terrible pains . Your mother 's up here with her . MRS . BUCHANAN is heard calling faintly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoop and sees VINCENT . VINCENT JONES Hello , Rosie . ROSE MAURRANT Good evening . She tries to pass , but he blocks her way. p. 70 VINCENT JONES What 's your hurry ? ROSE MAURRANT It 's late . VINCENT JONES You don ' wan na go to bed yet . Come on , I 'll take you for a ride in me hack . He puts his arm around her . ROSE MAURRANT Please let me pass . SAM appears at the window . They do not see him . VINCENT JONES enjoying ROSE 'S struggle to escape.You got a lot o ' stren'th , ai n't you ? Say , do you know , you 're gettin ' fat ? He passes one hand over her body . ROSE MAURRANT Let me go , you big tough . SAMUEL KAPLAN simultaneously.Take your hands off her ! He climbs quickly out of the window and onto the stoop . VINCENT , surprised , releases ROSE and steps to the sidewalk . ROSE goes up the steps . SAM , trembling with excitement and fear , stands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES Well , look who 's here ! Mockingly . Haster gesehn de fish in de Bowery ? Menacingly . What de hell do you want ? p. 71 SAMUEL KAPLAN chokingly.You keep your hands off her ! VINCENT JONES Yeah ? Sawing the air with his hands . Oi , Jakie ! He suddenly lunges forward , seizes SAM 'S arm , pulls him violently by the right hand down the steps and swings him about , so that they stand face to face , to the left of the stoop . ROSE comes down between them . Now whaddya got t ' say ? ROSE MAURRANT Let him alone ! SAMUEL KAPLAN inarticulately.If you touch her again  --   --  VINCENT JONES mockingly.If I touch her again  --   --  ! Savagely . Aw , shut up , you little kike bastard ! He brushes ROSE aside and , putting his open hand against SAM 'S face , sends him sprawling to the pavement . ROSE MAURRANT her fists clenched.You big coward . VINCENT JONES standing over SAM.Get up , why do n't you ? ROSE MAURRANT crossing to SAM.If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 VINCENT JONES as MRS . JONES and the dog appear at the right.Gee , do n't frighten me like dat . I got a weak heart . He is sobered , nevertheless . SAM picks himself up . MRS . JONES approaches . Hello , Ma . EMMA JONES with maternal pride.Hello , Vincent . What 's goin ' on here ? VINCENT JONES Oh , jus ' a little friendly argument . Ikey Finkelstein do n't like me to say good evenin ' to his girl friend . ROSE MAURRANT You 'd better keep your hands to yourself hereafter . VINCENT JONES Is dat so ? Who said so , huh ? EMMA JONES Come on , Vincent . Come on upstairs . I saved some stew for you . VINCENT JONES All right , I 'm comin ' . To ROSE . Good night , dearie . He makes a feint at SAM , who starts back in terror . VINCENT laughs . EMMA JONES Aw , let ' im alone , Vincent . VINCENT JONES as he goes up the steps.Who 's touchin ' him ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To ROSE . Some sheik you picked out for yourself ! He enters the vestibule and opens the door with his latchkey. p. 73 EMMA JONES going up the steps.You seem to have plenty of admirers , Miss Maurrant . Pausing on the top step . But I guess you come by it natural . ROSE does not reply . MRS . JONES follows VINCENT into the house . ROSE averts her head to keep back the tears . SAM stands facing the house , his whole body quivering with emotion . Suddenly he raises his arms , his fists clenched . SAMUEL KAPLAN hysterically , as he rushes to the foot of the stoop.The dirty bum ! I 'll kill him ! ROSE MAURRANT turning and going to him.It 's all right , Sam . Never mind . SAMUEL KAPLAN sobbing.I 'll kill him ! I 'll kill him ! He throws himself on the stoop and , burying his head in his arms , sobs hysterically . ROSE sits beside him and puts her arm around him . ROSE MAURRANT It 's all right , Sam . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a big tough like that ? SAM does not answer . ROSE caresses his hair and he grows calmer . He 's nothing but a loafer , you know that . What do you care what he says ? p. 74 SAMUEL KAPLAN without raising his head. I 'm a coward . ROSE MAURRANT Why , no , you 're not , Sam . SAMUEL KAPLAN Yes , I am . I 'm a coward . ROSE MAURRANT Why , he 's not worth your little finger , Sam . You wait and see . Ten years from now , he 'll still be driving a taxi and you  --  why , you 'll be so far above him , you wo n't even remember he 's alive . SAMUEL KAPLAN I 'll never be anything . ROSE MAURRANT Why , do n't talk like that , Sam . A boy with your brains and ability . Graduating from college with honors and all that ! Why , if I were half as smart as you , I 'd be just so proud of myself ! SAMUEL KAPLAN What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if nobody knows you exist ? ROSE MAURRANT gently.I know you exist , Sam . SAMUEL KAPLAN It would n't take much to make you forget me . ROSE MAURRANT I 'm not so sure about that . Why do you say that , Sam ? SAMUEL KAPLAN Because I know . It 's different with you . You have beauty  --  people look at you  --  you have a place in the world  --   --  p. 75 ROSE MAURRANT I do n't know . It 's not always so easy , being a girl  --  I often wish I were a man . It seems to me that when you 're a man , it 's so much easier to sort of  --  be yourself , to kind of be the way you feel . But when you 're a girl , it 's different . It does n't seem to matter what you are , or what you 're thinking or feeling  --  all that men seem to care about is just the one thing . And when you 're sort of trying to find out just where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see what I mean ? Hesitantly . Sam , there 's something I want to ask you  --   --  She stops . SAMUEL KAPLAN turning to her. What is it , Rose ? ROSE MAURRANT I would n't dream of asking anybody but you . With a great effort . Sam , do you think it 's true  --  what they 're saying about my mother ? SAM averts his head , without answering . Wretchedly . I guess it is , is n't it ? SAMUEL KAPLAN agitatedly.They were talking here , before  --  I could n't stand it any more ! He clasps his head and , springing to his feet , goes to the right of the stoop . Oh , God , why do we go on living in this sewer ? p. 76 ROSE MAURRANT appealingly.What can I do , Sam ? SAM makes a helpless gesture . You see , my father means well enough , and all that , but he 's always been sort of strict and  --  I do n't know  --  sort of making you freeze up , when you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole trouble , I guess ; my mother never had anybody to really love her . She 's sort of gay and happy-like  --  you know , she likes having a good time and all that . But my father is different . Only  --  the way things are now  --  everybody talking and making remarks , all the neighbors spying and whispering  --  it sort of makes me feel  --   --  She shudders . I do n't know  --   --  ! SAMUEL KAPLAN coming over to her again. I wish I could help you , Rose . ROSE MAURRANT You do help me , Sam  --  just by being nice and sympathetic and talking things over with me . There 's so few people you can really talk to , do you know what I mean ? Sometimes , I get the feeling that I 'm all alone in the world and that  --   --  A scream of pain from MRS . BUCHANAN . ROSE springs to her feet . Oh , just listen to her ! SAMUEL KAPLAN Oh , God ! p. 77 ROSE MAURRANT The poor thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all there is in life  --  nothing but pain . From before we 're born , until we die ! Everywhere you look , oppression and cruelty ! If it does n't come from Nature , it comes from humanity  --  humanity trampling on itself and tearing at its own throat . The whole world is nothing but a bloodstained arena , filled with misery and suffering . It 's too high a price to pay for life  --  life is n't worth it ! He seats himself despairingly on the stoop . ROSE MAURRANT putting her hand on his shoulder.Oh , I do n't know , Sam . I feel blue and discouraged , sometimes , too . And I get a sort of feeling of , oh , what 's the use . Like last night . I hardly slept all night , on account of the heat and on account of thinking about  --  well , all sorts of things . And this morning , when I got up , I felt so miserable . Well , all of a sudden , I decided I 'd walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , everything looked so green and fresh , that I got a kind of feeling of , well , maybe it 's not so bad , after all . And then , what do you think ?  --  all of a sudden , I saw a big lilac bush , with some flowers still on it . It made me think about the poem you said for me  --  remember ?  --  the one about the lilacs. p. 78 SAMUEL KAPLAN quoting.When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'dAnd the great star early droop 'd in the western sky in the night , I mourn 'd and yet shall mourn , with ever-returning Spring . He repeats the last line . I mourn 'd and yet shall mourn , with ever-returning Spring ! Yes ! ROSE MAURRANT No , not that part . I mean the part about the farm-house . Say it for me , Sam . She sits at his feet . SAMUEL KAPLAN In the door-yard , fronting an old farmhouse , near the white-washed palings , Stands the lilac bush , tall-growing , with heart-shaped leaves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate , with the perfume strong I love , With every leaf a miracle  --  and from this bush in the dooryard , With delicate-color 'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green , A sprig with its flower I break . ROSE MAURRANT eagerly.Yes , that 's it ! That 's just what I felt like doing  --  breaking off a little bunch of the flowers . But then I thought , maybe a policeman or somebody would see me , and then I 'd get into trouble ; so I did n't . DANIEL BUCHANAN Miss Maurrant ! Miss Maurrant ! SAM and ROSE spring to their feet and look up . p. 79 ROSE MAURRANT Yes ? DANIEL BUCHANAN Do you mind phoning to the doctor again ? She 's getting worse . ROSE MAURRANT Yes , sure I will . She starts to go . Wait ! Maybe this is the doctor now . DANIEL BUCHANAN excitedly as DR . WILSON , a seedy , middle-aged man in a crumpled Panama , appears at the left. Yes , that 's him . Mrs. Maurrant ! Tell her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none too soon . DR . JOHN WILSON Plenty of time . Just do n't get excited . He throws away his cigarette and enters the vestibule . The mechanical clicking of the door latch is heard as he goes into the house . ROSE MAURRANT I hope she wo n't have to suffer much longer . FRANK MAURRANT appearing at the window in his undershirt.Rose ! ROSE MAURRANT rather startled.Yes , Pop , I 'll be right up . FRANK MAURRANT Well , do n't be makin ' me call you again , d' ya hear ? ROSE MAURRANT I 'm coming right away . MAURRANT leaves the window . I 'd better go up now , Sam . p. 80 SAMUEL KAPLAN Do you have to go to bed , when you 're told , like a child ? ROSE MAURRANT I know , Sam , but there 's so much wrangling goes on , all the time , as it is , what 's the use of having any more ? Good night , Sam . There was something I wanted to talk to you about , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her hand . SAM takes it and holds it in his . SAMUEL KAPLAN trembling and rising to his feet.Rose , will you kiss me ? ROSE MAURRANT simply.Why , of course I will , Sam . She offers him her lips . He clasps her in a fervent embrace , to which she submits but does not respond . Freeing herself gently . Do n't be discouraged about things , Sam . You wait and see  --  you 're going to do big things , some day . I 've got lots of confidence in you . SAMUEL KAPLAN turning away his head. I wonder if you really have , Rose ? ROSE MAURRANT Why , of course I have ! And do n't forget it ! Good night . I hope it wo n't be too hot to sleep . SAMUEL KAPLAN Good night , Rose . He watches her , as she opens the door with her latchkey and goes into the house . Then he goes to the stoop and , seating himself , falls into a reverie . A POLICEMAN appears at the right and strolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance a homecomer sings drunkenly . A light appears , in the Maurrant hall bedroom , and a moment later ROSE comes to the window and leans out . p. 81 ROSE MAURRANT calling softly.Hoo-hoo ! Sam ! SAM looks up , then rises . Good night , Sam . She wafts him a kiss . SAMUEL KAPLAN with deep feeling.Good night , Rose dear . She smiles at him . Then she pulls down the shade . SAM looks up for a moment , then resumes his seat . A scream from MRS . BUCHANAN makes him shudder . A deep rhythmic snoring emanates from the Fiorentino apartment . A steam-boat whistle is heard . The snoring in the Fiorentino apartment continues . SAM raises his clenched hands to heaven . A distant clock begins to strike twelve . SAM 'S arms and head drop forward. @x Daybreak , the next morning . It is still quite dark and comparatively quiet . The rhythmic snoring in the Fiorentino apartment is still heard , and now and then a distant El train or speeding automobile . A moment after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on his way home from the speakeasy . He reels slightly but negotiates the steps and entrance door without too much difficulty . It grows lighter  --  and noisier . The street light goes out . The OLSEN baby begins to cry . An alarm clock rings . A dog barks . A canary begins to sing . Voices are heard in the distance . They die out and other voices are heard . The house door opens and DR . WILSON comes out , passing JONES at the top of the stoop . DR . WILSON stands on the steps and yawns the yawn of an overtired man . Then he lights a cigarette and goes toward the left . DANIEL BUCHANAN Doctor ! DR . JOHN WILSON stopping and looking up . Well ? DANIEL BUCHANAN What if she does wake up ? DR . JOHN WILSON sharply.She wo n't , I 've told you ! She 's too exhausted . The best thing you can do is lie down and get some sleep yourself . As he goes off at the left , MAE and DICK appear . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DICK MCGANN as they reach the stoop.Well , goo ' night . MAE JONES with a yawn , as she finds her latchkey.Goo ' night . Going up the steps and looking toward the Fiorentino apartment . Aw , shut up , you wop ! DICK MCGANN his dignity wounded.How ' bout kissin ' me good night ? MAE JONES venomously , from the top step.For God 's sake , ai n't you had enough kissin ' for one night ! She enters the vestibule and puts the key in the lock . The ringing of an alarm clock is heard . DICK MCGANN raising his voice.Well , say , if that 's the way you feel about it  --   --  MAE JONES Aw , go to hell ! She enters the house . The alarm clock has stopped ringing . DICK MCGANN You dirty little tart ! He stands , muttering to himself for a moment , then goes off at the right , passing the POLICEMAN , who looks at him suspiciously . The sounds of a Swedish quarrel are heard from the janitor 's apartment . The baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a MILKMAN appears , whistling and carrying a rack of full milk bottles . p. 84 POLICEMAN Hello , Louie . The snoring in the Fiorentino apartment stops . A MILKMAN Hello , Harry . Goin ' to be another scorcher . POLICEMAN You said it . He exits at left . The MILKMAN crosses to the cellar steps . Mae appears at the hall-bedroom window of the Jones apartment and removes her dress over her head . The MILKMAN , about to go down the steps , sees her and stops to watch . MAE , about to slip out of her step-in , sees him , throws him an angry look , and pulls down the shade . The MILKMAN grins and goes down the cellar steps . CHARLIE HILDEBRAND comes out of the house . He is chewing gum and as he comes out to the top of the stoop he scatters the wrappings of the stick of gum on the stoop . Then he jumps down the four steps of the stoop , in one jump , and goes off at the left , pulling the chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the cracks in the pavement . A young WORKMAN , carrying a kit of tools and a tin lunch box , appears at the left , extinguishes the red light on the excavation , and , opening the door , goes in . A TRAMP comes on at the right and shuffles across . He sees a cigar butt on the pavement , picks it up , and pockets it as he exits at the left . ROSE , in her nightgown , appears at the window , yawns slightly , and disappears . It is daylight now . The baby stops crying . MRS . OLSEN comes up the cellar steps .

I just do n't seem able to manage him any more . ROSE MAURRANT I sometimes wonder if it would n't be better for us all if we moved out to the suburbs somewhere  --  you know , some place in Jersey or Staten Island . ANNA MAURRANT I do n't think Pop would do it . As MAURRANT comes out of the house , carrying a much battered satchel .

I thought I 'd make her some chicken soup , to give her strength . FRANK MAURRANT Say , how about lookin ' after your own home an ' lettin ' the Buchanans look after theirs . ANNA MAURRANT All I 'm trying to do is to be a little neighborly . It 's the least anybody can do , with the poor thing hardly able to lift her hand . FRANK MAURRANT That 's all right about that ! Coming down the steps . A woman 's got a right to stay in her own home , lookin ' after her husband an ' children . ANNA MAURRANT going toward him.

She starts to run after her mother . FRANK MAURRANT imperiously.Come back here , you ! ROSE hesitates . Come back , hear me ? ROSE turns and comes slowly back . You stay right here .

Where 's she got any kick comin ' ? Ai n't I always been a good husband to her ? Ai n't I always looked after her ? He takes a drink . ROSE MAURRANT It 's not that , Pop . It 's some-body to be sort of nice to her that she wants  --  sort of nice and gentle , the way she is to you . That 's all it is . FRANK MAURRANT turning to her.So she 's got you headed the same way , has she ? Goin ' out nights with married men , huh ? ROSE MAURRANT You do n't need to worry about me , Pop . I can take care of myself all right . FRANK MAURRANT No daughter o ' mine ai n't gon na go that way . I seen too many o ' those kind around the theayter . ROSE MAURRANT Things are different nowadays , Pop . I guess maybe you do n't realize that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of soft and helpless . A girl nowadays knows how to look out for herself . But not her , Pop ; she needs some-body to look after her . FRANK MAURRANT Aw , can all that talk ! You been listenin ' to them Bolshevikis , that 's the trouble . But I 'm gon na keep you straight , by God , or I 'll know the reason why . ROSE MAURRANT I guess I 've got a right to think about things for myself . p. 105 FRANK MAURRANT Yeah ? Well , do n't let me ketch that other bozo comin ' around here either  --  that 's all I got to say . ROSE MAURRANT hesitantly going up to him.Pop , listen  --  could n't we get a little house somewhere  --  Queens or somewhere like that ? FRANK MAURRANT What 's the idea ? ROSE MAURRANT Well , I do n't know . I sort of thought it would be nice for all of us . And maybe if Ma had a nice little home and some real nice neighbors  --  do you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . ROSE MAURRANT You can get some real nice little houses that do n't cost such an awful lot . And I would n't mind helping to pay for it . And once we had it all fixed up  --   --  FRANK MAURRANT Forget it ! I don ' know when I 'll be back . As he starts to go right . An ' remember what I tol ' you , hear ? EMMA JONES appearing at her window with a tin dustpan.Good mornin ' , Mr. Maurrant . You off on a little trip ? FRANK MAURRANT curtly.Yeah . He goes off . MRS .

It 's just the way things are , that 's all . BUCHANAN appears at the left . They turn and face him as he approaches . Oh , Mr. Buchanan , I got a little chicken , so that I could make her some good , nourishing soup . DANIEL BUCHANAN Well , say , you got to let me pay you for it . ANNA MAURRANT Oh , never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Did you have her medicine made up ? DANIEL BUCHANAN Yes , I got it right here . I called up the office and they told me not to come down today . ANNA MAURRANT Well , that 's very nice . It 'll be a comfort to her to have you around . DANIEL BUCHANAN Yes , that 's what I thought too . Well , I 'd better be getting upstairs . He goes up the steps . ANNA MAURRANT I 'll be up later , with the soup . DANIEL BUCHANAN Well , thanks . Stopping at the top of the stoop and turning to her . You 've been a mighty good neighbor , Mrs. Maurrant . He enters the house . p. 113 ANNA MAURRANT He 's an awful nice young feller  --  so nice and gentle . And he 's always trying to be so helpful . It makes you feel sort of sorry for him . SHIRLEY comes out of the house , carrying a large wicker bag , which contains her lunch and schoolbooks . She takes a postcard out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd better go and start this chicken . Are you coming home for lunch , Rose ? ROSE MAURRANT Yes . I 'll be back , as soon as the funeral 's over . ANNA MAURRANT Oh , all right . As she sees SHIRLEY . Good morning . SHIRLEY KAPLAN coming out of the vestibule , reading the post-card.Good morning . ROSE MAURRANT Good morning . MRS . MAURRANT goes into the house . The shade of MAE 'S window flies up , and she is seen , for an instant , dressed only in her step-in . She yawns noisily and turns away from the window . Seating herself on the stoop . It 's another awful day , is n't it ? SHIRLEY KAPLAN Yes , and when you have to keep forty children quiet  --   --  ! Well , thank goodness , in two weeks , school closes . Otherwise , I think I 'd go crazy . ROSE MAURRANT Well , you get a nice , long vacation anyhow . p. 114 SHIRLEY KAPLAN Not much vacation for me . I 'm taking summer courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hesitates , and then comes down the steps . Miss Maurrant , if you do n't mind , I want to talk to you about my brother Sam . ROSE MAURRANT Why , certainly , Miss Kaplan . SHIRLEY KAPLAN I guess you know he 's only finishing college , this month  --   --  ROSE MAURRANT Yes , of course I do . SHIRLEY KAPLAN Then he has to go three years to law school and pass the bar examination before he can be a full-fledged lawyer . ROSE MAURRANT Yes , it takes a long time . SHIRLEY KAPLAN A long time and lots of money . And before a young lawyer begins to make his own living , that takes a long time too . It will be ten years , maybe , before he 's making enough to support himself and a family . Looking away . Then , it 's time enough for him to think about marriage . ROSE MAURRANT You do n't mean me and Sam , Miss Kaplan ? SHIRLEY KAPLAN Yes , that 's just what I mean . ROSE MAURRANT Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 115 SHIRLEY KAPLAN I know how it is with a boy like Sam , Miss Maurrant . He thinks he 's a man already ; but he 's nothing but a boy . If you 're such a good friend , you should n't take his mind away from his work . ROSE MAURRANT But I have n't meant to , Miss Kaplan  --  honest I have n't . SHIRLEY KAPLAN I 've had to work hard enough to get him as far as he is . And I have my father to take care of too . The few dollars he makes , writing for the radical papers , do n't even pay the rent . Believe me , every dollar I make goes . ROSE MAURRANT I know . Sam 's often told me how much he owes to you . SHIRLEY KAPLAN He does n't owe me anything . I do n't care about the money . Only he should be thinking about his work and not about other things . ROSE MAURRANT Yes , he should be thinking about his work . But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , besides just work ? SHIRLEY KAPLAN Do n't you think I know that ? I know that just as well as you do . Maybe , you think I 'm only an old-maid schoolteacher , without any feelings . ROSE MAURRANT Oh , I do n't  --  really I do n't ! SHIRLEY KAPLAN turning her head away.Maybe I 'm not a movie vamp , with dimples  --  but I could have had my chances too . Only , I wanted to give Sam an education . p. 116 ROSE MAURRANT I have n't tried to vamp Sam , honestly I have n't . We just seemed sort of naturally to like each other . SHIRLEY KAPLAN Why must you pick out Sam ? You could get other fellows . Anyhow , it 's much better to marry with your own kind . When you marry outside your own people , nothing good ever comes of it . You ca n't mix oil and water . ROSE MAURRANT I do n't know . I think if people really care about each other  --   --  SHIRLEY KAPLAN He 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right away , he forgets about everything else . ROSE MAURRANT with a flash of temper.I know I have n't as much brains as Sam , or as you either , if that 's what you mean . SHIRLEY KAPLAN contritely , going toward her . I did n't mean to hurt your feelings . I have n't got anything against you . Only , he 's all I 've got in the world . What else have I got to live for ? SAMUEL KAPLAN appearing at the extreme right window with a cup of coffee and a piece of coffee cake.Hello , Rose . ROSE MAURRANT Hello , Sam . SHIRLEY KAPLAN in a low tone.Please do n't tell him what I said . SAM goes to the other window. p. 117 ROSE MAURRANT Oh , no , I wo n't . SHIRLEY hurries off at the left . Rising and turning toward SAM . Sam  --   --  SAMUEL KAPLAN holding out the coffee cake.Want some coffee cake ? ROSE MAURRANT No . Going up the steps . Sam , there 's something I want to ask you , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act in a synagogue ? SAMUEL KAPLAN eating throughout.In a synagogue ? ROSE MAURRANT Yes . The funeral I 'm going to is in a synagogue , and I thought there might be some special thing you have to do . Like in church , you know , a girl is always supposed to keep her hat on . SAMUEL KAPLAN I do n't know . I 've never in my life been in a synagogue . ROSE MAURRANT Did n't you ever go to Sunday school , or anything like that ? SAMUEL KAPLAN No . ROSE MAURRANT That 's funny . I thought everybody went , once in a while . How about when your mother died ? SAMUEL KAPLAN She was cremated . My parents were always rationalists . ROSE MAURRANT Did n't they believe in God or anything ? p. 118 SAMUEL KAPLAN What do you mean by God ? ROSE MAURRANT puzzled.Well  --  you know what I mean . What anybody means  --  God . Some-Body that sort of loves us and looks after us , when we 're in trouble . SAMUEL KAPLAN sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies that people tell themselves , because reality is too terrible for them to face . ROSE MAURRANT But , Sam , do n't you think it 's better to believe in something that makes you a little happy , than not to believe in anything and be miserable all the time ? SAMUEL KAPLAN There 's no such thing as happiness . That 's an illusion , like all the rest . ROSE MAURRANT Then what 's the use of living ? SAMUEL KAPLAN brushing the last crumbs off his hands.Yes , what is the use ? ROSE MAURRANT Why , you ought n't to talk like that , Sam  --  a person with all the talent and brains that you 've got . I know things are n't just the way you want them to be . But they are n't for anybody . They are n't for me either . SAMUEL KAPLAN Then why do n't we get out of it , together ? p. 119 ROSE MAURRANT I do n't see just how we could do that , Sam . SAMUEL KAPLAN It would be easy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURRANT Why , Sam , you do n't mean kill ourselves ! SAMUEL KAPLAN Is your life so precious to you that you want to cling to it ? ROSE MAURRANT Well , yes . I guess it is . SAMUEL KAPLAN Why ? Why ? What is there in life to compensate for the pain of living ? ROSE MAURRANT There 's a lot . Just being alive  --  breathing and walking around . Just looking at the faces of people you like and hearing them laugh . And seeing the pretty things in the store windows . And roughhousing with your kid brother . And  --  oh , I do n't know  --  listening to a good band , and dancing . Oh , I 'd hate to die ! Earnestly . Sam , promise you wo n't talk about killing yourself any more . SAMUEL KAPLAN What difference would it make to you if I did ? ROSE MAURRANT Do n't talk like that , Sam ! You 're the best friend I 've ever had . She puts her hand on his . SAMUEL KAPLAN I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURRANT There 's something I want to ask your advice about , Sam . It 's about what I started to tell you about , last night . A man I know wants to put me on the stage . SAMUEL KAPLAN releasing her hand and drawing back.What man ? ROSE MAURRANT A man that works in the office . He knows a manager and he says he 'll help me get started . You see , what I thought was , that if I could only get out of here and have a decent place to live and make a lot of money , maybe everything would be different , not only for me , but for Ma and Pop and Willie . SAMUEL KAPLAN But do n't you know what he wants , this man ? ROSE MAURRANT Nobody gives you anything for nothing , Sam . If you do n't pay for things in one way , you do in another . SAMUEL KAPLAN Rose , for God 's sake , you must n't ! VINCENT JONES comes out of the house . ROSE MAURRANT seeing VINCENT in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from upstairs . She goes over to the left of the stoop . VINCENT JONES in the doorway.Hello , Rosie . Been here all night , talkin ' to the little yit ? ROSE does not answer . Turning to SAM . Hello , motzers ! Shake ! He leans over the balustrade and seizes SAM 'S hand in a crushing grip. p. 121 SAMUEL KAPLAN writhing with pain.Let me go ! ROSE MAURRANT Let him alone ! VINCENT gives SAM 'S hand another vicious squeeze and then releases him . SAM cowers back in the window , nursing his hand . VINCENT JONES waving his hand about in mock pain.Jesus , what a grip dat little kike 's got ! I 'd hate to get into a mix-up wit ' him . To ROSE . Got a date for tonight , kid ? ROSE MAURRANT Yes , I have . VINCENT JONES Yeah ? Gee , ai n't dat too bad . I 'll give you two dollars if you let me snap your garter . ROSE MAURRANT Shut up , you ! VINCENT laughs . SAM makes an inarticulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoid you say sumpin . He makes a threatening gesture . SAM shrinks back . With a loud laugh as he goes down the steps . Fightin ' Kaplan , de pride o ' Jerusalem ! He looks at them both , then laughs again . Fer cryin ' out loud ! He exits left . ROSE MAURRANT Oh , if there was only some way of getting out of here ! SAM puts the back of his hand to his forehead and turns away . I sometimes think I 'd just like to run away . p. 122 SAMUEL KAPLAN without turning.Yes ! ROSE MAURRANT Anywhere  --  it would n't matter where  --  just to get out of this . SAMUEL KAPLAN turning.Why should n't we do it ? ROSE MAURRANT rather startled , coming over to the right balus-trade.Would you go with me , Sam ? SAMUEL KAPLAN Yes  --  anywhere . ROSE MAURRANT I 've heard that people are much nicer and friendlier , when you get outside of New York . There 's not so much of a mad rush , other places . And being alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly . Only , what would you do , Sam ? SAMUEL KAPLAN I could get a job too . ROSE MAURRANT And give up your law work ? SAMUEL KAPLAN I 'd give up everything , to be with you . ROSE MAURRANT No . I would n't let you do that , Sam . It 's different with me  --   --  EASTER appears at the right . HARRY EASTER stopping at the right of the stoop.Good morning , Miss Maurrant . Startled , ROSE turns and sees him for the first time . p. 123 ROSE MAURRANT none too pleased.Oh , good morning , Mr. Easter . What brings you in this neighborhood ? HARRY EASTER not very plausibly.Well , I just happened to have a little business right around the corner . So , I thought as long as you were going to the funeral , we might just as well go together . ROSE MAURRANT Well , I hardly expected to see you around here . An awkward pause . Oh , I 'd like you to meet my friend , Mr. Kaplan . HARRY EASTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you . SAM murmurs something inaudible . An awkward silence . ROSE MAURRANT to SAM.Mr . Easter is the manager of the office . SAM does not reply . Another silence . To EASTER . It 's awful hot again , is n't it ? HARRY EASTER Worse than yesterday . Approaching the stoop . Tell you what I was thinking . I was thinking , that after the funeral , we might take a run down to the beach , somewhere , and cool off a little . ROSE MAURRANT I ca n't today . I 've got a lot of things I want to do . p. 124 HARRY EASTER Oh , you can do ' em some other day . ROSE MAURRANT No , really , I ca n't . Looking at her watch . Well , I guess it 's time we got started . She comes down the steps . HARRY EASTER Yes , it is . We 'll pick up a cab at the corner . MRS . MAURRANT appears at her window , looks out , and sees ROSE and EASTER . ROSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not far . HARRY EASTER Too hot , today , for any walking . ROSE MAURRANT starting to go toward the left.Not if you keep in the shade . HARRY EASTER Much more comfortable taking a cab . ROSE MAURRANT I 'd rather walk . HARRY EASTER Well , whatever you say . Good morning , Mr. Kaplan . Glad to have met you . SAM murmurs an inaudible reply . ROSE MAURRANT Good-by , Sam , I 'll see you later . SAM does not answer . ROSE and EASTER go toward the left in silence . SAM watches them intently , trembling with jealousy . MRS . MAURRANT , surprised and disturbed , watches ROSE and EASTER . To EASTER , as they disappear . It 's a lucky thing my father was n't around . SAM suddenly turns and goes into the room . MRS . MAURRANT remains at the window , looking out , with obvious expectancy . p. 125 A DISTANT VOICE offstage left.Straw-berries ! Straw-berries ! A MUSIC STUDENT , an anemic girl of eighteen , with a music roll under her arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushes one of the buttons in the vestibule , then goes to the entrance door and waits . A moment later MRS . FIORENTINO appears hastily at the window and whisks away the bedclothes . After another moment the latch clicks and the girl enters the house . THE VOICE a little nearer.Oh-h ! Straw-berries ! Straw-berries ! SANKEY appears at the right . He carries a pencil behind his ear , wears a round cap with a metal nameplate and a stiff visor , and carries a large black-covered bill holder . He and MRS . MAURRANT see each other and both become tense with excitement . MRS . MAURRANT beckons to him , and he comes over to the railing under her window . ANNA MAURRANT in a low , tense voice.Come up . STEVE SANKEY looking about , nervously.Now ? ANNA MAURRANT Yes . I got to talk to you . STEVE SANKEY Is it all right ? p. 126 ANNA MAURRANT Yes . He 's gone to Stamford . STEVE SANKEY How about later ? ANNA MAURRANT No . Rose 'll be home in a hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looks about again , then goes quickly toward the steps . SAM appears at the entrance door . He is about to step out when he sees SANKEY . He stops and looks at him . SANKEY sees SAM , hesitates a moment , then goes quickly into the house . Meanwhile MRS . MAURRANT has closed both windows and pulled down the shades . SAM takes a periodical out of the mailbox , then comes out of the house and down the steps . He looks up at the Maurrant windows , sees the drawn shades , and looks around in perturbed perplexity , not knowing what to do . At last , he sits down on the steps of the stoop , tears the wrapper off the periodical  --  The Nation  --  and begins to read . The girl in Lippo 's apartment begins playing the piano . This continues throughout the scene . Two untidy and rather coarse-looking men appear at the left and approach the stoop : JAMES HENRY , a city marshal , and FRED CULLEN , his assistant . They stop in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARSHALL JAMES HENRY crossing to the left of the stoop and taking a paper from his pocket.Dis is it . To SAM . Hildebrand live here ? p. 127 SAMUEL KAPLAN startled.What ? MARSHALL JAMES HENRY I 'm askin ' you if Hildebrand lives here . SAMUEL KAPLAN Yes . Fourth floor . MARSHALL JAMES HENRY Better give de janitor a buzz , Fred . FRED goes up the steps and rings the janitor 's bell , then leans over the left balustrade . FRED CULLEN bawling.Hey , janitor . CARL OLSEN below.Vell ? FRED CULLEN Come on out a minute . OLSEN appears below . We got a warrant for Hildebrand . CARL OLSEN Fourt ' floor  --  Hildebrand . FRED CULLEN Yeah , I know .

They enter the house . OLSEN leans his elbows on the coping and smokes his pipe . SAM sits on the steps , deep in troubled thought . A GROCERY BOY with a full basket appears at the right and goes down the cellar steps . MAE JONES comes out of the house . She stands on the top step , yawns noisily , and goes off at left . She and SAM do not pay the slightest attention to each other . A VOICE a little nearer.Straw-berries ! Straw-berries ! MRS . OLSEN comes up the cellar steps with a heavy pail of water . OLSEN leans forward to make room for her . She staggers over to the stoop almost dropping the pail , and goes up the steps into the vestibule . OLSEN yawns and goes down into the cellar . MRS . JONES appears at the window , her hair wet and stringy , a towel pinned about her shoulders , and leans out to dry her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kesh ko ! He wears a battered derby and carries a folded newspaper under his arm . MRS . OLSEN , on her knees , begins washing up the vestibule . FRED comes out of the house , carrying a worn chair and a large gilt-framed picture , which he deposits on the sidewalk , against the railing , to the left of the stoop . As if to someone across the street . Kesh ko ? To SAMAny ol ' klose , mister ? SAM pays no attention to him . FRED re-enters the house . To MRS . JONES . Any ol ' klose , leddy ? p. 129 EMMA JONES Naw , nawthin ' . AN OLD-CLOTHES MAN Hets ? Shoes ? Ol ' stockings ? EMMA JONES Nawthin ' , I tell you . As the OLD-CLOTHES MAN goes off at the right , MAURRANT appears , still carrying his satchel . Why , hello , Mr. Maurrant . MAURRANT looks up without replying and comes over to the stoop . I thought you was off to Stamford . FRANK MAURRANT I changed me  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks up at the drawn shades of his apartment . SAM rises , slowly and rigidly , his eyes glued in fascination upon MAURRANT . MAURRANT 'S movements take on a lithe and catlike quality . Then , slowly and deliberately , he goes toward the steps , his back arched , like a tiger ready to spring . SAMUEL KAPLAN suddenly blocking the steps.No ! No ! For God 's sake  --   --  ! FRANK MAURRANT raging.Out o ' me way , you goddam little rat ! He flings SAM violently aside , almost knocking him down . MRS . OLSEN , terrified , rises and shrinks into a corner as MAURRANT , with swift stealthiness , enters the house . MRS . JONES leans out to see what is wrong . SAM rushes down the steps and stands under the MAURRANT windows . The MARSHAL comes out of the house , carrying a wash boiler filled with pots . p. 130 SAMUEL KAPLAN hysterically.Mrs . Maurrant ! Mrs. Maurrant ! EMMA JONES What 's the matter ? The MARSHAL puts the wash boiler on the balustrade and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Run and tell her ! Quick ! EMMA JONES What is it ? Suddenly . Oh , Gawd , is he in there ? She leaves the window hastily . SAMUEL KAPLAN Yes ! Mrs. Maurrant ! Mrs. Maurrant ! A scream of terror is heard from the MAURRANT apartment . MRS . MAURRANT 'S VOICE Frank ! Frank ! Two shots are heard , in quick succession , and then a heavy fall . MRS . OLSEN runs out of the vestibule and down into the cellar . SANKEY 'S voice is heard , inarticulate with fear . Then one of the shades shoots up , and SANKEY appears at the window , coatless , his face deformed by terror . He tries to open the window but succeeds only in shattering the pane with his elbow . MAURRANT appears behind him and pulls him away from the window . Then another shot is heard . MARSHALL JAMES HENRY For Chris ' sake , what 's happenin ' ? Get an ambulance , you ! He pushes SAM toward the left , then hurries off at the right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLSEN comes up from the cellar , followed by the GROCERY BOY . The two WORKMEN come up out of the excavation . Two or three of the WORKMEN from the demolished building run on at the right . p. 131 A WORKMAN What 's happening ? THE MAN What is it ? A murder ? Still others join the crowd : a HUCKSTER , a JANITOR from a neighboring house , a MULATTO GIRL , six or eight WOMEN of the neighborhood , some in street dresses , others in housedresses or dingy wrappers . Lippo 's PUPIL appears at the window , badly frightened . The crowd surges about uncertainly , not knowing what has happened and buzzing with questions which nobody can answer . While the crowd is still forming FRED , the MARSHAL 'S assistant , appears at the broken window . FRED CULLEN excitedly.Grab dat boid ! He 's comin ' down ! A WORKMAN What boid ? THE MAN Here he is , now ! The crowd murmurs with excitement and surges about the stoop as the house door opens and MAURRANT appears . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shreds . His face , hands , and clothing are covered with blood . He stands in the doorway for a moment , surveying the crowd , his eyes glaring . FRED CULLEN Grab him ! Do n't let him get away ! As the crowd makes a concerted movement toward MAURRANT he whips out an automatic revolver and levels it . The crowd shrinks back . Some of the women scream . p. 132 FRANK MAURRANT Git back ! Git back , all o ' you ! The crowd falls back toward the left , to make way for him . With his back to the balustrade he comes quickly down the steps and , still leveling his revolver at the crowd , retreats backward to the cellar steps . A man , approaching at the right , comes stealthily up behind him , but MAURRANT senses his presence in time , wheels quickly , menaces the man with his revolver , then rushes down the cellar steps . While all this is happening the other shade in the Maurrant apartment flies up and MISS CUSHING opens the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance ! No one pays any attention to her as they are all watching MAURRANT . As MAURRANT runs down the cellar steps the crowd surges forward to the railing on both sides of the stoop and leans over . A scream from MRS . OLSEN is heard from the basement . FRED goes away from the window . Get an ambulance , some-body ! Unable to attract anyone 's attention , she leaves the window . CARL OLSEN Olga ! He hurries down the cellar steps . THE MAN calling.Here 's a cop ! The crowd looks to the right . Hey ! Hurry up ! A POLICEMAN runs on from the right . p. 133 POLICEMAN Where is he ? VOICES IN THE CROWD He 's down the cellar ! He ran down the cellar ! He went down the steps ! POLICEMAN Get out of the way ! The POLICEMAN and two men in the crowd go down the cellar steps . VOICES IN THE CROWD Watch yourself ! Look out , he 's got a gun !

Lippo 's PUPIL , her music roll under her arm , appears timidly in the doorway . MARSHALL JAMES HENRY grabbing her arm roughly.Where you goin ' ? A MUSIC STUDENT nervously.I 'm going home .

Come on , git back from dem steps ! Back now , all o ' youse ! He and the MARSHAL push the crowd back to the right of the stoop , leaving the steps and the sidewalk in front of them clear . Then he goes up the steps again. p. 140 MARSHALL JAMES HENRY What did he do ? Shoot two of ' em ? SECOND POLICEMAN I 'll say he did ! His wife an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead when I got up dere .

MARSHALL JAMES HENRY Hey , you ! Where you goin ' ? SAM ignores him and hurries on . A WOMAN Look ! There 's the Maurrant girl ! ANOTHER WOMAN Who ? A WOMAN It 's her daughter . The crowd murmurs excitedly as ROSE comes on quickly at the left . ROSE MAURRANT What 's the matter , Sam ? What 's the ambulance for ? Did anybody get hurt ? SAMUEL KAPLAN Go away , Rose . Go away . ROSE MAURRANT Who is it , Sam ? What 's the matter ? Is it my mother ? It 's not my mother , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 141 SAMUEL KAPLAN There 's been an accident . Go away , Rose . He tries to force her away . ROSE MAURRANT Tell me what 's happened ! Tell me ! AGNES CUSHING appearing at the window.They 're bringing her down ! ROSE MAURRANT with a cry.It is my mother ! AGNES CUSHING seeing her. Oh , my God , there 's Rose ! MRS . FIORENTINO , MRS . JONES , MRS . HILDEBRAND , LIPPO , and BUCHANAN crowd to the Maurrant windows . SAMUEL KAPLAN Rose ! Go away ! She pays no attention to him but stands watching the door , transfixed . The INTERN comes briskly out of the house . INTERN to the MARSHAL.Hold the door open , will you ? He comes down the steps . MARSHALL JAMES HENRY Sure , Doc ! He hurries into the vestibule . INTERN to the crowd.Keep back now ! ROSE MAURRANT seizing the INTERN 'S arm.Doctor ! Is she dead ? p. 142 INTERN Who are you ? Her daughter ? ROSE MAURRANT Yes , sir . I 'm her daughter . INTERN She 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the AMBULANCE DRIVER and the SECOND POLICEMAN come out of the house , carrying MRS .

ROSE MAURRANT running forward and gripping the side of the stretcher.Mother ! Mother ! ANNA MAURRANT opening her eyes feebly.Rose ! She tries to lift her hand , but it falls back . INTERN pulling ROSE back.You must n't talk to her now . SAM takes her around the shoulders . They and the INTERN follow the stretcher off at the left . The crowd swarms after them . FRED comes out of the house , carrying one end of an iron bedstead. @x Midafternoon of the same day . At the left of the stoop is a large roll of bedding . Before the rise of the curtain , and continuing faintly thereafter , a woman can be heard singing scales . OLSEN , pipe in mouth , is leaning against the railing . Two men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up the bedding.All right . Dat 's all , Charlie ! The men exit left . A POLICEMAN comes out of the house , carrying the bloodstained dress of MRS . MAURRANT and SANKEY 'S coat , cap , and bill holder . He comes down the steps and exits at the right . At the left two young NURSEMAIDS in smart uniforms appear , each wheeling a de luxe baby carriage . FIRST NURSEMAID seeing the house number.This must be the place , right here  --  three forty-six . They stop under the Maurrant windows . SECOND NURSEMAID Yes , I guess it is . FIRST NURSEMAID Yes , this is it , all right . Looking up . Must be right up there , on the first floor , see ? SECOND NURSEMAID Yes , sure . Excitedly . Say , look ! You can see where the glass is out of the window . That 's where this feller What's-his-name tried to climb out . p. 144 FIRST NURSEMAID Oh , yes , I see it ! Say , what do you know about that ! SECOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the baby buggy.Wait ! There 's a picture of it somewhere . Turning the pages . Here it is . They excitedly examine it together , as she reads . " Composograph showing Sankey , scantily clad , in a last vain attempt to escape the vengeance of the jealousy-crazed husband , whose home he had destroyed . " And there 's Maurrant pulling him back . And Mrs. Maurrant trying to get the pistol away from him , see ? Look at the blood running down her face , will you ? FIRST NURSEMAID It 's worse than awful ! Can you imagine what those two must have felt like , when he walked in on them like that ? SECOND NURSEMAID Well , he just happened to be one of the ones that finds out ! Believe me , there 's lots and lots of husbands that do n't know the half of what goes on uptown , while they 're downtown making a living . FIRST NURSEMAID Say , you 're not telling me , are you ? If I was to spill all I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if they caught him ? SECOND NURSEMAID as her baby begins a thin wailing.Oh , God , he 's in again ! To the unseen baby . Shut up a little while , ca n't you ? She shakes the carriage. p. 145 POLICEMAN appearing at the Maurrant windows , a tabloid in his hand.Keep movin ' , ladies . No loiterin ' aroun ' here . FIRST NURSEMAID eagerly.Say , have they caught him yet ? POLICEMAN Why , ai n't you hoid ? He was last seen flyin ' over Nova Scotia , on his way to Paris . FIRST NURSEMAID Who are you trying to string anyhow ? SECOND NURSEMAID coquettishly.Say , will you let us come up and look around ? POLICEMAN Why , sure , sure ! Bring de babies too . De commissioner is soivin ' tea up here at four-thoity . SECOND NURSEMAID You 're awful smart , are n't you ? POLICEMAN Yeah , dat 's why dey put me on de entertainment committee .

Clarice darling would throw a duck fit if she knew I brought her precious Dumplings to a neighborhood like this . SECOND NURSEMAID turning her carriage.There 's not so much to see anyhow . It 's nothing but a cheap , common dump . They go toward the left. p. 146 POLICEMAN Over de river , goils . See you in de funny paper . SECOND NURSEMAID Do n't you get so fresh . POLICEMAN Drop in again when you 're in de neighbor-hood . An ' tell Mrs. Vanderbilt Harry was askin ' for her . As the NURSEMAIDS go off at the left , EASTER hurries on at the right , several folded newspapers under his arm . HARRY EASTER to the Policeman , going to the left of the stoop.Is Miss Maurrant up there , Officer ? POLICEMAN No . There ai n't nobody up here but me . HARRY EASTER You do n't happen to know where she is , do you ? POLICEMAN No , I do n't . Are you a reporter ? HARRY EASTER Who , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to see her . POLICEMAN Well , I ai n't seen her since she went off to the horspital this mornin ' . She ai n't been back since . He starts to leave the window . HARRY EASTER Oh , Officer ! POLICEMAN Yeah ? HARRY EASTER Have they caught him yet ? p. 147 POLICEMAN Naw , not yet . But we 'll get ' im all right ! He leaves the window . EASTER remains at the left of the stoop , uncertain whether to go or not . MRS . JONES appears at the right , carrying several newspapers . EMMA JONES to OLSEN.Have they caught him yet ? CARL OLSEN shaking his head. No . EMMA JONES I been down at Police Headquarters all this while  --   --  Breaking off , as she notices EASTER . Say , what 's he want here ? OLSEN shrugs his shoulders . HARRY EASTER approaching them.Pardon me , but maybe you can tell me where I can find Miss Maurrant ? OLSEN shakes his head . EMMA JONES Why , no , I ca n't . I jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's aroun ' at the horspital . HARRY EASTER No , I just came from there . EMMA JONES Well , I really could n't say where she is . Was there somethin ' special you wanted to see her about ? HARRY EASTER I 'm a friend of hers  --   --  p. 148 EMMA JONES Yeah , I noticed you talkin ' to her , last night , when I took the dog out . Staring at him . Well , I guess she 'll need all the friends she 's got now . Imagine a thing like that happenin ' right here in this house , at ten o'clock in the mornin ' ! Everythin ' goin ' on just as usual , and then , all of a sudden , before you know it , there 's two people murdered . CARL OLSEN I tal everybody someday he kill her . EMMA JONES Well , I ai n't sayin ' it 's right to kill anybody , but if anybody had a reason , he certainly had . You ought a heard some o ' the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel myself gettin ' redder an ' redder . " Say , " I says , " how do you expect me to know things like that ? " Suddenly , as she looks left . Here 's Rose now ! HARRY EASTER Where ? He turns quickly and hurries to the left as ROSE appears , carrying four or five packages . EMMA JONES to OLSEN.He seems to take a pretty friendly interest in her . OLSEN nods . ROSE MAURRANT anxiously , as she comes up to EASTER at the left of the stoop.Have they caught him yet ? p. 149 HARRY EASTER Why , no , they have n't . I just asked the officer upstairs . ROSE MAURRANT Oh , I hope he got away ! If they get him , there 's no telling what they 'll do to him . And what would be the good of that ? He never would have done it if he 'd been in his right mind . HARRY EASTER I only heard about it a little while ago . So I went right around to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURRANT going to the steps.She never opened her eyes again . They did everything they could for her , but it did n't help . HARRY EASTER Here , let me take your bundles . ROSE MAURRANT No , it 's all right . I think I 'll just sit down for a minute . She sits on the stoop and puts the packages beside her . HARRY EASTER Ca n't I get you something ? A drink or some-thing ? ROSE MAURRANT No , I 'm all right . It 's so hot . She puts her hand to her head . And all those people asking me a lot of questions . EMMA JONES approaching the stoop.Are you feelin ' dizzy or anythin ' ? ROSE MAURRANT No , I 'll be all right in a minute . p. 150 EMMA JONES Well , I was gon na say , if you want to go up to my flat an ' lay down for a minute  --   --  ROSE MAURRANT No , thanks ; I do n't want to lie down . I 've got to go upstairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't want to go up there ! ROSE MAURRANT I 've got to ; there 's some things I need . HARRY EASTER Well , let me get them for you . Or this lady here . EMMA JONES Yeah , sure . The place is a sight up there . You 're li'ble to go into a faint or somethin ' . ROSE MAURRANT I guess nothing can be any worse than what 's happened already . Indicating the bundles . I got to change my dress . I bought a white dress for her . And white silk stockings . I want her to look pretty . EMMA JONES Yeah , white is the nicest . ROSE MAURRANT She looks so quiet and natural . You 'd think she was asleep . EMMA JONES It was the same way with my mother . You 'd of thought she was gon na get up the next minute . Starting to go up the steps . Well , I got ta go up an ' get me some lunch . Between everythin ' happenin ' an ' goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't had a bite to eat since breakfast . Stopping on the top step and looking from ROSE to EASTER . Well , you certainly never know , when you get up in the mornin ' , what the day is gon na bring . She enters the house. p. 151 ROSE MAURRANT rising. Well , I 'd better be going up too . There 's a lot of things to attend to . HARRY EASTER You better let me come up with you . ROSE MAURRANT Why , thanks , Mr. Easter . But I 'd rather go alone , if you do n't mind . HARRY EASTER But , listen here  --  you ca n't go through all this alone  --  a kid like you . That 's why I came around . I knew you 'd be needing a helping hand . ROSE MAURRANT That 's awfully nice of you , Mr. Easter . But I do n't need any help , honest I do n't . She opens one of the packages . HARRY EASTER Why , you ca n't handle everything yourself ! What about a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosette of black crape out of the package.Well , I do n't exactly know yet . I 'll have to find some place where Willie and I can live . I 'd like it to be some place where he would n't be running around the streets all the time . You see , there 's nobody but me to look out for him now . OLSEN crosses to the cellar . MRS . JONES appears at her window and furtively peeps out at ROSE and EASTER . As ROSE sees that OLSEN is about to descend the cellar steps . Oh , Mr. Olsen ! p. 152 CARL OLSEN stopping.Yes , ma'am . ROSE MAURRANT Would you mind lending me a hammer and some tacks ? I want to put up this crape . CARL OLSEN Yes , ma'am ; I bring ' em right away . He goes down into the cellar . MRS . JONES leaves the window . HARRY EASTER insistently.But why wo n't you let me help you out ? ROSE MAURRANT It 's terribly nice of you , Mr. Easter . But I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't as if I was n't young and strong and able to take care of myself . But as it is , I 'd sort of rather not be under obligations . HARRY EASTER Why , you would n't be under any obligations . I just mean it in a friendly way , that 's all . ROSE MAURRANT You 've been very nice to me and all that , Mr. Easter . But  --  well , I 've been sort of thinking things over  --  you know , about what we talked about last night and all . And I honestly do n't think I 'd care about going on the stage . HARRY EASTER Say , you 've got me all wrong , Rose ! Just forget all about that , will you ? I just want to help you out , that 's all . Taking a step toward her . I think you 're one swell kid , and I want to do something for you . I 'm not trying to put anything over on you . SHIRLEY appears at the left , carrying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURRANT Well , that 's nice and friendly of you , Mr. Easter . And if I ever do need any help  --   --  SHIRLEY KAPLAN catching sight of ROSE.Rose ! You poor thing ! She runs up to ROSE and throws her arms around her . It 's terrible  --  terrible ! ROSE MAURRANT Yes , it is . But I sort of had a feeling , all along , that something terrible was going to happen . OLSEN comes up the steps with a hammer and a box of tacks . SHIRLEY KAPLAN How could he do such a thing ! I could n't believe it when I read it . ROSE MAURRANT He was out of his mind when he did it . Oh , I only hope he got away ! As OLSEN approaches . Oh , thanks , Mr. Olsen . CARL OLSEN I do it . ROSE MAURRANT giving him the crape.Oh , would you , please ? Right up there , I think . She indicates the left of the door-way . CARL OLSEN going up the steps.Sure . ROSE MAURRANT going to EASTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know when I 'll be able to get back to the office . p. 154 HARRY EASTER Why , that 's all right about that . Only , in the meantime , I wish  --   --  ROSE MAURRANT If I need any help , I 'll let you know . With a tone of finality in her voice . Good-by . HARRY EASTER All right ; but do n't forget . He hesitates , then decides to go . Well , good-by . He exits at left . ROSE MAURRANT I 've got to go up and get some things that Willie and I need . Sam went to call for him at school and take him around to my aunt 's . You see I did n't want him coming back here . He 's only a little kid , after all . SHIRLEY KAPLAN Oh , it 's such a terrible thing ! I ca n't believe it yet . CARL OLSEN holding up the crape.Dis vay ? ROSE MAURRANT Yes , like that . Hesitantly , as she picks up her bundles . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess . But I 'm kind of afraid to go up there alone . I wonder if you 'd mind coming up with me . OLSEN tacks up the crape . SHIRLEY KAPLAN Anything I can do for you , poor child ! She and ROSE go up the steps. p. 155 ROSE MAURRANT Thanks ever so much . To OLSEN . Thanks , Mr. Olsen . It 's awfully nice of you . She and SHIRLEY enter the house . OLSEN exits down the cellar steps . KAPLAN appears at his window and , seating himself , begins to read a newspaper . An undersized man and a tall , athletic woman appear at the right . They are dressed for tennis and carry tennis rackets . THE MAN as they cross.He would say that . A WOMAN So I just looked at him for a moment , without saying anything . And then I said , " My dear boy , " I said . " What do you expect anyhow , in this day and age ? " I said , " Why even Frankl has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE MAN as they disappear at the left.Exactly ! And what did he say to that ? BUCHANAN comes out of the house and , seeing KAPLAN at the window , stops at the right balustrade . DANIEL BUCHANAN Well , there 's been some excitement around here today . ABRAHAM KAPLAN looking up from his paper.Dees is a terrible t'ing vich he s heppened . DANIEL BUCHANAN I 'll say it is ! You know , the way I look at it , he did n't have a right to kill the both of them like that . Of course I 'm not saying what she did was right either . p. 156 ABRAHAM KAPLAN How ken ve call ourselves ciwilized , ven ve see thet sax jealousy he s de power to avaken in us de primitive pessions of de sevege ? DANIEL BUCHANAN rather bewildered by this.Yes , that 's true too . Of course , you ca n't expect a man to stand by and see his home broken up . But murdering them , like that , is going a little too far . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing 's given my wife a kind of a relapse . She thought a lot of Mrs. Maurrant . He goes down the steps and off at the left as LIPPO appears at the right . FILIPPO FIORENTINO stopping in front of KAPLAN 'S window.Dey don ' ketcha Maurrant , ha ? ABRAHAM KAPLAN I hev n't hoid anyt'ing foider . FILIPPO FIORENTINO He'sa gon na gat da ' lectrica-chair , ha ? ABRAHAM KAPLAN De blood lust of our enlightened population must be setisfied ! De Chreestian state vill kerry out to de last letter de Mosaic law . FILIPPO FIORENTINO Eef Ahm ketcha my wife sleepin ' wit ' ' nudder man , Ahm gon na keela ' er too . SAM hurries on at the left . ABRAHAM KAPLAN So you t'ink thet merriage should give to de hosband de power of life and det ' and thet  --   --  p. 157 SAMUEL KAPLAN going up the steps.Papa , is there any news of Maurrant ? ABRAHAM KAPLAN I hev heard notting . SAMUEL KAPLAN The police are going to make me testify against him . What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notting . SAMUEL KAPLAN How can I send a man to the electric chair ? How can I ? I tried to stop him , Papa . I tried to warn her  --   --  He stops short as several shots are heard offstage at the left . What 's that ? FILIPPO FIORENTINO excitedly.Dey finda ' im ! He runs off at the left , followed by SAM . KAPLAN leans out of the window . At the same moment MRS . JONES leans out of her window and , a moment later , MRS . FIORENTINO out of hers . In the Maurrant apartment the POLICEMAN leans out and ROSE and SHIRLEY appear in the hall-bedroom window . ROSE is wearing a mourning dress . OLSEN comes up the cellar steps and runs off at the left . MRS . OLSEN comes up the steps . Several men and women appear at the right and run off at the left . ROSE MAURRANT agitatedly.Is that him ? p. 158 POLICEMAN Must be ! Voices are heard shouting in the distance , and then another shot . The POLICEMAN leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shoot him , would they ? She leaves the window . SHIRLEY KAPLAN following her.Rose ! Two or three more persons appear at the right and run off at the left . The POLICEMAN runs out of the house as BUCHANAN appears at the left . DANIEL BUCHANAN excitedly.They got him ! The POLICEMAN runs off at the left . SHIRLEY reappears at the Maurrant window . EMMA JONES calling.Have they got him ? DANIEL BUCHANAN Yes ! He was hiding in the furnace , down at three twenty-two . As ROSE comes out of the house . They found him , Miss Maurrant ! ROSE MAURRANT her hand to her heart.Oh ! Is he hurt ? DANIEL BUCHANAN I do n't know . He fired at the cops and they fired back at him . I was just passing the house when it happened . p. 159 EMMA JONES leaning far out.Here they come ! She leaves the window . The low murmur of the approaching crowd can be heard offstage left . ROSE MAURRANT Where ? She comes down the stoop and looks off , at the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GRETA FIORENTINO You better come inside . SHIRLEY KAPLAN Come up , Rose . DANIEL BUCHANAN Yes , you better . He takes her by the arm . ROSE MAURRANT resisting.No . No . Please let me alone . I want to see him . She leans against the railing . Meanwhile the murmur and tramp of the approaching crowd has grown nearer and nearer . GRETA FIORENTINO Look at him , vill you ! MISS CUSHING comes out of the house and stands on the stoop , followed a moment later by MRS . JONES . MAURRANT appears at the left , between two POLICEMEN . Behind him a third POLICEMAN holds back a swarming crowd , which includes SAM and LIPPO . MAURRANT 'S clothes are torn , and his right arm is in a crude sling . Sweat , blood , and grime have made him almost unrecognizable . The POLICEMEN too show evidences of a struggle . p. 160 ROSE MAURRANT running forward.Pop ! Are you hurt ? FRANK MAURRANT seeing her for the first time.Rose ! POLICEMAN to whom MAURRANT is manacled.Keep back , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sake , boys , lemme talk to me daughter ! Maybe I 'll never be seein ' her again ! SECOND POLICEMAN Give ' im a woid wit ' her . He is the officer who was on duty in the Maurrant apartment . POLICEMAN after a moment 's hesitation.Well , all right . Savagely to MAURRANT . But do n't try to pull nothin ' , hear ? There is a forward movement in the crowd . SECOND POLICEMAN to the crowd.Keep back , youse ! FRANK MAURRANT Rose ! You 're wearin ' a black dress , Rose ! ROSE MAURRANT Oh , Pop , why did you do it ? Why did you ? FRANK MAURRANT I must o ' been out o ' me head , Rose . Did she say anythin ' ? ROSE MAURRANT She never opened her eyes again . p. 161 FRANK MAURRANT I 'd been drinkin ' , Rose  --  see what I mean ?  --  an ' all the talk that was goin ' around . I just went clean off me nut , that 's all . ROSE MAURRANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURRANT It 's the chair for me , I guess . But I do n't care  --  let ' em give me the chair . I deserve it all right . But it 's her I 'm thinkin ' of , Rose  --  the way she looked at me . I ought n't to done it , Rose . ROSE MAURRANT She was always so good and sweet . FRANK MAURRANT Do n't I know it ? I ai n't no murderer  --  you ought to be the one to know that , Rose . I just went out o ' me head , that 's all it was . POLICEMAN All right , that 's all now . Come on ! FRANK MAURRANT Gim me a minute , ca n't you ? She 's me daughter . Gim me a chance , ca n't you ? What 's gon na happen to you , Rose ? ROSE MAURRANT I 'll be all right , Pop . You do n't need to worry about me . FRANK MAURRANT I ai n't been a very good father , have I ? ROSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURRANT It ai n't that I ai n't meant to be . It 's just the way things happened to turn out , that 's all . Keep your eye on Willie , Rose . Do n't let Willie grow up to be a murderer , like his Pop . p. 162 ROSE MAURRANT I 'm going to do all I can for him , Pop . FRANK MAURRANT You 're a good girl , Rose . You was always a good girl . ROSE MAURRANT breaking down.Oh , Pop ! She throws her arms around his neck and buries her head against him . MAURRANT sobs hoarsely . SECOND POLICEMAN gently.Come on , now , Miss . He and SAM take ROSE away from MAURRANT . POLICEMAN All right . Come on , Charlie . They go toward the right , the crowd swarming behind them . Straggling along at the very end of the crowd is an unkempt woman wheeling a ramshackle baby carriage . MRS . JONES and MISS CUSHING fall in with the crowd . ROSE gradually recovers her self-control and stands at the stoop with SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . Then KAPLAN and MRS . FIORENTINO leave their windows . The SECOND POLICEMAN enters the house , followed by LIPPO . MRS . OLSEN goes to the cellar . SHIRLEY looks down at ROSE and SAM for a moment , then abruptly leaves the window . SAMUEL KAPLAN taking ROSE by the arm.Rose , you better come inside . p. 163 ROSE MAURRANT No , I 'm all right again , Sam  --  honestly I am . Trying to regain her self-composure . What about Willie , Sam ? SAMUEL KAPLAN I told him an accident had happened . ROSE MAURRANT It 's better to break it to him that way . But I 'll have to tell him , I guess . He 'd only find it out himself , tomorrow , with the papers all full of it . I saw Mrs. Sankey down at Police Headquarters . It 's terrible for her , with her two little children . SHIRLEY KAPLAN appearing at the Maurrant window , a covered pot in her hand.Rose ! ROSE MAURRANT looking up.Yes , Miss Kaplan ? SHIRLEY KAPLAN There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . ROSE MAURRANT A chicken ? SHIRLEY KAPLAN Yes . The policeman says he smelled it cooking this morning , so he turned out the gas . ROSE MAURRANT Oh , I remember now . My mother said she was going to make some soup for poor Mrs. Buchanan upstairs . SHIRLEY KAPLAN It wo n't keep long , in this weather . ROSE MAURRANT No . I really think Mrs. Buchanan ought to have the good of it . p. 164 SHIRLEY KAPLAN All right . I 'll take it up to her . ROSE MAURRANT Thanks ever so much , Miss Kaplan . SHIRLEY leaves the window . It 's only a few hours ago that she was standing right here , telling me about the chicken . And then she went upstairs , and the next I saw of her , they were carrying her out . Abruptly , as she starts to go up the steps . Well , I 've got to go up and get my things . SAMUEL KAPLAN I must talk to you ! What are you going to do , Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time to do much thinking . But I really think the best thing I could do would be to get out of New York . You know , like we were saying , this morning  --  how things might be different if you only had a chance to breathe and spread out a little . Only when I said it , I never dreamed it would be this way . SAMUEL KAPLAN If you go , I 'll go with you . ROSE MAURRANT But , Sam dear  --   --  SAMUEL KAPLAN I do n't care anything about my career . It 's you  --  you  --  I care about . Do you think I can stay here , stifling to death in this slum , and never seeing you ? Do you think my life means anything to me without you ? p. 165 ROSE MAURRANT But , Sam , we 've got to be practical about it . How would we manage ? SAMUEL KAPLAN I do n't care what I do . I 'll be a day laborer ; I 'll dig sewers  --  anything . Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave me ! ROSE MAURRANT I like you so much , Sam . I like you better than anybody I know . SAMUEL KAPLAN I love you , Rose . Let me go with you ! ROSE MAURRANT It would be so nice to be with you . You 're different from anybody I know . But I 'm just wondering how it would work out . SAMUEL KAPLAN If we have each other , that 's the vital thing , is n't it ? What else matters but that ? ROSE MAURRANT Lots of things , Sam . There 's lots of things to be considered . Suppose something was to happen  --  well , suppose I was to have a baby , say . That sometimes happens even when you do n't want it to . What would we do then ? We 'd be tied down then , for life , just like all the other people around here . They all start out loving each other and thinking that everything is going to be fine  --  and before you know it , they find out they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over again  --  only it 's too late . p. 166 SAMUEL KAPLAN It 's to escape all that , that we must be together . It 's only because we love each other , and belong to each other , that we can find the strength to escape . ROSE MAURRANT shaking her head. No , Sam . SAMUEL KAPLAN Why do you say no ? ROSE MAURRANT It 's what you said just now  --  about people belonging to each other . I do n't think people ought to belong to anybody but themselves . I was thinking , that if my mother had really belonged to herself , and that if my father had really belonged to himself , it never would have happened . It was only because they were always depending on somebody else , for what they ought to have had inside themselves . Do you see what I mean , Sam ? That 's why I do n't want to belong to anybody , and why I do n't want anybody to belong to me . SAMUEL KAPLAN You want to go through life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you ? ROSE MAURRANT Why , of course not , Sam ! I want love more than anything else in the world . But loving and belonging are n't the same thing . Putting her arms around him . Sam dear , listen . If we say good-by now , it does n't mean that it has to be forever . Maybe someday , when we 're older and wiser , things will be different . Do n't look as if it was the end of the world , Sam ! p. 167 SAMUEL KAPLAN It is the end of my world . ROSE MAURRANT It is n't , Sam ! If you 'd only believe in yourself a little more , things would n't look nearly so bad . Because once you 're sure of yourself , the things that happen to you are n't so important . The way I look at it , it 's not what you do that matters so much ; it 's what you are . Warmly . I 'm so fond of you , Sam . And I 've got such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice kiss ! SAM takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately . A gawky GIRL of seventeen , one of LIPPO 'S pupils , appears at the left and looks at them , scandalized . Then she goes into the vestibule and rings the bell . The door clicks and she enters the house as SHIRLEY comes out , carrying a wicker suitcase . SHIRLEY looks at SAM and ROSE . To SHIRLEY .
