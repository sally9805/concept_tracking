Zfie Ne70 REPUBLIC A Journal of Opinion VOLUME XXIX NEW YORK , WEDNESDAY , DECEMBER 14 , 1921 NUMBER 367 The Week TEN million Russians will die before spring un- d : less help is sent to them . What is America ? tng about it ? The Friends are feeding a few h undred thousand . The Relief Administration bwas feeding 207,000 children in Russia on Novem- r Ist , 500,000 on November 20th , 750,000 on December 1st , and expects to be feeding a million it New Year 's Day . With its present resources , dr cannotplan ' to feed more than 1,200,000 chil- of " ' for the first eight months of 1922 , at a cost epro b ? ut $12,000,000 . Such a schedule fails to oide for at least a million children , and of rou , rse leaves out older people altogether . What 's su be done ? From Moscow Mr. Lyman Brown vggears a government loan to Russia of $50,000 , - this u With all our hearts we ought to welcome iis pi and anything u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it convicts America of the ? ssest cruelty . tr th ? ls reported in the Times of December 2nd 1 : ; , . . he electric light and power company of ' Neill , Nebraska has begun to burn corn . The plant is one of some importance and should help materially to relieve the local market of its surplus corn . That is good business for the farmers and for the power company . Good business ; but on the other side of the world there are ten million people apparently doomed to die of starvation in the next one hundred and fifty days . That is sixty-six thousand a day , if our minds shrink before aggregates . A ton of corn would suffice to save ten lives . The mature citizen of O'Neill may be reminded , as he turns on his light , of a historical romance popular in his youth which described an antique feast illuminated by the torch light from blazing mummies . His light is even more exquisite : the life-light of ten Russians dying for want of each ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudder a moment , but then the thought will sink from his mind as he unfolds his newspaper or opens his book under the pleasant white light , odorless , unstained . What can he do about it ? Not his will , but the collective will of America , could save those ten million lives . Not he , but collective America , will presently reply to the voice that comes menacingly out of the void : " Am I my Russian brother 's keeper ? " IT is impossible to escape the conclusion that the Interborough directors have in the past been scandalously lavish in their dividend policies , and that no small part of the present embarrassment of the company is due to the fact that funds which should have gone into reserves were dissipated . In the same way much of the present distress of the railway companies is attributable to reckless and wasteful financiering in years gone by . But recognition of this fact will not help us directly to improvements in subway and railway traffic . It will help us indirectly if it forces us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enterprises whose returns are subject to strict public regulation . Private finance lives by its flexibility . Policies that appear wasteful , such as the payment of dangerously large dividends , may be pursued by even conservative and disinterested directors , who see in them an essential means of strengthening corporation credit in preparation for further operations . Public regulation frowns upon such policies , and subordinates considerations of immediate credit in the financial markets to the principle of adequate service at fair charges . There is an inevitable contradiction here , and the result of it is that the public is neither supplied with adequate facilities nor protected against exploitation . Sooner or later it will be driven to the conclusion that either regulation of returns or private financing will have to be eliminated . As the former alternative is politically impracticable , it can only be a question of time when the financing of public services will pass over to the field of government . PROBABLY the ugliest question which still remains to be decided with respect to naval armament concerns the future of the submarine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 12th assumed that submarines with the possible exception of the " cruiser " type were essentially a defensive weapon and that a comparatively large number of them in the hands of any one power could not be used for aggressive purposes . The British have submitted weighty objections to this contention . There is no trustworthy distinction between cruiser and other submarines . Both could be adapted to long voyages and to commerce destroying activities . If they are in existence when the next war breaks out , the government which possesses them will follow the German precedent , particularly if it is fighting a power stronger than itself in capital ships . This contention is probably true . There is much , consequently , to be said in favor of the total abolition of the submarine . If that is impossible , arrangements should be made to limit their numbers as carefully as the number of the battleships are limited . We hope that the American government will modify its original program in this respect . BRITISH opinion appears to ' be moving rapidly toward a recognition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Mr. Grasty , there is a definite opinion among the experts , and that is that the 82,000,000,000 gold marks in class C bonds should be cancelled . Of course they should be cancelled . The Class A and Class B bonds in themselves exceed Germany 's reasonable capacity to pay . They exceed any fair calculation of what Germany bound herself to pay under the pre-armistice agreement . The Class C // bonds have no financial standing . They serve no other end than to keep alive the memory of the dishonor of the victors in welching on a pledge they made in order to escape the losses that would have had to be incurred if the war had been fought to the poipt of unconditional surrender . Those bonds are a great black spot on the record of Allied integrity , and the sooner the spot is expunged , the better . But there is an essential preliminary to such action . That is the repudiation of the item " pensions and separation allowances , " whose inclusion in the bill against Germany pro- duced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerical expression . Confining indemnification to damages inflicted upon the civil population of the Allied countries and their property , as definitely provided in the pre-armistice agreement , would throw to France a larger share of the indemnity that can be paid . Will British opinion accept such a readjustment ? That is the final test of its sincerity . MR . CHARLES GRASTY , in a despatch to the Times of December 2nd , declares that " it mg be stated as a fact that at the time of the London protocol the best opinion among reparations ex perts was that 130,000,000,000 gold marks and 26 percent on exports were beyond German capacity ? but it was wise for Germany to accept under the conditions proposed . " Another instance of " nod it can be told " journalism . We have the highest respect for Mr. Grasty 's ability to get at the real opinions of men , however well blanketed with talk for publication . He must have been aware at th ; time that the terms Germany was advised to accept " under the conditions proposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were regarded as impossible by evert one who knew anything about the matter . nut we search his despatches of that time in vain fc't any indication that he knew it . In fairness to his readers Mr. Grasty ought to invent a cryptO gram which would tell them when he is speakil his mind and when he is tempering the wind of his words to their shorn condition . ON another page of this issue Professor Davla Friday arrives , by a series of startling calculations ' at the conclusion that the , capital accumulation ll the people of the United States for this year amount to more than eight billion dollars . Fr ? this fact , which for most people will be an arna0 ! revelation , and a complete reversal of whatthe 0 : . had believed , the deduction is inevitable that , 9 were as our industrial depression has been , far fr ? d wasting capital it has permitted accumulation at% investment on an enormous scale . It now appear December 14 , 1921 THE NEW that taxes , which were usually blamed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dam this huge flow of investment . What can now be the answer of those who have been incessantly complaining that until the tax burden Were made lighter no surplus could be accumulated en which to start business going again ? Yet such a view has been common . For instance , in the World we find Mr. Frederick Todd , Secretary of the First Federal Foreign Banking Association , asserting that " The amount that the Government take in the form of direct taxation this year la twice the amount which has been carefully estikated as the total of personal savings of the People of the whole country . " Which amount he Places at $1,600,000,000 . We refer Mr. Todd , With the myth that taxation has crushed capital and discouraged savings , to Professor Friday and his $8,000,000,000 total . THE arrest of Mrs. Juliet Barrett Rublee for her part in the Birth Control meeting of several weeks ago adds another chapter to the story of the New York City administration 's useless high-handedness . Even though the official who originally t'tdered Mrs. Rublee 's arrest later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tnediately dismissed in court , the fact remains that a stupid outrage was committed . What redress has the victim of such false arrest ? Very little . A suit for damages would not come up kyr trial for a year or more , and at best would result in the award of a few dollars . No sense of decency seems to restrain the police from arbitrary arrests , and the law as it exists is too feeble to et as a deterrent . Obviously one remedy is legislation providing swifter justice and a greater Penalty for false arrest . Here is a matter which well worth investigation by the New York Bar elation . FAMINE is the immediate source of Russia 's present sufferings , and it is natural and proper that the first effort of American philanthropy should be devoted to feeding the starving . But we should Ilvr forget that a pestilence of infectious diseases a ; , waYs follows in the wake of famine , to complete ( 41 baleful work , and extend it far beyond its Rnial field . The Hoover organization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other agencies such as that of the Friends able to handle 4s 0re than a fraction , of the work of medical relief . An organization recently formed in New York . quer the name " Medical Unit for Service in Rus-$e ) ( Room 303 , 110 West 4oth Street ) offers Americans who are alive to the horrors of epidemic disease an opportunity to give immediate help . The Unit is endorsed by the Russian Red Cross and by the Friends of Soviet Russia , and has already received assurances from the Soviet government that its services will be welcomed . It will take to Russia a completely equipped field hospital , ambulance , sterilizers for controlling the spread of typhus , all necessary medicines , together with food supplies sufficient for its own personnel and for the patients who come under its care . The Friends of Soviet Russia have pledged food to the amount of $5o,000 , and large donations of drugs and apparatus have also been pledged . The Unit needs money , however , and friends of humanity will search far for a better investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working out as was to have been expected . The quotas of Greece , Spain , Jugoslavia , Palestine , Turkey , Syria and Smyrna are already exhausted . This means that no more immigrants from these countries will be admitted until July I , 1922 . It also means that , as in the past since the passage of the law , hundreds of people will arrive here only to find that they can not enter , and must either be deported or admitted under some arrangement which virtually evades the law . The facilities for receiving immigrants at our ports of entry will have to undergo periods of congestion alternating with slack periods when a number of quotas are simultaneously exhausted . We must expect a tremendous rush the first of next July , with the familiar spectacle of immigrant laden ships racing bow to bow for Ellis Island . THE Loyal Coalition and the American Legion have clashed . The Loyal Coalition had hung over its headquarters near the State House in Boston the American flag of 1777 , which is made up of the thirteen stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross of the Union Jack . The American Legion refused to accept this symbol of the 1777 brand of loyalty . " The flag was not taken down , " declares the Coalition proudly , " although to save argument it was placed upon another pole . " The whole occurrence , from one point of view , reflects credit on all participants . First , the Legion , with commendable self restraint , called on the police to make or execute whatever law was necessary to the situation . Then , although one of the Legion so far forgot himself as to suggest that the flag " be thrown into the cellar , " the Coalition instead of mixing with him then and there took advertising space in the Sunday papers to characterize his remark as " a gross insult to the flag of Washington and the first flag of the United States " ( sic ) , and to " venture the suggestion that the American Legion in this locality under the present leadership , has something to learn not only about flags but about what they stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope the Loyal Coalition will continue its instruction of the American Legion with those amenities on both sides which remind one how far ahead of Centralia is Boston . FOR the first time in the history of the law , a labor union has successfully invoked the conspiracy law against employers . The International Ladies Garment Workers have secured an injunction restraining the manufacturers ' association from any action that might violate the agreement effective between the two parties until June I , 1922 . This law has frequently been resorted to by employers against their labor , and its one-sided use in the past has given the unions some ground for their denunciations of " one-way " law . It is quite likely , however , that in legally skillful hands the law can be made to function against both sides . When its other edge has been sharpened , so that it cuts both ways , this particular law will be finally recognized as the impracticable and ineffective instrument it has in fact always been . AS a feat of human engineering the negotiations between Mr. Lloyd George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve to stand among the masterpieces . The latest news gives fresh hopes that the bridge projected last July , which for five months has hung wavering in the air , may at last find anchorage on the farther bank . Two chasms have to be crossed without a placement between them ? sovereignty and unity . The spanning of both has to be done simultaneously . The Irish representatives , in view of past deceptions , can not surrender sovereignty without being assured of unity , and this assurance Grealt Britain can not give except by withdrawing the separate parliament already granted to N. E. Ulster . It is now officially announced that the representatives of the British Parliament and of Dail Eireann have reached an agreement , the terms of which have been communicated to Sir James Craig . One forecast of the terms is that the Irish will owe allegiance to a free state which is to hold membership in the empire , and that N. E. Ulster is to join this Irish state with power to contract out after a certain time . Protestant Ulster is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be clear . But even if Sir James Craig 's veto still runs , the agreement of the Dail with the British Cabinet affords good hope that the structure of Irish settlement can be preserved , even in its suspension ; and in that case the yielding of N. E. Ulster is again a question of time . A DISPATCH to the World from Lahore , India , brings news of the arrest of Lajpa ; t Rai , president of the Indian National Congress . This action following the arrest , trial , and imprisonment in October of the Ali brothers and Dr. Kitchlew , the leaders of the Khilafat movement , indicates that the British rulers of India are now meeting with force the Non-Cooperative Movement of peaceful revolution . This was to be expected . The representatives of any imperial power are sure in the long run to become exasperated or frightened by continued passive resistance , and prefer to meet their opponents in the open . The visit of the Prince of Wales at this time naturally increases the sense of irritation and of responsibility on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders of the non-cooperators , however , is a pc ' culiar provocation to the mass of followers , and further deprives this mass of an influence which so far has stood for non-violence . The situation of India drifts day by day toward a catastrophe the magnitude of which is beyond conjecture .
