Vitally important is the synthesizing of hematin , the red iron core which carries oxygen into the blood . Hans Fischer , 47 , of the Munich ( Germany ) Institute of Technology worked on the problem 17 years and , last week , reported success . His synthetic he calls Hematine . In normal breathing , the blood 's hemoglobin , which includes hemochromogen ( compound of hematin ) , takes oxygen from the lungs and forms unstable oxyhemoglobin . Oxyhemoglobin readily gives its oxygen to body cells . When carbon monoxide is breathed , very stable carbon monoxide hemoglobin* results and the body cells can not burn off their wastes , death results . In such poisoning Prof. Fischer 's synthetic hematine may possibly be injected into the blood . Animal experiments with it are under way . <P> <P> *0ne hundred forty times as stable as oxyhemoglobin.
