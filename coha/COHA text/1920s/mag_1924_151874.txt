The body of Deputy Giacomo Matteotti , assassinated some weeks ago by some person or persons unknown , but suspected and in custody awaiting trial ( TIME , June 23 et seq. ) , was returned to the dust in the cemetery of his home town near Rome . Soldiers paid him military honors for the State ; 8,000 persons attended the funeral . <P> In the crypt of St. Peter 's , a tomb lay covered with flowers . Heavy candles diffused their ethereal light , revealing black-draped and kneeling figures , bent in devout prayer . A slight murmur of subdued voices disturbed the restful silence . Occasionally , the firm voice of a prelate would rise above the murmur as he pronounced a benediction , or sometimes low , sad chants would break the stillness . Close to the tomb were two elderly sisters of the dead , absorbed in reciting the Ave Maria , as they tremblingly counted their beads . All that long day , figures shuffled in and shuffled out of the crypt , crossing themselves repeatedly . It was the tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-Pio il buono , the Romans call him .
