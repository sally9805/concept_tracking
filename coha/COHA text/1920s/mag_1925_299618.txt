Rockefeller Jr . Last week , a certain name appeared three times in U. S. news items . The references were brief : <P> On Wednesday , Mr. John D. Rockefeller Jr . had accompanied Judge Elbert H. Gary and eight other spokesmen of the National Citizens ' Committee of One Thousand for Law Enforcement to Washington-o breakfast with Calvin Coolidge . <P> On Thursday , Mrs. Mary Anne Rudd , aunt of John D. Rockefeller Jr. , had died at her home in Cleveland . <P> On Saturday , Charles E. Hughes had resigned as Secretary of State . Journalists recalled that Mr. Hughes had been the first leader of the Bible class of the Fifth Ave . ( now Park Ave . ) Baptist Church , that Mr. John D. Rockefeller Jr . is at present Honorary President of that class . <P> Meagre enough , these items , bearing as they do upon that awkward , austere , magical name whose connotation is an unquotable sum and an unknown personality . Yet , out of such flying hints , has grown the outline of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limned in charcoal scratches , clarified little by little with inkier facts , until the quality and temper of the man have come to stand out distinct , significant . <P> It is not the fact that his personality has been largely unknown , that his wealth abashes ciphers , that makes him significant . There is no significance in mystery . John Davison Rockefeller Jr . is significant because he has twisted a parable , and because he has made a signally novel application of an ancient law . <P> The parable is one that has been often quoted with smug exultation in needy homes , in great houses with lamentable quakings . It has to do with a camel , a rich man 's son , Heaven , the eye of a needle . The law , equally familiar , has to do with two Gods-one the Father of the Christian faith , the other Mam mon ; a man can not serve both . If he cleaves to the one , must he foreswear wealth ? or can he discipline wealth and its devouring deity to the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years ago in the Cosmopolitan Magazine it was said of Mr. Rockefeller Jr. : " He is an utterly negative person . . . . " Negatives stated of him in another magazine were : ' ' He has no personal enemies . . . . His altruism has never been questioned . " These statements were based on correct , if casual , considerations of his ethics , his philanthropies , his business . <P> Ethics . Mr. Rockefeller is familiar with the parable about the rich man 's son . He is a Christian , a member of the flock of the Park Avenue Baptist Church , Manhattan . At this Church there is a Bible class , first conducted ( as noted above ) by Charles Evans Hughes , originated by Dr. Faunce , who became President of Brown University , from which Mr. Rockefeller graduated in 1897 . Mr. Rockefeller became interested in the Bible class , became its leader , instructed it for seven years . Now he is its Honorary President . Several times a year he attends its meetings , reads to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Scripture , lard all his public speeches . " The big thing in life is work . . . . Success comes by doing the common , everyday things of life uncommonly well . " Hardly original , these utterances are those of a man to whom practicality is native , abstraction difficult , the defect of whose thought is rather narrowness than looseness . Narrow also is the needle 's eye .
