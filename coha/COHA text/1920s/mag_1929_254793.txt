So ornamentally idle have been the lives of military aides to the President that Army and Navy he-men well have dreaded the assignments , right honorable though they are . The chief duties were : 1 ) to stand grandly by when the President received new foreign envoys ; 2 ) to pass tea and sandwiches smilingly at White House at-homes ; 3 ) to add splendor to the President 's official trips . <P> When President Coolidge brought into Washington from the plains Col. Osmun Latrobe as his aide , that weather-bitten old soldier was so patiently bored that the President gave him an additional assignment as assistant to the Chief of Cavalry . <P> For idleness , even under the guise of official duty , President Hoover has no use . Last week he prepared to put his new military aides-Lieut . Col. Campbell B. Hodges , U.S.A. and Capt . Allen Buchanan , U.S.N.-to work . Col. Hodges reported for duty last week at the White House from West Point , where he was Commandant of Cadets . He found a shiny new desk awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for Captain Buchanan when he comes to the White House from the U. S. S. Omaha in a few weeks . <P> Precisely what office work the Hoover aides will do , Col. Hodges has yet to discover . In general , they will serve as special liaison officers between the White House and the War and Navy Departments . Military matters " of a secondary nature " will be placed before them for action . Special letters dealing with the Army and Navy will be prepared by them for the Hoover signature . A 9-to-5 working day will be observed . <P> President Hoover left Washington last week for the first time since inauguration . He was gone eleven hours on an inspection of his Virginia fishing preserve in Shenandoah National Park . He rode a horse ten miles through mountain woods , tramped three miles more on foot , picked out three camping sites between Double-top and Fork Mountains on the Upper Rapidan . In a black riding habit , Mrs. Hoover accompanied him part way . Forbidden to follow , newsgatherers and cameramen had a holiday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the President . The 54th was last week handed by John Heydler , President of the National League , to President Hoover . As usual , it was No. 1 , bore the U. S. seal . Unlike all others , it was in an elephant hide case. * <P> Around the corner of 13th and Irving streets , N. W. swing heavy blue double-decked buses . There they stop , to start up again with a splattering roar of the exhaust . At that corner stands the Friends Meeting House where President and Mrs. Hoover worship . So loud were the bus noises that the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia ordered the vehicles to take another route on Sunday mornings . Last Sunday the President worshipped in peace . <P> President Hoover last week put his first message to Congress in shape for the Public Printer . It is short , written mostly in the evenings of the last month . It recommends action on only two legislative subjects : Farm Relief , Tariff Revision .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
