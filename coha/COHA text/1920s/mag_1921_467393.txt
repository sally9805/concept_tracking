WHAT goes on behind the scenes in a hotel ? To find that out I poked around till I discovered the employment-office entrance of one of New York 's biggest and newest hotels . There had been no " ad. " in the Sunday paper which would give a hint that any hotel needed additional help . We took our chances . Some twenty men waited in a little hallway , two women inside the little office . Both wanted chamber work . The employment man spied me . " What do you want ? " " A job . " " What kind of a job ? " " Anything but bein ' chambermaid . " " What experience have you had in hotel work ? " " None , but lots in private homes . I 'd like a job around the kitchen some place . " " Ever try pantry work ? " " Not in a hotel , but lots in private families . I can do that swell ! " ( What pantry work meant I had n't the least idea perhaps washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hat and dashed upstairs . He always put on his coat and hat to go upstairs . In a few moments he dashed hurriedly back , followed by another man who , I learned afterward , was an important steward . He asked me all over again all the questions the first man had asked , and many more . He was in despair and impatient when he found I had not a single letter of recommendation from a single private family I had worked for . I could have written myself an excellent one in a few moments . Could I bring a letter back later in the day ? " Can you fix salads ? " " Sure ! " " You think you could do the job ? " " Sure ! " " Well , you look as if you could . Never mind the letter , but get one to have by you ? comes in handy any job you want . Now about pay ? I ca n't pay you what you been used to getting , at least not the first month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Second month maybe more . First month all I can pay you is fifty and your meals . That all right ? " As usual , my joy at landing a job was such that any recompense was acceptable . " Be back in two hours . " I was back before my two hours were up , anxious to begin . In a corner of the main kitchen the steward turned me over to Bridget , who was to take me here , there , and the other place . By 11.30 A.M. , I was back where I started from , only , thanks to aged Bridget and her none too sure leadings , I was clad in a white cap and white all-over aprondress , and had had my lunch . Thereupon the steward escorted me to my own special corner of the world , where , indeed , I was to be monarch of all I surveyed ? provided my gaze fell not too far afield . That particular corner was down one short flight of stairs from the main kitchen into a hustling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where were prepared the brealdasts , lunches , and dinners of those who placed more importance on hurry and less on style than the patrons of the main dining rooms . Our caf ? fed more persons in a day than the other dining rooms combined . Outside we could seat five hundred at a time , sixty-five at marble counters , the rest at small tables . But our kitchen quarters could have been put in one corner of the spacious , airy upstairs main kitchen . Through the bustle of scurrying and ordering waiters I was led to a small , shelved-off compartment . Here I was to earn my fifty dollars a month from 1.30 P.M. to 9 E . M. daily except Sunday , with one-half hour off fur supper . I was entitled to eat my breakfast and lunch at the hotel as well . This first day I was to watch for some two hours the girl I was to relieve at 1.30 . Her hours were from 6 in the morning to 1.30 , which meant she got the brunt of the hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush . To me fell Lhe tail end of the lunch rush ? up to about 2:15 , and dinner , which only occasionally could be spoken of as " rush " at all . By the time 11.30 came around , I knew what I had to do and could be Ieft to my own devices . To the pantry girl of our cafe fell various and sundry small jobs . BuL the end and aim of her life had to be speed . To the left of my little doorway was a small , deep sink . Directly next to the sink was a very large ice chest . On the side of the ice chest next the sink hung the four soft-boiled egg machines ? those fascinating contrivances in which one deposited the eggs , set the notch at two , three , four minutes , according to the desires of the hurried guest without , sank the cup-shaped container in the boiling water , and never gave the matter another thought . At the allotted moment the eggs were hoisted as if by magic from out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire left side of my small enclosure . Along the entire right and front was a wide work-shelf . On this shelf at the right stood the electric toasting machine which during busy hours had to be kept going full blast . In the front corner just next the toaster stood . the tray of bread sliced ready to toast , crusts off for dry or buttered toast , crusts on for " club , " very thin slices for " toast Melba . " Directly in front , and next the bread tray , came the tray filled with little piles of graham and milk crackers , seven in a pile . What an amazing number of folk order graham or milk crackers in a cafe ! It seems unbelievable to one who has always looked upon a place furnishing eatables outside a home as a chance to order somewhat indigestible food prepared entirely differently from what any home could accomplish . Yet I know it to be a fact that people seat themselves at a table or a counter in a more or less stylish caf ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackers , and perhaps top off , if they forget themselves so far , with a shredded-wheat biscuit . Just above the counter holding the bread and crackers was the counter on which were placed the filled orders for the waiters to whisk away . It was but a step from there to my ice box . The orders it was my business to fill were for blackberries , blueberries , prunes , sliced oranges , rhubarb , grapefruit , whole oranges , apples , sliced peaches and bananas , muskmelons , four kinds of cheese . All of these pretty well filled the upper half of the ice chest , if you counted the finished salads I kept just ahead on , say three of each lettuce and tomato , hearts of lettuce , plain lettuce , and sliced tomatoes . In the lower half stood the pitchers of orange and grape juice , jams and jellies for omelettes to be made down the line , olives , celery , lettuce , cucumbers , a small tub of oranges , and a large bowl of sliced lemons . The lemons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the ice-tea orders ! I had also to keep on hand a bowl of American cheese cut the proper size to accompany pie , toast , and soft - boiled eggs and crackers , and a crock of French dressing set in ice . Such was my kingdom , and I ruled alone . During slack hours it was easy , too easy . In rush hours you had to keep your head . Six waiters might breeze by in a. line not one second apart , each calling an order , " Half a cantaloupe ! " " Two orders of buttered toast ! " " Combination salad ! " ( that meant romaine and lettuce leaves , shredded celery , sliced cucumbers , quartered tomatoes , green pepper , watercress , which always had to be made up fresh ? none waiting in the ice chest ) ; " Sliced peaches ! " ( they could never be sliced in advance ) ; " One order orange juice ! " " Toast for club ! " Then how one 's fingers sped ! Between 2 and Q30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my breath and took time to note the lay of the land . My compartment came first , directly next the dishes . Next me was a wonderful chef with his white cap set on at just the chef angle . He was an artist , with a youngster about fifteen as his assistant . Some day that youngster will be a more wonderful chef than his master and more of an artist . His master , I found out in my slack hours that first afternoon , was French , with little English at his command , though six years in this country . I know less French than he does English , but we got to be good friends over the low partition which separated us . There was nothing impertinent about him . I showed my gratitude for that by coming over in the afternoon and helping him slice hot potatoes for potato salad while my floor got washed . Every day I made him a bow and said , " Bon jaw , Monsieur le Bon Chef , " which may be no French at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Bon jour " something or other , which I could tell was nice and respectful , but ? I ca n't write it down . Monsieur le Bon Chef made splendid cold works of art in jellies , and salads which belonged to another realm than my poor tomatoes and lettuce . Also he and his assistant ? the assistant was Spanish ? made wonder-sandwiches . At the left of the stairs were five chefs of as many nationalities ? Italian , Spanish , South American , French , Austrian , who filled hot orders ; fryers they were , and broilers , and roasters , and such like . Turn the corner and there opposite the Bon Chef and me were first the Lwo cashiers , then my special friends , the Spanish dessert man and the Greek coffee and tea man . That is , they were the main occupants of their long compartment , but during the lunch rush at least six men worked there . Counting the chore persons of various sorts and not counting waiters , we had some thirty-eight working in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porto-Rican glass washers and me . Bridget , the dear old soul , came down that first afternoon to see how I was getting along . I had cleaned up spick and span after the Spanish woman ? and a mess she always managed to leave . The water was out of the egg-boiling machine and that all polished lip ; the heat turned off in the toasting machine and that wiped off ; lemons sliced ; celery " JOetted " ; and I was peeling a tuhiul of oranges in the way the steward showed me , to be sliced by Spanish Mary for breakfast next morning . It was plain to see that down our way everybody 's work eased up between 3.30 and 5 . Then everyone visited one another , exchanged newspapers , gossiped over counters . We changed stewards at 3 . Kelly , the easy-going , jovial ( except at times ) Irishman , took himself off , and Schmitz , a narrow-shouldered , small , pernickety German-Jew came on for the rest of my time . At five minutes to five Schmitz graciously told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law in the statute books stood five . Everybody upstairs in the main kitchen , as I made my way to the service elevator , spoke kindly and asked , in the accents of at least ten different nationalities , how I liked my job . Hotel folk , male and female , are indeed a friendly lot . There are , it seems , class distinctions among hotel help . The chefs eat in a dining room of their own . Then , apparently next in line , came our dining room . I , as pantry girl , ranked a " second officer . " We had round tables seating from eight to ten at a table , table cloths , and cafeteria-style of getting one 's food . The chefs were waited upon . In our dining room ate the bell boys , parlor maids , laundry workers , seamstresses , housekeepers , hotel guards and police , the employment man , pantry girls . To reach our dining room we had to pass the large room where the chambermaids ate . They had long bare tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to food , our dining room but reflected the state of mind any and every hotel dining room reflects , from the most begilded and bemirrored down . Some thought the food good , some thought it awful , some thought nothing about it at all , but just sat and ate . One thing at least was certain ? there was enough . For dinner there was always soup , two kinds of meat , potatoes , vegetables , dessert , ice tea , milk , or coffee . For supper there was soup again , meat or fish , potatoes , a salad , and dessert , and the same variety of drinkables to choose from . From 6 to 7.30 was the height of the supper rush . What a variable thing our patrons made of it ! Some evenings there would be a regular run on celery salads , then for four nights not a single order . Camembert cheese would reign supreme three nights in succession ? not another order for the rest of the week . Sometimes it seemed as if the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next night stocked up in advance so as to keep no one waiting ? not a human being looked at a tomato . At eight o'clock only stragglers remained to be fed , and my job was to clear out the ice chest of all but two of each order , send the rest upstairs to the main kitchen , and then start scrubbing house . Schmitz let it be known that one of the failings of her whose place I was now filling , who had been asked to leave the Friday night before the Monday morning I appeared , was that she was not clean enough . At first , a year and a half ago , she was cleanly and upright ? that is , he spoke of such uprightness as invariably follows cleanliness . But as time wore on her habits of cleanliness wore off , and there were undoubtedly corners in the ice box where her waning-inenthusiasm fingers failed to reach . But on a night when the New York thermometer ranges up toward the nineties it is a pure and unadulterated joy to labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped until Schmitz almost looked approving . Only it was congenital with Schmitz that he never really showed approval of anything or anybody . Schmitz was the kind who always had to change everything just a little . There would echo down the line an order , " One Swiss cheese , little one " ( that referred to me , not the cheese ) . Schmitz would stroll over from where he was trying to keep busy watching everyone at once , enter the very confines of my compartment , and stand over me while I sliced that Swiss cheese . It was always either too big , in which case he took the knife from my hands and sliced off one-sixteenth of an inch on one end ; or too small , in which case Schmitz would endeavor to slice a new piece altogether . The chances were it would end in being even smaller than the slice I cut . In that case , Schmitz would say , " Let it go , anyway . " But for all that Schmitz deigned not to allow it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own soul approved of me . The shelves and the sink I scrubbed . Then every perishable article in my ice chest or elsewhere got placed upon trays to go upstairs . By this time it was two minutes to nine . Schmitz , always with his hands clasped behind him , except when he was doing over everything I did , said , " You can go now. , , ' pstairs among the lockers on the third floor the temperature was like that of a live volcano , only nothing showed any signs of exploding . Fat women who could speak little or no English were here and there pi iffily dismantling , exchanging the hotel work-uniform for their street garments . Everyone was kindly and affectionate . One old Irishwoman came up while I was changing my clothes . " Well , &ark,; and how did it go ? " " Sure it went swell . " " That 's good . The Lord bless ye . But there 's one bit of advice I must be giving ye . There 's one thing you must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearie , you must guard your personality ! I 'm tellin ' ye , there ' re the men y ' know , but guard y ' personality ! " I had been getting affectionate pats most of the time , though the majority of them were from the male help . The lump memory of that first day as I took my way home in the sticky Subway was that the world was a very affectionate place , nor was I quite sure just what to do about it . The second morning I was given a glimpse of what can be done about it . As I was waiting for the elevator on the service floor to take me down to work , a very attractive girl came along and immediately we became chummy . She had been at the hotel three weeks ; her job was to cut fruit . Had she done this sort of work long ? Not in this country , but in Europe . Just one year bad she been in America . At that moment two youths passed . I saw nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You fresh guy keep your hands to yourself ! " So evidently that 's the way it 's done . I practiced it mentally . " Lots o ' fresh guys round here , " I sniffed . " You said it , " muttered the still ruffled fruit cutter . Downstairs , Kelly was waiting with a welcoming nod ? Kelly , the unpernickety steward . Everyone was as friendly as if we had been feeding humanity side by side these many years . During the rush the waiters called out as they sped by , " Hi there , little one ! " " There 's the girlie ! " " Ah there , sweetheart ! " If a waiter had an order to give he passed the time of day as he gave it and as he collected his order . Voc . CXLIV. ? No. 859. - 15 " And how 's the little girl to-day ? " " Tiptop ? and yourself ? " " A little low in spirits I was to-day until I seen you 'd come . You love me as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . W'at y ' a-doin ' talkin ' to my girl ? Now , honey , I 'm tellin ' you this here guy is too fresh for any lady . I 'd like one order of romaine lettuce , bless your sweet heart , if it wo n't be tirin ' your fingers too much . That 's the dearie ? I 'm back in a moment . " Across the way , arms resting on the counter , head ducked under the upper shelf , leaned a burly red-headed helper to the Creek . Every time the pantry girl looked his way he beamed and nodded and nodded and beamed . " How you lak ? " " Fine ! " More beams and nods . Soon a waiter slipped a glass of ice coffee , rich in cream and sugar , under my counter . Beams and nods fit to burst from the assistant coffee man across the way . Beams and nods from the pantry girl . Thus , every day . Our sole conversation was : " How you lak ? " " Fine ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush over , Kelly sneaked around my entrance and jerked his head sidewise . That meant , naturally , that I was to approach and hearken unto what he had to say . When Kelly imparted secrets ? and much of what Kelly had to impart was that sort of information where he felt called upon to gaze about furtively to make sure no one was overhearing ? he talked down in his boots and a bit out of the corner of his mouth . " Say , kid " ? Kelly jerked his head " want to tell you about this eatin ' business . Y ' know , ai n't no one supposed to eat nothin ' on this floor . If the boss catches ya , it 's good-by dolly . Sign up over the door sayin ' you 'll be dismissed at once if you eat anything ? sec ? But I 'm givin ' ya a little tip . See ? I do n't care how much ya eat ? it 's nothin ' to me . I say eat all ya got a mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Boss catch ya . " ( The Big Boss was the little chief steward , who drew down a fabulous salary and had the whole place scared to death . ) " See ? pull a cracker box out so and put what ya got to eat behind it this way , then ya can sit down and sorta take your time at it . If the boss does come by ? it 's behind the cracker box and you should worry ! " Every day , about 2.30 , Kelly got in a certain more or less secluded corner of my compartment and ate a bit himself . " Been almost fired a couple of times for doin ' this ? this place is full o ' squealers ? got ta watch out all the time . Hell of a life , I say , when a fella has to sneak around to eat a bit of food . " That second afternoon , Kelly stopped in the middle of a gulp of coffee . " Say , w'al 's a girl like you workin ' for , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married easy as ? my Gawd ! too easy . Say , you could pick up with one of these waiters just like that ! They 're good steady fellas , make decent pay . You could do much worse than marry a waiter . I 'm tellin ' ya . there 's no sense to a girl like you workin ' . " That was an obsession with Kelly . He drilled it into me daily . Kelly himself was a settled married man . Of his state we talked often . One of Kelly 's steady , dependable waiters approached about 5 P.M. " Say , girl , I like you ! " Of course , the comeback for that now , as always , was , " Aw , go-an ! " " Sure , I like you . Say , how about goin ' out this evening with me ? We 'll sure do the old town ! " " I say , you sound like as if you got all of twenty-five cents in your pocket ! " He leaned way over my counter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you say the word ! " It 's words like that which sometimes do n't get said . For supper that night I sat at a table with a housekeeper , a parlor maid , and a seamstress , and listened to much talk . Mainly , it was a discussion of where were the most desirable jobs to he had in their respective lines . There was complete unanimity of opinion . Clubs headed the list , and the cream of cream were men 's clubs . The housekeeper and parlor maid together painted a picture which would lead one to conclude that the happiest women in all New York City were the housekeepers in men 's clubs . The work was light , they were well treated ? it was a job for anyone to strive for . The type of men or women in clubs , they remarked , was ahead of what you 'd draw in any hotel . The parlor maid , an attractive grayhaired woman ? indeed , all three were gray-haired ? was very pleased with her job at our hotel . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so clean ? your towels were changed daily just as for the guests . Sure she was very contented . If her mother were only alive ? she died two years ago ? she 'd be the happiest woman in the world , she just knew it . But every single morning she woke up with an empty feeling in her heart for her mother . One Thursday noon , I ate with the workers in the help 's kitchen . So much talk ! We discussed domestic service . Every day at that hotel I wondered why any girl took work in a private home if she could possibly get a hotel job . Here was what could be considered by comparison with other jobs , good pay , plus three nourishing meals a day , decent hours , and before and after those hours freedom . In many cases , also , it meant a place to sleep . There was a chance for talk and companionship with one 's kind during the day . Every chance I got asked a girl if she liked working in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a chance . The only person who was not loud in decrying private service was Minnie during this special Thursday lunch . Minnie had worked years in private families and only six years in hotels . She wished she 'd never seen the inside of a hotel . That same night at the supper table the subject came up again before an entirely new crowd . Three at the table had tried domestic service . Never again ! Why ? Always the answer was the same . " Aw , it 's the feeling of freedom ya never get there , and ya do get it in a hotel . " On the whole , that supper table agreed that domestic service was a good deal like matrimony . If you got a good family , all right ; but how many good families were there in the world ? One woman spoke of working where they 'd made a door mat of her . Barely did she have food enough to eat . There were four in the family . When they had chops the lady of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chops got none . After lunch I rushed to assist Mary . I loved going down the stairs into our hot , hurrying scurry of excitement . Indeed , it was seeing behind the scenes . And always the friendly nods from everyone , even though the waiters especially looked ready to expire . At Monsieur Le Hon Chef 's counter some sticky waiter had ordered a roast-beef sandwich . The heat bad made him skeptical . " Call that beef ? " The waiter next glared at him with a chuckle . " An ' must we then always Lead in the cow for you to see ? " A large Irishman breezed up to my Bon Chef . " Two beef a la modes . Make it snappy , chief . Party 's in a hurry . Has to catch the five-thirty train " ? this at 1 . Everyone , everyone , good-natured , though the perspiration literally rolled off them . Most of the waiters were Irish . One of them was a regular dude ? such immaculateness as never was . He was the funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special benefit , for I made no bones of the fact that he amused me highly . He was especially immaculate this Thursday . I guessed he must he taking at least three ladies out that evening . He looked at me out of the corner of his eyes . " Three , little one , this hot night ? Winter time , yes , a man can stand a crowd about him , but not to-night . No . To-night , little one , I take but one lady . It allows for morecirculation of air . And you will be that One ? " The Greek this hot Thursday became especially friendly . He twirled his heavy black mustache and carried on an animated broken-English conversation most of the afternoon . Incidentally , he sent over one ice coffee with thick cream and two frosted chocolates . The little Spaniard next to him who served pies and ice cream and more amazing desserts became very friendly . There was nothing the least impertinent about him . He mostly leaned on his counter , in moments of lull in trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sighed heavily . Finally he made bold to converse . I learned that he had been two years in this country , eight months at his present job . When I asked him how he spent his off time , he replied in his very broken English that he knew nobody and went nowhere . " It is no pleasure to go alone . " For some years he had been in the printing trade in South America there was something to a job like that . But in New York he did not know enough English to be a printer , and so , somehow , he found himself dishing pies and ice cream at our hotel . Later on that day he asked me , " Why arc you so happy ? " I had no reason . Only a great multitude of reasons why there was no excuse to be anything else , but I did not go into that . He would know , though . " What did you do last night ? " " Ho ! " I laughed at him , " rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit later a piece of folded paper landed almost in my French dressing . It was a note from the Spaniard , " Will you go riding with inc to-night ? " I wrote on the bottom of the paper : " Not to-night . Perhaps next week , yes ? " A few moments later a folded menu landed on the floor . On the back was written : " I will he very pleased whenever you can or wish . Could it be Sunday ? I hope you would n't take it amiss my asking you this . Frank . " I really wanted to take that bus ride with Frank . It still worries me that I did not . He was such a lonesome person . Then there was the tall , lean , dark Irish waiter I called Mr. O'Sullivan . He was a continual joy to my heart and gave me cause for many a chuckle . A rebel , was Mr. O'Sullivan . I heard Kelly call him down twice for growling at what he considered inexcusable desires in the matter of food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was none of his business . But I loved to listen to Mr. O'Sullivan 's growlings , and once he realized that , he used to stop at my counter , take extra long to collect three slices of lemon , and tell me his latest grievance . Mr. O'Sullivan knew that . I gave ear to his sentiments upon such matters as old parties , male or female , who must needs order special kinds of extra digestible bread , and usually that bread must in addition be toasted . While it was toasting , Mr. O'Sullivan voiced his views on Old Maids with Indigestion . Much of it does not bear repeating . When the toast was done , Mr. O'Sullivan would hold out his plate with the napkin folded ready for the toast . " Shure an yo'r the sweetest child my eyes ever looked upon . " ( Mr. O'Sullivan would say just the same thing in the same way to a toothless old hag of ninety . ) " Mind you spare yo'rself now from both bein ' an old maid and sufferin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread ! " Upstairs at supper that night I had the luck to land again at a talkative table . The subject of matrimony , as ever , came up . Why should a woman get married when she can support herself ? All she 'd get out of it would be a pack of kids to clean up after , and work that never ended . Of course , the concession was eventually made , if you were sure you were getting a good man ? But how many good men were there in the world ? And look at the divorces nowadays ! Why try it at all ? One girl reported as statistically accurate thatthere was one divorce in the United States to every four marriages . " You do n't say ! " was the chorus . Before I knew it , 5.30 had come around , and by the time I was downstairs again it was five minutes past my appointed half hour . Poor , poor Schmitz ! And yet lucky Schmitz . It must have caused his soul much inner satisfaction to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could not go up for his supper until I came down from mine . ) Schmitz upbraided me , patiently , with explanations . Every single night from then on , when at 5 lie would tell me I could go upstairs , he always added , " And be sure you 're back at half past five ! " In natural depravity of spirit , it was my delight one night to be able to sneak down at about 5.25 without being seen by Schmitz . Then I shrank into a corner of my compartment , out of his line of vision , and worked busily on my evening chores . At 5.30 Schmitz began his anxious scanning of our large clock . By 5A0 he was a wreck and the clock had nearly been glared off its hinges . Then it was a waiter called out to me the first evening order . With the steps of a martyr , a ten-minute martyr at that , Schmitz made his way over to fill that order . And there I was , busily filling it myself ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sent for in the middle of the evening , more tomatoes , more blackberries , more cantaloupes , more bread for toast . There was no stopping for breath . In the midst of the final scrubbings and cleanings came an order of " One combination salad , sweetheart ! " That done and removed and there sounded down the way , " One cantaloupe , honey ! " Back the waiter came in a moment . " The old party says it 's too ripe . " There were only two left to choose from . " Knock his slats in if he do n't like that , the old fossil . " In another moment the waiter was back again with the second half . " He says he do n't want no cantaloupe , anyhow . tors , at which he dropped everything , wiped his hands on his apron , and beamed from ear to ear until I got by . One day be dashed along beside me and directed an outburst of Spanish in my ear . When I shook my head and shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a countrywoman , his dismay was purely temporary . He spoke rather flowery English . Would I walk up the stairs with him ? No , I preferred the elevator . He did , too . I made the most of it by asking him questions too fast for him to ask me any . He was a tailor by trade , but business had been dull for months . In despair he had taken to roasting . Some six months he had been at our hotel . He much preferred tailoring , and in two months he would be back at his trade in a little shop of his own , making about fifty to seventy-five dollars a week . And then he got in his first question . " Are you married ? " " No . " " Could I then ask you to go out with me some evening ? " ? all this with many beams and wipings of hands on his apron . Well , I was very busy . " But one evening . Oh , just one evening ? surely one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? " " No , not to-night . " " To-morrow n i ght ? " " No , no night this week or next week , but perhaps week after next . " " All , that is so long , so long ! " There was no earthly way to get to the stairs or elevators except by passing his stove . I came to dread it . Always the Spanish ex-tailor dropped everything with a clatter and chased after me . I managed to pass his confines at greater and greater speed . Invariably I heard his panting , " Listen ! Listen ! " after me , but I tore on , hoping to get an elevator that started up before he could make it . . Downstairs that first Saturday the little quiet Spaniard of the pies and ice cream screwed up his courage , crossed over to my precinct , leaned his arms on my front counter , and said , " If I had a wife like you I would be happy all the rest of my life ! " Having delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pies and ice cream . The Greek coffee man would Lake me to a show that night . I had a very nice Italian friend ? second cook , he called himself ? who used to come over to the compartment of Monsieur Le Bon Chef and talk over the partition to me every afternoon from four to half past . He also was not in the least forward , but just talked and talked about many things . His first name in Italian was " Eusebio , " but he found it more convenient in our land to go under the name of " Victor . " He came from a village of fifty inhabitants not far from Turin , almost on the Swiss border , where they had snow nine months in the year . Why had he journeyed to America ? " Oh , I donno . Italians in my home town have too little money and too many children . " Victor was an intelligent talker . I asked him many questions about Lhe labor problem generally .

Every other day hours were from 6 A.M. to 8.30 p.m. ; in between days they got off from 2 to .5 in the afternoon . Now , in the very same job , a man works eight hours a day and gets eighteen dollars a week . Victor at present drew twentytwo dollars a week , plus every chef 's allotment of two dollars and forty cents a week " beer money . " But Victor thought he was as well off seven years ago on eighteen dollars a month as he would be to-day on eighteen dollars a week . Then , it seems , he had a nice room with one other man for four dollars a month , including laundry . Now he rooms alone , it is true , but he paysfive dollars a week for a room he claims is little , if any , better than the old one , and a dollar a week extra for laundry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoes , now ten or twelve , and they wear out as fast as the two-dollar shoes of seven years before . Now fifty dollars for a suit no better than the one he used to get for fifteen dollars . Besides , Victor could save nothing now , for he had a girl , and you know how it is with women . It 's got to be a present all the time . You ca n't get ' em by a store window without you go in and buy a waist or a hat , or goodness knows what all a girl does n't manage to want . He went into detail over his recent gifts . Why was he so generous as all that to his fair one ? Because if he did n't get the things for her he was afraid some other man would . Nor could Victor understand how people lived in this country without playing more . Every night , every single night , he must find some countryman and play around a little bit before going to bed ! " These fellas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dinner , and then go home and sit around and go to bed ! " No , Victor preferred death to such stagnation . If it was only a game of cards and a glass of wine ( prohibition did not seem to exist for Victor and his countrymen ) or just walking around the streets , talking . Anything , so long as it was something . As ever , the day for leaving arrived . This time I gave notice to Kelly three days in advance so that a girl could be found to take my place . " The Big Chief and I both said when we seen you , she wo n't stay long at this job . " " Why not ? " I indignantly asked Kelly . " Ah , shucks ! " sighed Kelly . Later : " Well , you 're a good kid . You were making good at your job , too . Only I 'll tell y ' this . You 're too conscientious . Do n't pay . " And still later , " Aw , forget this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
