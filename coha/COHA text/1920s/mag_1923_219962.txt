The Navy Department recently secured a special appropriation of $6500,000 to increase the angle to which guns on 13 battleships could be raised , in order to extend their range . The reason given was that England was doing the same . Now the British Admiralty announces that the angle of the British guns was not raised and the range of their guns was not increased . The Navy Department , however , is considering increasing the angle of our guns in spite of the Admiralty 's statement . The British Navy already has a range about 3,000 yards greater than ours . The Japanese battleship Mutzu is reported to have a range of 35,000 yards-5,000 yards greater than that of any American or British ship . In addition , the Japanese are spending $25,000,000 in modernizing their navy . These facts are considered sufficient to warrant the Navy Department project . Whether the proposed change can be made under the Limitation of Armaments Treaty is a question which Secretary Hughes is said to be discussing with the British Foreign Office . Although American Naval officers declare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the range of our guns , Representative Madden , Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , announced that he would protest the right of the Navy Department to make the change . Secretary Hughes and President Harding will be consulted before action is taken .
