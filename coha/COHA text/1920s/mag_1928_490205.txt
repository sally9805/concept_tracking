VINCENT MILLAY wrote most of the poems for her new book in her studio on a farm near Austerlitz , upstate . The studio adjoins an old barn across the road from the poet 's farmhouse and is built into a tree-top , the flooring resting on the branches . From her windows the author can see fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Boissevains have settled pretty permanently in the country ; three tiled bathrooms have just been installed in their farmhouse , which is near the Massachusetts line . Miss Millay and her husband have their eye on a flock of sheep which they are about to buy . Since the production of " The King 's Henchman " Miss Millay has spent almost all of her time " tilling the uplands " ? references to the farm are frequent in the new book  --  riding horseback , planting hedges , working in her studio . Just now she is busy on an ambitious sonnet sequence and not , as rumors have had it , on another opera with Deems Taylor . She works at no set hours , but only when she feels like it . Her husband seems to think this is too often . She writes with great care , revising poems after she has typewritten them , often making further changes in proofs , which she holds for a week or so before attacking , in order to have a fresh viewpoint . Her main contacts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boston , and a great lot of mail which arrives daily . Letters come from all over the world . This winter she will make her usual reading tour , since reading aloud has always been one of her delights . Her public appearances are rather quietly advertised , as she does n't like fanfare . She does n't even like to be photographed . In sending out the formal announcement of her new book , Harper had to use a picture of her taken several years ago . The new hook , " The Buck in the Snow , " has been out only about a month , but the regular two-dollar first editions are already quoted as high as five dollars . A new volume of hers now always creates a flurry in the book market , a rare thing for poetry to accomplish . She is unquestionably the best-selling poet .

En-raged taxpayers , going down to the Municipal Building to have someone fired , as a rule have been mollified by righteous adjustments and also considerably set up to hear that the receipt of such a notice proves that one is considered by his city to he Somebody . Only about forty thousand of these notices , as a matter of fact , were sent out this year  --  to names taken from the Blue Rook , the Social Register , rosters of clubs , and so on . It is all admittedly guesswork and all done in a high-handed and somewhat half-hearted manner by the tax officials on the ninth floor of the Municipal Building . It seems that this old tax on personal belongings has been pretty largely abandoned , because most of the items it embraces arc now provided for in separate special taxes  --  such as the automobile tax . No effort is made to summon the taxpayers at large , because the majority could swear they came under the thousand-dollar exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses indicate that they live in more or less elegant surroundings , to get a few million dollars ' return on household furnishings . This plan does n't always work , how-ever . This year a gentleman named Woffington or something , with a fine Park Avenue number , turned out to be the janitor of the apartment building at that address . It seems that many employees of the sort find comfort in being entered in some directory or other as living at a swanky address . No actual appraising is done for this tax . An arbitrary valuation , based upon the neighborhood the taxpayer lives in , is made by a man sitting at a desk , chewing a pencil . These valuations are always outrageously high because , having made a valuation , the officials must adhere to it , even if they later find out they are hundreds of thousands of dollars too low in their estimate . The city will make only about three and a half million dollars this year by this tax , after the cost of bringing in janitors on wild-goose chases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down and swear off your assessment if you got one and it is too high .

Francois Quillars , his trainer , interpreted our questions ; Ouafi speaks no English . Be said he had never served in the R if , but he had been in the French army . Be was conscripted  --  that was how he came to leave home . In Algeria his father was a dragoman , and Ouafi went with him on trips ; he liked to run beside the camels , twenty , thirty miles a day . Then he was in the French Army of Occupation at Coblenz and then in the Renault automobile factory at Biilancourt . It was n't true that the Renault Company paid him $1.50 a day . Be made $1.40 .

The greatest luxury he has experienced to date was his trip from France in the first cabin of the Paris . While he was in town Ouafi ran sixteen miles a day and spent most of the rest of his time at the movies . He likes all movies , but the talkies best , although he does n't understand the words . One evening he got away from Quillars and went to a night club , where he jumped on a table and gave an imitation of the hostess . After that his trainer slept in the same room with him to keep him from getting out at night . Ouafi eats no meat , does not smoke or drink , is shy with women and fond of ice cream . He was n't tired after his race with Ray and the others ; later he sat talking till two in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . In training , as in a race , he uses a short , fiat-footed stride ; he never changes his pace and never sprints . Quillars shouts " Allcz " to start him and waves his arm when he wants him to stop .

Precaution AT a late supper party the other night in one of the more restful restaurants , a hell began to ring insistently . The sound was traced at length to a middle-aged gentleman who had dozed off over his coffee . It seems that this fellow has for the past year or two been inclined to nod after dinner , and to meet the situation , when he set out for this gathering , he put a small alarm clock in his pocket , having set it for a little after eleven o'clock  --  which is past his bedtime anyway . He relied on it to wake him up , should he he napping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off quickly . But with the coffee , the conversation had turned toward the fine arts , and the bellwether , as his friends now call him , had sunk into a stupor . Photographer to a Cathedral TN shifting weathers , the appearance of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine goes through strange and lovely changes . New moons for twenty years have played upon its stones in different ways . The sun has cast novel shadows with the advance of construction work . Fortunately , the chronicle of these ephemeral beauties and of the cathedral 's growth has been kept , in the form of several thousand photographs . About twenty years ago , Mrs. Waiter L , Hervey , who has lived for thirty-five years in an apartment facing the cathedral , noticed that a high arch under construction looked like a magnificent ruin . She took a photograph of it , and went on to take further photographs from various angles . She has made pictures from the tops of neighboring buildings , from scaffolds in the wind , from precarious perches high up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded by placing her camera in a window , setting an alarm clock , and getting up in the middle of the night to close the camera shutter .

Mrs. Hervey 's collection has been accepted as the official record of the construction of the cathedral and is said to be rivalled only by a portfolio of similar views of the Cathedral of Chartres . Mr. John Angel , the English sculptor , who is doing the statues in the St. John Baptistry , has Mrs. Hervey photograph his work , and not long ago Canon Jones asked her to solve a special problem . Two men , sent down from Boston by the firm which supplied a fine grilled gate for the baptistry , had announced that , he-cause of its situation , it was impossible to take a picture of the gate after it was installed .
