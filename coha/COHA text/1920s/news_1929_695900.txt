txt Stocks continued reactionary on Saturday . There was pressure against the market from the opening , when traders were putting out lines and margin selling came from outsiders . Quite a. number of margin calls were sent out after the close on Friday . and in many instances clients of leading houses responded by liquidating their longs to some extent . The decline could be described as orderly . There were sharp reactions in many issues , but scale support was in evidence as lower levels were established . This buying was credited mainly to shorts who were covering to even their accounts for the week end . No attempt was made to bid up the market , and the buyers were content to wait until the prices fixed for their proposed purchases had been reached . Few observers expect any great change in the market . They believe that stocks may become oversold , and score rallies , but most commission houses are strongly advising their customers to take advantage of the recoveries to further reduce long accounts , on the confident belief that stocks thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more reasonable levels . Important interests who are reported to be waiting for a decline to pick up stocks have not yet shown a tendency to purchase . They are apparently wait.ng for the market itself to indicate when an advance is to be started Trading Comnassion houses sold on balance Many firms sent calls for marg.ns to customers , and had selling ceders before the opening . These caused the sharp losses on the initial transactions One or two firms reported moderate scale buying by clients who are usually referred to as bargain hunters , but this demand was comparatively negligible . Professionals and floor traders sold stocks at the satrt , but as lower levels were estabhshed the operators who had a short position started covering actively on a scale , and as a result were buyers on balance . Calling of Loans Calling of loans on Frida : ? v. as quite a surprise to many However . it is noted that in the past two weeks there has been a flurry in call money rates at the end of the lenning week , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which carried over until Monday . It is considered probable that the rate will ease again in the new week , although the calling of loans Friday might bring other withdrawals from the market here and thus keep the charge for funds quite high . The fact that call money has been obtainable under time funds is pointed to as indicating that there will be no protracted period of ease in call money for some time . Obligations to Stockholders An official of a large industrial company which has been lending its excess cash in the call money market makes the contention mat such a policy is for the best interests of security holders and adds that it should be looked upon by as obligation of officials to stockholders of their companies to get the best interest obtainable on excess funds The comment was prompted by the announcement of some of the large concerns which have not been lending money in Wall Street . although these concerns have an ample supply of cash . This official maintains that stockholders would have a reason for complaining if corporations kept money on deposit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they could get 6 ' . cc Sa , in the call money market . Liquidation There has been real liquidation in the market at times during the past week . This can not be denied . Leading commission houses report that customers have been reducing their long commitments . first because of the larger margin demands by various firms , and secondly because of the lessened confidence which exists in many quarters regarding the immediate resumption of the advance . In many cases the liquidation has been brought about by the uncovering of stop orders . A large number of outsiders adopted stops as a means of protecting their accounts . These limits have been fixed only moderately below selling prices so that moderate reactions have uncovered them . Margin Calls Margin calls were sent out almost every night during the past week . They went to customers of houses who had been carrying stocks which suffered sharp declines , or to those who failed to bolster their accounts in conformity with the more stringent regulations which were adopted by many firms . In most ' instances the responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . Those who put these selling orders into the market before the opening obtained comparatively good prices cn several days of the week . A Source of Supply One of the sources of supply recently has been the liquidation of small outsiders who have been carrying less than 50-share lots on margin . Several leading commission houses adopted the policy of insisting that lots of less tnan 50 shares must be paid for outright . Many of the small interests were not able to meet this requirement . Sonic of them disposed of part of their holdings to pay for what stock remained , while others closed their accounts entirely by liquidating and taking the cash out of the Street . While such selling was in small lots , the cumulative effect was felt in the market . Equipments Equipment stocks have not shared proportionately in the advances in the market for a long time . This was due to the fact that these companies were doing little business and earnings did not encourage buying despite the comparatively high yield obtained on the securities . When it was definitely indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for several years , the stock maeleet suddenly developed an uncertain tone , so that these stocks were held back during a period when underlying conditions favored a demonstration of strength . Consistent improvement in buying of cars and locomotives by the railroads must eventually affect these stocks , and there is a tendency in many quarters to purchase the leading equipments on a scale during any further sharp reaction in the general market , on the theory that they will be aiming the first to rally . The Reserve Action Announcement that the Federal Advisory Council had approved the action of the Federal Reserve Board and would recommend that member banks in each district be requested to coopetate to bring about a more satisfactory situation and prevent the diversion of funds for stock market loans was looked upon by most interests as a natural sequence to what happened in the past . In some quarters it was believed that knowledge of this approval and the fact that some banks had been notified of the request to be made had caused the withdrawal of the funds from Wall Street which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on Friday . Rediscounts and Acceptances Increase to 5 .. er , in the bid rate on 90-d.ri bankers ' acceptances is tnewed as significant because it compares with a rediscount rate in this district of 5 ' .. There is a feeling that this upturn in acceptance is one of the consequences of the prolonged meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank Thursday afternoon . Various opinions have been expressed on this situation . There is a feeling among sonic Wall Street students that the higher bankers ' acceptance rate means an early upturn in the rediscount rate . Others contend that the advance in acceptances will have the same influence on call money as a higher rediscount and therefore action on the latter could be delayed . Combustion lEngineering Action of International Combustion Engineering in holding near its high price during the recent periods of heavy selling in the general list has been impressive to market students . As a result quite a few houses have called attention to the stock and express the opinion that when the market has again turned upward Combustion will be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the reactions thus far . Andes Copper Andes copper established a new high record during the past week . The buying came not only from interests . dentifled with the copper industry . but from several of the larger commission houses and rtpresented a demand from many sections of the country . Andes is one of the low-cost South American copper producers and the high prices prevailing for the metal will mean substantial earnings . The company is controlled by Anaconda There have been reports of an offer for the miriority stock but these are not credite'l by those in a position to know the facts . Something along such lines may be done later on . however . Anaconda Rumors of a Split-lip have been in circulation on Anaconda . When the market has been holding steady these reports have been successful in bringing buying into the stock . United Electric C'oal Sharp drop in United Electric Coal recently has been attributed to a bear drive made against the issue during the absence of some of its market sponsors . Vice President Stumpfel states that there hat e been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the break . January production figures have not yet been compiled , but November and December showed that the company 's earnings v.-ere at about the same rate as in the quarter ended January 31. 1925 , when the period 's proportion of the regular S3 a share annual cat  --  dend was earned with an ample margin to spare . American &; Foreign Power American &; Foreign Power has been one of the sensations in the market recently . The stock has moved ahead in a spectacular manner , indicating that the floating supply is unusually small . Electric Bond &; Share owns about 500,000 of the 1,250,000 shares of the company and investment trusts are credited with having accumulated at lower levels , so that the amount available for market transactions must be limited . About the only supply is through the purchase of warrants on the Curb which permit subscriptions to the stock at S25 a share . These warrants have been moving ahead with the stock .                    @
