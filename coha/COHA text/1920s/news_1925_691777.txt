txt Country Air for City Children . Can you Imagine how it must feel never to have seen a green country field ? And Yet there are hundreds of little children who have never been out of the shadow of grim tenements . We want to give as many as possible of these children a breath of fresh air , a chance to see the sun on flowers and fields . Last Summer the Henry Street Settlement took 1,100 children to the country for a two- weeks ' vacation . For those who could not go for so long a period day parties to neighboring beaches were arranged ; 11,062 children and 175 weary mothers were given outings We want to take them away from the cruelty of the Summer 's heat in the city . Each dollar sends one child away for one day . We need help to erase some of the fear of the stifling days and nights from their minds by making it possible for us to give them a vacation in the country . LILLIAN D. WALD .
