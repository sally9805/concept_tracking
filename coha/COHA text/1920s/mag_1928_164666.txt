Monkey Trial <P> Nathan L. Miller , onetime ( 1920-22 ) Governor of New York , famed U. S. Steel attorney , was retained last week by Verner Reed , wealthy onetime Denverite , to defend a butler against a charge of cruelty to animals . The butler was Felix Solomon , who two weeks ago shot and killed a neighbor 's monkey that had invaded the Reed estate and was threatening two Reed infants . <P> At the trial , which was attended by many persons of large fortune and social inclinations , onetime Governor Miller denounced the monkey and eloquently praised the menial who had murdered him . " Monkeys are wild animals , " remarked Nathan Miller , " no game laws protect them , their bites are dangerous and the late King Alexander of Greece died from the effects of being bitten by an ape . This charge is ridiculous . It would be a fine country if property could be invaded by wild animals without any opportunity being provided to stop them . " <P> Said Lawyer Miller 's opponent , Assistant District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitten those children . . . . " <P> The jury of six men said that Felix Solomon was not guilty . <P> <P> Plunge <P> In Manhattan , Horace F. Poor , 50 , president of the Garfield National Bank , crawled out of a sick bed and wobbled to an open window . Once there , he made as if to leap out , down to the street four floors below him . As he did so , Ella Randolph , his nurse , scuttled across the room to stop him . Just as Horace Poor toppled over , she grabbed his ankles and held them so that he hung down head first , looking into the hot crowded street and waving his arms . <P> Ella Randolph soon began to scream and succeeded after several minutes in attracting the attention of a crowd of taxi drivers lined up at the curb below . Obeying her instructions , these piled the cushions from their cars directly under the inverted head of Horace Poor . Policemen visited a nearby hotel whence they secured a blanket ; this they stretched under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremulous cry , Nurse Randolph released her banker ; he sped down for an instant , plunged through the blanket and lay , panting and lolling , on the cushions . <P> Said Horace Poor : " I was restless . . . I went to the window for air ... I must have fallen out . . . . " <P> <P> Plunge <P> " I knew I could do it . It cost me $7,000 to finance the adventure , but I hope to get it all back and more besides . " These were the first words spoken by Jean A. Lussier , 36 , of Springfield , Mass. , after he had dropped over Niagara Falls in a rubber ball . <P> Jean A. Lussier was the third human being to remain alive after accomplishing this courageous and stupid feat . First was Annie Upson Taylor in an oak barrel in 1901 . Second was Bobbie Leach in a steel barrel in 1911 . Sixteen years ago Jean Lussier had worked in the machine shop where Leach 's barrel had been made . That was where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was steel framed , nine feet in diameter , with a sealed hole in the top and a ballast to make it stay upright . After completing it , Jean Lussier had been forced to hide his ball in a barn lest the Canadian Government take it away and prevent his stunt . No less than 100,000 people gathered on the river bank , most of them hoping that the ball would break on the rocks under the 155 foot water-drop.
