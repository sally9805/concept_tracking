At the Bronx Zoo , New York , vandals last week committed wanton depredations upon the caged beasts there . They shot the only Arabian Dorcas gazelle in captivity , a frail and beautiful animal . They threw stones at the only shoebill heron in the U. S. until they smashed its bill so badly that it could not eat and could scarcely breathe . They threw more stones at the sea lion until they blinded one of its eyes . Weirdest of the crimes was the dark attempt of a man to pull a cobra from its glass case by means of a cane and to carry it away in a violin case . Guards saw him ; he ran booty-less . <P> The shoebill heron injured at the Bronx Zoo is one of the most singular of all creatures . Five feet tall , grey , gaunt , spindly-legged , it lives naturally in the White Nile marshes . Its head is extraordinarily large , topped by a little curled tuft . The eyes scowl , when seen from the front , stare brightly in side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollowly when the bird gapes or preens itself . That bill closely resembles a shoe ( whence the popular name " shoe-bill " ) or the head of a whale ( hence the scientific name Balaeniceps rex ) .
