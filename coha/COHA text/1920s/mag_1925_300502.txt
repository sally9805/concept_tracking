At Durham , sleepiest of English " cathedral towns , " the former Nancy Langhorne of Virginia , now Viscountess Astor , famed original female M. P. , orated in part as follows to an assembly which she suspected of harboring Communist sentiments : <P> " Perhaps some of you men pretend to think that Russia is a Paradise . I shall call your bluff ! If I can find one solitary man , at present unemployed , who will agree to go to Russia and live there for two years , I myself will pay for his passage and for that of his family , if he has one ! " <P> Well pleased at this rhetorical flourish , Lady Astor descended from the platform prepared to make her exit from the hall in quiet triumph . Instead , unemployed males surged about her car , demanding that she fulfill her pledge-valiantly attempting to call the Rt . Hon. Lady 's bluff . Upon reaching home , the harassed Viscountess was " deluged with letters . " <P> Late in the week she hedged as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , my offer still holds good . "
