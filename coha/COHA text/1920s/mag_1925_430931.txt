Five years ago he might have been expressing , in a manner after his own kind , the instinctive sentiments of a large number of our citizens . To-day his position is no longer tenable . Europe has proved it . The remarkable growth of air transportation services on the Continent during the last six years , carrying close to 200,000 passengers and thousands of tons of mail and merchandise between the principal European cities , leaves no reasonable doubt that aircraft , as safe , reliable transportation agents , are here ? and here to stay .

" Mayor of Dover , " the Captain called him , in deference to his position as councilman in the Channel town that lies on the route of the English and French planes flying daily between London and Paris . A big , burly Scotsman , with a voice like a husky foghorn , he paced the bridge where I had been allowed to remain , and , between instructions to the yeoman at the wheel , told me of air transportation , while the winking silver line of lights of Brighton slipped behind us and the chalk cliffs of the Dover coast shone dimly in the moonlight ( see pages 269 and 273 ) . " It was the mail plane for Paris , " said the " Mayor , " " that first interested me in aviation .

RADIO GUIDED PLANES ENVELOPED IN FOG " What kind of weather it was did n't seem to make any difference ; on clear clays it might be just a speck in the sky , and then when the fog was on the cliffs , it would roar down the street just above the housetops and disappear in the mist over the harbor . There were times I could n't see it at all , and only the muffled  | roar of the engines somewhere overhead betrayed its passage . " I got to wondering how they found their way up there , in such thick weather , and then one day I stumbled on the secret . You see , my boy is pretty keen on radio and we have a set at home for the city concerts . One day , while tuning in , we picked up a pilot somewhere in the air , talking to the flying field at London . That chap was getting reports on his position in the sky and about the weather along the route ; thought he ought to be getting near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three minutes Croydon was telling him where he was ? over a small fishing village on the French coast . " Well , sir , that made me a bit interested , I can tell you . I began to read some Air Ministry reports about aviation and they opened my eyes . I found there were regular air lines all over Europe that could take you most anywhere you wanted to go ; you can hop into a plane to-morrow in London and fly right across Holland and Germany to Moscow , Russia , or up to Ilelsingfors , Finland ; or you can slip over to Paris and on to Constantinople , or down across the strait to Algeria and Morocco . " England is n't so far behind the others . I guess ; some 50.000 passengers have flown across the Channel since the Armistice , and most of them have traveled in British machines .

" An object for envy I felt , too , when a few days later I climbed into the British Imperial Airways bus at Trafalgar Square Passengers  | bound for the flying field ? and Paris . There were eight of us in the car , of whom five were Americans in fact , Americans form the major part of the cross-Channel air traffic . Two silent Chinese girls , in the latest European styles , sat wedged in one corner , while beside them a loquacious broadbrimmed Oklahoman held conversation with a stout , bejeweled lady from Texas .

AIR STATION PRESENTS THE ASPECTS OF A RAILWAY TERMINAL To any timid passenger the sight that met us at the field would have been very reassuring . An imposing row of offices and waiting rooms of the Dutch , French , and British services , a courtyard before the Customs building well filled with limousines and busses , a bustling and  | scurrying to and fro of tourists a n d attendants ? the normal pulse and movement of a typical railway station . The noon liner from Paris h a d just arrived , a French bimotored Goliath , and stood among a group of planes beyond a picket fence that separated us from the flying field . Its big propellers were still idly turning over , the last of its dozen passengers just emerging through a doorway in the fuselage .

You see , ' e was flying a bomber down there , and ' e dropped ' is load on the Hamur 's ' arem . " It is one of the boasts of the Croydon field that its customs officers are as expeditious and efficient in their sphere as is the aircraft itself in its own element . I soon found myself comfortably installed in the seat of honor beside the pilot in the nose of the Princess Mary , the two Rolls-Royce engines close behind me on either side , tinder half-throttle , humming tranquilly their message of latent power . A messenger came scurrying out , waving the final clearance papers for the pilot ; a burst of blue smoke and a rising roar from the starboard motor , and the great plane began to circle slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An airplane on the ground is an unwieldy creature , and we bounced along over the uneven turf , as the pilot cautiously sought the far corner , from which we had a clear run of the length of the  | aerodrome for our take-off into the wind . A sudden , engulfing , devastating roar , as the throttles of both engines were fully advanced , control wheel well forward to raise the tail of the plane , and we began to roll swiftly ahead , gathering fresh momentum with each fleeting instant . THE AIRPLANE IS A MAGIC CARPET BEARING ONE THROUGH THE SKIES One is scarcely conscious of the actual moment of leaving the ground until the absence of further jolting and the slight billowing effect , as the wings cushion in the warm air , make one realize with a peculiar thrill that he is off at last on his great adventure .

There is no sense of dizziness , no sudden feeling that the solid earth is deserting the feet ; just a growing sense of release , a feeling of age-old restraints cast off , like a sigh of relief from the soul . But the emotion of cross-country flight must be experienced to be appreciated . Like the taste of fresh olives , it defies description . There is a sense of exhilaration and freedom invoked by the spectacle of green hills and dales streaming rapidly away beneath , as one floats above with little realization of his own motion , save the knowledge that the checkered farm land just below in a brief space of time will be fading into an indistinct horizon far behind . Some remote atavistic instinct is stirred at this sudden break with accustomed limitations , flooding one 's soul with a new spirit of power and importance , as his magic carpet bears him swiftly through the sky .  | Flying a few hundred feet above a lowlying range of hills , we skimmed past several magnificent English manors , their well-kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road curved over the hilltop and down the valley , beckoning us to follow , while the everchanging and widening vista of the English countryside held the attention enthralled . To be truly appreciated , England must be seen from above ? " her sights and sounds , dreams happy as her day . " There was something warm and refreshing in this embracing vision of friendly cottages hidden in foliage , winding lanes bordered with hawthorn hedges , and the mile after mile of cultivated fields upon which the golden harvest now stood ripening , as we sped in an unveering line over hill and coppice . It has been said that an English summer consists of two days of sunshine and a thunderstorm , but our weather could not have been more ideal . The air was clear and warm , as we neared the coast , and from an altitude of 1,500 feet we could trace the gray waters of the Channel far to the north toward the Hook of  | Holland , and south to where the water and the distant haze converged on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MINUTES BY AIRPLANE The rays from the afternoon sun threw a shadow of the plane on the earth below ? a grotesque , miniature shadow that slipped silently over hedge and plowman and cottage , streaked across a field of yellow grain at the Channel 's edge , slid precipitously down the chalky cliff , and without an instant 's pause plunged out across the water . A score or more of vessels were in sight , one big chap , outbound for some far-off port , lying directly on our path , black smoke streaming from the stacks , its murky track visible for miles in its wake . Our fleeting , streamered shadow eclipsed for an instant the tiny-appearing passengers crowding the hurricane deck , plunged a minute later over an old schooner making lazily for Zeebrugge , and darted on over the gray Channel waters toward the low-lying coast of France , which now showed on the horizon . We were 22 minutes from Folkestone to Boulogne-sur-Mer , 22 glorious minutes against two difficult hours by Channel boat . The clean , white sand of Le Touquet beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland . Seemingly far ahead against the horizon hung an ominous bank of cumulus clouds , their flat tops in brilliant sunshine , while below the soft outlines of the open fields were submerged in shadow . THE PILOT GETS WEATHER REPORT BY RADIO PHONE DURING FLIGHT An aviator 's life is said to consist of hours of idleness punctuated by moments of intense fear , but the pilot seated by my side would have quickly put to rout such a slander . At the moment , he was  | talking into his radio phone , the mouthpiece of which was attached to a jointed metal sleeve strapped to his chest . I could see his lips moving , but no sound of words reached me above the enveloping roar of the engines mounted so closely on either side . He switched ; he phone to receiving and in a minute leaned over , grinning , to shout in my ear that Le Bourget reported the sky clear as far as Beauvais , and that he would fly above the clouds the intervening distance . Wisps of cloud were already drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very different and harmless they appeared when seen close by , tossed h y the slip-stream from our propellers , but rather frightening where the cross-wind currents crowded them into great pressure ridges towering hundreds of fee t above our line of flight , or left dark , foreboding crevasses in the cloud floor . PLANE 'S SHADOW SCAMPERS OVER CLOUD BANKS With a sudden rush , the green fields far below were blotted out of sight , and a damp , gray mist enveloped us , a sense of floating in some dimly lit , enormous ocean cavern ? then abruptly into brilliant sunshine again , while just beneath our wings , looking for all the world like a fresh-fallen field of snow , stretched the great mesa land of clouds . Among the many wonders of flight , there is a special and peculiar enjoyment evoked by flying in clouds ? a feeling both of arrogance and humbleness in thus prying into the infinite wonders of Nature 's overhead workshop , a quickening of the sense of " the incommunicable and elusive excellence that haunts all beautiful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors against the brilliant white surface just below , and prodigiously increased in size , scampered over the tum-  | bled cloud layers with amazing speed , its nearness emphasizing- the swiftness of our flight . Through an unexpected rift in the woolpack , a patch of dark fields appeared beneath our wing and the word " Abbeville " became discernible , written in big white letters on the ground . This is one of the intermediate stations along the airway where supplies and shelter for the airmen are available . My companion reported our passage by radio and received from Abbeville a reply that we were invisible from the field . The wind-scattered edges of the cloud bank faded behind us as the Cathedral of Beauvais came into view , casting long shadows in the fading light . Then Paris under a twilight glow , a tangle of red Q Aerofilms , Ltd. mansard roofs in the distance , with the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coeur standing sentinel against the crimson sky . Le Bourget was at our feet . The pilot reeled in his wireless antenna and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Customs building , the ground rushed up to meet us and skimmed by under our wheels , the tailskid settled easily onto the grassy turf and ? nous y sommes . " Have you anything to declare , des cigarettes , du tabac ? " asked a boredlooking customs officer . " Non ? Eh bien , passez . " And we are off for the Place de la Concorde in a big motor bus , tongues loosened as everyone exchanges impressions with his neighbor.  | It is hard not to look down with a touch of conscious superiority on the jostling street throngs , tired workmen , who have trodden the dusty road of common tasks , hurrying home , while for us all the heavens have sung of liberty . OFF TO TOULOUSE FOR A FLIGHT TO MOROCCO Not many evenings later I boarded a night train at the Quai d'Orsay bound for southern France . The lights of the French capital were still glowing in the sky as I tumbled promptly into bed preparatory for an early rise in the morning . It was shortly after 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same whose palm I had crossed the previous evening to insure against any midnight intruders attempting to share my compartment . " For ways that are dark and devious , " the French wagon-lit conductor has few superiors . We were late rolling into Toulouse , the northern terminus of the French air line to Morocco , and although it was scarcely light , the local field manager was at the Gare du Midi awaiting us . A few minutes at the Poste to collect the score or more of heavy mail sacks that had come down on the same train , and we were rattling over the cobblestones in the ubiquitous Ford toward the open fields . The air port at Toulouse is the main repair and construction field for the entire Latecoere system , but there was no time this morning for even a hasty inspection . A Breguet biplane was on the cement mat before the long row of hangars , its Renault engine idling . Upon our appearance a small group of mechanics precipitated themselves upon the mail , stowing the sacks in two large streamlined containers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower wing . A sleepy-looking paysan in a Customs  | uniform made some hasty notes relating to my passport and declared impecuniosity , and I scrambled into the rear open cockpit as the pilot began to taxi slowly away from the buildings . BEGINNING THE MOST MEMORABLE AIR RIDE IN EUROPE An answering roar from the engine as the throttle was advanced , wheels plowing through the deep dewladen grass , tail poised for flight and I was off on what was destined to prove my most memorable air ride in Europe . A wide turn over Toulouse , the street lights glowing dully through the ground mist . In the half-light of early morning the earth appeared dark and cold , and the crisp , clean rush of air past my uncovered cockpit made me thankful for the warm flying suit borrowed from a friendly mechanic at the field . The gentle valley of the Garonne lay sleeping under a fleecy sheet of light fog , the apparent complete suspension of life evoking in some peculiar way a sense of special virtue in our own animation . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the furrowed hills , a solemn double row of poplars guarding its banks . The black thread of the railroad now ran close beside it , now struck out boldly across the rich farm land toward where the valley narrowed before the encroaching Pyrenees . A grayish mist across the narrow corridor warned us to descend to a lower altitude . The whistle of the flying wires rose to a shrill pitch , as we gathered momentum in the downward glide . Wisps of damp cloud flung by , and then a sudden opaqueness , as we plunged with noiseless impact into the threatening cloud front ahead .  | In the damp semidarkness before me the glimmer of the radium-painted altitude indicator marked our steady descent from 300 meters to 200 , too ? and then we were in the open again , with the dreaming farmhouses just beneath and the tall poplars reaching midway up to us . Ahead looked unpromising . The crests of the hills crowding in on both sides were hidden in cloud , and the red-tiled roofs and yellow haystacks loomed up uncomfortably near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , marked by the canal . Pang ! A drop of rain strikes my forehead and smarts like a hailstone . The damp , chill air penetrates through the flying suit and the lowering cloud just overhead shuts out the morning light . A half hour passes . We dodge through a winding pass ahead , swing to the east again , and abruptly there opens before us a glorious picture of the breaking day . Still in shadowland , as from the mouth of a giant cavern , we gaze out under the  | black wedge of the storm lifted above us into the golden , sunlit country beyond . Through some momentary , drifting cloud the low-lying sun sends forth long bars of alternate light and shade , like giant chariot spokes , as if to guide us in our eastward flight ; and the whole countryside lies floating under a rising mist that covers the land with a transparent lavender veil . Such a glorious moment 's careless rapture is worth " an age without a name . " ACROSS SPAIN ON A SACK OF MAII , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light and shadow ( see page 282 ) , and the glistening waters of the Mediterranean appear ahead . As we swing by the eastern slopes of the Pyrenees , the clouds that had seemed so black and ominous overhead now appear snow-white , soft , vaporous , streaming south . Perpignan lies in a fertile valley at the eastern foot of the Pyrenees , and here we make our first landing , one hour from Toulouse , to pick up the mail from Marseille . The connecting plane has arrived before us with another passenger , a young Frenchman with military clothing samples for his clients among the fonctionnaires at Rabat . My comfortable chair is removed and replaced by a huge sack of mail : " ucitf kilos ea-cedeut " of baggage is wedged in alongside ; Monsieur , my new traveling companion , takes his place before me , while I mount solemnly on top of the mail sack , head and shoulders exposed to the wind .

Sun-baked white huts cling precariously to the ridges . Terraces , burnt dry , struggle up the hillsides . On our right the mountains rise sharply pointed , precipitous , gullies and pockets in their bare sides , patches of rough cultivation on their lower slopes . Dried river beds lie parched in the heat of the summer sun . On our left the great bowl of the Mediterranean , green to deep indigo-blue along the rocky shore line , silver-gray on N ON EUROPE ? 81 the shimmering horizon ; a few toy fishing boats motionless on its placid surface . The drowsy , friendly , comfortable purr of the engine which reaches us muffled by the cotton in our ears , and the deep drafts of cool fresh air have induced my companion to doze in the corner of the cockpit , his feet drawn up under him on top of packages of machine parts , the scarf about his neck waving languidly , like an ancient altar flame , in the eddies of wind above his bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental bull ring , its uncompleted Cathedral , is three hours behind us . Peniscola , that extraordinary cluster of gray walls and white fishermen 's huts clinging to a tiny rock thrown out like a button into the sea ( see page 286 ) , has faded into the distant haze . This is Spain , dry , sunburnt Spain , whose brown hills and relentless heat have burned themselves so indelibly into Spanish character . Valencia and its fertile valley lie forgotten to the rear ( see page 289 ) . w TRANSFER MAIL , TO A PLANE BOUND FOR ALGERIA Alicante at our feet , choking tinder a dense blanket of dust stirred up by the unbidden sirocco . The sirocco is as unwelcome in Spain as is the mistral in southern France . We leave our cool height and glide down slowly , skim over a fence of rough piled stones , and settle to the earth , kicking up a great cloud of yellow dust behind us , as we taxi to the hangar . What a contrast with the cool green field at Toulouse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to seethe in heat and the air is thick with suspended dust . No time for lunch . A cup of black Spanish coffee while the mail is being transferred to a waiting plane , a few pesetas to the sandaled , slatternly femme de buvette , and we are off , happy to rise quickly above the mantle of dust and breathe the clean air again . The hot wind off the bare hills clutches at the plane and tosses it angrily about , until we pass suddenly into the cool stratum above and make smoothly for the distant peaks of the Sierra Nevada ( see page 292 ) , far to the south .  | Monsieur nudges me to note the sunstricken fort and tiny harbor of Alicante , with the breakwater thrust out into the sea . As we watch , a seaplane takes off , bearing the mail for Algeria which we have brought from France . The following week , if all goes well , I will be returning from Oran , 200 miles across the blue Mediterranean . on that same hydroplane ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet , my companion produces a shoe-box , which he opens to reveal a dWcuiler francnis. vin compris ! " Here is good fortune , indeed ; and 3,000 feet in the air we drink each other 's health with red wine from a leaky folding cup , while the orange groves of Murcia slip away beneath and the sullen Sierra range unfolds in seemingly endless panorama ahead . A snow-clad peak appears , dimly visible above its companions upon the horizon ; two hours , and it has passed beneath us and lies indistinguishable among its neighbors , now far to the rear . Thudoes air travel obliterate ancient barriers . Tiny white villages , like clustering flights of egrets , begin to dot the great brown slope rising up from the shore .  | A group of fishermen 's huts appears at the foot of the cliffs , where a welcome beach affords a possible terrain de setours , should our faithful motor fail us .

ALHAMBRA PALACE A HALE HOURS PLIGHT TO THE RIGHT Our new pilot , who joined us at Alicante , is a tall , vigorous-appearing Corsican with leathery skin , tremendous hooked nose , and dark , flashing eyes . He points to the jumbled hills thousands of feet below , pulls his nose , makes a wry face , and shakes his finger disparagingly . The tanned kerchief about his neck whips in the breeze ; the silken sock which he wears for a helmet is much the worse for constant exposure to grease and oil ; and his sharp eyes face the wind without the protection of goggles . A valley opens out and Malaga appears , a welcome sight after four hours. * It is hot on the ground , and tropical palms , their fronds gray with dust , border the field . Up this valley a brief , cool half hour by air ? and most of a disagreeable clay by Spanish train ? lies Alhambra Palace on its wooded hill , Granada at its feet ( see page 294 ) ; and sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course that way , deserting the shore line for the inland route . But such was not our good fortune . In lo minutes we have transferred to a new plane , and with another pilot are off down the coast , the lower contours flattening out as we rise above them . Here at last the long Spanish coast ends at the Strait of Gibraltar , culminating in that strange , formidable outthrust of the earth named after a long-dead Moor  | Tarik ) . The wind sweeps through the narrow strait , scattering sudden flashes of white foam in the Mediterranean blue , like fireflies against a twilight sky , while beyond lies Ceuta on the Moorish coast , with the highest peak of its headland , the African " Pillar of Hercules , " standing out menacing , portentous ( see page 298 ) . @# SKIRTING THE AFRICAN COAST UNDER A PITILESS SUN The international port of Tangier beneath our wings , white , flat-roofed houses rising above each other in tiers of cubes , a solitary minaret jutting into the air , a gray line marking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To our left lie the Riff hills , where Spain is vainly bleeding herself to death ; before us , brown , burnt , and dead , the wide , rolling world of the Bled , the Moroccan veldt ; on our right , the restless blue of the Atlantic . This is the East , bright and shining as a sword , under a andrin pitiless sun . Here and there , on the lone , treeless plain , are flocks of Berber sheep , conical huts of the indigenes , and the clustered black tents of nomads . We skirt the African coast , where Phoenician , and , later , Portuguese caravels crept cautiously southward . The heat at this hour of the day , even at 2,000 feet , is stifling . From my exposed perch on the sack of mail , the blast from the propeller is like that from the opened grate of a furnace ; impossible to look westward , toward the burnished sun low on the horizon .

Then Sale ( Salli ) of a dazzling whiteness , ancient home of the " Sally Rovers , " and Rabat-el-Fath , the Imperial City , on the banks of the Bu Regreg , winding down to meet the blue of the ocean under high cliffs , through a brown-velvet valley ( see illustration , page 300 ) . As we glide down over the Residency , the sun slips at last behind the low , banked clouds on the horizon , in gray mist and secret splashes of fire , and the red cliffs across " The Father of Glittering " are reflected like a flame in the river .

THREE CIVILIZATIONS PASSED IN REVIEW IN 15 HOURS The blinding light of the afternoon has given way to a velvet softness . The rolling Bled upon the Atlantic still lies burnt and brown , but there is more water here in the occasional meandering stream than in the sun-baked arroyos of Spain . Roused by the roar of our engine , great storks rise leisurely before us and wing their way across a marsh , a study in black and white . At a bare Too feet of altitude , we skim over a low stone wall , behind which an imperturbable , worm-eaten camel stalks languidly round and round a water wheel .

The pilot dips down suddenly to a few feet above the broad Atlantic beach , and , with wheels almost touching the sand , we skim south , dunes flying by our wing tip , the pungent salt air of the crashing waves filling our nostrils . Thus we rush suddenly upon Casablanca , zooming up over the artificial harbor , across the white and yellow houses and ocher-tinted towers , and come at length to rest upon the flying field beside a military camp ( see pages 301 and 302 ) . In the cool of the evening I wander through the narrow , winding streets within the walls of the old Moorish  | quarter , the courteous chef de l'Acrodrorne as my guide . Veiled women slip noiselessly past , an indolent Moor in scrupulously white garments goes by astride his donkey , a half-naked watercarrier staggers under the swelling goatskin flask across his loins . here is the age-old , immemorial life of the East , a page out of the thousand and second tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 hours before , I was 1,200 miles to the north , across the length of Spain , engulfed in the tumult of a European city .

FROM PRAGUE TO BUCHAREST IN A DAY There were eight of us who sat in the crowded bus of the " Compagnie FrancoRoumaine de Navigation Aerienne " on an early August morning , as it pulled up the long hill out of Prague to the military aerodrome on the plain commanding the Vltava ( Moldau ) Valley . Of my traveling companions one was a Frenchman en route , as I , from Paris to Bucharest ; the rest were Americans destined for Vienna ? a group of college students and a young man from Boston traveling with his mother .

This is a bitter legacy of the World War , a regrettable schism that only serves to aggravate international misunderstanding ; but for those of us only momentarily involved , it appeared as an additional element of adventure , adding zest to our flight .

REGISTERED VOTERS ARE OBLIGED TO VOTE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA The frowning bulwark of the Hradcany , or Royal Castle , looks down across the green islets of the wide Vltava to the strange houses along the left bank , where the fusion of Italian baroque with the splendor of the Middle Ages captivates the eye .

It is an interesting fact that the screw propeller , an essential element of the airplane which was to carry me swiftly across Bohemia this morning , was the invention of a son of a Czech customs official in Trieste , more than Too years ago . At the aerodrome we found two Spad planes waiting , as there were too many of us to accommodate in the usual one plane . These winged carriers of the F'rancoRoumaine are not the most comfortable of the modern European passenger planes . but they make up in part for their cramped quarters by cruising at a higher speed than the more commodious liners in use between London and the Continent .

THE BOHEMIAN COUNTRYSIDE , IS A COLORFUL MOSAIC One hundred and eighty-five miles across some of the most fertile farm land in central Europe , lay Vienna .

Dark green-and-purple forest patches standing groomed and orderly ; long , narrow , undulating strips of alternating green and gold and brown ? new growth , ripening grain , and fresh , upturned earth ; a score of greens ; delicate shades of henna and silver-fox ; gray and blue flashes of water ; the white ribbons of roads lost for a moment in the cool shade of timber ; tiny teams of oxen on the crest of a slope ? while over all the dominant color theme of gold , the gold of the harvest . It is little wonder that Bohemian character developed , in such a friendly environment . With real regret I saw ahead the glistening Danube winding off through heavy woods toward Bavaria ; then the pilot was calling my attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle of Kreuzenstein , set upon a knoll dominating the neighboring countryside , its moat now velvet-green , its battlements upflung in seeming challenge to the indifference of a flying age ? a proud symbol of a cruel and chivalrous past . There came flooding back all my boyhood memories of " Graustark " and " Men of Iron , " and I was still lost in reverie when we glided down for a landing at the Aspern field . PILOT ACTS AS GUIDE , USING PENCILED NOTES In 20 minutes we were off with a new plane and pilot for Budapest . A heavyjowled Hungarian , who had taken the place of the Americans who bade us good-bye at Vienna , shared the small compartment of the Potez plane with the Frenchman , who had come from Prague , and myself . With true French courtesy , our pilot had thoughtfully prepared a scholarly typewritten description of the route , which was mounted on the bulkhead before us , and , together with a roll map case with which we had been provided , it served to shorten the Igo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we passed over the old Roman arenas and the chateaux , our genial pilot would shake the plane controls to attract our attention , and several times during the hour and a half he thrust brief penciled notes of comment through the sliding window behind our heads . But the first glow of the day 's enthusiasm was gone , and , even with the pilot 's energetic cooperation , could not be recaptured . My spirit was hovering above the Moravian Hills and refused to respond to the unimpressive vista of the broad and level Danube Valley , the yellow tide of the Donau Strom meandering between wooded , uncertain banks . " A moitic cheinin , " read the pilot 's note , and ahead we made out Komorn , a city half Czech and half Hungarian , at  | the confluence of the Waag with the Danube . Here the river turns somewhat northward to cut a tortuous course through some farflung foothills of the great Carpathian chain ; so we left it , flying , as a bird flies , straight toward our goal . THREE AIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched my elbow to note something far below us at which he was excitedly pointing ; it was another plane , a German seaplane flying low along the Danube , bound back along the course which we had just covered . Between these two capitals of the former Dual Monarchy , Vienna and Budapest , there are three competing air services ? French , German , and Hungarian . Each is subsidized by its country in an endeavor to develop a national aeronautical industry . Of the three , an unbiased estimate must yield to the Germans the best results with the greatest economy . It was past the lunch hour when we landed at Budapest . Our Hungarian , now on his home ground , lost no time in bidding us adieu and disappearing in the direction of the city ; but Monsieur and I had but a scant quarter of an hour to fortify ourselves before taking off in a fresh plane for Belgrade . A mechanic pointed out the lunchroom , a small stucco building at the far end of a long row of shops and hangars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge barefooted woman in a soiled calico slip was fussing about a stove , but our demands for food or drink of any kind or quality elicited only a curt , unintelligible response . Having exhausted our best English , French , and German without avail , we were about to despair when an attractive girl appeared , evidently the daughter of our formidable and unkind opponent . She entered the lists in our behalf , and through her efforts we were supplied with a cup of black coffee and some buns . Then came the question of paying : dreissig tausend kronen , 30,000 Hungarian crowns ? a tremendous figure in prewar days , but modest enough , now that a dollar is equivalent to some 77,000 . But I had no Hungarian money , and neither had Monsieur . With praise-  | worthy foresight , Monsieur , before leaving Prague , had exchanged some francs for Rumanian lei against arrival in Bucharest , and I was prepared to settle our debts in the coin of at least five different countries . None , unfortunately , was current in Budapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fraulein in my best schoolbook German . " If 18/ French francs are worth an American dollar , and are therefore equal to 77,000 Photograph from Levasseur Hungarian kronen , and if TO Czechoslovakian kronen are equivalent to loo francs , I must owe von At that moment the mechanic opportunely appeared to warn us that the plane was about to leave ; I threw down the assorted paper bills in my hand and fled ! A WELTER OF EXCHANGE AND CONFUSION OF LANGUAGES IN CENTRAL EUROPE It is a mystery how business can be  | rationally conducted in this hodgepodge of states jostling each other between the Black Sea and western Europe . Currencies that before the World War were counted in digits now have meaning only in multiples of thousands . Relative values painstakingly learned to-day may become obsolete overnight . To this welter of exchange must also be added the confusion of a score of languages , a constant source of irritation and friction. * Small wonder , I mused , as our plane sped southward and the glitter of Budapest was dimmed by the haze on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carpathians and the Alps should be the source of so much smoldering hatred and dispute . There is , too , an even deeper antagonism here , for this is the meeting place of East and West , of indolence and secret privilege , with enterprise and aggressiveness . As the Moravian Hills are the * See , also , " The Battle-Line of Languages in Western Europe , " by A. L. Guerard , in THE GEOGRAPHIC for February , 1923. watershed dividing the streams that flow westward from those leading to the Black Sea , so somewhere across this broad Danube corridor lies an invisible , intangible demarcation between the dominance of Eastern and Western ideals . A TURBULENT PASSAGE THROUGH A STORM A sudden severe jolting of the plane , followed by a painfully familiar sinking sensation , forced my attention to the fact that we were rapidly approaching a big rain squall . For some time the pilot had been gradually reducing his altitude and , as we passed beneath the cloud rim , the level floor of the Hungarian plain lay but a few hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . Fortunately , the squall was traveling our way and raced us along at 120 miles an hour . But the turbulent air was full of " pockets " and " bumps , " and caused me to wonder after a time if my hasty investment at the Budapest lunch counter had been perhaps ill-advised .  | At Kiskunfelegyhaza we overtook the storm center , an awe-inspiring spectacle of Nature 's pent-up fury unleashed on a hapless town . The rain lashed the gray roofs below us and ran in torrents through the narrow streets . The black spiral core of the storm threw out wraithlike octopus arms that reached down to the wet , gleaming earth , and clutched at us in sinister fashion as we slipped by to the south . But in 20 minutes we were out of shadowland into sunlight once more , the tumbled thunderheads behind us now gloriously white , towering I5,000 feet into the sky . Occasional flashes of silver far away to our right betrayed the sluggish Danube making lazily for the sea , and the placid , level fields beneath our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand partial corruptions . I let my eyes close on this tranquil scene , in involuntary relaxation from the tension of our turbulent passage through the storm . The muffled roar of the engine beat less and less loudly on the drowsy senses , and when I awoke Pancsova aerodrome was rushing up to meet our wheels , with Belgrade at the wing tip across the shallow Danube . PROCEEDING AT A " SNAIL 'S PACE " OF 75 MILES AN HOUR Five hundred and fifty air miles now lay behind us , while still some 28o miles to the east , beyond the frowning Transylvanian Alps , was our goal , the capital of Rumania .  | There was no time to lose , as the afternoon was waning . Hence it was with disappointment that I noted our baggage being loaded into a large three-engined plane , whose obsolete lines gave evidence of an ancient , however honorable , vintage . This plane I darkly suspected could not cruise at much more than 75 miles an hour , at which rate we would be most of four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field manager informed me that night-flying aids had been installed on the Rumanian section of the route , and that this was the " experimental " plane with which the test flights were to be made . The announcement , however , failed to elicit any enthusiasm on my part . After traveling all day at nearly 100 miles an hour , the idea of poking along through the deepening twilight in this ancient crate at the absurd speed of 75 miles an hour was very annoying . It is curious how one grows speed-saturated in flying . Then , too , the sight of barefooted workmen tinkering about the highstrung aeronautical engines did not serve to quiet my uneasiness . For one shamefaced moment I considered renouncing further flight that afternoon . After all , three countries should be enough for one day . Then the thought of bargaining in some outlandish Serbian tongue for Yugoslavian currency stiffened me for the original venture . Besides , Monsieur , my French companion , had already nonchalantly taken his place in the passenger compartment of the big plane . I resolutely mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were accommodations for six passengers , but Monsieur and I were alone . At the forward end of the cabin was a narrow door leading to the cockpit of the pilot and mechanic . A young French lad  | in greasy jumpers and leather helmet wormed his way in backwards through this doorway to hand us our passports , which had been duly stamped by the local customs agent , and to ask if the messieurs would be so kind as to take the forward seats , as otherwise the plane would be too tail-heavy . A COPPER TUBE CRACKS IN MID-AIR My new position brought me directly beside the engine on the port wing , a Hispano-Suiza from which the cowling had been completely stripped , exposing an alarming number of slender connecting pipes and complicated-appearing accessories . Was it a trick of the isinglass through which I was peering that made that long copper tubing along the base of the crankcase appear to vibrate so badly ? Some barefoot workman must have failed to secure it properly . With a deep-throated triune roar , the big plane plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time in 4,000 miles over the air lines of Europe I was distinctly uncomfortable . That copper tube vibrating in the 75-mile wind held my uneasy attention fixed . Then I saw it crack . From the broken end there streamed out , under pressure , a liquid which I prayed was only water , but darkly suspected was gasoline . I scrambled up to open the door before me and nudged the mechanic , whose broad back obscured the passage . He took one look and crawled forward hastily to notify the pilot . In another minute , with engines throttled , we were circling back from the Transylvanian foothills to the Pancsova field , fortunately not yet many miles to the rear . Half an hour later we were off again , in the same plane , the offending tube having been replaced by a new one that had  | been secured under the supervision of the chief mechanic . This was the only instance in all my European air travels when a flight was interrupted or delayed by mechanical trouble . It is curious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motors expressly for the purpose of avoiding unpremeditated landings . It would seem that often the presence of additional engines , rather than acting as a further safeguard . actually may multiply the possibilities of interruption , and that the wisest insurance is to employ only the best equipment , maintained at the highest standard of skilled workmanship . A broad white cloud lay brooding upon the outposts of the Transylvanian Alps , as we swept east 1,000 feet above , and the Danube swung in a wide arc to the south , searching an outlet through this last barrier to the sea . The brown Serbian plain was lost behind us in the glare of the late afternoon sun , while pineclad , tumbled ranges below us reached up through broken clouds . A strong wind at our upper altitude urged us forward , but it was already dusk when we crossed the deep-cut gorge at the Iron Gate and bade good-bye to the Danube at Turnu Severin , where it debouches upon the Wallachian plain . An hour sped by and waves of darkness crept down from the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drown the last steely glint of the evening sun on the little streams hurrying toward the Danube , now marking the Bulgarian frontier far to the south . Friendly lights rubbed at the tiny windows in dark wooded patches on the plain , a beacon flare winked eagerly from an emergency field below , inviting us to explore its welcome ; then a dull glow against the sky , a checkerboard of myriad flashing signals , and Bucharest lay beneath our wing , a great searchlight spreading its yellow glare upon the Baneasa aerodrome . That evening , through my window on the Calea Victoriei , there floated up the staccato music of hoof beats to the accompaniment of endlessly tinkling silver bells , as the youth of Rumania rode out  | behind the dark-robed Russian cabbies to mark the quiet stars . Royalty had withdrawn weeks before to the cool seclusion of the near-by foothills ; but the street life of the city still throbbed on . Barefoot peasants along the narrow lanes jostled soldiers in slovenly uniform ; a gypsy girl in brilliant scarf and rainbow-colored skirt chatted gaily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady rumble of the street rang out the sharp crack of a Russian whip and the warning cry of a muzhik . DANZIG CAUSES MANY COMPLICATIONS AND HEARTBURNINGS The unfamiliar sounds lent color to my fancy , and at length , as I fell asleep , there seemed to be spread out before me the whole great length of the Danubian watercourse , with the massive Carpathian chain and the Transylvanian Alps sprawling across it , like a sinister question mark , a symbol of the uncertain destiny of this strange , unstable land . Seven hundred and fifty miles northwest of Bucharest , as the crow flies , lies Konigsberg , the capital of East Prussia , near the shores of the Baltic Sea . An easy day 's flight if one cares to make it so , but I chose the more leisurely way , revisiting the capitals that had been little more than glimpsed on the outbound journey , and thence by air via Warsaw to the quaint old city of Danzig , near the mouth of the broad Vistula . The creation of the Free City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vexing problem for the weary conferees at Versailles in the spring of 1919 . But conceive , if you will , of the City of Galveston cut off from the rest of Texas by a Mexican " corridor , " its customs controlled by foreigners . Can you imagine the populace any other than wildly American in sentiment , its people restive and unhappy ? Thus , in Danzig 93 per cent of a population of some 400,000 are Germans , isolated on the one side by the Polish corridor , separated on the other from their relatives and business relations in East Prussia by restrictive customs regulations . Everywhere one meets two customs officers : the Danzig " Free " City agent who takes your money , and the Polish officer who relieves the Danzig agent of it .  | Trains from East Prussia to Germany go through Danzig locked , with Polish guards patrolling the vestibules . It becomes as great an offense to get off a train without permission as to board it without a ticket . SEABATHERS PARTICIPATE IN A CUSTOMS WAR One of the amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf of Danzig , whither the townsfolk spread during the hot summer afternoons to enjoy a dip in the Baltic or to promenade along the beach . Zoppot , the Monte Carlo or Coney Island for Danzigers , boasts a pretentious Palace of Sans Souci , which for many years has attracted a host of summer visitors from the Polish hinterland . With a foothold on the Baltic shore , Poland determined to build its own seaside resort ; and a rival to Zoppot came to life at Gdingen , just across the invisible wall of the corridor . Here the visitor was to be lured and Zoppot humbled by the simple expedient of a costly vise penalty to any Pole whose preference led him to Free City territory . But sabotage commenced . Bathers who entered the water innocently enough at Gdingen left it at Zoppot . Guards were stationed at the corridor wall , like " offside " referees at a football game . Finally an overzealous agent shot an Englishman who , while swimming without his  | monocle , had inadvertently crossed the line , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to firearms . The horrors of this guerrilla warfare were duly impressed on my mind one savage rainy night while traveling by train between Danzig and Konigsberg . Under the circumstances of this article I hesitate to confess my presence on a train , but it really was n't my fault . Three days before I had wired from Warsaw to reserve a place on the air line , only to be informed that all seats between Danzig and Konigsberg were booked for more than a week . This heavy traffic had seemed a little surprising , but the explanation was not long in forthcoming . The main railway artery , which reaches Danzig from Stettin and continues into East Prussia , passes through the little city of Dirschau at the bridgehead across the Vistula , some 40 minutes out of Danzig . And Dirschau is Polish . A glance at a map of Europe* reveals the territory of the Free City imbedded like a third molar in the Baltic jaw represented by the Gulf of Danzig , while between its roots lies Dirschau , the strategic railhead for all east-west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit his cousins , let us say , in Marienburg , East Prussia , not much more than an hour 's train journey away , he must pay $Io for a Polish vise for the privilege of riding five minutes through the narrow apex of land in which Dirschau lies ; and in all probability he will have his baggage opened by four different customs officers ? that is , unless he circumvents the whole nagging system by traveling by air . There is an air taxi service at Danzig advertising " Zwanzig Minuten nach Marienburg " ( Twenty Minutes to Marienburg ) , for which , needless to remark , Dirschau is not an intermediate stop ; and  | there are busses which will carry one as far as Konigsberg-without crossing Polish territory . I reached Dirschau late at night on my enforced train journey , without a special Polish vise , the dismal light of the long platform revealing the steady downpour of an early autumn rain on the sodden streets beyond . For ten minutes my fate hung gloomily in the balance , while a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave me with my baggage under the dripping eaves . Finally a kindly Pole , with whom I had struck up a casual acquaintance , assured the unfriendly agents I was a bona fide American diplomat , and that grave international dissension might arise were I detained . Thus I was permitted to continue , after being strongly warned to procure an additional Polish vise before attempting to return . Of course , I earnestly agreed to do so , with the mental proviso that I would not soon again wander so far from the friendly freedom of air travel . THE PROSPECT OR A RACE OR AERIAL COM MUTERS In contrast with this harrowing tale . the journey back to Danzig by air was idyllic . It was early morning , and the rising sun threw splashes of color on the green meadow through scattering clouds that overhung the Konigsberg field . The Nord Europa Union monoplane to Riga and Helsingfors was the first to get away : then the big liner for Smolensk and Moscow , carrying the Russian courier and several hundred pounds of diplomatic mail ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off in a metal limousine plane , scudding before a following wind across the ivy-covered university where Kant once taught . The streets were bedecked with flags for the anniversary of von Hindenburg 's defeat of the invading Russians in the swamps of East Prussia . Most of these flags were the old imperial black , white , and red ; here and there , occasionally , the symbol of the new democracy ? black , red , and gold , the flag of the revolutionists of 848 was rather furtively displayed . Where the Pregel empties into the landlocked finger bay of the Frisches ldaff , the sun withdrew for a time behind a misty wall and " the hooded clouds , like friars , told their beads in drops of rain . " A beautiful rainbow loop formed beneath us , thrown out , as it were , from our whirling propeller and curving upward to our opposite wing tip , like a magic golden ring , through which we sped above the sandy strip along the Baltic shore . The muffled roar of the engine penetrated but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions engaged earnestly in some business conversation , wasting few glances on the placid scenes unrolling beneath our feet . It may be , when a race of aerial commuters has been created , that many will fly , as they say in the " Bhagavad-gita , " like a spoon through soup , without perceiving the flavor thereof . But flight is an esthetic experience , as the quickening spectacle of Nature must always be , " full of a serious sadness and a large peace . " AIRCRAFT TO PLAY IMPORTANT ROLL IN ENRICHING LIFE The toy fishing vessels rolling in the trough of a Baltic wave ; the tiny figures of fishermen on the white sand stretching out their dark nets ; sudden silver gleams from wheeling gulls ; the rich green meadowland edging the blue lagoon ? such scenes stir the fancy and enrich the mind . Indeed , aircraft are destined to play an important part not only in the ordering , but in the enrichment , of life ; for they  | contribute to our control over our environment , which is the fundamental value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofs and narrow streets of Danzig lay beneath us , the massive monument of the Church of St. Mary , with its " Kunkle Giebel , hohe Fenster " towering above its neighbors ( see illustration , page 316 ) . We glided down for a landing at the Langfuhr municipal field , to await the connecting plane from Warsaw before pushing on to Berlin . Reflection upon esthetic experience must often remain abortive or incoherent , yet there is one quality I would express  | if I could . The freedom of flight represents in a real , objective sense a partial removal of the ordinary checks and restraints that normally impose themselves between our will and our actions , between impulse and event . There is a temporary harmony with one 's environment where momentary preference may be indulged without opposition . This is , of course , only a limited freedom , but it is , nevertheless , a partial , however elemental , approach toward that adequacy and perfection which is commonly designated as omnipotence . In this fact may lie some explanation of the deeper esthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight is past . But " to feel beauty is a better thing than to understand how we come to feel it . " It is September and I am in London again , having flown over from Amsterdam this morning , across the dikes and tulip beds of Holland , with a company of Dutchmen in a monoplane , thus completing 6,500 miles of looking down on Europe . Europe is big , but not so big that with such a vantage the mind can not retain a vision of the whole line and contour of it ? a vibrant , living picture . A VISION OF EUROPE One learns without conscious effort the geographical origin of so much of Europe 's history ; the inevitableness of misunderstanding and conflict where political lines have been flung recklessly across mountain and watercourse , now throttling an isolated valley , now barring an ancient people from their natural outlet to the sea . There comes flooding back the vision of castellated battlements along the Dan-  | ube bank ; of castles nestling in the German hills ; of chateaux , half hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm colors of the French countryside ; of ripening grain on the Moravian slopes under a late afternoon sun ; and of the bold , free sweep of the Mediterranean , stretching out in tranquil beauty to an unreal horizon . But the real , luminous beauty of Europe seen from above can not be phrased . It is there , now happily within the reach of every arrant lover of living , this precious gift bestowed by flight . But the deeper wonder of it is of the nature of things which talk does not easily pursue : in the end it remains something incommunicable , irrational , and final .
