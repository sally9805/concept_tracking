A new-sworn President 's first words are usually , " My Countrymen . " Excerpts from what new-sworn President Hoover said next : <P> Humility . I assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of Almighty Providence can I hope to discharge its ever-increasing burdens . <P> The Race . We are steadily building a new race-a new civilization great in its own attainments . <P> Coolidge . For wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to Calvin Coolidge . <P> But all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self-government must be safeguarded . The strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease . <P> Crime . Crime is increasing . Confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing . I am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the Federal Government to enforce its laws . <P> It is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the 18th Amendment . The problem is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the 18th Amendment . <P> To re-establish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire Federal machinery of justice , the redistribution of its functions , the simplification of its procedure . The provision of additional special tribunals , the better selection of juries , and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift . <P> . . . Intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals . <P> . . . To consider these evils , to find their remedy , is the most sore necessity of our times . <P> Prohibition . A large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens . There would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it . <P> . . . The duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is co-equal with the duty of their Government to enforce the laws which exist . No greater national service can be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Than that they should , by their example , assist in stamping put crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor . <P> . . . If citizens do not like a law , their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation : their right is openly to work for its repeal . <P> Inquiry . I propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our Federal system of jurisprudence , to include the method of enforcement of the 18th <P> Amendment and the causes of abuse under it . . . . * <P> Business . Regulation of private enterprise and not government ownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our relation to business . <P> Peace . The whole world is at peace . The dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world . No suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
