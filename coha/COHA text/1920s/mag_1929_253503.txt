It was 10:20 o'clock on St. Valentine 's morning . Chicago brimmed with sentiment and sunshine . Peaceful was even the George ( " Bugs " ) Moran booze-peddling depot on North Clark Street , masked as a garage of the S. M. C. Cartage Co. , where lolled six underworldlings , waiting for their breakfast coffee to cook . A seventh , in overalls , tinkered with a beer vat on a truck . Two of the gang drifted aimlessly into the front office where ink wells stood dusty dry . <P> Ten minutes later they glanced at each other , startled . Was that a police gong ? Into the curb eased a car , blue and fast , like the Detective Bureau 's . Through the office door strode four men . Two , in police uniforms , swung submachine guns . Two , in plain clothes , carried stubby shotguns . <P> The gangsters in the office raised their hands . Their visitors marched them back into the garage , prodding their spines with gun muzzles . Tin coffee cups clattered to the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north wall , their eyes close to the white-washed brick . The visitors booted the overalled mechanic into the line and " frisked " away hidden guns . <P> One of the men at the wall said : " What is this , a ... " <P> " Give it to ' em ! " was the answer . The garage became a thunder-box of explosions . <P> From the four guns streamed a hundred bullets . Only eight of them ever reached the brick wall behind the seven targets . One man , all blood , tried to crawl away . A volley at six inches ripped away his head above the ears . The others toppled over into the careless postures of death . <P> A Mrs. Alphonsine Morin , across the street , saw two men , hands over head , walk out of the garage , followed by two uniformed policemen with leveled guns . Obviously a raid and an arrest . She watched captors and captives enter the blue car , which flashed down the street , passed a trolley on the wrong side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the gabbling crowd that quickly collected . They counted the neat row of bodies by the wall-six dead , one dying . It was a record , even for Chicago . <P> " Bugs " Moran , the proprietor of the garage , was not among the dead . He was spending St. Valentine 's Day in Detroit . Moran inherited the North Side mob from " Schemer " Drucci , who inherited it from " Hymie " Weiss , who inherited it from the late great Dion O'Bannion . The perforated bodies were those of Moran 's brother-in-law and co-leader , James Clark ; No. 1 Gunman Peter Gusenberg , Con-Man John Snyder , Gorilla Al Weinshank , John May , the man in overalls , and Reinhart Schwimmer . Frank Gusenberg , Pete 's " Kid " brother , carrying 20 bullets , lived for three hours after the shooting but gangland 's curious code of honor sealed his lips against police proddings . Besides him , the only living thing in the garage when the slaughterers left was the Gusenbergs ' police dog , a fierce animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
