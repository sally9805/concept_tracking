txt DAYLIGHT SAVING . Why daylight saving ? And if daylight saving , why stop it as soon as one really might enjoy it ? In Summer we have more of daylight than we want . Yet we are hounded out of bed and an extra hour is forced upon us , putting so much further the comparative coolness of the evening . In the Fall , as soon as daylight becomes scarce , we are ordered to stay in bed an hour longer and make our day so much ' shorter . Daylight saving may be a good idea in the northern countries that originated it . But this is the City of New York , which happens to be of the same latitude as Barcelona , Naples and Constantinople , and here it is nothing but an imbecility . CYRIL MONK . New York . Nov. 3 , 1927.
