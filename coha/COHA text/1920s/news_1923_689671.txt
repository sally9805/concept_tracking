txt In its leading editorial of November 21 , discussing the French occupation of the Ruhr incidentally to the indispensable German " will to pay " her reparations , The Wall Street Journal said : " What is to be cultivated in Germany is the will to pay . The ability to pay would disclose itself usefully and exactly in the course of a friendly and intelligent receivership for Germany . Some people suggest to this newspaper that Secretary Mellon should be taken off his highly expert job to attend to this matter . He simply can not be spared ; but it will help things along a little if this occasion is taken to nominate Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes of Chicago , who is not afraid of a congressional committee , to say nothing of the German army . " It has now been officially intimated from the White House that the administration will " view with favor " the unofficial representation of the United States on an international committee of inquiry into Germany 's ability to pay , and the common sense suggestion made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times and the Journal of Commerce suggest General . Dawes as the kind of man everybody would trust . He was suggested here because , to speak frankly , he admires and understands the paper and never asks favors of it . Indeed , he is that kind of administrator who is much too intelligent to tie his hands with obligations received and ultimately to be paid for . For this very reason , as well as for others which will be easily understood by those who watched Charles G. Dawes set up the budget machine , and make it about the most efficient instrument of governrhent business this country has devised , he is not likely to be contented with a balance sheet Germany 's ability to pay , onpaper , as rather less than nothing . He had a problem not unlike this one when he took the Washington departments in hand . The question was not their ability to reduce their demands on Congress to a businesslike basis , but their will to do so . He had the loyal backing of President Harding , and he confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cooperate , until he convinced them that there was less trouble for themselves in the future in meeting the new requirements . This is what must be done ultimately with the German people . They must/ be made to estimate the industrialists who have exploited them in the cold light of fact , and above all they.must be made to see that the ultimate prosperity and freedom of Germany are to be , foundiu.the development of a - real will to pay , at present non-existent for all practical purposes . It is necessary to show Germany that honesty is the best policy . The French have succeeded in convincing the industrial monopolists in the Ruhr that the time has arrived to face the facts . The business of such an investigating committee would be to show the facts to the world , but , still more imperatively , to show the facts to Germany . But if the enterprise is merely another series of guesses of what Germany might do if she received an entirely undeserved restoration of credit , the inquiry is not worth undertaking . It is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of the suggestion are here pointed out .
