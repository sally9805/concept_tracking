The Senate Public Lands Committee , investigating oil , discovered that Edward B. McLean , publisher of the Washington Post and the Cincinnati Enquirer , had had a private wire installed between his Washington office and his home at Palm Beach where he was wintering . Besides , it secured copies of about 100 telegrams sent by Mr. McLean to his aides in Washington or by them to him . It was a Brobdingnagian discovery . <P> Mr. McLean was the man who ex-Secretary Fall had said lent him $100,000 . McLean , through his attorney , A. Mitchell Palmer ( first Alien Property Custodian and later Attorney General under Mr. Wilson ) , had confirmed this statement . Later , Senator Walsh of Montana had taken testimony from Mr. McLean at Palm Beach , in which the latter admitted that , although he had given Mr. Fall checks for $100,000 , they had been returned uncashed . So Mr. McLean was indubitably connected with the oil scandals . <P> Besides , the Senate Committee had secured some delightful messages . A few of them were in code-apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Francis H. McAdoo ( son of William G. ) , A. Mitchell Palmer , Wilton J. Lambert ( all attorneys for Mr. McLean ) , J. W. Zevely ( counsel for Mr. Sinclair ) . It was very interesting . Mr. McLean received more publicity than has been his lot in many moons . <P> The telegrams made one thing clear- Mr. McLean wished to avoid being questioned in detail about his " loan " to Mr. Fall . There was also a curious phrase in one of the telegrams suggesting that the installation of the private wire to Palm Beach would afford " easy access to the White House . " There was evidence that a telegraph operator at the White House had been employed after hours to operate the Washington end of the McLean wire . <P> Then The New York World discovered that four of the messages were in a code used by the Department of Justice , or at least a code formerly so used . The deciphered messages did not reveal much except what was already known-that McLean 's employees were keeping him informed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips as to whether or not he would be required to testify . In one of the telegrams Wm . J. Burns , Chief of the Secret Service , was mentioned , thereby adding his name to the list of those implicated . <P> At once the Committee began to summon everyone mentioned in the telegrams . A. Mitchell Palmer testified that he had acted temporarily for Mr. McLean , while the latter 's regular attorney was out of town . He declared that he had made no attempts to pull wires for the publisher , and denied connection with anyone else mentioned in the case . <P> Some of Mr. McLean 's employees were questioned , but without startling results . Mr. McLean himself was placed on the schedule of those to be examined . Thus , from one attempt to avoid unpleasant testimony , Mr. McLean has apparently got himself into an even more unpleasant situation , where more testimony-accompanied by more publicity-will be required .
