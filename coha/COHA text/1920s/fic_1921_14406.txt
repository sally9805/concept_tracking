THE scene is laid in the kitchen-dining room of the Adams home , a home typical of the tenant farmer class . It is weather-boarded on the outside , with rough joists and rafters showing inside . In the center is a table covered with striped oil-cloth . Two or three splint-bottomed chairs are set around it . Directly behind the table is a child 's high chair . At the right front is a stove with a fire going , and beside it a wood-box . Through the rear center wall a door leads into a shed room , to the right of which is a window . To the left rear are a cupboard and a flour barrel . Near the center of the left wall a door opens to the outside . On a string behind the stove dishcloths hang drying . At the right a door leads into a bedroom . Between this door and the window at the rear hang several old coats , a shawl and two or three ragged hats . An old organ is beside the door.1 The organ is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing from his hymn-book alone . Near the right front is a large homemade chest . When the curtain rises , MARY ADAMS is at the table ironing on a spread-out quilt . Through the window at the rear the sun can be seen setting behind a wide cotton field fringed in by trees glowing with autumn color . Beyond the rim of the woods a country church with its surrounding tombstones stands white on the hill . Somewhere far off a dog barks . Then there is the rattle of a wagon and the sound of the driver hurrying on his team . A great gap of silence hushes these sounds , and nothing is heard except the slipping of the iron on the clothes and the sudden " blump " as MARY sets it on the holder to turn the garment . MARY is a thin-chested woman about twenty-five years old , tall and pale of face , yet retaining a sort of wistful beauty . Her dress is poor but clean . Her eyes are red and dark-circled with weeping and sleeplessness . Lazily and clear from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll be no stranger there , They 'll be no stranger there , I 'll take my golden rocking-chairTo the River and set down . " Look up , look up that lonesome road , Where me and my pardner 's got to go  --   --  " The day 's work is done , and the negroes , with their cotton weighed up , are going home . MARY stops ironing and , holding the iron in her hand , listens with something of a rapt expression on her face . She goes to the window and stands looking out at the cold streaks of the sunset . Fainter and farther away comes a single negro 's voice yodeling high in the gathering dusk . " O  --   --  ee ! O  --   --  ee ! Hi  --  yo  --  o-o-o  --  ee ! " It too passes out of hearing . She turns from the window with a sigh . In a childish sort of helplessness she brushes her hand across her forehead and into the hair loosely done up at the back of her head . She returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes up the garment which she has been ironing . It is a child 's dress , suitable for a girl of four or five . Placing a chair near the stove , she hangs the dress on it and begins ironing another . The sound of a childish rattling cough comes from the room at the rear . MARY drops her iron and hurries quietly through the door , leaving it ajar . The indistinct outlines of a low wooden bed are seen . The spell of coughing passes , the words " My precious ! " are heard , and MARY comes back into the room . Closing the door softly behind her , she stands wiping the tears from her eyes . Then she clasps her hands and lifts her head as if to pray . But a look of rebellion comes over her face . Vehemently she throws her hands apart . Footsteps are heard coming up the porch . She starts impetuously toward the door , but stops and goes slowly back to her work . MRS . JONES comes in at the left . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap dark dress , bare- headed , and puffing with the exertion of walking . She is carrying food on a tray with a napkin spread over it . For a moment she stands just inside the door as if un- decided as to what to do . MARY ( In surprise ) Why , Mis ' Jones , I thought it was  --   --  p. 3 MRS . JONES Never mind , Marry , I just stepped over for a minute . ( She comes toward the table . ) Was you expecting somebody else ? MARY It 's about time for Lem to be coming . I thought it was him . MRS . JONES ( Somewhat laconically ) Yes , Lem ! MARY But come in and take a seat . ( She places a chair for her . MRS . JONES puts the tray on the table . ) I shore am surprised to see you . MRS . JONES Well , it 's a sort of surprise to me . But I 'd cooked up some different things for supper ; and a-setting there waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd run down here and bring something . Perhaps Ruth could drink a little of the chicken soup , and maybe you 'd like a piece of fruit cake yourself . ( She turns towards MARY and looks around the room . ) Where is she ? She ai n't bad off enough to be in bed , is she ? MARY I do n't know  --  she 's in there asleep . ( With a motion of her head towards the room at the rear . ) Yistiddy she said she wanted to lay down . ( After a moment . ) Maybe she 's better there in bed . MRS . JONES ( Looking rather directly at MARY and then away ) I reckon so . Guess you know best . ( She uncovers the food . ) This is shore-'nough cake , Mary , if I did make it myself . It 's got some of John 's scuppernong wine in it I snitched from the bottom of his trunk . p. 4 MARY ( Gazing hungrily at the food and then turning off ) You 're mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . JONES ( Blowing her nose in her apron ) No , no . Lord help my life . I got to be hitting the grit in a minute . John 'll be home after while and want his supper . And Dick 's there waiting for hisn . You know how men folks is . And John 's on the puny list too . ( MARY replenishes the fire from the wood-box . ) MARY Oh , set down , Mis ' Jones  --  if you can spare the time . MRS . JONES Wisht I could , but there 's my greens I left a-cooking . The thrasher 's coming tomorrow and they 'll be a passel of hands to feed . But  --  there I go about my fixings . How 's the child tonight ? MARY ( With a troubled look ) I do n't know . This morning she seemed to be better , but about five o'clock she tuck to coughing worse'n usual . Onct or twice she had a spell of choking with the phleagm . I  --  I  --  oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to the window . ) Take a seat . ( MRS . JONES stands watching her . MARY turns from the window , puts the iron back on the stove , folds the quilt up and places it in the chest along with the dress . Then she lights the lamp and sets it on the table. ) p. 5 MRS . JONES The soup 'll soon be cold . You reckon you 'd better see if she 'll drink some now ? ( Accusingly . ) Is that her coughing so ? ( As the child coughs . ) MARY ( In alarm ) Yes , but I  --  I think she 'll be all right soon . Shore ' nough she ai n't bad off . ( MRS . JONES starts toward the door . ) Better not go in . She 's sleeping now . And the soup can warm on the stove . We sure appreciate it . If you had n't brought the soup and cake I hardly know what we 'd ' a ' done  --  for supper . ( She sighs . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking on so . I ai n't done nothing for you but what I ought . It ai n't more'n human for folks to help each other out in spells of trouble . MARY Yes , but  --  I did n't think  --  and the way things has turned out ! MRS . JONES Now , now , that 's all right . I have been hopping mad about the way Lem 's done , but  --  well , just because you live on our land ai n't no reason we ca n't be neighbors . You know , Mary , we 'd ought to sorter pull together . MARY Yes , oh , yes , we had ought . MRS . JONES And if John does stay mad about the way Lem 's done him , it do n't mean that I ca n't be kind to his wife and baby , does it ? p. 6 MARY But Mr. Jones , he do n't feel for  --  oh , I reckon women folks had n't ought to fall out when they men ca n't gee horses  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , and soon as Sue told me this evening about Ruth being sick , I thought I 'd better fix some soup and bring her . ( Impulsively . ) ' Tai n't as if I had a houseful of little uns of my own , Mary . And you know Ruth sorter tuck to me the time you was at your daddy 's nussing the fever . MARY That 's so . She loves you about as much as she does me . She takes natural to most everybody . MRS . JONES Now you see , I wanted to . And besides it 's my duty . MARY Yes , but they 's plenty of folks in this world do n't do they duty . MRS . JONES That they is . And one of ' em do n't live far from here neither . MARY ( Turning quickly toward her ) Do n't , Mis ' Jones . Do n't start on that . He ai n't never said a harm word ag'in ' Mr. Jones . MRS . JONES I reckon not . ( She shivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got hot digging across the plowed ground , and now I 'm about to have the shivers . ( She looks around at the unceiled room . ) Mary , tell me , you reckon she caught that cold on account of this house being so airish ? p. 7 MARY I think not . ' T is terribly cold , but she got the starting of it last week . That cold day , the Saturday Mr. Matthews killed hogs , I washed up Lem 's clothes for the meeting at Prospect Church ; and she kept playing around the pot in the cold . I tried to git Lem to keep her in the house with him , but he was reading the Bible and working at his sermons . He did n't have no time to fool with her he said . That night she was all stopped up . And she 's been gitting worse ever since . MRS . JONES ( Explosively ) Well , I never in all my born days ! There  --  again , always  --  but  --  ( Seeing Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd caught it all from the openness here . I been after John to ceil the house before the roaring gusts sets in , but ( stopping ) somehow he wo n't take much stock in doing it . ( MARY sits down at the table resting her chin in her hand . ) MARY I know , I know . Set down . MRS . JONES Well , I will a minute . ( She sits . ) Do n't notice what I said . They 's more ways than one to git a house ceiled , and I reckon I 'll see to it or break a trace . ( Sympathetically . ) Must be powerful lonesome here at times , ai n't it ? p. 8 MARY ( Persistently ) I know the reason he wo n't ceil the house . It 's account of Lem , ai n't it ? MRS . JONES Well , I do say ! How come you to think of such a thing ? I never said a word about it . MARY But that 's just the reason , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . JONES Aw , Mary , do n't go digging up trouble before your joy 's spread . MARY ( Bitterly ) I know , though . He 's goin ' to git niggers to move in next year and plant a lot of cotton . Sue come from the cotton patch this evening to git a drink of water , she said , but it was just to tell me that Mr. Jones had rented to them another year . MRS . JONES ( Wrathfully ) The black hussy ! What 's she talking to you like that for ! You just let her come back to pick cotton a-Monday and I 'll make her cut a dido for that very thing . MARY Oh , I do n't blame him for wanting to git rid of us , with nobody to work . There 's our cotton standing in our field not touched except for the little dab I picked . And I ai n't picked none since Ruth was tuck . MRS . JONES ( Taking out her snuff-box ) Mary , it ai n't that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  ( blurting out )  --  Lem 's jest no ' count for farm work . p. 9 MARY ( Wearily , without seeming surprised ) Maybe not . He 's plumb carried away with his preaching . Says that 's what he 's made for . And  --  you know the way he feels about it . MRS . JONES It may be what he 's made for . But he told John , when he come to rent from him , that he 'd let preaching go and count his crop first . And look what he 's done . A quair thing when preachers ca n't tell the truth . ( Scornfully . ) Been off to tent meetings , and holding revivals and brush meetings every since last July . And here it is the first of November with just a day now and then at home . Never got all his fodder pulled even . Left it all for you to do . MARY Do n't blame him , Mis ' Jones . You ca n't understand how much his preaching means to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's good to me in his way . I understand him . But his religion 's everything to him , it is that . MRS . JONES ( Resolutely calming down and taking snuff ) Well  --  but anyhow people has different ideas on that . Have some snuff ? MARY ( Looking at her hungrily as she lifts a huge brushful to her mouth ) I 'd be plumb glad to , but I quit it long ago . Lem said ' two n't right to dip , and so I ai n't teched it since we was married . ( Leaning forward . ) That smells like Sweet Scotch , is it ? p. 10 MRS . JONES ( Holding the box toward her ) Yes , that 's the kind ' t is  --  good too . MARY It 's what I used to dip . MRS . JONES Then try a dust of it . Lem wo n't know . ( With a sudden thought . ) Now if John Jones 'd try to stop me from my snuff I 'd  --   --  MARY ( Pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lem . You can reason with Mr. Jones . And he kinder lets you have your way at times . But they 's something slow and awful in the way Lem does things . You could n't go ag'in him . He used to chew tobacco , but on the road one day God told him to quit it . And he ai n't never had none in his mouth since . MRS . JONES ( Bursting out ) There you go , Mary Adams ! You 're a plumb fool to be belly-banged around the way Lem Adams does you . Set here and eat your heart out from pure lone- someness , not a ray of pleasure in the world . And he off preaching trying to save souls . He 'd better sight be here saving his crop . ( With gathering wrath . ) He ai n't even been here since Ruth got sick , I bet you on it . MARY She ai n't been sick long . I sent word by Mr. Matthews this morning that she had a cold . The meeting breaks today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been expecting him all the evening . I thought at first that you was him . p. 11 MRS . JONES It 's his own good time he 'll take leaving that meeting . Oh Lord , child , I 'm sorry for you . My man 's hard enough to endure , but if I was tied  --  do n't look at me that way , for I 'm going to say it  --  Yes sirree , if I 'd married a spindle-shanked fool like that , always dribbling gospel from his jaws  --  oh , I 'd been in the asylum long ago . Cussing and fighting is better'n too much praying for me . ( Her snuff-brush works up and down with excitement . MARY rises from her seat . ) And what 's any of it worth ? Far as I can see  --  and God 'll forgive me for saying it  --  far as I can see , his preaching ai n't worth a cent . He might as well spend his time catching doodles . Yes , I do mean it ! ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pain . ) He ai n't fit for nothing but to stake out cows . Here he goes up and down the country roaring out the word of God , and he might as well be on a hill in a dark night calling cooshy , cooshy to a dead sheep . Suit him better  --  and he a treating you like pizen . MARY ( Half in tears ) You had n't ought to  --   --  MRS . JONES ( Continuing ) I ai n't never heard him preach but once , thank God ! And I did n't understand a word he said , and I do n't believe he did . The way he throwed his hands around in the air made me think of my old cat the day he got caught in a whirlwind of sand . ( She stops for lack of breath . ) But , oh , Lord , what 's the use of my preaching too . And you , a-standing there , pale and plumb wore out . p. 12 MARY ( Turning on her in sudden rage ) Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down behind his back . ( Half sobbing . ) You 're trying to tear up my belief in him . But he 'll show you all some day what a man he is . He 's got a great work to do . I married him believing in him , and I 'll keep on till everybody puts confidence in what he 's trying to do . MRS . JONES ( Sadly , sympathetic , but firm ) What he 's trying to do ! He ought to be here trying to take care of his family . MARY Oh , it 's been hard , lonesome  --  doing without enought to eat even , working my fingers to the bone , believing in him , trusting in him , knowing that some these days it 'd come all right and folks 'd see in Lem what I see in him . But  --  now  --   --  ( She looks at the floor to hide her tears . ) MRS . JONES There , there , Mary . Do n't . ( Blowing her nose . ) I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't keep on telling me how sorry you are for me and what a hard time I have in this world . Do n't I git to the place sometimes I ca n't hardly stand it ? If I had n't had Ruth I 'd done been raving distracted . ( She goes to the window and looks out . Several negroes are passing the road singing a medley of high-keyed women 's and low husky men 's voices  --  mingled into a far-away harmony  --   --  ( " We are climbing Jacob 's Ladder , We are climbing Jacob 's Ladder , We are climbing Jacob 's Ladder , Soldiers of the Cross . ( " We will wear them golden sandals , We will wear them golden sandals , We will wear them golden sandals , Soldiers of the Cross . " ( An expression of almost delight comes over her eager face . The singing passes down the road dying into a faint wisp of song . ( " Soldiers of the Cross . " ) p. 13 MRS . JONES ( Casually ) That 's purty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forgetful for a moment ) Ai n't it ! And do n't it make you think of sorter way-off things  --  with the sky so glowsy and cold and everything so still-like . ( She glances shyly at MRS . JONES . ) MRS . JONES ( A little gruffly ) Them lazy niggers ! They 'll chouce you out'n a piece of meat and a peck of meal slicker'n nothing , talking of how po'ly they 's getting along , and go home at night singing all the way like you hear ' em there . They do n't feel trouble no more'n goats . MARY Yes , but they ai n't no telling what they 's remembering back of all they 's singing . ( A tear slides down her cheek . ) MRS . JONES ( Embarrassed ) Do n't  --  do n't let a little music make you babyish . MARY That there music sorter makes me think of all I 've wanted and ai n't never had  --  and  --   --  MRS . JONES Oh , Mary , do n't carry on so  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss as to what to do. ) p. 14 MARY ( Growing calm again and speaking dully ) Oh , well , they ai n't a bit of use of complaining . ( In a queer abstracted fashion she begins picking at her finger nails , now and then wringing her hands together . ) But Lem keeps saying put all your troubles on the Lord and if you want anything to ask for it . He seems to understand it all . But everything is numb and cold when I pray . I ai n't never had no prayer answered . Lem says I ai n't never been changed from nature to grace . MRS . JONES Changed ! The idea ! MARY It 's all a mystery to me . I ca n't understand it . ( Helplessly . ) But he seems so certain about it all . He do n't even git worried no more  --  says the Lord 's tuck away his troubles . ( The child has another coughing spell . ) MRS . JONES Let me go to her . She 's coughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll ' tend to her . She may just be restless in her sleep . And one she ai n't used to might wake her . ( She passes through the door . The rattling breathing of the child is heard more distinctly . MRS . JONES raises her head quickly with a sharp movement of uneasiness . MARY comes back into the room , her face even more haggard than before . She closes the door softly ) p. 15 MRS . JONES ( Catching Mary by the shoulders ) Look here . Why did n't you let me know how sick that child was ? From the way she 's breathing she 's  --   --  MARY ( Frantically catching her hands ) Tell me , tell me ! She ai n't real sick , is she ? No , no ! What you mean ! They ca n't be no danger , can they ! MRS . JONES ( Pushing her firmly down in a chair ) Set still , Mary , and I 'll go in and see her . No , I wo n't wake her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may n't be nothing much to matter . ( Her face belies her words . She goes into the room . MARY rises and follows her with her eyes , clasping and unclasping her hands , and looking around the room as if pursued by a nameless fear . MRS . JONES reappears in the door . MARY runs to her , frightened by what she sees in her face . ) MARY Oh , Mis ' Jones ! MRS . JONES Child , child , why did n't you let me know ? She 's burning up with a fever . MARY I knowed she 's awful warm , but I did n't think it was wors'n croup . MRS . JONES Croup ! She 's got pneumony in both sides , bless God , if I 'm any judge . p. 16 MARY ( Fear blanching her face ) Pneumony ! But they ai n't no danger , is they ? Oh , they ai n't ! ( Looking at her beseechingly . ) MRS . JONES They may be . We got to git a doctor quicker'n that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKay 's . And he 'll be here in no time . Oh , why did n't you let me know ? ( MARY stands at the stove with a lost look on her face . ) What sort of medicine you been giving her ? MARY ( Coming to with a start ) You , you know Lem do n't believe in medicine . ( Wildly . ) I prayed and prayed for her all last night and all day yistiddy . But it do n't do no good . Lem says you must have faith . MRS . JONES ( Exasperated to the limit ) Faith ! Lord ' a ' mercy ! Here , I 'll kite across the fields and send for the doctor . Then I 'll come right back . Do n't be uneasy now . MARY No , no . Lem wo n't have no doctor . It 's ag'in ' his religion . You know that . MRS . JONES It may be ag'in ' his religion , but it ai n't ag'in ' common sense . ( Taking a salve box out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . Git a piece of flannel and we 'll fix a poultice quick . ( MARY goes hesitatingly towards the chest . The sound of a buggy is heard outside. ) p. 17 MARY I ca n't do it . There 's Lem now , I believe . Somebody must ' a ' brought him from the meeting . MRS . JONES Go at the door and see if it is . ( She rummages around in the chest . ) MARY ( At the door ) Lem ! A VOICE ( Replying from the outside ) All right , Mary . I 'll be there in a minute . MRS . JONES It 's him , ai n't it ? ( She lets the lid fall with a bang . MARY closes the door . ) Well , it wo n't do to have no trouble with him now , Mary . MARY ( Somewhat hopefully ) Maybe Lem can  --  oh , maybe he can  --   --  MRS . JONES Maybe nothing . You can believe in prayer if you want to . But you just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lem about how sick Ruth is till I git back . We 'll have the doctor then and let him do his do when he comes . If you 'd let him git in there to her now , he 'll like as not pray over her so loud he 'd bring the death sweat on her from pure fear . Now keep him from her if you have to scratch his eyes out . ( She hurries out through the door at the left and is heard greeting LEM as he comes up the walk . MARY straightens up , wipes her eyes , hurriedly tidies the room , goes to the stove and replenishes the fire , through every motion acting like one numbed with the horror of the news she has just heard . The last faint streak of day has died out . Now and then a stray negro going home from the cotton fields can be heard far away giving his holler . MARY goes to the cupboard and brings out some cold food . She breaks off a piece of the cake and nibbles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard . LEM ADAMS , about forty years old , tall and stoop-shouldered , enters carrying a small ill-looking handbag made of imitation leather and split at the sides . He wears cheap clothes , rough shoes , a derby hat , home-laundered collar without a tie. ) p. 18 LEM ( In a voice hoarse from the week 's preaching ) Well , how you been , Mary ? ( He looks at her kindly . ) MARY All right , I reckon . Supper 's about ready . ( He hangs his hat up and starts through the door at the rear . MARY calls out sharply , but half-afraid . ) Do n't go in there . Ruth 's asleep . You must n't wake her . Please do n't . ( LEM slowly sets his bag down and turns towards MARY . His face is ignorant and kind . There is a deadly sort of seriousness , a powerful will shown in his every action and word . He has the way of a man absorbed in the power of a belief or idea . ) LEM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me she had a bad cold . How 's she tonight ? ( Without waiting for her reply , he opens his satchel and takes out a well-worn Bible . ) MARY ( Bringing out knives and forks ) She 's better now , I think . Anyhow she 's asleep . ( He lays the Bible on the table , buttons up his coat , the sleeves of which are far too short for his arms , and goes over to the stove . ) LEM ( Rubbing his hands together ) It 's going to be cold tonight , and think of the poor suffering homeless ones with no place to lay their head . We sure ought to be thankful that we 're living in peace here , keeping our health and strength . ( Stands musing . ) I'as sorter surprised to see Mis ' Jones . What 'd she want ? p. 19 MARY ( Wiping a plate with a dishcloth ) Nothing , she just come down to see how we 're making out . LEM I thought she 'd been a-giving you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right good woman if she wo n't so wild in her talk . But , Mary , it 's set forth plain as light concerning them as talks about they neighbors the way she does . Sometimes  --   --  ( Hurriedly . ) I do n't mean no harm by saying that either . ( MARY stands near the door to the sick-room , as if listening for the child 's breathing . ) You say the baby 's gittin ' ' long better ? MARY ( Coming towards the stove ) I think she 's better . LEM When 'd she begin to mend ? MARY ( Calculating ) She must have had a change this evening about five o'clock . LEM ( His voice thrilling ) It was just about that time , Mary , as I was coming along the road I felt a strong desire to pray for her . And right there on my knees I asked the Lord to do as He saw best . And He 's seeing fit to restore her to health . Few knows the power of prayer . ( MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 MARY Yes . Oh , yes , I hope so . LEM ( Earnestly , with a worried note in his voice ) Hope ? It ai n't hope that saves , Mary , it 's faith  --  faith in the Lord Jesus Christ . If you could have seen what faith did in our meeting ! Old Miss Campbell , who 's been crippled for five long years , is walking about tonight because she had faith  --  faith in our prayers for her . Walking , Mary , walking ! Praise His name ! MARY Yes ,  --  faith . ( Bursting forth . ) But I ai n't got no faith . LEM What ? MARY ( frightened ) No , no . I mean it 's so awful hard to  --  to have faith . LEM Yes , that 's so . You sorter scared me at first with that wild talk . It made me think of your pa , and he such a cussing man , and how you 's raised in the times back there before I married you .

It 'll be like a stone rolled from your heart . Oh , Blessed Jesus ! p. 21 MARY ( Glancing at the door ) Le 's eat . The towel 's by the stove . ( LEM runs his fingers through his thin hair . He goes to a towel hanging behind the stove and gives his hands a dry wash . Then they sit down at the table . ) LEM ( Hesitatingly ) Ai n't you going to put Ruth in her high chair ? MARY Let her sleep . It 's better . LEM I 'd sorter like  --  never mind . Le 's give thanks . We thank thee , our Father , for what we receive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come from thee .

Save us  --   --  ( Here the child begins coughing and MARY in her nervousness knocks over a cup . ) For Jesus ' sake , Amen ! MARY ( Breaking out ) I just ca n't stand to hear her cough so much . LEM ( Speaking kindly , but rebukingly ) You had n't ought to break right in on the blessing like that . ( He looks at her and then at the meal before him . ) Why , where is all your supper , Mary ? p. 22 MARY I ai n't got nothing but this . The flour give out two or three days ago . And  --  and  --  yes , I was about to forget a special I had for you . ( She rises and goes to the cupboard and gets the cake . ) Here 's some fruitcake . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner of affection and smiling somewhat boyishly . ) It shore was good of you to save it for me . ( He buries his teeth in it . ) It 's fine , all right . Ai n't you going to eat ? MARY No , I do n't want nothing . I et just before you come in . ( She goes to the stove and replenishes the fire . ) LEM ( Roused by the noise of the stove door and the crackle of the flames ) Ironing ag'in , air you ? MARY I 'm trying to . They ai n't been a thing ironed since you left . But the irons wo n't heat with nothing to burn but chips and pine bark . LEM ( Rising from the table ) I 'll cut you some wood a-Monday . You ironed that streaked shirt and low collar yet ? MARY I was just fixing to . They 're out on the line now . I better git ' em . ( She goes through the door at the right .

They were shed for one that had gone astrayEre the Shepherd could  --   --  " With a rush MARY comes back into the room carrying the skirt and collar . She runs to LEM and pulls at his arm. ) p. 23 MARY Lem , Lem , do n't do that . Ruth ca n't sleep . Please quit . ( After a minute he stops playing . ) LEM ( Turning around slowly as he closes the organ ) Oh , I forgot , Mary . But that wo n't wake her , will it ? And what you want her to go to sleep for right here at dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her to sleep a while ago . LEM ( Coming towards the table ) It seems so natural to play a piece after supper that I  --  well , go ahead and iron them things . I 'll need ' em tomorrow , if the Lord 's willing . MARY You ai n't going off to preach ag'in , are you , Lem ? LEM Do n't ask me not to , Mary . MARY I  --  I  --  kinder thought you 'd  --   --  LEM ( Turning away his face ) Do n't start that old tale ag'in . ( He stands in silence a moment and then flames out . ) Ca n't you see ? It 's my work . ( Fiercely . ) I got to . I ai n't one of them highfaluting preachers serving God for the money . I 'm called to do it . They ai n't no rest for me ' less I 'm preaching . ( His eyes flash and he nervously clutches the Bible as it lies on the table. ) p. 24 MARY I know . ( Somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ) People do n't understand me . They abuse me , talk about me , and accuse me . But let ' em talk . Did n't they persecute the Master ? And He said in His Holy Writ:Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake . Did n't He say for us to be glad of it ? For so they persecuted the prophets . And great shall be my reward in Heaven . Praise His name ! ( His voice is earnest , glowing with the power of his feeling . MARY , no longer able to contend against him , sits down , holding the ironing cloth idly in her hand . The strained and hunted look in her face grows more accentuated . For a moment LEM stands silently looking at the Bible . RUTH coughs and struggles for breath . MARY springs to her feet and runs to the door . LEM , on whose face has come a look of pain at hearing the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY Do n't bother to come in , Lem . I 'll just smooth out her pillow so she can sleep better . ' Tai n't nothing much . ( LEM seems to mistrust her and makes a move as if to go into the room . In fright MARY clutches his arm . ) Let me ' tend to her . A touch of croup ai n't nothing . ( She pushes him from the door , and closes it behind her . LEM clearly shows that he realizes something is wrong . He falls on his knees and prays in a barely audible voice , clasping and unclasping his hands . Now and then the words , " Heal her , Lord ! Heal her , Lord ! if it is Thy will , " are heard . As MARY comes back into the room , he rises and taking a dirty blue and white-striped handkerchief from his pocket , wipes his moist face with trembling hands. ) p. 25 MARY ( Feelingly ) She 's resting all right . ( Loudly , as if trying to calm herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a bad cold . She 'll be plumb well in the morning and wanting to set in her chair . LEM ( Visibly relieved ) I 'm shore glad tai n't nothing worser'n that . I wanted to come home soon 's I heard about it this morning , but I could n't leave the meeting . ( Piously . ) What a privilege it is to have a Friend who will take all our sorrows upon Him  --  and we can know that all things work for the good of those that love the Lord  --  and He alone knows how I love Him . MARY ( Briskly ) It 's all right . I been ironing a dress so me and her could go down to pa 's tomorrow . Anyhow I was ironing it  --  and  --   --  ( She suddenly sobs . ) LEM ( Half amazed ) Why , what 's there to be crying about ? ( With a sudden light dawning on him . ) Now , if it 's Ruth you 're worrying about , do n't you know you need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knows what is best . Put your trust in Him . ( He speaks kindly but firmly , like one reasoning with a child . With an effort MARY holds back her tears and begins clearing away the dishes . LEM picks up his Bible and sits down near the lamp . From his jacket pocket he pulls out a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles and puts them on . He begins thumbing the leaves of the book . MARY sits a moment as if lost in thought and then springs up suddenly , spreads the quilt back on the table , goes to the stove for the iron and begins ironing. ) p. 26 LEM We had n't ought to worry about what we ai n't got no control over . The Lord of Hosts has got this world in His keeping . Listen here . ( Reading . ) See now that I , I am He , and there is none good besides Me . I kill and I make alive . I wound and I heal . Ai n't that plain ? ( He turns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let us return unto the Lord , for He hath torn and He will heal us . He hath smitten and He will bind us up . MARY It might be so , yet I ca n't , I ca n't understand it . But Lem , if Ruth  --  if Ruth 's sick tomorrow , you wo n't go off , will you ? LEM I 'd love to stay with her , but  --   --  ( Closing the Bible firmly . ) You know I ai n't going to let nothing stand in the way of service , Mary . I ca n't neglect my duty . I 'll leave her in the hands of God . MARY ( Coming around the table towards him ) Lem , I  --  I  --  wish you would n't go . It 's so lonesome here . Why ca n't you stay at home and let the preaching be for one time ? ( Somewhat defiantly . ) What 's it all for anyhow ? LEM ( More amazed ) What you mean by saying that ? Ca n't you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be , and a fool , though a wayfaring man , can understand . Why , why do you act like you do ? Here 's the Book sent as a lamp to your feet and you wo n't heed it . Do n't you remember He said , Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel  --  and whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple ? ( He stands up and speaks humbly . ) I felt His power this morning in the meeting . I know He speaks through me  --  to help save this poor sinful world . Oh , do n't tempt me from my duty ! p. 27 MARY ( With a sob in her voice ) And what sort of people is it you preach to ? All the common trash in the neighborhood . The best folks , them that has work to do , do n't waste their time at meetin 's when they 're housing their crops . LEM Mary , you ought to be thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doggedly ) Lem , I always let you convince me because I wanted to believe in you . But somehow , it 's changed now , and something 's got to be done . For one thing , we ca n't live on your preaching . It takes money . LEM Money do n't count Mary . Was n't He a poor man ? ( Sympathetically . ) I know we have got to have some money . I 'll try to fix it somehow . They took up a collection for me down at the meeting . But Brother Jenkin 's family is all down with the flus , and I turned it over to them , remembering it is more blessed to give  --   --  MARY ( Now angry ) And here your own child sick and we with hardly a bite . LEM ( Trying to be patient ) But , Mary , ca n't I convince you ? Listen here  --   --  ( Turning through the Bible. ) p. 28 MARY ( Half turning upon him ) Ai n't  --  Oh , who could answer your scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money when serving God . Did n't He tell His disciples to take no thought of money or clothes ? ( Firmly . ) Now let 's have no more words about it . MARY ( Her voice rising high and nervous ) I 'm going to have it out about this preaching . ( Half sneering . ) Preaching ! I heard them niggers yistiddy laughing about you being off preaching . ( Vehemently . ) They even make fun of you and your education . LEM ( Hurt and angered , looking at her ) What ails you tonight ? You ai n't never talked to me this way . ( Letting his arms fall in a despairing gesture . In a hurt , proud voice . ) Them niggers laughed at me ! Well it 's not them I heed . And what 's education got to do with it ! If God wants you to preach , He 'll put words in your mouth . I ai n't never lacked for nothing to say . MARY ( Hysterically ) Why ? Why ? But , Lem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and  --   --  p. 29 LEM Hush , Mary . I told you it was wrong in me to promise when I did n't know what work the Lord would call on me to do . I got forgiveness for that promise  --  ( Raising his hand. )  --  and I 'll never make another'n like it ag'in . ( Forgetting himself . ) It was all on account of you that I promised . No  --  no  --  I did n't mean that , Mary . MARY ( With growing wrath ) Yes , account of me ! LEM After tomorrow I am going to work on the crop , shore ' nough I will and that 's a fact . They wo n't be much more preaching until next summer . But you ought to help me , Mary , encourage me and not do all you can to pull me down . They ai n't nothing bigger than the Lord 's work . Why ca n't it be like it was when we started out together ? It 's hard , I know . But I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold  --  and you sha n't want , and then on to bigger things for His name 's honor and glory . But I need your help , Mary , you must help me . MARY ( Fighting to understand , and yet helplessly angry at him ) I 've helped you all I can and nothing do n't come of it . I reckon you wisht I was out of the way . I 've always been a drawback to you . LEM ( Contritely ) Do n't say that , Mary . Let 's not quarrel . We must help each other . You know we 'd ought to sorter pull together . p. 30 MARY Yes , I have been a hindrance to you and you know it . We wa' n't made for each other . We wa' n't . I love to work on the farm and live respectable and have things a woman likes . ( Recklessly . ) And you 're fit for nothing but preaching and praying and reading that old Bible . LEM ( Horrified ) Mary , what you saying ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I hate it . Why do n't you leave me , you and your scripture ! I do n't understand it , I  --   --  ( Helplessly . ) Oh , everything is  --  in a mess ! You , you , ai n't got no feelings for nothing but your Jesus and God and  --   --  LEM ( Sternly ) Stop that talk ! MARY ( Crying out ) I wo n't , I wo n't ! What 's He ever done for me but hurt me ! LEM ( Thundering ) Stop saying that ! MARY ( Sobbing ) I hate it , I hate God  --  all of it ! ( Wildly . ) Oh , I ai n't afraid of your hell fire  --  and brimstone and burning pit  --   --  p. 31 LEM ( In awe ) That 's blasphemy . It 's a wonder He do n't strike you dead . MARY ( Coming towards LEM ) I tell you they ai n't no God . It 's all lies and talk . He would n't allow things to be like this if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a senseless stammer . The terrified expression deepens on LEM 'S face . He moves away from her . MRS . JONES is heard coming up the steps . She hurries in out of breath . Her eyes show that she has been weeping . ) MRS . JONES Mary , I sent for him , and he 'll be right along . ( With a defiant look at LEM . ) And I brought some medicine back , too . LEM ( Staring around him as in a dream ) What 's all this mean ? Is there  --   --  ( Turning quickly towards MARY . ) Mary  --  Oh , Mary !  --  ( Suddenly from the sick-room comes a scream and the sound of the child struggling for breath , then a cry : " Mamma ! Mamma ! " With a bound MARY is in the room and at the bed . MRS . JONES hurries after her . LEM , left alone , stands a moment as if dumb-founded , and then runs to the bedside of the child . After a moment MRS . JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears from her eyes and goes back into the room . LEM mechanically twists his hands together , crying out. ) p. 32 LEM Oh , Lord , it ca n't be so ! It ca n't be so ! Spare me ! Spare me ! ( With a hysterical cry MARY comes through the door . Her eyes are almost wild now . As she sees LEM , a look of hatred comes over her face . With a scream she throws herself at him , clutching wildly at his throat . Dazed and uncomprehending , he holds her from him . ) MARY It is so ! It is so ! She 's gone  --  gone ! ( LEM catches sight of the Bible . Eagerly he picks it up . Outside the singing of the homegoing negroes can be heard . ( " See them children come dressed in red , Do n't you see ? See them children come dressed in red  --  Must be the children what Pharyoh led.I got a home in the rock , Do n't you see ? " ) LEM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word with its promise . ( He looks indefinitely around the room as if seeking aid from the bare walls . Dropping the Bible , he starts toward MARY , a sob in his throat . ) We 've got each other , Mary , and  --   --  MARY ( With a great cry , her voice rising high in a crescendo of final hopeless yielding . ) She 's dead  --  dead ! You hear ! Ruth 's dead  --  dead land , oh  --   --  ( Her voice goes out of her with a gasp . Sinking into a chair , she bursts into a wild scornful laugh . LEM , as if in a maze , brushes his hand across his forehead again and again . The singing of the negroes passes out of hearing . Suddenly she springs up and throwing back her head , cries out to the empty air . ) It 's You ! You ! Setting up there on your golden throne ! ( She begins laughing and moaning again . LEM covers his face with his arm to escape from her wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his knees by the bed . Far away a single negro 's voice comes back cold and high : )
