John William Davis , 1924 Democratic presidential nominee , onetime ( 1918-21 ) Ambassador to Great Britain , last week delivered the annual Stafford Little lectures at Princeton University. * His subject : " Party Government in the United States . " In his first lectures he said : " A little more genuine and widespread effort in the line of strict party service by our so-called ' best citizens ' would work a greater revival in this country than all the prayers and preachments of all the reformers . " In his second lecture , after mocking at the pretentious , windy , ambiguous pronouncements of the quadrennial party platforms , he said : " Why not at the last session of every Congress preceding an election have a party manifesto framed , agreed to and officially promulgated by the representatives of the party in the Senate and House ? " <P> *Previous Stafford Little lecturers : Charles Evans Hughes , Theodore Roosevelt , Elihu Root , Grover Cleveland .                  @ @ @
