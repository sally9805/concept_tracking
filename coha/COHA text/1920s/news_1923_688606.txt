txt On the day when Masan ? HANIHAP , A , the newly appointed Japanese . Ambassador to the United States , touching at Honolulu on his way to this country , stated that Japan was satisfied with the working of the " Agreement ? ? to keep Japanese laborers out of the United States . the House Committee on Immigration approved an amendment to the Irrimi ! ; : a.titin law , as follows : An immigrant not eligible to citizenship shall not be admitted to the United States unless within the class specified in subdivision C. E , or II of Section 4% or unless the wife or minor child of an immigrant described in such subdivision E. The exceptions Indicated-are ministers of the Gospel , processors of colleges and seminaries , members of any recognized learned profession , students I and returning immigrants who have resided in the country before the " Gentlemen 's Agreement " went into effect . Chairman JOHNSON says : This provision is in accordance with the United States Supreme Court decision ( that persons of yellow or nonCaucasian races are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ziny treaties . In , this provision we are only attempting to write into law the terms of the " Gentlemen 's Agreement " between the United States and Japan . What the committee is really trying to do is to put on the statute book an exclusion law aimed at the Japanese , whose honor is involved in living up to the " Gentlemen 's Agreement . " They have professed to be satisfied with it because an edict of exclusion was thus avoided . Professor H. A. Idir ... Lis of the University of Kansas in his book . " The Japanese Problem in the United States , " maintains that an exclusion law would be an affront to Japan . He says : Certainly the control of immigration under the agreement with Japan has been more effective than our admin1 istration of an exclusion act would be with less co-operation on the part of her Government . ? ? ? To enact such a law so long as the Japanese Government faithfully observes the agreement entered into in 190.7 would be too serious an affront to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command the treatment due a firstclass nation . In its memorial presented to President Wir-sox on his visit to San Franrisco in September , 1919 , the Japanese Association of America declared that when the " Gentlemen 's Agreement " was accepted the United States Government in effect agreed " not to subject the Japanese to the humiliation " of an exclusion act . " It was asserted in the memorial that " the admis " Sion of Japanese under the passport " system has worked out with fewer " abuses than the admission of Chi " nese under the exclusion laws which we administer ourselves . " Californians might take issuo with this statement , but even they would admit that the Japanese Government has endeavored in good faith to carry out the " Gentlemen 's Agreement . " It would be fairer and more friendly to Japan to amend that compact in order to add to its security than to enact an exclusion law which classified , her people with the Chinese and low-caste Hindus and at the same time was a reflection upon her good faith .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
