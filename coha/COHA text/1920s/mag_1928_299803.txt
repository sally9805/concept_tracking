But the hearing of testimony germane to the murders gave way before the information of a stream of truck drivers , brewery bosses , alcohol dealers and other nondescript employees of what began to loom with increasing clarity as a monster liquor ring in the Philadelphia underworld . <P> Figures . Paramount figures in the inquiry have been Max ( " Boo Boo " ) Hoff , sports promoter and alleged bootleg tsar ; Louis R.

A man who sees everything , knows everything and controls everything in the underworld , " said Mr. Monaghan , but did not name any name . The diversion of 350,000 gallons of pure grain alcohol from Philadelphia throughout the land was described as the Master Mind 's greatest recent coup .
