ADVENTURES or AN AFRICAN SLAVER , Being a True Account of the Life of Captain Theodore Canot , Trader in Gold , Ivory &; Slaves on the Coast of Guinea : His Own Story as told in the Year 1854 to Brantz Mayer &; Now Edited with an Introduction by Malcolm Cowley-A . &; C. Bom ( $4 ) . <P> A derelict sea-captain , cadging drinks on the Baltimore wharves ( according to the present editor ) , accosted one Brantz Mayer , swapped yarns for liquor . The captain , the accosted , the yarns , are all of a piece with garrulous South African traders who peddle reminiscence with their kitchenware . In pleasant 19th century cadences Mayer sets down the story of this Canot , Italian by birth , American by adoption , who sailed the last legal slaver before the trade was outlawed . Forced thereafter to bootleg his valuable black cargo , he practiced the proverbial sardine economy of space in his barracoon , packing his human loot spoon fashion , so that each wretch lay curved in his neighbor 's lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fellow ' legger . The law read that a slaver suspect could not be confiscated unless at the time of capture there were actually slaves aboard . That a slaver could be smelled " five miles down the wind " made camouflage the more difficult , and upon such a reeking suspect four war-vessels one day descended . Fortunately for the suspect captain , the law was becalmed long enough for him to drop his 600 slaves overboard , chained to the anchor . <P> Such fate was nevertheless preferable to the treatment the blacks would have suffered as convicts or prisoners-of-war in Africa . Prisoners were put to slow torture and mutilation at the hands of the captor and his wives , vicious harpies who neatly carved out eyes , skinned off lips , and with sharp nails clawed out brains-succulent delicacy for the night 's banquet . Convicts were killed by their own parents . In ( none too authentic ) pidgin English , dusky King Holiday confided to a client whose " factories " he kept well stocked with slaves : " All captains come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we trade , and s'pose dat true , sell ' em , we father must kill dem own child . And s'pose trade be done , we must kill too much child same way . "
