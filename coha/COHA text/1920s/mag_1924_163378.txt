There came a climax to the pro-French policy of Belgium 's Premier Theunis and Foreign Minister Jaspar . They proposed a Franco-Belgian economic convention . They took it to the Chamber . It was defeated 95-79 . M. Theunis resigned and , in spite of King Albert , refused to reconsider . <P> The economic convention was opposed by the Socialists who have consistently opposed nearly every item of French policy ( Ruhr , etc. ) , of which M. Theunis has been the most ardent and consistent supporter . But the Socialists have only 68 votes . In order to oust M. Theunis they needed the votes of the extreme Flemish Catholic party . This they finally received-not so much on account of the specific economic convention as on account of general anti-French feeling which has been growing in Belgium as a result of the failure of French policy to bring good cheer . <P> But Catholics and Socialists would be strange table-fellows at a Cabinet meeting . They could unite to eject M. Theunis , but could they unite to rule in his stead ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandervelde , Socialist leader , demanded new elections with a program of socialization of all means of production , capital levy , reduction of military service , international agreement with the powers , including Russia . He had recently consulted with Ramsay Macdonald of England . <P> Paris was dismayed . Poincar had lost a friend , said the journals . France was isolated . The proposed economic convention was not unfavorable to Belgium . France was to yield 10% on import duties of 140 articles while Belgium was to yield on only a few articles . But it was felt that the convention would bind Belgium to France as against either England or Germany . <P> M. Theunis started for the Riviera.
