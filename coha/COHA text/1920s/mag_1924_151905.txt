More than 500 invitations were issued to the popular Senator LaFollette to speak on Labor Day . He finally decided , according to his report from Washington to accept them all , by delivering an address from the Capital via radio . <P> In general , Senator LaFollette 's speaking engagements have not been completely booked . He is expected to speak in St. Louis , in Kansas City , in Chicago , in Cleveland , perhaps in Detroit and in Manhattan . But those matters will be decided later . Meanwhile , Senator Wheeler is concentrating his energies on New England . He expects to speak early in September at Boston , Worcester , Portland , Manchester , Providence , in Connecticut and in northern New York . Evidently the Progressive strategy is to strike at their outlying regions first before centring on the Northwest .
