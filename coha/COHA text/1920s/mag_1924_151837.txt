Hitherto no American bank has been able to boast of resources totalling a billion dollars . Yet it is undoubtedly only a matter of time until some of our larger banking institutions break into the " billion dollar " class . The likeliest candidate at present is America 's largest bank , the National City Bank of New York ; that it is already within striking distance of the billion dollar figure is shown by its statement at the end of the first quarter of 1924 , when its resources had reached $834,121,543 . <P> The City Bank was organized in 1812 , and after the passage of the National Banking Act during the Civil War became the " National City . " In 1893 , at the end of its first quarter , its resources were $25,000,000 . Ten years later these had multiplied five times , and by 1913 had reached $250,000,000 . <P> The War greatly increased the volume of the bank 's business , although its ambitious experiment of foreign branches proved unprofitable in spots and had to be curtailed . Since 1921 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even its Cuban and Far Eastern branches have become assets instead of liabilities . <P> Today the National City is America 's largest bank , and predictions have been made that 1924 may see it reach the billion dollar figure in its resources . Yet this growth could be paralled , in proportion , by other large banking institutions of New York , Chicago , Cleveland , and other important American centres .
