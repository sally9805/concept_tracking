The Child Who Was Mother to a Woman SOMETIMES the best way to tell a story is to tell it as it came to you , without bothering whether or not you tell it hind end to . This is a story I particularly want to tell right , because I believe it explains a great deal about Margaret Sanger , not merely in profile , but all around and through and through . Margaret Sanger probably needs a little more explaining than the next one , because to the inexperienced eye she looks so precisely what she is not . For instance , she is not old-fashioned , she knows no kinship to the clinging vine , she is not ever daunted by opposition and she is not mild . All of these are what she looks to be . And so looking , she has carried her crusade for birth control through from the time when simply to mention it was to invite imprisonment , to the time when , ten years later , it has every contour of calm respectability . It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that she has lifted it out of the field of brawls and quarrels and put it where to discuss it is no risk . She has eight times been put in jail . She has been harried and muzzled in every place where she ever raised her voice  --  at one time or another . Of course , by now , there is some conquered territory . But there is this one outstanding fact about Margaret Sanger : nobody has ever been able to make her stop talking . The first part of my story happened two years ago , and the second part about twenty-five years before that . The scene of the first part was a hotel lobby in Albany . Margaret Sanger had been scheduled to speak in that hotel that night . For many reasons , not here pertinent , the hotel denied her the hall at about seven-thirty , and it was already eight . People were gathering in the lobby , confused by the hotel announcements that there would be no meeting , and they were a little reluctant to leave . Now Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anybody , so presently she stood up on a chair , by which she was barely visible , and said : " 1 am not allowed to speak here . Neither am I allowed to speak in any other hall in Albany , because they have all been officially closed to me . Now this is n't my city ? this is your city . If you want to hear me , I want to speak to you , and I will go anywhere , inside the city or outside of it , if you can find a place for me . " Then she stepped down from her chair , sat in it , and put her hands in her lap . There was a little buzz among the Albany folks , and presently a tall , thin , gray-haired man , who had been conferring with a small , white-haired woman , announced that the meeting would be held , at suchand-such a private house , immediately . So they all rose and walked to that house , and Margaret Sanger spoke . The next morning I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy that she had spoken  --  that I would have sworn that she could not , in Albany , that night . " You can always speak , if what you have to say , or even the mere fact of your wanting to say it , is of any consequence to anybody . Why  --  one of the first things I can remember " And so began the second part of the story . Margaret Sanger ? who was then Margaret Higgins , was twelve years old . She lived in a very small town in Pennsylvania , where her father was a sort of stonecutter-sculptor . He chiselled out the angels for the tombs in the little town 's cemetery . He had a great barn of a studio , and his townspeople used to come there towards the end of the day and talk to Mr. Biggins . His daughter used to imagine that he nicked the outer coverings of of people , just as he chiselled away the stone and found the seraph it contained within . At any rate , they loved him , and believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , and he took two or three weekly magazines . By and by , he became greatly interested in Robert Ingersoll , through his magazines , and he began to talk of him to his flock . It was finally decided that Mr. Higgins should write and ask Mr. Ingersoll if he would come way up there and speak for them . This wo Mr. Higgins did , though he was a little frightened by his boldness . But back came a letter from Robert Ingersoll , saying he would be glad to come , and setting a Sunday in late November . Mr. Higgins then hired the town hall  --  which was the school house too  --  and everybody waited for the great day . But not all of them waited with the same sentiments . It was not long before Mr. Higgins had word from his priest that he could not have Robert Ingersoll there to speak . Mr. Higgins replied with some heat that he had hired the hall , and that anybody in this country could speak anywhere , about anything . After this drawing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dull and cold , and Mr. Ingersoll arrived . He dined with the Higgins family and they set out for the hall . There , outside , they found a great churning of people . The door to the hail was closed and barred , and a constable stood in front of it . The little Margaret stood back with her mother , watching her father and wondering what he would do . Finally she saw her father turn and address the crowd : " We can not hear Mr. Ingersoll in this town , " he said , " because they have closed even the streets to us . But the town is n't very big . Those of you who will walk with me to the end of it can hear Mr. Ingersoll . " So Mr. Higgins stepped beside Mr. Ingersoll , and they began a strange sort of procession . The two men walked first , and behind them came Margaret and her mother , and a few neighbors . Then , slowly , those who were not afraid straggled after , and those who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred , and they walked in the wind , under the gray sky , leaving the houses farther and farther behind . After about three miles , they came upon a little hill , with a lone shorn oak on the side of it , and under that Mr. Higgins stopped , introduced Mr. Ingersoll , and Mr. Ingersoll spoke . " So you see , " said Margaret Sanger , " I have always known that when they said they could stop us from speaking , they were wrong . " . Of course , in any fairness , there is a little more to it than that . Of all the little faithful adventurers who stood under that gray sky and heard Ingersoll 's serene and rounded voice roll out , only Margaret Sanger became a crusader , and only she ever lived to speak on and on , no matter what the difficulties might he . But the two other things needed , besides the restoring remembrance of Ingersoll under the knotted black limb of the oak tree , Margaret Sanger had  --  and got . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection out on the world  --  in other words , she was a born fanatic . She had a belief in Birth Control by which it seemed to her to represent a gigantic advance over all the former behavior of the human race . She has always believed that it would cure the ills of home , of war , of most of the tangles and tragedies of all human relationships . She has shored up that great emotional conviction with rational fact , with a prodigious fund of exact information . She is , by far , now and from the beginning , the ablest and the most effective friend that the cause of Birth Control has ever had . To see her , one is astounded at her youth , at her prettiness , her gentleness , her mild , soft voice . One is reminded of Botticelli 's Judith a gentle spring-like maid who treads the hills as if she danced  --  but who is attended by a maid upon whose shoulders is the severed head of Holofernes . This flame of Mrs. Sanger 's , within her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The third I will not try to place it in the order of its merit . But , early in her life , she found herself with the certainty that nothing could stop her from pleading her cause , and she had the great cause to plead . Then she discovered that when she stood on a platform , her enemy came from within . She was nervous and timid before a great number of people . She could n't find her voice . Then there came one of those monumental trifles by which sometimes the whole of history is changed . She found herself about to address her first audience in England . She was shivering in the wings . An old Scotsman of great experience came up to her and said : " You must n't worry . After all , the hall is warm , and the chairs are comfortable , and they do n't really expect much of you . " Now , just before every speech she makes  --  and Margaret Sanger makes hundreds and hundreds of them every year  --  she says to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and so she speaks .
