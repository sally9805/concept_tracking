txt A unique demonstration is being made simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic by eminent citizens of Great Britain . France , Holland . Switzerland , Denmark . Norway and Sweden , and the United States , who are addressing a memorandum to their respective governments , in which sound economic principles are laid down on the lines of which . in the opinion of the signatories . the solution of the world 's present economic problems must be sought . It is interesting that the memorandum takes issue squarely with Sir George Paish 's scheme . in that it emphasizes the necessity of " encouraging to the greatest extent possible the supply of credit and the development of trade througt normal channels . " It recommends the calling together as quickly as possible of a conference of representatives of commerce and finance , who are to recommend on the basis of authentic information what measures may best be taken in the various countries in order to revive and maintain international commerce . The European signatories are addressing to their governments a request to take the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American signatories have followed a different course in this ? respect by requesting the United States Chamber of Commerce to call such a conference . The Americans have not requested their Government to take any action , because they are of the opinion that such a conference should be one of private character and that the problems outlined in the memorandum should be met prinianly and as far as possible through private initiative . with the moral support of the Government and by a just and constructive policy on the part of the Reparation Commission . The men signing the appeal both in Europe and in the United States comprise leaders of thought and finance , statesmen and labor leaders , conservatives , liberals and socialists  --  a remarkable mixture of the most prominent men of all classes and professions . One might sum up the document as a call to the people to return to pre-war standards of reason , an appeal to the Reparation Commission for wise moderation as to the best business policy for all concerned ; an appeal to governments to arrest inflation and meet inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their debts ; an appeal to the people to work and to save ; and finally . an appeal to leaders of commerce and finance to get together in order to study the problem dispassionately and take it up as a business proposition relying on independent action rather than government intervention . Governments must be relied upon , however . to remove as rapidly as possible the obstacles that impede such a course . The American group sponsoring the appeal on this ride is composed of the following : Edwin A. Alderman . University of Virginia ; Frank Robert L. Brookings , St. Louis ; Emory W. Clark .

The memorandum is in part as follows : " There can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent policy of meeting its current expenditure by a continuous inflation of its circulation and by increasing its interest-bearing debts without a corresponding increase of its tangible assets . In prac ? tice every country will have to be treated after carefol study and with due regard to its individual conditions and requirements . No country , however , is deserving of credit , nor can it be considered a solvent debtor , whose obligations we may treat as items of actual value in formulating our plans for the future , that will not or can not bring its current expenditure within the compass of its receipts from taxation and other regular income . This principle must be clearly brought home to the peoples of all countries ; for it will be impossible otherwise to arouse them from a dream of false hopes and illusions to the recognition of hard facts . " It is evident that Germany and Austria will have to hear a heavier load than their conquerors , and that , in conformity with the Trenty of Peace , they must hear the largest possible burden they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken that this burden does not exceed the measure of the highest practicable taxation and that it does not destroy the power of production , which forms the very source of effective taxation . For the sake of their creditors and for the sake of the world , whose future social and economic development is involved , Germany and Austria must not be rendered bankrupt . If , for instance . upon close examination , the Commission des Reparations finds that , even with the most drastic plan of taxation of property , income , trade and consumption . the sums that these countries will be able to contribute immediately towards the current expenses of their creditors will not reach the obligations now stipulated , then the commission might be expected to take the view that the scope of the annual contribution must be brought within the limits within which solvency can be preserved , even though it might be necessary for that purpose to extend the period of instalments . The load of the burden and the period during which it is to be borne , must not , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so drastic a lowering of the standard of living that a willingness to pay a just debt is converted into a spirit of despair and revolt . " It is also true that amongst the victorious countries there are some whose economic condition is excedingly grave , and which will have to reach the limits of their taxing-powers . It appears therefore to the undersigned , that the position of these countries , too , should be examined from the same point of view of keeping taxation , within the power of endurance , and within a scope that will not be conducive to financial chaos and social unrest . " It . is not our intention to suggest in detail the method by which such international co-operation in the grant of credit may be secured . But we allow ourselves the following observations : The greater part of the funds must necessarily be supplied by those countries , where the trade balance and the exchanges are favorable . Long term foreign credit , such as is here contemplated , is only desirable in so far as it is absolutely necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those efforts and sacrifices on the part of each country , by which alone they can solve their internal problem . It is only by the real economic conditions pressing severely , as they must , on the individual that equilibrium can be restored . For this reason , and also because of the great demands on capital for their own internal purposes in the lending countries themselves , the credit supplied should be reduced to the minimum absolutely necessary . Assistance should so far as possible be given in a form which leaves national and international trade free from the restrictive control of governments . Any scheme should encourage to the greatest extent possible the supply of credit and the development of trade through normal channels . In so far as it proves possible to issue loans to the public in the lending countries , these loans must bo on such terms as will attract the real savings of the individual ; othervi ( iee inflation would be increased .                    @
