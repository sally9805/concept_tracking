There is a pious belief held by many ignorant persons , that in holy water no disease can breed or be transmitted . Pious the belief may be , but nevertheless in Balboa , C. Z. , last week , the Archbishop was ordered to pay a $50 fine or close the Cathedral because mosquitoes were breeding in unhealthy and rabbit-like fashion in the fonts holding holy water . <P> * Other pious beliefs : no house in which blessed palms are kept will be struck by lightning ; holy water will disperse devils ; those whose throats are blessed on the Feast of St. Blase will be immune to throat diseases . Pious beliefs are not to be confused with Articles of Faith .
