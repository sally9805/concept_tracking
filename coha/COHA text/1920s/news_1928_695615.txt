txt Our first night out , Saturday night , the Vestris began to hit rough weather . As the night progressed the storm got worse until , before the I night was over , we were in the worst storm I ever saw on the sea . It was late that night , perhaps a little after midnight , that a ' thing happened which I believe started the trouble that ended in the tragic sinking of the Vestris . Two big waves struck her , almost simultaneously , bow and stern . The ship quivered from end to end . You could almost feel her wrenching . The next day she developed a leak ; and I believe that started the leak . One of her plates must have been wrenched loose . Feared List . Early Sunday . It was rough Saturday night , and Sunday was rougher . Only four of the passengers besides myself were down for breakfast . The minute I stepped out of my cabin that morning I began to feel uneasy . The Vestris was listing had been on steamers before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list before . It looked bad . In the dining salon that morning L ran into Captain Frederick Sorenson and we started to tr.lk things over . He did not like that list either . Inasmuch as he was a sailor I decided he must know what he was talking about and that he was a good man to stay with . We spent most of the day together . Whether the other passengers were uneasy I do n't know . Most of them were violently seasick and spent the whole day in their bunks . As I said , there were only five down for break fast No more showed up for lunch ' or dinner . By the middle of the afternoon . while the storm still continued with no apparent let-up , the list had become so pronounced that all the furniture that was n't ? fastened down in the dining salon and in the smoking I room had slid over to- the ' starboard side , where it was crashing around as the ship rolled . After dinner , Sorenson and . I went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find:two chairs wedged in on the starboard side . of the smoking room , : from which we could reach around into the bar . I had a couple of whiskyand-sodas , felt a little better , and went to bed about 10 o'clock . After wedging my bed into a corner of the cabin so it could n't slide around , got to sleep . Water Up to Cabin Windows . " My cabin was on the top deck , star , board side . When I woke up at 8 o'clock Monday morning there was the water , right on a level with my windows . There was water sloshing around on the floor of my cabin . too . My steward came in , groaning , with a badly wrenched shoulder . There was apparently a leak , he said . The hold was filling with water , and he had been bailing with a bucket all night . The cargo had shifted , too . and the ship had tipped clear over until the water was on a level with my windows on the top deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banana which was all my steward could get for my breakfast , and went up on the bow port deck . " The crew was throwing the cargo overboard , all the stuff they could handle . It looked like bales of cloth and such stuff . Their derricks were n't working so they could n't get rid of the heavier things like automobiles . " A little crowd of men stood up there , leaning over the railing and watching the crew throw the stuff overboard . Some of them had come out with their life preservers on . They looked badly scared . Although I had dressed myself that morning with the idea that I 'd probably have to leave the ship before the day was over , I tried not to take such a dark view of the thing . Some of us did what we could to cheer the more timid ones , told them this was just a precaution and so on . Waves Seemed 40 Feet High . " The sky had cleared during the night , and now the sun was shining brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those waves , ? great , towering black waves  --  they looked forty feet high . " ' Well , any way , we 've got a nice day to be wrecked on , ' one of the men remarked with a grin . " Officers were going about , cheery but non-committal . They never told us anything . I never knew until after the Vestris had gone down that they had even sent out an S 0 S , although , when I went into the smoking room for a little while that morning and tried to read and divert my mind , I thought I heard the radio sort of sputtering . Once I went back to my cabin to try to rescue my money that I had left in a trunk . No use . The trunk was under water and wedged in under my bunk . I got my passport , stuck a pack of cigarettes in my pocket . and left for good . The ship kept on tipping . It looked to me as though she had a list of 45 degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and children were brought up and were told to put on life-preservers . Still we got no definite information from the officers or crew . " The women were wonderful . Some of them were crying quietly , but there was no hysteria . One of them held in her arms a baby not more than eight months old . All the children had been bundled up . They knew now that they would probably have to leave the ship . " ' Is n't this fun ? ' I said to one little fellow with bright blue eyes . trying to cheer him up . He looked at his mother , who was crying , and nodded solemnly . " At 11:30 they started to launch the lifeboats over the port side , the side that was up as she listed . Then the trouble began . " It took them two hours to launch those boats , an operation that usually takes about ten minutes . " The difficulty was that the lifeboats kept catching on the sides of the ship . The outsides of the lifeboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these would catch on the overlapping steel plates of the ship 's hull . They tried to hold the lifeboats out , away from the ship , by pushing with oars ? It was a slow and painful process . Boat 8 , the ' lifeboat to which I was assigned , had a hole torn in her side as they were letting her down . They patched it up with a piece of tin before they let us in , but the tin did n't hold . When the boats were about twenty feet fron the water they told us to climb down ' he rope ladder and get in . Two boats were filled with women and children before they filled No. 8 : In No : 8 , before I got in , were ten women and two children , the youngsters about 6 or 8 years old . One of them was Clara Ball . with whom I subsequently floated on the piece of wreckage . Another was Mrs. Inouye , wife of the couneelor of the Japanese Embassy at Buenos Aires . The ship 's bartender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors . Forty Dive- as Ship Sinks . Three minutea after we pulled away the Vestris keeled over on her side and sank . ? I think one of the limniest things I saw was ' forty men , apparently all those left on board , racing madly down her side and diving off from her keel . One boat never got away at all . It was still on deck when she sank . They had tried to launch some from her starboard side , but they had to cut them away before they could be filled . These were rowed around to where her keel had been when she went down and they picked up a lot of the swimmers . She went . dawn Silently with suet a little puff of steam . Her boilers must have been cold . The engine room had not been functioning all morning . Just a few minutes after we pulled away our lifeboat began to fill with water . The tin patch tore away . She had air compartments , however , so that we could stay in her , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep calm , although the tears streamed down their cheeks . There was no screaming . ' One of the children started to whimper . ' Isis mother , hastily drying her eyes , tried to comfort him . It was n't long before a big wave came along and capsized us . I got caught under the lifeboat as she turned over . I was n't hurt , except for a little scrape on my neck . As I struggled out from under I saw a woman 's foot bob up . I grabbed it and hauled her with me . It was Mrs. Ball . Lifeboat Is Righted Again . One of the women had been drowned when the boat tipped over . Most of the occupants came up , however , including the children . We all got on one side , pulled , and managed to right it again . The women and children climbed in . But the waves were pounding it to pieces . The air compartments , stored under the seats , tore loose . She was breaking up . Great black waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were  --  kept pounding down on us . The children disappeared , and the women , all except Mrs. Ball . I saw a piece of wood  --  wreckage  --  floating in the water nearby . " Come on , " I said . We swam to it . " Take hold of one end , " I told her , " and I 'll take the other . " Silently she did so , never a whimper out of her . We then proceeded to make ourselves as comfortable as we could and to wait for help . The water was warm , warmer than you find in an Indoor swimming tank . It was so warm , in fact , that you hardly gasped when you plunged in . The fact that it was warm probably helped to save our lives . But a was enervating , too . Mrs. Ball was fully dressed , with a coat and sweater on under her life preserver . She had on gloves , which certainly saved her hands . Mine are all cut up . " What in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life preserver ? " I asked her . " She grinned and pulled up a slipper . Her feet were so narrow , she explained , that she had a hard time getting shoes to fit , and she wanted . to , save this pair if she could . Nearly Crushed By Huge Waves . Through the afternoon we clung to the spar . It was n't so bad , except for the waves . Our life-preservers held us up , and having something to cling to made ' it easier to keep our heads out of the water . Only every - now and then a great big wave would come crashing down on us , almost knocking the life out of our bodies and smothering us in foam : I think the hardest thing was to keep from getting excited and floundering about . We had to save our strength and not move about unnecessarily . Mrs. Ball was wonderful . She showed iron nerve . Never a whimper out of her . " Several times during the afternoon we tried to hail the lifeboats . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think they passed us up deliberately , It 's pretty hard to spot ' a swimmer In waves like those . " Toward sunset it began to cloud up , and then a thought flashed into my mind that made me feel a little sick all over  --  sharks . I do n't know whether Mrs. Ball ever thought of them or not , If she did , she kept still about it . " During that long night of waves and wind and rain we- clung to the spar , talking interraittently . She told . me that she was . a. stewardess . When we made for the spar , and for several hours after we had attached ourselves to it , I had no idea who she was . " I confess that we spent a good deal of time cussing out Captain Carey for not getting those radio messages out earlier , Mrs. ' Ball had heard that one went out at 8 o'clock Monday morning and bad been canceled . We agreed , though , that it was a tough break for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he has to . Probably be thought the Vestris would ride it out . I 'd like to know if it 's true , though , that he sent out an S. 0 S at 8 o'clock and then canceled it . Felt Fish Brush Against Body . The night wore on . Several times we saw the searchlights of ships . They were too far away to see us then , but It gave us hope . Several times fish brushed against my body in the water and I squirmed . Miss Ball never said a word if she noticed them . If she was undergoing , what I was . she never let on at all . I decided to hold on anyway and wait until a shark actually attacked me before I let go . At daybreak -. came the worst moment of all for us . As the dawn broke not a ship was in sight , and our piece of wreckage was beginning to break up . We had to hold it together while using it for a support . At about 11 o'clock we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . But our spar was practically gone . " How about it ? " I asked Mrs. Ball . " Shall we swim for it ? " Without a word she started off toward the Wyoming . I kept by her side . We had been swimming ' for an hour when I looked back and saw the American Shipper . She wail only about a mile away and coming t*-ward us . I tore off the tail of my shirt and waved it wildly in the air . They ? ? ? ? ? 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? saw it . A boat was lowered . As we got up alongsid , they threW Out . a rope . I fastened it around my bOdY . under my arms , and grabbed Mrs. 136.11 . I had an idea that when she would give in she 'd go . quiekly , I was right . Hoisted Up In Rope Net . They hauled us into the boat and then hoisted us up In one of those rope cages they use for hoisting cargo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were much too weak . I never was treated more wonderfully in my life than I was on the American Shipper . The doptor ripped my clothes off , gave me a couple of shots of whisky and an alcohol rub and told me to go to sleep , which I certainly did . When I woke up , the steward was ready to shave me . My clothes were all dried . I guess there 's just one thing more . About five minutes after we were hoisted aboard the American Ship , per a dead body floated alongside- , and two sharks ,
