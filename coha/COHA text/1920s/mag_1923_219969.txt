British , French and Italian experts came to an agreement at London on most of the disputed points of the Lausanne Treaty raised by the Turkish counterproposals . It is , therefore , probable that negotiations will be re-opened with the Turks in the near future . <P> The commission is at present deciding the issues presented by ex- Premier Venizelos , who set forth the views of the Greek Government on indemnities and safeguards for Hellenic subjects . Lieutenant General Sir Charles Harington , Generalissimo of the Allied forces in the Near East , also gave the Allies a survey of the present military and political situation in Turkey . <P> There are three main concessions to which the Allies will not agree : <P> 1 ) They will not consent to detaching the financial and economic clauses from the Treaty . <P> 2 ) They will insist on adequate safeguards for foreigners in Turkey . <P> 3 ) They will insist that the Turks give up all claim to the Island of Castelloriza , at present under the sovereignty of Italy . <P> The Allies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their weather-eye skinned for signs of Turkish double dealing . Possibly they have in mind the Treaty of London , May 30 , 1913 , in which Turkey- in-Europe was driven east of a line drawn from Enos ( on the Aegean Sea ) to Midia ( on the Black Sea ) .

" And they won their point !
