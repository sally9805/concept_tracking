THESE are the days the traveller is discovering that the great emotional experience of returning to native soil from abroad is knocked into a cocked hat by Quarantine , Immigration , and Customs . Long Island , rising from the sea , seems as thrilling a sight as did Cornwall  --  until the moment the United States Government starts to take effect . Just when the traveller should be hanging over the rail , saying " Hello " to the harbor , he is below , standing in a stuffy line . Homecoming is real only at Ambrose Light , with the pilot coming aboard . The rest is bathos . OUR finger ever on the nation 's pulse , we report a significant happening of last week . At one of the neighborhood movie theatres we saw a film showing the workings of the prohibition air forces . While the orchestra played " My Country ' T is of Thee , " " Dixie , " and other patriotic airs , we saw prohibition agents getting their orders by field telephone , leaping into a natty seaplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swooping down upon a tiny dot in the ocean , which turned out to he a " rum craft " loaded with wicked bottles of Scotch . Is the Prohibition Unit , we wondered , going to be classed with the Army , the Navy and the Marine Corps ? Will bands play , flags wave , and enthralled crowds stand at attention and salute when , in the yearsto come , the agents are shown making an arrest ? Will the hearts of fair maidens beat in faster rhythm and young men choke with pride and exclaim , " That 's my country 's prohibition unit " ? We suspect that the rum officials have sagaciously adopted this policy of dramatizing their activities . If successful , the obvious result will be the success of enforcement and the discomfiture of a lot of prophets . SOMETIMES , on hot , still days in town , the noxious gas exuded from motor vehicles becomes unbearable . One does not need the nose of a Cyrano to sense its deadly power . Fifth Avenue is frequently swathed in a foul , clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horror by their frenzied excursions into second gear . This gives pedestrians headaches , and gives tragic cops , in our opinion , cause for action . Our noxious gas expert has been at work , and tells us that carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air . Therefore , the menace could be alleviated by piping the exhaust through secret channels to the top of the car , thus wafting it gently upward where it would disappear in the direction of the skies , with no greater toll of human life than the small minority of upper-deck bus riders . This is our constructive suggestion for this week . INCENSED not at all by the news that American women spend $325,000,000 on their hair every year , we see in it a normal diversion of wealth . Hair is a very serious matter . Stenographers earning twenty-five dollars a week wager their entire week 's salary on their locks two or three times a year . We admire the spirit . We have been informed that American ladies spent more last year on permanent waves than the government spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . What good would a Navy be if we had no good-looking women to protect ? Drab THE week 's American tragedy was enacted at the French Line pier , the chief actor being a young man who had stopped there to get a visa for a friend . He happened to be on his way to spend the weekend on Lung Island , and carried a suitcase in which , besides a toothbrush , were two quarts of domestic gin . He obtained the visa and was departing from the pier when a guard stopped him . " I'Vhere have you been ? " asked the guard . " Getting a visa . " " Why the suitcase ? " " I 'm on my way to Long Island . " The guard said maybe he 'd better lordly towers of Tudor City , flinging wide their casements above the New York Veal &; Mutton Company . Little old Prospect Place now gazes in surprise at lawns and privet hedges and the bungalows of the renting agents . Two units of the proposed community are already built , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street new brick apartments are progressing , with courts and greenery of their own . A short distance away , the Beekman Place river view has been changed by the tall Campanile which juts out above the water at Fifty-second Street . This district is probably the neatest case of elegance-in-squalor , with terraced gardens smiling above the roof of the Yellow Taxi repair shop , slum children playing on the grass-grown cobhave a look at the suitcase , anyway . He opened it , drew forth the two quarts of gin , shook his head sadly , confiscated one of the bottles , and stood by while the young man was fined five dollars . Elegant Slums ' THE fashionable East River con- tinues to gain in favor , if our eyes serve us . The tiny centres of elegance , which used to be small community garden apartments above the roofs of tenements , are spreading and encroaching on the slums . East Forty-second Street you will hardly recognize in its Fred F. Frenchiness , and the whole skyline northward along the river is changing . Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picturesque wooded shores of this popular and teeming stream . Aristocracy first begins to appear where rise the south side of Forty-second Street is being chipped away for another skyscraper home . The spirit of the thing seems to have reached the merchants even this early , for we noticed one antique dealer had hung out a fresh sign : " Tudor Shoppe ? Interesting Things . " On Forty-eighth Street , discreetly back from the river , between Second a n d Third Avenues , the Turtle Bay colonists still dwell in the quiet dignity of their exclusive gardens , while right across the hies of East Fiftieth Street , and the old row of sober brownstones looking out on the place , their stoops cool in ailanthus shade . When the Montauk Yacht Club establishes its landing at the foot of the Campanile , the inhabitants will have the added attraction of seeing white-winged ships at rest . TILL wandering northward , we STIL passed gloomily among the grand old breweries of the Fifties and emerged on the broad sunlit reaches of Sutton Place  --  the daddy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et al. , long ago Set the seal of approval by taking up residence there in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge . Special policemen were basking comfortably beneath sycamore trees ; and proper young ladies were leaning out over the wall by Riverview Terrace to watch the hairy-chested wharf rats swimming , far below , from the life saving pier . We noticed that new apartments have gone lip all along Fift ? - seventh Street westward to Second Avenue  --  which indicates that eventually they will link op with the eastward growth from Park  --  a complete triumph of respectability over poverty and commerce . THE river continued to lure us on , and at Sixty-sixth Street and Avenue A we peered in at the children 's gardens , in the vast front yard of the Rockefeller Institute , where kids of the neighborhood annually raise a hundred thousand radishes with ecstatic zeal . This district , too , is an apartment centre in a way  --  the Institute having built for its research workers a group of model dwellings facing the river . Then on into Yorkville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for half a century without anyone 's thinking anything about it . Opposite the green expanse of Carl Schurz Park , above Hell Gate , a cooperative apartment will shortly go up , and a further air of delicacy will be added with the new building of the Chapin School for Girls , on another corner . We hear , too , that J. Gordon Hammersley is buying extensively along East End Avenue , and that across from the Grade Mansion a large hotel-hospital is to be erected . The district is definitely booming , possibly because it commands a splendid view of the swirling waters , and perhaps , too , because it is still possible , we noted , for a person to Sit in the park and be lulled into oblivion by the faint and not unpleasing aroma of beer . Cautious AGENTLEMAN of our ac- quaintance , finding himself in an uptown restaurant at a table which was annoyingly wabbly , called a waiter . " Will you put something under the table , please ? " he requested . " Sorry , not tonight , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful . They just padlocked two places in this block . " Success Story THOSE who , until fairly recently , had not so much as heard of broccoli , and now are unable to pick up a menu without encountering it , may be interested in hearing the story of this vegetable 's romantic American career . It is not , as some have suspected , a product of one of Luther Burbank 's hothouse romances , but has been a highly respected table delicacy of certain parts of Italy for twenty centuries . Just a few years ago something prompted Frederick Kast , chief steward of the Waldorf Astoria , to remember having eaten it when he worked in Milan some forty years past . He wondered whether it would be possible to import a bunch or two for ' Waldorf guests . With this in kr mind he consulted Arthur Kelly , Sr. , a commission merchant , who , in turn , took up the matter with Joe and Roxy who , in addition to dealing in vegetables on a large scale , are also Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten broccoli and they promptly wrote to Italian friends asking for seed . In due time this came and they planted it on a Long Island farm . The delicacy subsequently appeared on the Waldorf menu . Broad-minded diners were induced to try it and it was liked . The Jill brothers increased their broccoli acreage and other hotels and restaurants became interested . Within a year several Long Island farms were given over to the culture of broccoli and other agriculturists leaped into the field to compete with the Jills . Some of these experiments were unfortunate . One competitor , it seems , wrote to Italy for seed and sowed a large tract with it only to End a hardy crop of wild turnips on his hands . Others , however , were successful , though we are informed that the Jills still dominate the market . They now have added several Texas farms to their holdings , on which they grow the winter supply . Broccoli has become so popular that New York now receives a carload of it every day in winter and two in summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a matron who lives on the East Side was dismayed to find a gang of scantily clad laborers noisily at work on street repairs in front of her home . More horrifying still , the men had hung their divested garments on her spike fence , She summoned the butler and instructed him that the festoons must be removed at once , but that he should go about it tactfully . At this moment an idea occurred to her . A few minutes later the butler appeared on the sidewalk with two old-fashioned coat-trees . Setting these at the curb he approached the workmen with proper ? dignity , requesting that they make use of them . They were happy to do so , it appears , and calm was preserved within the household . Fire ! FIRE " buffs , " as conscientious readers of Sunday newspapers know well , are gentlemen who follow the engines for the love of it . The title is eschewed by the present-day fire-chasers , who are , and who want the world to know they are , Honorary Deputy or Battalion Chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to around 1865 , when New York 's first paid fire department was organized for a very good reason ? competition between the young bloods of the volunteer companies had grown so intense that a kink in the rivals ' hose was as good as a fire extinguished . These dashing characters , thrown out of payless jobs , still followed the fires , even going so far as to sleep in the fire houses . Since the new fire department would not supply them with bedding , they took to carryingheavy buffalo robes to the fire houses to sleep in . Hence the nickname " buffaloes , " contracted to " buffs . " Today the fire " buffs " sleep at home , but their appetite for good three-alarms is as keen . Their dean is Robert H. Mainzer , a prosperous banker , with an office in Pine Street and a home at West End Avenue and Seventy-fourth Street , each place equipped with a fire-alarm telegraph instrument which keeps him informed . Second ? in rank is Dr. Harry M. Archer , successful surgeon , who lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of Engine No. 56 , where the Fire Department ambulance is kept . Mr. Mainzer , Dr. Archer and Manfred Neumoegen , another " buff , " have an intricate system of getting to late night and early morning conflagrations . Their bedsides are connected by a private wire . Each has an alarm to wake him and a push-button to notify the elevator man in his apartment house that he is on his way to a fire . The first one who wakes calls the others , they hop into firemen 's outfits and are off . Mr. Mainzer and Mr. Neumoegen meet at West End Avenue and Seventy-fourth Street . Dr. Archer gets the ambulance from its garage around the corner and drops by for them . Thus they hasten to battle . The only thing they lack is a brass pole to slide down . MR . MAINZER has been chasing fires for twenty-seven years , and as we dash to press his diary showsattendance at 5,497 of them . He and Dr. Archer were made chiefs for distinguished service after a sulphur fire at which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also honorary surgeon of the department . Mr. Mainzer has established a loan and aid fund for firemen . He also goes abroad each summer , inspects foreign fire equipment , including the Scandinavian , and tells foreign chiefs how much better ours is . Other " buffs " worth noting are William F. Kenny , the millionaire contractor ; his brother , Edward J. Kenny , who donated and operates the department 's searchlight truck ; Francis Loughman , State Tax Commissioner ; Congressman William W. Cohen , and Alex I ) reyfoos , whose hobby is recording fires with the camera . Another Method WE HAVE no reason to believe that anyone is having the slightest difficulty getting liquor anywhere , but always thoughtful of our public , we report the success of the following method which we came upon by accident . The restaurant has an exceptional cuisine and the headwaiters are both foreign and intelligent . We called one of them and asked him to indicate the best food available , and with him we carefully discussed the merits of the chicken and the tournedos . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak . Then we recalled the headwaiter to discuss appropriate vegetables and were persuaded by him to try a remarkable native soup . He stopped on his rounds when we were about to order dessert , and we reported to him what we thought of each of the dishes . As the coffee was brought he came to us and asked , with great solicitation , in his native tongue , " Would you like a fine ? " We bowed and had an excellent brandy , and took away with us a system which has never since failed . Get the captain of all the captains and talk about your dinner with him ; be advised by him , quarrel with him a little , ask the composition of whatever sauce you have chosen , be a gourmet . And if , at the end of five minutes , he does n't offer you drink , sigh mockingly and say that such a dinner as he has ordered really needs wine ( or whatever you want ) . You always get it . Forel jORD from Poland is that Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the solid , substantial footing that it has in America . Being in Warsaw on business connected with the Polish Stabilization Loan , some weeks since , Messrs . F. N. B. Close and J. F. Dulles , together with some French confreres , decided that an afternoon on the links would be dandy relaxation . Yes , they were told , there were golf links , and they were given directions on how to reach them . After several hours of motoring over the countryside they finally found the course . It turned out to be a cow pasture , actively inhabited by cattle , in charge of an old man with a beard and a stick with a white flag on it . When anyone wanted to play golf this worthy gentleman would walk to a point designated by the golfers , dig a hole in the ground with his toe and set up the flag . The game would then be on . Granite ONE is frequently reminded that this city is sadly deficient in the matter of monuments , that the vast majority of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , the city has done very well by General Wrilliarn J. North , whose bones lie buried under that enormous Quincy granite shaft in the triangle formed by Broadway , Fifth Avenue and Twenty-fifth Street , opposite Madison Square . The story of how it got there is not uninteresting . General Worth , it seems , fought in the War of 1812 and in the Mexican War . He was a popular hero and when he died Mr. James C. Batter-son was commissioned to prepare a monument . The largest granite company in America was given the contract and , operating on the scale of its own size , turned out , in 1857 , a fifty-one-foot monolith of enormous weight . In fact , the street commissioner of the day took one look at it and announced that it was so heavy it would crush the pavements and that any attempt to haul it through the streets would be met with arrest . R. BATTERSON was not so I.V1 easily abashed . He waited until the commissioner had gone to bed , loaded the shaft on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses as they tugged to the spot . By the time the commissioner got there the monument was up . The streets were messed up a bit , but that , of course , was long before street-destroying became the perfect art it now is . Mr. Batterson was not arrested . In fact , he lived to become president of the Travelers Insurance Company . The monument was merely the city 's tribute to the general . The nation 's tribute took the form of a pension of $50 to Mrs. Worth , his sixtyyear-old widow , and her three children . She did not get it , however , until she had been reduced to living on charity , because Congress had to debate the matter . Several statesmen opposed the grant , on the ground that the general had not died in battle . It was Mr. Polk of Tennessee who finally won the day for the widow with a speech in which he set forth that , while it was true that the general had not actually died on the field , " God had sent forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart as Worth 's . " These facts may soften the feelings of those who find the monument slightly atrocious . Litter ( A NE of the wealthiest matrons on VI Long Island owns a male poodle dog of no small aristocracy , and some months ago she decided that he needed a proper mate . No American poodle of the proper sex , however , could be found worthy of her proud canine and she , perforce , sent to England . Presently the female came  --  accompanied by a chaperon from the breeding kennels and occupying a stateroom on the Aquitania . On her arrival upon Long Island it was perceived that she was not quite herself . She seemed to mope . Presently , on the chaise-longue in one of the guest rooms , appeared a new and happy family of six puppies . The matron , chagrined , ordered the puppies out of her sight and the butler gave them to a negro family , living a few miles away . A week later a message came from England saying that the sire of the abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that his female companion had been dispatched to her through a mistake in bookkeeping . The lady has found the whole thing very distressing .
