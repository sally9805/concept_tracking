President Coolidge sent to Congress his sixth and last annual Budget message . Budgeting the U. S. began only two years before he became President , so he felt justified in reviewing the system 's success as part of the Coolidge Era . <P> " Our splendid Treasury . " he said , to remind people why the Budget Bureau was established , " is not a bottomless , automatically replenishing fountain of fiscal supply , and its outflow must be eternally watched and carefully and wisely directed into proper channels . " <P> The first seven Budgets , for the years 1923 to 1929 inclusive , called for a total of $29,800,233,790 to run all branches of the Government . The Congresses appropriated $29,478,282.294 , cutting the Budget Bureau 's estimates by only $321,951,495 , or 1.16% of the total . Of this amount , $135,468,732 was saved by the Naval Disarmament Conference , from the Budget for 1923 . Since 1923 , the Congresses have appropriated only $55,971,630 less than the Budget Bureau 's estimates , or a margin of faultfinding and disagreement of less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hearty co-operation . " <P> A fiscal year for the U. S. begins July i of the previous calendar year , and ends June 30 . Fiscal 1929 is thus about half run . Costs of running the country , including debt reductions and meeting deficits of the theoretically self-supporting Post Office Department , have been and will be as follows : Fiscal 1928 $3,643,519,875.13 ( actual ) <P> " 1929 3,794,745,469.00 ( appropriated and estimated ) <P> " 1930 3,780,719,647.00 ( estimated ) <P> Of the figure for 1929 , $3,637,079,024.09 had already been appropriated and President Coolidge was emphatic in warning Congress to be prudent this session , not to vote any extra money without providing new sources of revenue . <P> Last summer , not a little political capital was made-by Republicans as a warning against change , by Democrats as evidence of bad stewardship-out of a report from the Budget Bureau that fiscal 1929 might show a deficit of 94 millions . President Coolidge now announced that the outlook was for a surplus of some 37 millions . Neither of these figures is very near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Budget message last December . Last week the President explained that the discrepancy was due rather to increased expenditures than to decreased revenues . The postal deficit was 60 millions greater than expected . Flood control added 16 millions , public buildings 26 millions , pension increases n millions , increased pay for Federal employes 21 millions , Navy and Shipping Board increases 26 millions , etc. , etc.
