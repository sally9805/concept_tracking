So unobtrusively does Professor Robert Hutchings Goddard of Clark University , Worcester , Mass. , work on his study of the air 's upper miles by means of rockets that to many a Clark student he is only a tradition . They call him the moon man , in the inaccurate belief that he is trying to reach the moon with his missiles . Last week , Tradition Goddard detonated very loudly . From a 40-ft. steel tower he fired his latest rocket , a huge steel cylinder 9 ft. long by 2 ft. diameter . A new propellant sent it whizzing from the ground . It rose straight up about a quarter-mile . There the fuel seemed to ignite all at once , instead of in a stream , as planned . The roar sent Worcester ambulances and police hunting for tragedy . They found Professor Goddard and assistants inquisitively studying his rocket shell , which had landed near the side of its propulsion . <P> Carrying objects , and perhaps eventually persons , by means of rockets is an engineering phase of physics in which Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principle of rocket motion is simple-action and reaction . Escaping gases act in one direction , the rocket body in the opposite . The ground is not necessary for the rocket gases to push against in order to propel the rocket . Nor is the air . Such action and reaction can take place in a vacuum , a fact which has driven Professor Goddard on his experiments . His objective is not to see how far he can shoot a rocket but to investigate the physics of the earth 's third and outermost blanket of air . <P> Earth 's atmosphere is only seven to eight miles thick . Aviators have been able to reach the top and hover there a few moments . Outside is the tenuous stratosphere , about 70 miles thick . Man has not entered that yet , although small balloons bearing measurements have done so . <P> Of the third and outer blanket , the Heaviside layer , very little is known , and that only inferentially . Pressure 100 miles up is calculated to be 1/300,000 of the pressure at sea level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium is , it is nonetheless dense enough to burn up meteors by its friction . Like the lower atmosphere it carries electrical charges . Proof of that is the great heights from which the curtains of Aurora Borealis , an electrical phenomenon , hang . If Professor Goddard , or anyone else , can learn the exact nature of that high zone it is conceivable that man will be able to put it to some purpose . <P> Rockets have already been used for motive power . A rocket car driven by Fritz von Opel attained 120 m. p. h. in eight seconds ( TIME , June 4 , 1928 ) . <P> Fuel is the great handicap against sending rockets to great heights . No known fuel is sufficiently light and energetic to be useful .
