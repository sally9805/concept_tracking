IT IS my conviction that they do ? the vast majority at any rate ? and especially the poets . With few exceptions like Sassoon , who may have enjoyed himself more than he knew , the poets of the Great War were lyrical in their ecstasy and , from being a somewhat neglected species , became the spokesmen of the inarticulate , and entered into a dizzy popularity . The war over , they fell silent . Some of them had died gloriously like Rupert Brooke . Others had either ceased to be poets , or the subject matter at their disposal no longer inspired them . Even Sassoon who , one might suppose , would naturally break into pans of thanksgiving , found nothing memorable to say . Perhaps the horrors of peace did not lend themselves to his favorite adjectives . In this respect the poets of 1914-1919 were symptomatic . They were not real but merely occasional poets ? ordinary men wrought up by events to a high point of ecstasy where they became articulate . They were the vents of national emotion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write poetry . They went back to their offices and grew bored and stout and melancholy , remembering happier days . Not that they openly regret the war ; hardly any of them will be found to approve of it . The only thorough-going old-fashioned war-for-war'ssake firebrand is the man or woman who never went to war at all . No , the returned veteran invariably expatiates at length on the miseries and agonies of war and ends up with a fanfare of high moral disapproval . War is an anachronism ? the end of civilization and so forth . All of which is very reassuring for the future . For , after all , they are not old men . They have still an influence over their time and presumably ? if they choose to exert it ? over the next generation . So that at this stage the pacifist , who usually prefers his peace of mind to any sort of peace , would do well to drop his investigations . For press the disillusioned patriot a step farther , and he will admit frankly that the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? which is certainly serious and causes the worrying type of pacifist like myself a lot of uneasy thinking . Undoubtedly there are other men who will assure you that they would rather he put against a wall and shot than take up again a rifle in defense of their country . But of this minority the majority are revolutionaries who are perfectly ready to shoulder a rifle in the right caps , . ( Most of our English pacifists becan.e Sinn Feiner or bolshevik and , incick litany , an amazing number of the women had been militant suffragettes . ) It is merely a matter of the kind of people they enjoy shooting . The man who dislikes fighting anyone for any cause is so rare that his influence is negligible . It is true that one can quote only the survivors . The rest are , of necessity , silent . But even the crippled and those whose whole material existence has been apparently blighted by the catastrophe are oddly without bitterness . They complain as little as they did when they were actually in the trenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are human like ourselves , an example of the heroic stuff of which humanity is made . And I am not underrating their supreme virtue when I suggest that one must look deeper than heroism to explain a sustained struggle of five years ? that is , if the League of Nations is to function to any purpose . Speaking bluntly , I do not believe that whole nations of men can be kept for five years at a job which they profoundly detest ? no matter how moral the cause nor how desperate the pressure . I believe that over and above the grief and suffering , the nations , as a whole , like the individuals , were enjoying the best days of their history . The governments , had the people desired it , could have made peace at any time . They did not do so . They were all of them , of course , and especially the Germans , sustained by a high moral purpose , but better than that , they had behind them a united and satisfied people . And as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied , they were naturallyin no hurry to make peace . That much , at least , is beyond controversy . It is equally true that governments , confronted by serious discontent and disunity , have time and again discovered that the National Honor had been insulted by somebody in order to go to war with flying banners and a good conscience . War , in fact , is the cure-all which statesmen have always kept in their medicine-chest for severe cases . Naturally , the war has to be successful in order to succeed . An invaded country gets altogether too much kick out of the business , and in the last Great War the French were obviously not enjoying themselves as they would have enjoyed themselves had they been invading Germany . And , as a result of this deprivation , you will find more bitterness in France than you will among the Germans in spite of the latter 's final defeat . Even so , one suspects that for all their dramatic gestures , the French too were not as suffering as they thought they were . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not seem conspicuously happier . From this point of view , Great Britain had incomparably the best of it . A large proportion of her civilian population was in direct and constant touch with the enemy without enduring either the horrors or the fear of invasion . ( For whatever may have been in the minds of her leaders , the idea that she might be invaded , much less defeated , never entered the minds of this stupid and obstinate people . ) She had , in fact , the full emotional stimulus of war without its discouragement . When the Germans bombarded her coasts and bombed her cities they gave to the British constitution just that fillip that it needed to settle down to the war with a good heart . From the moment the civilians realized that they were in it too and might be blown up at any moment , they began to enjoy themselves and the German fate was sealed . London , bombed month after month and often night after night , was never for a moment panicstricken . More people were killed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marksmanship . An old lady of my acquaintance came up regularly to town on moonlight nights in order not to miss a possible " show " ? thereby displaying , if you like , a regrettable but quite typical lack of proper regard for German intentions and her own and other people 's safety . And I recall to mind as equally typical , a little Devonshire maid servant of mine whom I roused one early winter morning with the information that the German Gothas were immediately overhead . Rubbing her eyes sleepily , she remarked , " Lor ' . Miss , how you frightened me . I thought I 'd overslept myself . " You can call such a temper heroic or merely stupid . In fact , it is neither . Rather , it is true that men and women confronted by death lose their fear of death , and that a fighting and suffering people are often a happy people , profoundly at peace . And here , in order to spare myself the accusation of a paradoxical flippancy , I shall , at this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment , and that I am not referring in any way to the kind of emotions aroused by a picnic or a jazz-party , which are nearly always those of frustration and exasperation . I refer to a state in which the whole personality is alert , conscious , and living . It has been said often enough , and with truth , that we are all of us , in various degrees , more than half asleep , and that few of us ever wake up and then only for brief interludes , and under very powerful stimulus . These interludes are our periods of happiness , and it . is relatively unimportant whether the condition which has stung us into wakefulness is painful or otherwise . More often it is painful . An exalted state of bliss may be too like an extension of our everyday lives to be thoroughly effective . Pain , by the violence of its contrast , arouses us more completely not only to awareness of itself , but to appreciation of its cessation . Thus , men going into danger may do so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they will come out of it with every faculty strung up to such an acute realization that the commonest feature of every-day life will seem to them glorified . For a little while they really see with their eyes and hear with their ears and remain happy for just so long as they re-'main awake . Without further stimulus , Mowever , they sink back into a moody ' And discontented dreaming in which the past appears to them , with all its distress and havoc , as a time of living satisfaction . Even in every-day life , grief at its climax is never without this compensating quality of exalted emotional activity . It is the aftermath ? the sinking into a monotonous sense of misery , a return , in fact , to emotional sleep , which is unbearable . It is , therefore , a perfectly natural and common phenomenon for a person to enjoy the funeral of someone whose death is a crushing and irretrievable loss . The more simple and na ? ve the character , the more openly this enjoyment will be displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my belief that the fighting men of 1914-1919 were happy . II If there is one thing which we mortals suffer from more than another it is our habit of saying things we know to be untrue and ruthlessly and obstinately believing them . Much of our so-called morality is based on this intellectual perversity , and most of our misery can be traced hack to it . Thus , as a commonplace but important example , from the times of Genesis , we have declared that work is a curse or at best a duty , and have taught our children to regard it as such . Whereas every intelligent man acknowledges by his actions that work is his only respite from the arduous misery of doing nothing and that his so-called periods of rest are bearable only if he can find some means to exhaust himself effectually . Only the lowest types of humanity can endure idleness without wanting to kill themselves , and they usually end by killing one another . It is , in fact , high time we began to strip the sentimental unreality from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war we talk about the sacrifices brought by the fighters , as though they were abandoning immortality and paradise , whereas we all die sooner or later and more or less miserably , and from start to finish few of us can even guess what paradise may look like . The man who , when asked why he had volunteered , replied that it was the only way he could get away from his family was irreverently but sincerely paraphrasing the motives of thousands who with equal sincerity would have admitted that they went to a probable death in order to get away from an intolerable life . Were it possible for some explorer to free men who would go with him on some forlorn and hopeless enterprise , from obligations to their dependents ? as was virtually done during the war ? he would find himself besieged by applicants from the very class which would seem to have the most to lose . For men exaggerate their fear of death in almost the same measure as they pretend to find satisfaction in things that do not satisfy them at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are happy in the sense in which I have used the term . Men , in fact , who are utterly alive , who are in a lofty and peculiar sense " above themselves , " are not hag-ridden by the cold dread of annihilation as are men who feel in their bones the beginning of corruption . Whether they are intellectually aware of it or not , they become immortal ? a conscious part of the eternal stream of life . The half-dead ? the vast majority of mankind ? have the damp odor of the vault perpetually in their nostrils . The martyr and Lite hero are , in their degrees , liberated both from the fear of death and the apparent futilii y of living . Individually , we are always acknowledging these facts , but we do not follow through to their logical conclusion . When we read of the deaths of such men as Captain Scott , the explorer , arid his companions , we are profoundly moved but we rarely stop to analyze our emotions . If we did so , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from pity . We should not even wish these men alive again ? as little as we should wish to destroy a work of art which they , as supreme artists , had been able to complete with that final gesture . But we refuse to acknowledge that war is the average man 's unique opportunity to follow their example . In the first two years of the Great War , two million men in Great Britain volunteered . Perhaps one-tenth thought they knew what they were fighting about , and that tenth was probably mistaken . But they were not deceived victims on that account . Nor were they bloodthirsty butchers . They were not even inspired by any particular animus against the enemy , to whom they displayed from first to last a rather absurdly amicable toleration . They were simply an inarticulate people totally unaware that in surrendering to a brutal domination they were making a break for freedom , and that in their suffering and death they were proving themselves masters of the art of living . But it would be foolish to pretend that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to kill and be killed . We tend to forget , rather astonishingly , that other people are just as silly as ourselves and that grown-up men in vitally responsible positions are swayed by motives which would make a schoolboy blush if he had to acknowledge them . I once asked an American who had joined up with the Coldstream Guards at the beginning of the war and had done extremely well in the worst fighting , what had precipitated him into the conflict ; and after he had done telling me about Belgium and his love for dear old England , he added with a twinkle , " And then , of course , I rather fancied myself GENTLEMEN in the uniform . " And he was so obviously being funny that I knew he was telling me the truth . This matter of personal vanity was indeed a very serious factor in the last war , for the German Army was built up on it . The average German is notoriously the worst dressed man in the world . He is also afflicted with a bad figure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably aware of , his leaders offered him a beautiful uniform with enormous social prestige attached to it and sufficient physical exercise to keep his figure within bounds in return for his military service . And Germany became a great military Power . Had the German officers been compelled to adopt mufti when off duty , as is the case of the British Army , German militarism would never have swollen , as it did , to the bursting point . This is a trivial instance of the trivialities which influence our most portentous and tragic actions . And they are not confined to the Germans . Those who witnessed " The Bin , Parade " will remember the scene in which the hero enlists . At the Declaration of War he betrays no particular interest and certainly no serious intention of enlisting . But on a motor run , he happens to encounter a regiment marching to a band . His foot marks time to the invigorating measure . ( At this point the orchestra becomes increasingly- martial . ) Suddenly he throws his hat into the air and himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if at this point in the drama someone would come on the stage and announce that the United States had declared war on Timbuktu , the audience would throw its figurative cap into the air with the same enthusiasm and with just as much reason . ) From first to last none of the three chief characters seems to know or care what they are fighting about . But it is suggested that two of them were bored stiff with their job , and one of them was emotionally responsive to music . Certainly the producers did not mean to convey this impression ? I am not so sure of the author ? but inadvertently the truth slipped out . And anyone who has run two blocks to march with a regiment of Highlanders playing the bagpipes and who of us has n't or would n't , if he had the chance ? might just as well own up to his share in this form of human absurdity . To ignore our own absurdity in this matter is like ignoring a cask of gunpowder in a thunder-storm . III One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , lighting , in addition to the undoubted joy of combat , gave him a profession and fair chances of acquiring a decent living in hard times , and even , if he were lucky , a fortune . Later on he fought to retain the loot he had looted from other looters and became a patriot . But war as the explosion point for the pent-up discontents of peace is a modern phenomenon ? the most sinister and symptomatic of our civilization . In fact , though war remains our most permanent human institution , our attitude towards war is perpetually shifting . Even in my own time and in my own country , I have witnessed some remarkable changes . I was a child at the time of the Boer War and at the advanced age of ten was , I think , fairly representative of the national intelligence . In these days , we spoke of the Empire with our hats off and though , being a homogeneous people , we had no hundred per cent Englishman ? we had the next best thing ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Little Englanders , who would certainly have been lynched if lynching had happened to be an English custom . ) To the Imperialist war was a sort of national sport , half-sacred , like cric4et , but free from the taint of professionalism , which he played fairly and good humorcdly . It never became a serious business , but it was an occupation to which an Englishman should be able to turn his hand at any moment . To suggest that war was wicked or even horrible , was like criticizing the Dear Queen . it bordered on blasphemy . We were a smug and contented people . But even before 1914 that phase was over . We were already near the point where Beatrice Lillie could come on the stage as a caricature of Britannia and make mock of sentiments that fifteen years before had been treated with an almost tearful reverence . And we went into the World War as soberly and with as little flag-waving as any people in history . Nor did any people go into the war with higher motives or less clear thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal advantage and precious little interest in national aggrandizement . To suggest that two million men volunteered in order to wrest Germany 's colonies from her is simply silly . Equally untrue , though not so obviously absurd , is that the two million had any real belief that their country was in danger . Not until 1918 , and then only very dimly , did such an idea really affect the national purpose . ( That an Englishman can never be ultimately defeated , is one of the laws of nature which only an Englishman understands . But he understands it thoroughly . ) Nevertheless , the two million went . They went in spite of the fact that the national conscience no longer justified war . In the sense that , with the exception of a handful of Die-Hards , we were through with Imperialism in its ugliest form and entirely through with the belief that it was our duty to run the Universe , we were the most civilized nation on earth . The Boer War was no longer possible , as statesmen who had tried to subjugate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only be fought by a whole-hearted people if the loftiest possible motives could be found to justify them ? and there were motives enough . Civilization and democracy ? these were two of the most important deities that the two million carried with them on their sacrificial procession to the slaughterhouse . Lesser and more absurd motives , as I have suggested , no doubt played their part : love of adventure , vanity , pure destructiveness ? a hundred primitive stirrings ? but none of them strong enough to inspire a whole people for five years . And I am not suggesting that they did not believe that they believed in their gods , but only that , if there had not been a deeper force at work in them , there would be no cause for future anxiety . For it is clear now , at any rate , that no worthy god was served by their sacrifice and that , therefore , we need only leave ourselves to civilization and democracy in order to reach the end of all war . The fact that we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another conflagration ? suggests that beneath the heroic resolution of that significant two million was not faith in civilization but disillusionment . The two million fought for possessions they no longer valued . The Victorian era was over . Great Britain , for all time and for all peoples , had made the disconcerting discovery that men do not live by bread alone and that even with jam and butter added unto them , nations , like men , are in a bad way , unless they discover the secret food which alone can satisfy their no less mysterious hunger . We had found nothing . The chance to die for a high cause came like a deliverance . The two million went because they wanted to go . And the poets ? the most civilized among them ? sang in ecstasy . IV Herein , no doubt , lies a vital difference between the British , as more or less representing the European point of view , and the American . It is the very natural way of Americans to regard the inevitable squabblings of Europeans with impatience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment , is happy as we were happy fifty years ago , and she sees no reason why , with good plumbing , better business methods , and a telephone in every home , the world should not settle down to a similar contentment . She still believes in a millennium to which prosperity is the open sesame , and that when everyone in the United States owns his own car the riddle of man 's relation to man and to the universe will have been satisfactorily elucidated . Actually , when every man in America owns his own car , every man in America will wish he did n't . America too will have reached the saturation point where modern civilization , which is only another name for materialism , will appear to her as bleak disillusionment . And at that moment her statesmen no doubt will discover that the national honor is insulted or some high principle involved and another war will be in full blast . Always supposing that there is somebody left for her to fight with . It is of no use reminding humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never more than that of the individual . It is not cumulative any more than the suffering of peace is cumulative ? and it is infinitely more spectacular . It is of no use reminding men that the next war will probably mark the end of our civilization . They do n't care . If they admitted the truth , which they ca n't , because they dare n't , they would say that they do n't like civilization ? that it has turned out something totally different from what they had intended , and that it had better be destroyed before , like the R U. R. puppets , it grows too strong for them . It is of no use throwing the responsibility of governments on Leagues of Nations . War is not , as most pacifists would have it , the outcome of the machinations of wicked politicians and worse capitalists . Politicians and capitalists are not so much villains as cat's-paws of the national temper . Nor is war a horrible calamity forced on men by a blind outside force or a revengeful deity . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his environment ; and there will be no end to war until he himself has found peace . And there will be no chance of his finding peace until he has admitted honestly that he has n't found it . When men acknowledge that the whole thrust of their endeavor has been in the wrong direction , that they have not been able to create a civilization in which their souls can live , and that war is a way of escape from their consequent miseries and an outlet for their thwarted virtues , then the League of Nations may function to some purpose . I have written more especially of men . Women and War would require a book to themselves . But at least it may be suggested that the temptation to fight and to encourage fighting is as strong in women as it is in men and correspondingly dangerous . In the last war , millions of women who were risking all they cared for were happy for the first time . And if in spite of this women are obstinately set against war , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is no cure . Also it may be that , as some philosopher observed , since they have never been really civilized , they are better able to withstand civilization . Women through all the jangle and mechanical turmoil of modern life have been able to keep their course as human beings . It is still within the lot of them to suffer and to bring sacrifice . And thus perhaps they have , in a measure , retained their sanity and obtained peace .
