txt I find it most difficult to write about or describe what I saw and felt when I entered the Inner chamber of the tomb of Tut-ankhAmen , for of a surety I never- dreamed I should gaze upon the amazing sight which met my eyes . In the course of the morning Mr. Carter had - cased with planking the two bituminized statues of the King on each side of the sealed door , so that no hurt could come to them , and had also built a sort of wooden stage to enable him to attack the sealed door at the top . Professor Breasted had also spent several hours copying the seals on the door before they were finally broken away , and from their grouping he has , I understand , been able , to deduce some interesting facts . When we assembled there were about twenty people . What with the heat of the day outside and the electric lamps and the crowding together of so many in such a confined space , the air was insufferably hot . Interest in the proceedings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun by Mr. Carter 's chipping away the cement at the top of the sealed door . But he had not proceeded far when it was discovered that there was what proved to be a broad /Intel at the top of a built-up wall . The cement was exceedingly hard , and required a great deal of cutting with a chisel to detach it from the stones forming the backing of the wall . And the greatest care had to be exercised , because we were anxious to preserve all the sealings as nearly intact as possible . First Sight of the Canopy . After a little while a small aperture was made , through which it was possible to peep and it became evident that there was no empty chamber or passage confronting us but that we were looking at some large built-up structure . With the aid of an electric torch we managed to snake out that it was the top of what appeared to he a large canopy , carved and gilded . The work proceeded slowly , for the cement was still very hard and the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for on one of , the inner stones there lay the remains of a necklace of beads of faience land gold with two ornamental clasps . There it had evidently been dropped , presumably 3,000 years ago , by si-me one who either did not notice it or did not ? take the trouble to pick it up because he was already loaded with plunder . Much more of the construction of the interior object was now visible and our first conjecture that it was some kind of a catafalque or canopy was confirmed . It was now seen to be an enormous structure of wood , most elaborately carved and gilded and inlaid with blue faience . Altogether it forms one of the most magnificent and remarkable objects ever discovered Now also we could see that the walls of the interior of this chamber were painted , but in the short time at our disposal it was impossible to examine it closely . The painting , however , did not seem to me to be very fine and it appeared also to have suffered from damp and to be disfigured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside it was easy to distinguish among the decorations the cartouche of Tut-ankhAmen . This canopy was so close to the opening and left so little space that precautions had to be taken before it was possible to think of getting in . At last by means of a mattress placed against the canopy it became possible to risk an entry . Entered With Profound Emotion . Mr. Carter went in first and after a Short while announced to us , waiting outside , that there was no doubt it was the tomb of the King. - With the greatest care I followed in and whatever emotion and excitement may have felt when I entered the first chamber they were as nothing when I . realized that I was going into what undoubtedly was the practically untouched tomb of an Egyptian King . Moving carefully round to the right *we found on the east side of the shrine or canopy two large doors . They were closed by means of a bolt and hung on heavy bronze hinges . With ominous creakings we , managed to open a door , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entirely gilt , and between two istrUctures were some of the most marvelous alabaster ornaments it is possible to imagine One beautiful little painted pot with a lid on top of which was a cat with a pink tongue I could scarcely take my eyes off . It was impossible to open the door sufficiently to be able to see in detail all that lay between the two walls , the outer and the inner wall , but it was possible to see that the whole interior of the outer wall was carved and gilded . The second shrine was similar and had double doors exactly opposite those we had opened , but a very important point was that the inner doors were sealed with small seals and string , and the whole sealing arrangement was perfectly intact . It was , therefore , almost certain that the body of the King was lying somewhere in this second shrine or in one even farther in untouched . As far as I know , this has never happened before . We have only found royal personages either hidden away or very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramses IV. , if I recollect the papyrus rightly , five of these shrines or canopies figured as surrounding the King 's sarcophagus . There is room for as many as that in this tomb , but it is imprudent to venture any prophecy on the subject . Glimpses of Wondrous Objects ; The space is so constructed between the walls of the chamber and those of the outer shrine that it is impossible to pass along on any side but that where the entrance doors are situated ; but with the help of a lamp I could discern black paddles or oars for the I deceased King 's use after death , laid in criss-cross pattern along one side and some kind of a large statue at the far corner . This part of the tomb will take months to examine , and I can only hope the work may be carried on without the constant interruptions , which has been the chief feature of this season 's campaign . On the same east side there is a large opening in the outer wail of the chamber which has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most imposing and wonderful pictures possible to imagine . I felt that with so many people waiting , all of whom hoped to come In. it would be selfish to take up too much time , so any description I can give of this new and marvelous find is the result of only a very superficial - survey . The first thing that struck thegaze was one of the most wondrous objects that has ever been unearthed , either in Egypt or elsewhere . It is probably a shrine containing the canopic jars off the King , that is to say , jars containing the viscera and parts of the body , removed before embalming . On the top is an open work motif of uraei ( royal serpents ) and on the four sides are figures of four goddesses , which are simply marvelous in their modeling and refinement . One of them is in a position which , I think , has never been represented in eastern art before . They seem to be protecting the contents of the shrine , and the expression of the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet or 51/2 feet high and is gilt all over . Thirty Roses in This Room . There are other objects in this room which are extraordinarily fine . A box of the utmost magnificence , made of ivory inlaid with gold ankhs , is an object that none could have dreamed existed in those far-off days . It reaches a height of artistic excellence and delicate craftsmanship impossible to realize until it is seen . And this is only one object among many . There are about thirty boxes , some of large size , whirl ) do not seem to have been opened or even tamp ... red with . in one box , the lid of which had fallen off , I noticed two magnificent ushabti , or figures of men , who were supposed to act as substitutes or assistants of the deceased in his labors in the hereafter . We opened one box , resembling a small sentry-box , and found a pair of lions or leopards with figures of the King in gilt wood on their backs . I know I am repeating myself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsmanship and beauty any of the things that have been found up till now , but it is a fact , and one which , I am sure , w:r/ be endorsed by the public in due time . Gorgeous Ostrich Fan in a Box . There was one box from which we lifted the Ild , expecting to find it full of miscellaneous contents . Instead we found only a single object , but that , I believe , is unique in the history of Egyptian exploration . It was an ostrich feather fan . All the feathers are still there , looking in perfect , though probably very delicate , condition . Still with the chemical and expert knowledge at our disposal it is Possible we shall be able to preserve it all complete . The handle of the fan was a real joy to contemplate . It is difficult to describe it after such a brief inspection , but it was made of ivory with a crosspiece , or arm , set like the letter L at right angles with the main handle , the feathers being set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply but elegantly carved with , near the top , the king 's cartouche in different colored atones . This beautiful object in perfect artistic taste was well deserving of being treasured in a box by itself . There are a number of model boots , charmingly painted , some with rigging and linen , sails complete , and others being rowboats . It will be interesting later to compare these boats with the wonderful set , found by the Metropolitan Museum of New ' York some two years ago . These dated to the eleventh , dynasty and it will be instructive to note whether the boat construction and methods of propulsion had much changed between the eleventh and the end of the eighteenth dynasty , which was about 900 to 1.000 years , Another most striking thing which it was impossible to overlook was a lifesize jackal , representing the god . Anebis , couchant and mounted on poles , presumably to be carried on men 's shoulders . A Priceless Box of arepeLry . Another was a box full of jewelry , which , whatever the intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might almost call priceless today . What the other unopened boxes contain it is useless even to try to guess , but it is reasonable to hope that we may learn much about Egyptian burial customs and the objects used . There are many rites , the precise nature of which we have yet only dimly conjectured , but with the help of the objects . found here , these may be elucidated and made intelligible . I have little doubt that as we remove shrine after shrine , the space between each succeeding pair of walls will be found full of articles of the most intense interest and , judging from those already found , probably of surpassing beauty . The work of dismantling and removing the shrines will require the greatest care and dexterity and I anticipate constantly increasing interest as we go on and quickening excitement until we reach the place where , I have no doubt , the body of the king lies undisturbed . Such a sight as the body of one of the ancient kings , lying untouched as it was laid there , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly expect to find the Pharaoh still decked with the royal jewels and what will prove the full regalia of a king of Egypt . All the Egyptologists , present on Friday , were deeply moved by the un. - forgettable experience and one and all assured me that they never dreamed of beholding so unique and impressive a spectacle . Owing to the splendid arrangements , made by Mr. Carter , the work of opening the sealed door went off wonderfully well . It was a ticklish operation but passed off without a hitch of any sort .
