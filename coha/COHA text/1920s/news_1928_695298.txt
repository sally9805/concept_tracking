txt Great Britain has for years boasted her prospective position in the oil fields and she has a right to be proud of her supremacy in Persia . If the United States had backed the Chester concession we might have had too much of an oil monopoly . We have oil enough on this side of the water without I striving for world monopoly . People who think tha : oil ; is going to be scarce some time in the future had oetter study the oil seepages and undeveloped oil areas from Africa to the Arctic Circle . At both these points there are indications of greater - Al areas than any that have yet been opened . When it comes to diplomacy , we are , of course wholly outclassed by the English , the most diplomatic and politely forceful nation in the world . In respect to invention , transportation , manufacturing and merchandising , we appear to have held and to hold our own . The English are now awakening to the value of advertising as a business promoter . But Deterding of the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attacked the Russian oil contracts made with the American oil companies , and attempted to Destroy them with vocalization . Deterding wanted that Russian 7 I himself , and of course it was audacious for the American companies operating in India and the East to take the nearby Russian oil for the European and eastern markets . Work 0. er Words Apparently Deterding attempted to " holler a hole " through those contracts . But that distinguished American . Thomas A. Edison. is the only man who has ever invented a machine for talking a bole through a board . Deterding filled the newspapers on both sides of the water with a wordy warfare and then he struck his mighty blow  --  against himself , his own markets and his ca-n companies . He reduced oil prices and waved a red flag over the gory situation he had created  --  within his own area . The New York people murmured a gentle reply to indicate that Deterding had unsuccessfully nought the same contracts they had secured . and really had no basis of complaint . Whaley of the Vacuum Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American oils . to increase his gross business and net profits , to the continued advantage of his stockholders , while Deterding went into the international markets to borrow money by the hundred million . to ? it is understood that the genial and diplomatic Pratt of the Standp.rd Oil of New Yorlt  --  efepped from . New . York into London . ' had a " howcry* with Defending and perhaps ( " oh . tell it so softly " ) had a mug of English ale with him without violating American prohibition . Pratt probably intimated to Deterding that when the Russian oil contracts expired the American people would take in Deterding on new business as before . The Press Agents But what a fool is sometimes made of the American newspaper reading public . It was forced into reading columns on columns of what appeared as an international controversy but was really only a commercial fight over some oil contracts . America has the laugh on the English and the Royal Dutch . but what a laugh Russia would have on them all if it should recover a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , stop taxing the police of other countries to repress her Soviet agitators all the way from Berlin , Switzerland . London and Mexico to New Bedford . Mass. , recognize her honest national and international debts , respect labor as represented in property creation . and invite capital for the development of the greatest unturned soil and the richest mineral territory in the world . Then Russia might be producing ten times as much oil as now flows from her wells , and might be consuming it all within her borders . Financial Success Again let it be remarked that the Standard Oil companies are now selling for over $5,000,000,000. and the Standard of New Jersey for over a billion , or more than it was ever quoted when representing all of the 32 Standard Oil companies preceding the United States clecr ? ? of dissolution . The Standard Oil Co. of New York . whim Deterding threatened with extinction when he cut the price of oil in India . is selling for nearly $600.000.000. although it had a value of only $41,000,000 when it began business independently of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same time has advanced from a value of 512,500.000 to $375.000,000 . It continued to increase its earnings when Deterding was imegaphoning to tell how iniquitous it was to buy Russian I oil without his cooperation . Let it also be remarked in passing that the more these Sandard Oil companies are smashed the more pros , porous they become . When the Standard Oil Co. was ? dissolved by the United States Supreme Court it had 1$96.000.000 capital , and now the various parts have 96.000.000 shares .
