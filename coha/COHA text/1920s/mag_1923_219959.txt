An appeal and a warning was issued to all Indians by Indian Commissioner A. H. Burke . His appeal was especially against holding tribal dances when their work was needed in the fields , against torturing their bodies and handling poisonous snakes , against giving away their clothing , horses , cows and other possessions at ceremonies , against drugs , intoxicants and gambling at dances . <P> His warning was , that unless these reforms took place within a year , his department would take action . <P> Following the Commissioner 's message , two protests were immediately made . The American Indian Defense Society in Manhattan asserted that if the program is carried out , the Indians will be compelled to abandon traditions as old as their race , and will be denied freedom in worshiping the gods of their ancestors . The other protest came from the Yakimo tribe in the State of Washington . Its chief in announcing the usual spring dances declared : " You say , ' Farm as the white man does ' and ' Save your money as the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man from dancing we may also stop dancing .
