On and on and on went the Williamstown Institute of International Politics ( TIME , July 28 et seq . ) <P> To start the third week , the Experts ' Plan for Germany 's restoration was lugged into Chapin Hall . The members hunched forward in their seats to hear what Dr. Moritz J. Bonn , financial oracle to many a Berlin ministry , would say . <P> Dr. Bonn approved , with minor reservations ; said the Plan had removed one or two of the larger flies from the Versailles Treaty ointment . Sir James Arthur Salter , chief of the League 's financial section , in his turn likened the Experts ' job of work to the bridging of many gulfs . John H. Fahey , a major fixture in the U. S. Chamber of Commerce , skimmed over the high points of a world trade revival that he and other business men had envisioned springing all golden from the Experts ' foreheads . <P> Dr. Harry A. Garfield , host of all present , introduced Yusuke Tsurumi , young Japanese Liberal : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portals that the Congress of the United States sometimes makes mistakes . " <P> Said Yusuke , every inch the diplomat : " The recent Immigration Bill . . . has had and will continue to have ' grave consequences . ' . . . To grow angry about it is like growing angry at storms and earthquakes . . . . America and Japan , on the opposite shores of a vast ocean , stand now upon the threshold of a new era-the Pacific era . " <P> Dr. Leo S. Rowe , Pan-Americanist , suggested the League as a counterbalance , if not a substitute , for the Doctrine of James Monroe . <P> General Henry T. Allen , famed Ruhr occupant for the U. S. , fanned up some academic excitement by revealing that the Washington Conference on Limitation of Armaments ( 1920 ) almost initiated an association of nations . General Allen was demonstrating that the World Court idea was " the legitimate child of a Republican father and a Democratic mother , " neither of whom should contemplate infanticide . <P> And so to Exhibit B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been pouring over the League of Nations for days . There had been dissension . Now the debate was brought out into Chapin Hall , where the Army and Business ( pro ) locked epithets with the Navy and miscellaneous interests ( con ) . Rear Admiral John A. Rodgers , outspoken mariner , " shocked " a Britisher , was hissed by a woman . The tumult over , Sir Arthur obliged by answering League questions , dubbing the U. S. " Arcadia , " to keep his remarks free from improprieties . <P> Said the Boston Transcript , irritably : " A marvelous testimony to American good nature and American patience is the Williamstown Institute of Politics . . . frothy utterances . . . foreign meddling during a Presidential campaign .
