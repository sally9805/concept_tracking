One hundred and eight guns boomed , at Peking last week in terrific salute . At the Hall of Ceremonies , an imposing structure on a tiny island in the middle of a toy lake , hundreds of Chinese officers and diplomats prostrated themselves thrice . A Chinese band struck up the national anthem-to Western ears shrill and squealing . At the focus of this orgy of homage stood a slim , imperious Chinese , clad from neck to heel in a gorgeous , shimmering , blue silk Field Marshal 's uniform of his own invention .

The wire was strung , the bags piled up ( TIME , April 11 ) to barricade the Occidental quarter at Shanghai against possible Chinese violence after that city was taken by the " Nationalist " armies of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ( TIME , March 28 ) . Last week the danger of Chinese violence at Shanghai was thought to have vanished . As a precaution , however , the barricades were taken down only where they interfered with traffic , were left standing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
