The Dutch Senate voted against a bill prohibiting daylight saving time . The new time will probably come into effect on June 1 . The question of daylight saving was the cause of a hot political dispute between the town dwellers and the agrarians .

The latter , who are very numerous , obtained the support of the Catholic Party ; they declare that daylight saving time is entirely unfavorable to farming . It is clear that the Senate have overridden a majority demand in the interests of trade , which is affected by Holland 's neighbors adopting the summer time schedule .
