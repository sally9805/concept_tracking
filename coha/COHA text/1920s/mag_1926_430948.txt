WE ARE pretty well accustomed to the idea that a great deal is being found out of late about the world and even about human beings . Physicists have discovered dead matter to be electrical charges in an amazing state of agitation ; biologists reveal every day something astonishing about the ways of life ; psychologists , about the play of the emotions . Knowledge certainly comes in rapidly enough , but Wisdom tarries . Life seems to be rather more of a mess now than ever before . At least , our poets and best story writers and dramatists present it full of bewilderment and frustration . Still , there is usually the implication that a great many of our disappointments and woes are gratuitous and unnecessary , the result of tragic stupidity and want of insight , rather than the fatal dictates of the gods . We ask pitifully , " What keeps us back , when so many undreamed-of possibilities are opening before us ? " The older longing to be " good , " with the hope of making all things right , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most need . This suspicion is reflected in a great number of books which have been coming out since that most imposing stupidity ? the World War ? to show how badly we think . Formerly only a few philosophers wondered about thinking ; now all of us are invited to consider why we manage our growing resources of information and insight so ineffectively as regards reducing friction with our fellows and maintaining peace in our own bosoms . It is evident enough that our thinking and feelings do not change so readily as our circumstances , and can not as yet keep pace with our knowledge at its present rate of increase . We continue to think of new things in old ways . Our sentiments teem with embarrassing anachronisms of which we are usually quite unconscious . Both old and new elements enter into all life 's perplexities . The old , as we shall see , always enjoys the right of way . It is as yet rarely  | summoned to prove its case . The old is at bottom a habit ; the new an adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us most of the time than adventure ! The new attracts attention and comment by reason of its freshness . The old , by reason of its familiarity , is commonly merely taken for granted . Nevertheless , since almost all things are as they are because they have been as they have been , their secret lies in the past . Our present problems can not be understood by just looking them in the face . We have to ask how they arose ? in trenchant slang , " How did we get that way ? " Notwithstanding our sprightly criticisms , we are far more old-fashioned than we realize . Old habits of thought yield very reluctantly to new . This is not astonishing when we consider that it has taken perhaps a half million years to inch along as far as we have gone . Ancient ways of thought and action become terrible nuisances long before they can be discarded . Goethe says gloomily : Es erben rich Gesetz ' and Rechte Wie eine edge Kranlcheit fort . The old drags us down like a chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is obviously but one aspect of man 's fate . The old is the indispensable foundation of the new . Without it no advance in knowledge and human improvement would be possible . Father Time is the benefactor to whom we literally owe everything , but he is exceedingly jealous of his established scheme of things . Wisdom will come as we learn to recognize vividly our abject dependence upon him and at the same time invent more ingenious ways than those hitherto discovered for exposing and overcoming his inveterate prejudices . How instructive is our annual symbolism as we reach December 31 . The old year makes his bow to the newborn and totters off to the grave . Within a twelvemonth the baby goes the way of his hoary predecessor . We can not start anew on January 1 or any other day . This truth historians dignify by the term " Continuity of History . " We are sadly familiar with this disagreeable fact but rarely appreciate its essentiality in all profitable thinking about human troubles . It is easy enough to illustrate our unconscious debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prejudices and conceits , our scruples and obligations are very seldom of our own making . They are historical products handed down to us , frequently from remote periods and alien peoples . Let us consider the historical implications of this magazine . It is printed on paper invented by the Chinese early in the Christian era and introduced into Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries . The letters were devised by the Phoenicians , adopted by the previously illiterate Greeks , modified by the Romans , and altered , so far as the " lower case " is concerned , by the medieval scribes . The capital letters are still the same that we find in ancient Roman inscriptions . The language is based upon a western German tongue used by the Teutonic invaders of England in the fifth century . It was later given added range and sophistication by the admixture of Latin and Norman-French words . English colonists brought it to this country , and it remains almost the same as when Jamestown and Plymouth were founded . Shakespeare and Francis Bacon could have understood Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the authorized version of the Bible prepared under their dread monarch , James I. Printing was a Dutch and German innovation made nearly five hundred years ago . This " August " issue is socalled after the Emperor Augustus , who added a day taken from February to make his month as long as the preceding one dedicated to Julius Ceesar . The year of Our Lord 1926 represents a method of reckoning time initiated by the ancient Egyptians , improved by Julius Caesar ,  | connected with the birth of Christ by Dionysius Exiguus in the sixth century , and readjusted by Pope Gregory XIII . These are but a few of the ways we unconsciously perpetuate the past . But they are enough to depreciate the stock of the hundred per cent American to a point where it would have to be reckoned in thirty-seconds of one per cent . II All advancement in intelligence and insight depends upon our ability to call in question and reconsider what we have hitherto taken for granted . The young Arab chants the Koran in a Cairo mosque ; the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rub her ailing baby on a stone fox ; the old-fashioned Chinese student conned Confucius ' Analects ; and Mr. Bryan read his Bible . Their ways were different , but to the critical onlooker each had exactly the same reason for his particular confidence . Each took for granted the habits of the group in which he happened to be reared . This is Truth for the multitude and for the conspicuously good and respectable of all ages and climes . During the two or three thousand years of man 's immediate past a certain number of thinkers have , as a result of curiosity , contrariness , or an awakened sense of the prevailing stupidity , set to work to reexamine , in this detail or that , what was taken for granted by their fellows . The Hebrew prophets , beginning with Amos and Isaiah , denounced the prevailing ideas about God and reexplained the service he demanded . Gautama , the Buddha , two or three centuries later , showed up the vanity of worldly ambitions and recommended new paths to philosophic calm and peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way by the respectable citizens of Athens . Euripides also had- more doubts than his generation cared to listen to . The expedients of those who have quarreled with Father Time 's " wise saws and modern instances " have been various . The Hebrew prophets listened to the still , small voice of God , and said thus " saith the Lord " ; in India holy men sought truth in silence and meditation ; in Athens chattering in the market place was quite as highly esteemed . In the late Middle Ages the habit grew up of defending lists of carefully formulated theses about God and his angels , sin and salvation . By the opening of the seventeenth century Bacon , Descartes , Galileo , and others lost all interest in the discussions of the scholastic professors and proposed a new way of learning how things are ? namely , by trying to see how they work . The incredible results of experimental science are too obvious to require rehearsing here . This method of seeking truth stands approved among all those qualified to have an opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another device for increasing understanding was developed . The biologists began to realize that their insight into the peculiarities of a plant or animal could be vastly increased by taking account of how the organism had come about , that is , by studying its history and that of its ancestors . The human body , for instance , is far more explicable in many respects when viewed historically than " as is . " The atrophied muscles for moving our ears and those which once wagged an ancestral tail , together with certain maladjustments which came from getting on our hind legs become plain enough if we look back far enough . Anatomy to-day tends to run off into embryology and even into protozoology , for our life is dependent upon the amcebalike white blood corpuscles which swim through our arteries and veins and cluster by hundreds of millions in our tissues . The Fundamentalists refuse to accept man 's pedigree as traced by biological genealogists . But the history of their own bodies offers a sort of recapitulation of the history of their race . If they  | would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his " word , " they might make less trouble for teachers of zoology . If they could once grasp the fact that the most stalwart of them not many years ago was a single fertilized cell too tiny for the human eye to discern , this historical consideration could hardly fail to modify their contentions . It turns out , then , that it was , curiously enough , the biologist rather than the " historian " who first appreciated the tremendous advantage of finding out how things had come about in order to comprehend the more fully how they are . But the students of nature did more . They furnished a new setting for human history . They have shown that man is part and parcel of the vast realm of living creatures and shares with them the exquisite responsibility of being alive . They also suggested the starting point from which we may reckon the beginnings of the unique human experiment which we call civilization . Its advance is to be measured by the degree in which it transcends the possibilities of our animal progenitors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught by patient trainers to do many humanlike things ? such as drinking out of a cup , riding a bicycle , and smoking a cigarette . But if he returned to the jungle and his own folk he would not be able to interest them in these innovations . Man alone , owing to certain unique physical peculiarities into which we can not go here , has been able to take up , apply , and gradually accumulate the inventions and ideas of those rare fumblers who came from time to time upon some new notion . III But what about the historians ? They have for two thousand years and more been pretending to tell us about man 's past ; but their works until very recently have been pretty dull and unilluminating . I , at least , find them so , and infer that what bores me is likely to bore others . They tell me so much that I do not care about and fail to answer the questions which I am most eager to have answered . Voltaire long ago heaped reproaches on the historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prepared for a friend with the expressed hope that it might interest her . For the old chronicles of dynastic wars and religious controversies he substituted the tale of human customs as they had changed through the ages . From a modern standpoint he was ill qualified for the job , but the idea was significant . During the French Revolution the highspirited Condorcet , a fugitive from the terrorists , hastily wrote out his " sketch " of human progress , which left out almost all that had been hitherto included in general accounts of history , and substituted highly exciting reflections on the past , and on the future prospects of that prime autodidact , Man . Herbert Spencer pronounced history , as commonly presented , worthless . Buckle believed it to be an imposing mass of meaningless reminiscences and tried to substitute something better . But he was just a trifle too early to be affected by the evolutionary and revolutionary teachings of Darwin . Greene in his famous History of the English People endeavored to escape from the routine account of monarchs , courts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preoccupations , and achievements of the nation as a whole . Just as the World War was coming to a close in 1918 a German writer of no special academic standing , Oswald Spengler , issued a stately work in two volumes under the startling title , Downfall of the West . This opens with the most pertinent indictment of historical writers with which I am familiar . One does not have to share Spengler 's rather mystic and Hegelian notion of the essence ( Seelenthum ) of history , nor his conclusion that we are now in the last stage of a cycle which is bound to end with our age . We do seem compelled , however , to accept his contention that the methods  | and results of studying man 's world ? his achievements and perplexities , his morals and manners , his fears and aspirations , his religions and arts ? must be quite different from those appropriate to an investigation of the so-called world of nature . The art of inquiring into the past of man himself is , in short , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfections better than Spengler . He complains that historians have been narrow and provincial and have mistaken their particular part of the world for the whole human experiment . This is true enough . " World " history , written by Westerners , is an affront to a Chinaman or an East Indian or even an Arab . But the gist of Spengler 's argument is far more profound ? and it is the gist of this article . Historians have usually confined themselves to reporting events or describing institutions of a particular part of the world during a particular period . They have told how things have been rather than how they came about . They have made contributions to human history , but have so far failed to give it its most precious significance . We can ask two quite different questions in regard to the past : " What has happened here and there from time to time ? " To answer this was the aim of former historians . Although Gibbon regarded the task of the historian as " an indispensable duty , " he declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the historical writer could lay claim . The second question is , " How is it that we now do as we do , feel as we feel , and know what we know ? This is a novel inquiry which fills the orthodox with consternation . It is to them nothing less , in the strong words of Scripture , than a whoring after strange gods , a disreputable kind of " philosophy of history " which should be left to mystic philosophers and poets . While I share their distrust of the various kinds of philosophy of history , including Spengler 's , I am confident that the answering of the second question must be the aim of historians if they are to exercise their full effect in the development of human enlightenment . Of course the first question is a necessary preliminary ; but the hewers of wood and drawers of water have been busy with it so long that we can begin on the second . When Lloyd George submitted his budget of 1909 in his " war on poverty " it was defended by Winston Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax-gatherer was , How much have you got ? ' . . . Now a new question has arisen . We do not only ask to-day , How much have you got ? ' we ask , How did you get it ? ' " When historians become expert in answering the question as to how we and our troubles have come about , history will deal mainly with what Mr. Marvin so penetratingly calls " the living past , " and this will radiate a light in which all our achievements and difficulties will stand out far more distinctly than ever before . The present writer can not explain very well even to himself how he has happened to devote a great part of his professional life to working out a different conception of history and its import from that handed down to him . He has hewn wood and drawn water enough to be in the historians ' guild , but he has always felt a certain qualm when he was forced to explain that he taught history . He feared that it might be assumed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can recollect his first meeting up with that august subject in school . There was a text book in which something was said of Pocahontas , the evacuation of Boston , the embargoes , and Fort Pillow . All these matters seemed irrelevant to an eleven-year-old youngster , but fortunately it was the era of decalcomania , a now-forgotten amusement , ? to-day a device confined to the decoration of cheap china . For a few cents one could get a set of brightly colored heads of just the size to fit neatly on the American heroes whose portraits appeared in the text book . There was  | nothing unpatriotic in the process of transfer , for the faces were hidden until they were irrevocably attached to the hero . Washington warning the pigheaded Braddock turned out to be a darky ; President Jackson was transformed into Pontiac ; General Burnside , into a Barbary pirate . Some heroes had bottle noses and exhibited unmistakable signs of dissipation . It took me some years however to realize that what most people think of as the study of history consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right date on the right battle , the right territorial transfer associated with the right treaty . I have , God forgive me , participated in a great number of examinations for the doctor 's degree . On these occasions timid and over-wrought young men and women are summoned to exhibit their proficiency in this pasting madness ( which seems to be what " decalcomania " means ) . How easy to say the battle of the Boyne when you should have said that of Bouvines ; the treaty of Ithyswick when you were expected to say Nimwegen ; Urban V when your inquisitor , who had once struggled through Theodoric of Niem 's De Scismate , Libri tres , had in mind Urban VI and his jocose atrocities . Even intelligent people often explain that they do not care for history because they can not remember dates . But who can , except the pedant or one that is using the dates to give precision to a fairly thorough knowledge of a period ? We know our own history better than that of Charles V or Napoleon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of recollecting , than give the alleged date of our birth , and those of graduation and marriage , and the sequence of children , if we happen to have graduated , been married , and had children . Bergson has pointed out that the brain is an organ of forgetfulness . It certainly has to forget almost everything in order to remember anything . Its usefulness consists in recalling the right thing at the right moment . The historian usually has had a feeble power of discrimination . He humbly reported what his sources happened to include , with little attention to whether his readers or even he himself had any obvious reason for being interested in what he selected . What onlookers call " impartial " history and professionals call " objective , " is merely history without an object . This is no implied excuse on my part for slipshod work . History may be both true and useful , since nothing is more scientific than showing how things as they are have come about . IV One who undertook half a million of years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization well under way might be puzzled by the outcome . He would have been a very shrewd prophet indeed to have foreseen that , being a sort of ex-animal , man would tend to sanctify the habits he happened to acquire . The other animals presumably just obey their habits without attempting to justify them or give them a fine name . One of the great obstacles to a free reconsideration of the details of our human plight is our tendency to regard familiar notions as " sacred " : that is , too assured to be questioned except by the perverse and wicked . This word to the student of human sentiment is redolent of ancient , musty misapprehensions . It recalls a primitive and savage setting-off of purity and impurity , cleanness and uncleanness . The French retain the double meaning of the word in their sacre , which means at once " blessed " and " damned . " Blessed is he who agrees with me and let others be damned . When we realize that this and that notion of ours is " sacred , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has emphasized in his Instinct of the Herd , in Peace and War , it is a childish impression which we have never carefully scrutinized . A woman once warned me that she was " religious "  | and that I had better be careful what I said to her . I replied that she seemed to suspect me of irreligion from her standpoint , and that she should also be considerate of my feelings . The claim to immunity on the ground of sacredness is by no means confined to religious controversy : it now includes the current system of business , governmental organization , and the family . It is one of the important obstacles in the way of free discussion and readapting our habits so as to bring them into accord with increasing knowledge and new conditions . Simple prejudices or unconsidered convictions are so numerous that the urgence and shortness of life hardly permit any of us , even the most alert , to summon all of them before the judgment seat . Then there are the sacred prejudices of which it seems to me we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energetic . History might be so re-written that it would at least eliminate the feeling that any of our ideas or habits should be exempt from prosecution when grounds for indictment were suggested by experience . We need a new kind of historian who will utilize the information painfully amassed by the older ones in order to bring it to bear on the quandaries of our life to-day . Our problems are oftimes inherited , and can best be met by fuller knowledge of their origin and development . The State , as we now know it , is a sort of reincarnation of the ancient chieftain and his entourage . Our religious beliefs are ostensibly Semitic , derived from a pastoral people and dwellers in Syrian villages and small towns . Our education still perpetuates medieval or classical conceptions . Our standards in the relations of men and women still smack of the ascetic theories of virtue of the days of Saint Augustine , and our theories of business , as Veblen points out , hark back to the eighteenth century . In the discussion of a relatively new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very recent question ? the entrance of the United States into the League of Nations ? we find the sacredness of Biblical anthropology and the authoritative utterances of Washington invoked . A proper understanding of the past would show the irrelevance of this type of argument . Precedent , however venerable , must be reinspected before it is accepted . Indeed , the more venerable it is the more suspicious should we become that it is an anachronism , originating in times and under conditions far removed from our own . When reverence for the past encroaches upon our meditations and decisions we are admitting an ancient but highly dangerous mischief-maker , so far as honest analysis and planning are concerned . Now history might be so written as to undermine prejudice ? which means that of which we can be quite sure without giving it any proper attention ? and especially the savage survival of " sacredness . " History , in the sense here recommended , is the sovereign solvent of prejudice and the necessary preliminary to readjustments and reforms . It is a sort of aqua regia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom . Nowadays all expert physicians in dealing with physical and mental dislocations always ask , " How did he get that way ? " They are not content to take what they can see without wondering how it came about . Our social , political , economic , and educational diseases must be dealt with in the same way . It is a fundamental and hopeful discovery , to be ranked among the great inventions of mankind , that we do not necessarily learn much about a situation from what is sometimes called a scientific method of dealing with it . We can fill a big book with statistical tables and imposing graphs , but so long as we do not ask how we got into the fix we miss the main point . When in the seventeenth century almost all educated men , doctors , theologians , jurists , professors , believed in witchcraft one might have prepared questionnaires and surveys to  | seek out and record the incidence of witchcraft , the frequency of the devil 's " sabbaths , " the technic of getting up a chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of witches who sank when they were cast into the water , the average location of the devil 's mark . But all this would hardly have forwarded the disappearance of the delusion . Witchcraft was , it is true , supported by history , but by history in the old sense . One might cite the terrible command " thou shalt not suffer a witch to live " ; the instance of the witch of Endor , and the tales in Apuleius . But none of these had anything to do with the manner in which the superstition had come about . What a chastening effect it might have on an ardent Marxian socialist to realize that Marx 's theories were a mid-Victorian product , the counterpart of the classical , Manchester , school of defenders of things as they were ! What effect would it have on the worshipers of our Federal Constitution , who would have every schoolchild believe it a sacred and inspired document , to read the Madison Papers , realize the groping , the compromises , the British and French influences that went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent of the entrance of the United States into the League of Nations it might not be a bad thing to see how exactly his arguments resemble those of the opponents of our Federal Constitution when it was submitted to the various States for ratification . Those who " believe in " the Bible might believe in it in so much less intolerant and hampering a fashion if they but knew the history of the Hebrew religious anthology comprising contributions extending through a thousand years . The late Professor Morris Jastrow has in his Gentle Cynic given a gracious account of the origin of the book of Ecclesiastes and illustrated the methods of sacred writers of yore . The basis of the little treatise as we have it was a description of the vanity of human life . All things are full of weariness unutterable , the " eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing . " Man hath no preeminence above the beasts . They all go speedily to the same place . Get what you can but remember that " there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grave whither thou goest . " This gloomy picture was later toned down by the interpolations of a more hopeful editor . Then , since the little book ( written perhaps in the time of Alexander the Great or later ) had been ascribed to Solomon ( who had died some five hundred years before it was composed ) , a third writer adds a few proverbs to which it was supposed that wise king had been addicted . If one is reluctant to accept the conclusions reported by Professor Jastrow he may consult a little book by George Foot Moore on The Literature of the Old Testament , which is a sketch of the various ways the books of the Bible were built up . The history of the New Testament is equally enlightening . These few instances must suffice as illustrations of the way in which fuller knowledge of how a thing came about may alter our attitude toward it . We are all endowed with defense mechanisms which operate automatically . It is a poor technic when attempting to convert one 's neighbor to attack his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may flatter ourselves that we are undermining them by our potent reasoning only to find that we have shored them up so that they are firmer than ever . Often history will work where nothing else will . It very gently modifies one 's attitude . Refutations are weak compared with its mild but potent operation . To become historically-minded is to be grown-up .  |
