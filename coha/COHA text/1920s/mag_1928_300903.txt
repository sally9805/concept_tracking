Through Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , then home again to New York , proceeded the Smith Special last week . <P> St. Louis . The press acquired a habit of comparing the popular demonstrations accorded Nominee Smith to the Lindbergh demonstrations of last year . The Smith demonstration in St. Louis was " practically as great " as Lindbergh 's . Beer and the Brown Derby seemed to be the chief attractions . <P> Sedalia . What makes Sedalia , Mo. , a famed political spot is a 230-acre enclosure , the State Fair Grounds , with an auditorium that will hold some 10,000 persons . With this edifice packed , a crowd of 35,000 milled outside . They had eaten the town out of food supplies . They were so thick that pickpockets were able to filch $500 from Norman H. Davis ( $150 of which he was guarding for Mrs. Charles Dana Gibson ) , and $125 each from two Manhattan newspapermen . <P> Candidates for state offices had been talking for hours before Nominee Smith arrived . The crowd was not greatly excited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on " Coolidge economy . " All those present got the main point : that any great reduction in the cost of running the Government after 1921 was more likely the natural result of the return of the country to a peacetime basis than the phenomenal result of " rigorous " economy . But scores of auditors were sidling through the exits before the Nominee finished adducing details to prove his point . This was , perhaps , just as well for the Nominee , because many of his details were ill-chosen , incorrect . That the main point was felt and resented in Washington was seen next day when Secretary Mellon issued a long parrying statement which knocked most of the Smith details , though not the main point , out of court . <P> " Chinese Puzzle . " A typically political result of the Smith-Mellon skirmish was the appearance of the great Chinese Puzzle Issue in the campaign . At Sedalia , Nominee Smith said the Government 's fiscal reports were ' ' about as near a Chinese puzzle as anything I ever saw in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the most accurate statement in Governor Smith 's entire speech . " In Chicago , Governor Smith retorted : " If it is a Chinese puzzle to me with all my experience in diving into governmental figures running over a quarter of a century , what must it be to the fellow on the sidewalk ? . . . I frankly admit it is a Chinese puzzle . I do not conceal it . And he Secretary Mellon knows it is . " <P> Chicago . Wearing a pair of socks monogrammed across the shin with his name , " because one of my friends in North Carolina gave them to me " ; jostled , huzzahed , jeered , cheered , gaped at , the Nominee spent three days in pandemonstrative Chicago . Cartoonist John Tinney McCutcheon drew a picture in the Chicago Tribune of an elephant looking down from a window on the crowd-banked Smith parade , and saying : " It 's lucky for me that eagerness to see him does n't mean eagerness to vote for him . " That night the crowds burned bonfires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
