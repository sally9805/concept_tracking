txt Drawing at his old briar , Charles G. Dawes , Republican candidate for Vice President , returned home today . There were no brass bands on the station platform and no reception committee , and no great milling crowd , for the reason that the General had been expected to arrive at 10 A. M. , Chicago time , or at 9 o'clock railroad time , but instead he arrived an hour earlier . Even the General 's family and officials at the Central Trust Company bank had the wrong information . It was not long , however , before the old school churns of General Dawes , R. R. Lloyd and Harry C. Butler of Dallas , Texas , appeared , and they were followed by a number of reporters and a photographer . The General smiled and appeared not the least disappointed With the situation . And then came the little Dawes family from Evanston  --  Mrs. Dawes . who had come on ahead , and the two adopted Dawes children , Dana , 12 years old , and Virginia , 10 years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all at once . After he had greeted Mrs. Dawes his arms seldom left the shoulders of Dana and Virginia . Mrs. Dawes and the children , a look of subdued pride and happiness on their Paces , then went back to Evanston , while the General proceeded to his office at the Central Trust Company . Business is business , even if one is a candidate for the Vice Presidency . General Dawes is first of all a business man . Crowd Cheers Him at Bank . If the reception at the station had been lacking in acclaim the absence of applause was made up when the general 's car drew up in front of the bank . A. crowd of several thousand had gathered in front of the building , packing the street from curb to curb . Here there was shouting and cheering and handclapping until the skyscrapers of the financial district echoed with the noise . Smiling broadly , the General entered the bank , followed by as many as could force their way inside . His trusty briar still in hand , he retired at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of telegrams and letters on his desk . Many of these were messages of congratulation . On the General 's desk stood a white elephant , emblematic or the party of which he Is an associate standard bearer , and a small American flag . Having broken the backbone of his day 's work , General Dawes decided to call it a day and caught an 11 o'clock train for his home in Evanston . He seemed anxious to get back to his foster children once more . Neither at the station nor in his office would the General discuss politics . Asked if he would continue his work as organizer of the Minute Men of America , he replied : " I can not answer that or any other question at this time . " " I 'll have something to say after I have been officially notified of the nomination , " hepromised , " I do n't think it 's wise to talk unless there 's something needs saying , " he said . " And as yet we have n't decided What needs saying first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added , Clad in a dark bluish-black suit with a white pencil stripe and wearing a Summer straw , tilted to one side ; the general appeared a trifle paler than usual . There was something at once humble and almost solemn in the attitude of both the candidate and his family . On the ride to Evanston , during luncheon , there . and on the sun-warmed lawns surrounding his home and overlooking the lake , the General became a conversationalist on subjects other than Polities . " This pipe causes a lot of talk , I suppose , " he said . " The photographers all ask me to smoke when they make pictures . " Funny thing . I suppose the fellow who makes the pipes will make a lot of money . I do n't know him and I do n't know where I could buy the pipe . My secretary gets them for me . Dammed good pipe . I 'm not trying to press agent the thing  --  I like it . I 'm going on smoking it . " I 've explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not goinE over it with you  --  I 'll give you a Pipe . The gift is filled , lighted and . puffed . " Tell about the Hell'n Maria . ' The General laughed . " First get it straight  --  it 's Hell Maria , " he says . " It 's not ' hell and Maria ' or anything like that . It is Hell Marla . It is a common expression down in Southern Ohio . Everybody is familiar with it in that neck of the woods . I think it 's a damned good expression . It got started in Washington . ' A lot of men who did n't understand war had been asking me foolish questions . They asked me if I had paid $400 for a horse . It made me good and mad . I shouted , ' Why Hell Maria , I 'd have paid horse prices for sheep if sheep could have drawn caissons and guns to the Argonne . Our boys were there ' getting Hell from the German artillery and they had to have artillery support " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ' worth their weight ' in gold , ' and I 'd have paid anything for ' em . Hell Maria never fitted an occasion so appropriately and I certainly threw it at them . That 's the way it got started.I think it 's a good expression .. The two upside down pipes sent billows of smoke over the lawn . A group of boys came up . The General arose , addressed them all by name , shook their hands and patted their dogs . The boys were wide-eyed , stammering " yes , sirs " and " no sirs . " " The music ? 0 , I 've written a lot of it . " he said . " That one piece was ' pretty mood . k few41ijrfaat gockde z published . Then Kreisler played it . My judgmeiit was confirmed . " There was a drafty puffing of the pipe , then  --  just for an instant  --  the General verged on politics . " I saw a Paper which said the rehabilitation of Germany will be a great boom for the farmers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the farmer 's hope . But I must't talk about it . Forefather Rode With Paul Revere . " Sure , one of my forefathers assisted Paul Revere in his famous ride . Revere had Longfellow for a press agent . ' Listen my children , and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere . ' Perhaps Dawes did n't have the same swing , cadence , or whatever it is the poets need  --  the rides - of never and Dawes are reenacted each year in Massachusetts . They asked me to come back in April and ride . I thought my forefather would turn over in his grave if he saw me astride a horse . " Now , I ca n't say anything about the campaign . Great weather . Do n't blame my kids for wanting to stay here . Wish I could have stayed in Marietta . It 's a wonderful place .. Everybody so friendly . ' Twenty or more photographers appeared with their tripods . " Reminds me of Europe . Lots of movie men there . Always shooting pictures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a good pipe . " The General will spend his time at " home and at his bank until the official word from the Republican Party starts him off on the march which he hopes will end in Washington . He 'll have plenty to . say when the cannonading starts . There is a twinkle in his eyes when he refuses to discuss the matter now , but there will be fireworks when General Dawes opens his campaign , Mrs. Dawes was asked whether she approved of the nomination and its acceptance . " But I never talk about such things , " she answered . " My husband does all that , you know . " She pulled her royal blue satin coat tighter . A bright red fancy button near her shoulder matched the lining of her blue parasol . Her hat was in keeping with the entire effect of the costume , blue straw and feathers . " I  --  really have n't anything to say , " she said again . General Dawes removed his pipe from his mouth and scowled a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he warned the reported 's . E ? : pressive looks were exchanged , and Mrs. Dawes said . in spite of herself : ' When I was in N w York last time , tosu Z 3r11/ the reporters were . eely to met You , luu
