Homer Loring , who is developing a reputation as a " minute man " for New England industry , last week revealed that before he resigned the chairmanship of the Boston &; Maine R. R. a month ago ( TIME , March 26 ) , he was developing plans to help the whole community of Fall River , as he had helped that railroad . <P> A few days after the Fall River fire ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) , he and Louis Kroh Liggett , president of the United Drug Co. and director of a dozen other important New England industries , decided that , as long as they intended to " rejuvenate " some New England community , they should begin with stricken Fall River . Mr. Loring put investigators to work , who soon found that Fall River cotton mill owners were in the mood for merging and refinancing . Such action required banking facilities , which Fall River lacked . <P> Thereupon Mr. Loring proposed to increase the capitalization of the B. M. C. Durfee Trust Co. of Fall River and have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metacomet National . Last week directors of the three institutions agreed to accept Mr. Loring 's plans , which of course are also Mr. Liggett's.
