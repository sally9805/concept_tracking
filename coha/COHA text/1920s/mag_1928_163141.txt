The progress last week of Candidate Hoover , busy beaver-man of the present Administration , towards theRepublican nomination , was as follows : <P> Ohio held a primary and Hooverized 31 of the state 's 51 convention votes , a far larger majority than had been expected . Women 's votes were heavily pro-Hoover . The balance of 20 delegates , technically instructed for the late Candidate Willis , were mostly committed to Candidate Lowden as second choice and Non-Candidate Dawes for third . An embarrassing feature was the defeat of Senator Simeon D. Fess as a delegate-at-large . The G. O. P. had already picked him as convention keynoter . But his admission to the convention , it was thought , could be arranged by obtaining for him the proxy of some elected delegate . Though he had formally stood for Candidate Willis , the Hooverites cogitated the gesture of offering Keynoter Fess the proxy of one of their own men . <P> Pennsylvania held a primary and though no candidate had filed his name , the voters wrote Candidate Hoover 's name on the ballots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 79 Pennsylvania delegates . <P> Massachusetts held a primary and , though Massachusetts delegates arenot legally bound , the writing-in of names gave Candidate Hoover the state 's solid backing , 39 strong . <P> Rollin Kirby , acute cartoonist of the astute New York World , drew a picture of the Primary School , a one-room structure flying the U. S. flag . Out into the road , in sailor hat , buster brown collar , short trousers and socks , came a fattish cherub waving his report card at an old gentleman labelled G. 0 . P. The cartoon was entitled : " Look , Daddy ! " The cherub was labelled Hoover . The report card said : <P> " Deportment ... 100 <P> " Attendance ... 100 <P> " Reading ... 100 <P> " Arithmetic ... 100 <P> " Home Work ... 100 <P> " Neatness ... 100 <P> ( Signed ) " Very good , Herbert . " Teacher . " <P> <P> Party conventions elsewhere during the week strengthened other candidates only sparingly . Oklahoma Republicans urged their 20 delegates to vote first for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to instruct their nine delegates . Arizona 's nine were reported to favor Candidate Lowden , but were not instructed . Alaska Republicans did not instruct their two delegates . The standing of delegates instructed or fairly claimed for all G. O. P. candidates as of last weekend was : Hoover , 359 ; Lowden , 211 ; Curtis , 24 ; Norris , 11 ; Borah , 11.
