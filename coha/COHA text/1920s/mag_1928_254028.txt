His Tribune want ad called for the services of a nurse . A Ruth Sampson answered the ad , and her he assaulted . Then he disappeared . The attack made an excellent Tribune story ; the Negro 's arrest would make another . But best for the paper 's business office , if he were caught , would be the well-spread cry : The Tribune guarantees the integrity of even its want ads . . . . Truth among the agate lines . <P> So Reporter Moses Lamson was set upon Negro Crowe 's scent . He used skullduggery and pipelines of sly information-police , stool pigeons , private detectives , Pullman porters , servants . . . . Shrewdly he asked the best catch-scamps - doctors- to watch for the villain . The quarry has cancer of the stomach ( TIME , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Kansas City , Mo. , Reporter Moses Lamson caught his Robert Malachi Crowe .

The reporter received a $1,000 bonus and the Tribune the want ad publicity , as the moral approbation , upon which it had calculated .
