Of these , 15 used the compulsory system , Britain the voluntary , Switzerland the militia . In 1925 , there are 25 powers which maintain armies . Of these , 14 have the compulsory system , five the voluntary , six the militia . If figures be adduced , " there has been no material diminution in the number of armed men maintained in Europe today as compared to 1913 .
