When the jury of eleven married men and one widower filed into the Chicago Criminal Court last week , Dr. Amante Rongetti , proprietor of a Chicago hospital , the prisoner , stood up . The jury foreman silently passed the written verdict to the court clerk , who read aloud in courtly monotone : <P> " Guilty and we fix his punishment at death . " <P> It was the first time in the U. S. , according to the prosecuting attorneys , that a physician had been given a death sentence as penalty for having performed an abortion , although many a one has been fined or imprisoned . The crime is fairly common , say sociologists , in the U. S. and is increasing . Although abortions are exceedingly dangerous to the health &; life of a woman , they are relatively simple operations to perform . Death is usually an untoward accident . <P> Convicted Dr. Rongetti 's operation-upon the body of one Miss Loretta J. Enders of Chicago-was replete with rude accidents : <P> 1 ) The baby was born alive . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a furnace . <P> 2 ) He permitted the delivered mother to contract blood poison , from which she died . <P> 3 ) He refused to perform another operation that might have saved her life because , " She had no money . " <P> 4 ) He refused to let her go to a public hospital for fear of revealing his abortion . <P> 5 ) He refused to let a priest shrive her before her death , for the same reason . <P> 6 ) He issued a false death certificate , declaring that she had died of heart disease . <P> All this constituted premeditated murder decided the jury . Dr. Rongetti will , unless his lawyers can prevent , die in the electric chair , the first to do so in Illinois , which has hitherto despatched its convicted murderers by hanging .
