One disadvantage of being a Congressman is that you have to talk about one topic for months , years . On trains back to Washington last week , Congressmen were still talking , after a decade of it , about farm relief . Politically if not economically , something-must-be-done . <P> Economics . Insoluble though it seems , the economic aspect of the farm problem is simple . The only large variable involved is weather . If weather is good , so are crops . Too-big crops make too-small prices . If weather is bad , prices are good but many a farmer will have no crop to sell . Intelligent study of sound weather data will help stabilize his decision as to when to plant but the farmer still needs a gambler 's instinct at planting time . And thereafter his fortune is in the lap of winds , rains , frosts . <P> Through his associations , the farmer is supposed to learn how much to plant so that there will not be a price-shrinking surplus . But most farmers are individualists . Far better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man raises as much as he can . Aid in marketing a surplus continues to interest most farmers more than laws of supply &; demand . <P> Politics . Being a gambler , the farmer is a skeptic and like all skeptics he is willing to believe unpleasant things . Thus , for example , when politicians tell him , for their own purposes , that the tariff discriminates against him , he believes it . Were the politicians honest , they would say that the tariff favors manufacturers , which is very different . But instead of mere jealousy , the farmer has been made to feel that he suffers downright injury from the manufacturers ' tariff . Similarly , ever since the Government fixed farm prices as a War measure , the farmer has been told , and he believes , there is no honest reason why the Government should not try to stabilize farm prices permanently . The Federal Reserve Board stabilizes the money market . Why should a Federal board not stabilize the food market ? So asks the farmer , and threatens with a ballot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Plans . The outstanding and controversial features of farm-relief plans have been , a ) Federal price-bolstering and b ) tariff adjustment . Plans currently urged contain these features as follows : <P> 1 ) The Farm Bureau Federation clings to the equalization-fee of the aged McNary-Haugen Bill . By this plan , each farmer would pay some of his profits into a pot , held by the Government , from which farmers with losses would draw compensation . How to compute such losses ? By having the Government fix " a fair price " for all crops each year . Farmers forced ( by the presence of a crop surplus ) to sell below the U. S. price , would be considered losers . <P> 2 ) The National Grange and Senator Caraway of Arkansas want export debentures . The latter would be negotiable receipts issued by marketing agencies to farmers who market their crops abroad . Senator Caraway 's suggestion is that the debentures should be used by the crop-exporters to buy imports duty-free , thus settling the tariff argument . The National Grange urges a tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> 3 ) Senator Borah and others have proposed that the U. S. determine the cost of U. S. crops , buy surpluses and market them abroad . This is subsidy .
