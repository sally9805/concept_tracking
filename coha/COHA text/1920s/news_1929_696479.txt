His . short speech , preparatory to announcing . the winner ; was highly complimentary to the boys , whom he characterized as a " splendid and representative body of ? young . men from all parts of the United States . " The candidates . tense and woryied-after.the intricate questionnaire and the evening entertainment which terminated after 3 o'clock in the morning ' after taking in Coney Island . Chinatown  --  and other sights of the metropolis , were relieved when the name of the winner was announced . It . was the climax oUthree pleasurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till 3 A. M. It was also.the close of a hard  --  period for the judges . The octogenarian inventor , a. shawl thrown about his shoulders . sat ' up until 3 A. M : yes- terday with the other judges to go over the forty-nine examination papers , each of which contained fifty-seven questions . Colonel Lindbergh looked tired ; so did Mr. Ford and Dr. Lewis Perry . headmaster of Philips-Exeter Academy , who had only snatched a few hours of sleep . ' The latter two/were the pedagogical members of the judging committee . The other member , George Eastman , president of the Eastman Kodak Company . had left for Rochester on a business call . Out on the lawn , where squirrels played tag between the tripods of movie photographers and the sun shone down on the rhododendron beds , the boy candidates stood in two rows . expectant and hopeful . They had first been called to assemble in the library of Mr. Edison 's laboratory . and were all seated and ready for the verdict when the plans were changed , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police force of West Orange kept order , and the chief and his men seized the opportunity to obtain autographs from the illustrious judges . The boys had faced a marble Eros grasping an incandescent lamp , flanked by a grinning bacchante . They seemed pleased at the change in arrangements . A few preliminary questions had been asked . Were any of them Boy Scouts ? Thirty-four responded affirmatively . Then fortynine souvenir albums were distributed , and finally they repaired to the Edison residence . There was some standing about and shuffling of feet . and then the photographers shouted : " Here comes the old man . " Mr. Edison. smiling and genial , strode forth , followed by the other judges , and Dr. Stratton made his short speech . He explained that the questions which might have seemed strange , almost foolish . had been carefully prepared to test the character and ideals of the boys . He explained that the questions had all been thought out by the judges . Those bearing on automobiles by Mr. Ford , those having to do with airplanes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members . All , he said , had been taken into account . Losers Cheer the Victor " I am just saying this to keep you boys in suspense , " he observed jocularly , to which the candidates responded with laughter . Then came the dramatic moment , the announcement of the winner , and the pent-up excitement was given air in a wave of cheering and general rush to shake young Huston by the hand and to lift him high in the air on strong young shoulders . When the hubbub had died down . and when the victor had been duly photographed shaking hands with all the judges , Dr. Stratton called out the names of the other four , and announced that " we old fellows have formed The Owls ' Club to be in the running with your Forty-niners ' Club . " He expressed the hope of a future get-together under circumstances as pleasant as the present . and wished them all success in life . For a few moments the winning candidate , nervously handling his spectacles , told the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wash. , that he had a little brother and a small sister . that his hobby was marine biology ? chiefly the study of specimens along Puget - Sound , that he intended to be a chemical engineer . Then he was rushed inside , and was not seen again until he was received by Mayor Walker in New York . Dr. Stratton later stated that no school teachers could have taken a greater interest in the examinations than had Mr. Edison , Colonel Lindbergh . Mr. Ford and the other judges . To the question " How would you spend $1,000.000 if that sum were left to you within the next year ? " most of the candidates had replied to the following effect : They would get the advice of a competent authority to invest it properly , give some to their churches and parents , and equip laboratories . ? Young Huston is the boy who modestly explained that he would give a fair amount to his family parish , because , he said . it was Door , and some to his father and mother . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important was : " Which one of the following would you be willing to sacrifice for the sake of being successful : happiness . comfort . reputation , pride , honor , health , money . love ? " Huston 's answer to this was : " I would sacrifice comfort . " " All the examination papers were numbered , " said Dr. . Stratton . " We did not know the names of the boys when we judged them . " Oral Test at Last Moment . At the last moment . however , the judges decided to give the boys a short oral test yesterday morning . They were asked questions that seemed innocent enough . but which apparently had some bearing upon the final . pronouncement . Huston will be the guest of 312r . Edison at West Orange for two days He will then return to Seattle . and in the Fall he will begin his studies ' at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the first holder of the Edison Scholarship . The Edison prot  --  g ? found a few moments to answer further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whalen at the City Hall . Surrounded by reporters , in fact with his back to the wall , he answered question after question , hesitating now and again , and occasionally refusing to reply , because . as he put it , " I did not like my own answer . " It was learned from this mass interview that Huston attended Lakeside School at Seattle . He was born in Detroit and later lived for two years in Baltimore . In the Seattle school he was a member of the fencing team and also played football and took part in some of the track events " My favorite publications , " he said , " are the Readers Digest , the Atlantic Monthly , the Literary Digest and the Scientific American . " " Never , " he replied when asked whether he had ever indulged in journalism , " but I am beginning to learn . " One poser in the Edison questionnaire had been : " When do you consider a lie to be permissible ? " To this Huston had answered : " In case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not benefit yourself in any way . " Huston never has been a Boy Scout nor has he belonged to the Y. C. A .. he said . To the question in the examination as to the future of the automobile he had answered that the automobile would become a subordinate means of transportation . to be used for short distances , while the airplane would be used for longer distances . He had also predicted the electrification of the airplane . Another question was as to what he would do if , marooned on an uninhabited island of the South Pacific , he had to move a heavy boulder for some distance . He had replied that he would use . a lever on an incline plane  --  provided he got it started . " Are you surprised that you won ? " asked some one . " Very much so . " replied Huston . Then came some inquiries which he apparently did not relish . " Nothing doing . I wo n't answer those , " he declared . Earlier in the day he had been approached by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal story for a certain sum of money . Only he and one other turned down the offer . One of the candidates . who showed considerable business alertness. had replied to the same offer : " But suppose another paper should offer me $500 ? " Walker Honors Huston . At 4:30 o'clock the boys stood in the Mayor 's office . Commissioner Whalen and Mr. Walker came in , and the introductory remarks were made by Charles Edison , son of the inventor , who accompanied the boys en the trip around the harbor . After choking hands with Huston , the Mayor proclaimed the blushing boy " champion of the champions , " and proceeded to extol the motives and the objects of the Edison contest . " It is a great privilege , " said the Mayor , " to welcome you to New York . It is an added distinction to our great city . The very name of Thomas A. Edison stands for the great admiration we have for that great American . When we are dead , when our children and grandchildren are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest in the country . The present fine scholarship contest is the sort of thing one would almost expect from a Thomas A. Edison . There will come out of this a great encouragement for the youth of America . and something great will result not only for America but for civilization . " There are forty-nine reasons why New York is proud to greet you boys from each State and district of the United States today . Your tests have been many and difficult , and you have proven that you are the choice of your home Sates . In the name of the City of New York I congratulate you all . What you will achieve later in life is bound to be good for America . " Then . as each of the boys filed by to shake hands with Mr. Walker , the Mayor dropped his serious manner and had the boys laughing and giggling at his droll remarks : To the boy from Missouri he observed : " Well . did they show you ? " " They certainly did , " grinned the lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you once a year in Louisville , " he ventured , and the Mayor grinned broadly . " Ha-ha , " ? said the Mayor to the Florida youth . " You must meet our friend , Commissioner Whalen . Perhaps you have seen a lot of him . You boys should get together . " Whereupon the head of ' the Police Department laughed and had a small chat with the boy from Florida . " Hot down there ? " suggested the Mayor to the Texas aspirant for honors . " No hotter than here , " replied the boy .. The Mayor buttonholed the candidate from Illinois , explaining that members of his family live somewhere between DeKaib and Clinton . " I live just between DeKalb and Clinton , " said the lad , who has attended a Lutheran orphanage in those parts . " That 's the way I 've been living for many years , " said the Mayor smilingly . With more photographs on the City Hall steps the official program of the affair . was ended . Some- of the boys left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the night . All their expenses have been paid by Mr. Edison.
