Carnival . Meet Mr. Molnar ; meet the Charles Frohman Company ; meet Miss Elsie Ferguson . Almost any evening you may meet them coming in a body out of the Cort Theatre with their baggage in hand . For these three , famed for consistent and successful ability , have collaborated in one of the foremost failures of the season . <P> Miss Ferguson seems least at fault . A trifle less lissome , perhaps , than in her earlier days , she is still the corporeal substance of a vision ; still plays with the grace and subtlety that made her famous . Mr. Molnar wrote an intricately interesting study of a woman wild to jump the hedge of life 's convention . He failed to set his study in a sufficiently decisive dramatic narrative . The woman 's character is there in all its broad sweep and tiny detail . Who cares ? The tale is tiresome . The Frohman production was surprisingly uneven for such an astute organization . They supplied actors and scenery instead of blending them . <P> The story tells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For two years she has loved a youth , feared to go to him because of the watch of her veteran and nagging husband . The great Crown diamond is lost-a Buddah 's eye with a history . Finding it behind a hanging , she catches fire from its influence . She tells her lover she will run away . In the crisis , he falters . Disillusioned , she gives up the diamond and goes back to her husband . <P> Patience . It has long been the experience of diligent navigators that it is difficult to look through a folded-up telescope . Some similar difficulty was encountered in watching this capsule review of one of the best of Gilbert and Sullivan . It was produced at the tiny Provincetown Playhouse where three 's a crowd on the stage and where the auditorium has all the lofty spaciousness of a doll 's house . Necessarily , therefore , the " 20 lovesick maidens we " of the opening chorus were reduced to ten , the dragoons enlistment was meagre , the orchestra minute and the vocal acrobatics tempered and discreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the auditors that the Provincetown Patience was too little of a good thing . <P> Rosalind Fuller sang the title role . <P> Her past is chiefly conspicuous in its <P> relation to Shakespeare . She sang <P> By Gis and By Saint Charity , <P> Alack , and fie for shame . . . . and others of the warped lyrics of Ophelia-the Ophelia whom the Hamlet of John Barrymore demented . Her present performance gives pledge of a considerable ability in light opera if presented without so many physical restrictions . Her colleagues were moderately well equipped for other assignments . Particularly pleasant was Edgar Stehli 's interpretation of the rotund Bunthorne . <P> To the considerable clique of Manhattan sages to whom Gilbert and Sullivan are the dual Messiahs of light musical entertainment , the values of the script and score were all-sufficient . To the casual wanderer seeking just a real good show , the miniature may seem in spots a trifle indistinct . <P> Seeniaya Ptitza . French entertainment may come and French entertainment may go , but the Russians go on forever . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go on back to Leningrad and stay there . They delivered pale entertainment fashioned precisely on the lines of the Chauve Souris . A certain element of soothing saturnine melody they delivered , very little humor and no novelty .
