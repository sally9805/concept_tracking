The Powder Mine in India INDIA is far away . Few Americans go there ; our newspapers give little space to happenings in such a remote quarter of the globe . It is ' difficult for us to realize that political developments among the people of India may have an important bearing on our own future ; yet the most earnest students of Oriental affairs assure us that this is not only probable but certain . It has become the tritest of truisms to say that the theatre of world events in the future will be the Pacific Ocean , as it has been the Atlantic in the recent past , and the Mediterranean before that . The keynote to the future of the Pacific is the attitude of Asia ; and today Asia is in a state which is not far from open revolt against the white man and his Western civilization . In Japan , this takes at the moment the form of bitter resentment against the United States for our new immigration law , and against Australia for keeping idle and empty a continent capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six million Englishmen . In China , the same fires of fanatical , semi-religious hatred for the foreign devil which provoked the Boxer uprising are not far below the surface , and might perhaps have flared out before this had China not been preoccupied with problems of internal unity and the struggle against Japanese exploitation ( that exploitation being a copy of the best , or worst , Western European model ) . The whole Mohammedan world , as represented by teeming millions in Asia Minor , in Africa and India is in a ferment ; and while the famous religious war against the white race seems to have been somewhat prematurely advertised , it is a very serious matter , particularly to England and France , whose chief policies of state are profoundly affected by the menace of an Oriental revolt . Finally , all India , Mohammedan and Hindu , is close to the boiling point in its desire to throw off the hated British yoke . The leaders of the movement in that country are well aware of their weakness in a military sense and the terrible suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the history of revolution that the counsel of wise leaders is swept aside when the indignation of the people and their sense of intolerable wrongs goes beyond the hounds of restraint by prudence . The people of the Orient are patient ; but they are also human . I have no desire to be unduly alarmist . An actual uprising in India may not take place . But whether it does or not , the rising tide of independence , of a sense of nationalism which transcends creed or caste , is producing a situation which makes it seem impossible that Great Britain shall hold India more than another generation at most . After all , the British Empire is fundamentally a business proposition . If India costs far more than she isworth , year after year ? which is not the case now ? that is an argument which the House of Commons and the India Office can not fail to hear . It would be folly not to recognize that there are enormous difficulties in the path of the independence movement . The prestige of the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is still high enough to exert an extraordinary influence which one can hardly understand unless he has seen it in operation on the ground . There is also the question of religious differences , particularly as it is expressed in the caste system . Caste is still very strong in India ; in fact , hardly any progress has been made toward its abolition . There are , for instance , fifty-three million " untouchables " who in many parts of the country can not even draw water from wells used by the higher castes . They can not walk the public roads without calling a warning ; they can not enter public schools or temples . The difficulty of conducting a unified political movement under such circumstances is obvious . But the moves made in the last few months show that in this field also India is progressing . Most people when they think of India think of Gandhi . While he is a man of the greatest spiritual power , a leader of the type which founds new religions , his non-cooperation movement has on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizes . The element of Indian life which is now most formidable to British rule is Swaraj , of which C. R. Das is the best known leader . The Swarajists , who are historically one wing of the Gandhi movement , also believe in noncooperation but of a different sort . They conduct political agitation , get themselves elected to the provincial or national legislature , and then proceed to hamper the machinery of government by refusing to pass bills , by airing their grievances in debate , and by otherwise making the life of their British rulers anything but a happy one . The latest developments , however , as expressed in Gandhi 's new unity proposal , indicate that all the political sections of the country will soon be united under one leadership . It will be remembered that some years ago , with a great flourish , India was given a supposedly large degree of home rule under the famous Montagu plan with the promise of more as soon as her inhabitants had proved themselves capable of meeting their responsibilities . The hollowness of these promises is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not really succeeded in seriously . interfering with the business of state . All the really important functions are still to be found , in the last analysis , in the hands of appointive British officials . One of the interesting speculations when the Labor government came into power in England was : What would it do about India ? Reviewing its activities , the question may now be answered : it Bid nothing , A commission of inquiry was instituted in order to find out ? what everyone well knew already ? what reforms India required . Commenting on this investigation , The Hindu , the leading Indian paper and one which is thoroughly temperate in tone , said : The authority really controlling Indian affairs pursues an ostriclolike policy , else it would not have added this fresh insult of a sham show of reforms inquiry to the injury it has already done . The Labor government must not be blamed too harshly for its failure to take action . As a minority government , it did not dare tamper with an imperial policy which would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England knows little about India , and those who are best informed have a lively sense of the economic importance of that country to themselves , Also , the routine of handling Indian affairs is carried on by Anglo-Indian officials , most of whom have Used for years in that country , and are thoroughly imbued with the point of view of British officialdom which is , of course , one of complete hostility to yielding anything at all to the " natives . " Under such circumstances , the Secretary of State for India , no matter how liberal his personal sympathies , finds himself helpless , bound hand and foot by red tape , delegated authority , tradition and inertia . How completely this is true has been described eloquently by E , S. Montagu , author of the famous Montagu plan , whose death a short time ago was a severe loss to the than ranks of those Englishmen who understand India . It has sometimes been questioned says Mr. Montagu. / whether a democracy can rule an empire . I say that in this instance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the House of Commons were to give orders to the Secretary of State , the latter is not his OM . master . In matters vital/y affecting India , he can lac over-ruled by a majority of his Council . I may be told that the cases are very rare in which the Council has differed from the Secretary of State for basis . I knownno case anyhow , where it W. a very mar thing and the action of the Council might , without remedy , have involved the Government of India M a policy out of harmony with the declared policy of the House of Commons and the Cabinet . And these gentlemen are appointed for seven years , and can only be controlled from the Houses of Parliament by a resolution carried in both liousm calling on them for their resignations . The whole system of the Indian office is designed to prevent control by the House of Commons for fear there might be too advanced a Secretary of State . I do not say that it is possible to govern India through the intervention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is that , .. he must get his expert advice in some other way than by this Council of men , great men though no doubt they always are , who come after lengthy service in India // to spend the first years of their retirement as members of the Council . If the Labor government did nothing for India , the new conservative government is fairly certain to do less than nothing . Its probable general attitude was indicated recently by Lord Curzon , speaking at a dinner of the Central Asian Society , when he said : . .. But in this area of chaos and disillusion ( Asia ) there is yet one great dominion still intact , with its frontiers still untouched , one great empire still , I believe , capable of exhibiting those virtues and setting that example which may help , at any rate , to arrest the decline of Central Asia . I allude to the Indian Empire of Great Britain . Here you still have British rule , although shaken , supreme ; still you have the frontiers of India untouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their great work in the East the strength and substance of their lives . The duty imposed on as from on high still lies on the British race . Let us not take our hand Boni the plow . When you consider the present state of feeling in India , it is easy to imagine what will he the result of the new rigor and rigidity with which , under a conservative government , Indian aspirations will be suppressed . An idea of what is ahead is indicated by the fact that the new Secretary of State for India is Viscount Birkenhead , while the new Under-Secretary is Lord Winterton , who occupied the same position in the last Baldwin Cabinet , and whose past activities have antagonized even the most moderate native leaders . Only a few weeks ago Lord Winterton declared over his own signature : I find myself - today as far as ever from visualizing the conditions under which the territory which is now known as British India will one day exereiry the functions of sell-government within the Empire . A more drastic policy on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands made by the Indians . At present the general body of opinion probably supports the modest proposals of Das , though as always in such a situation , the drift is steadily toward the Left . The Indian leaders are quite willing to remain inside the Empire , though they insist upon complete home rule at a not too distant date and one which must be definitely fixed in advance . They demand that British officials in India in the future shall be expert advisers but not directors of . policy clothed with arbitrary power . As Mr. Das remarked to the writer in the course of a conversation a few months ago : " We want to remain in the Empire if that is not inconsistent with our establishing our own system of our young men to think of going outside the Etn ? pire . " The form of home rule desired is one which would give the Indians complete autonomy in internal oft ah. , they do not ask to take control of for . December 17 , 1924 THE NEW aign policy nor to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India were expressed in a resolution passed not long ago by the National Legislative Assembly at Delhi . This resolution recommended that The Governor General in Council take steps to have the Government of India Act revised with a view to establish full responsible government in India and for the said purpose ( a ) summon at an early date a representative Round Table Conference to recommend with due regard to the protection of the rights and interests of important minorities the scheme of a constitution for India and ( b ) after dissolving the Central Legislature , to place the said scheme , for approval , before a newly elected Indian Legislature for its approval and to submit the same to the British Parliament to be embodied in a statute . The British in India are strongly opposed even to such a mild form of home rule as is suggested . Some of them merely feel that it is premature at the present time , and look forward to the day when India will be able to stand on her own feet . But there are others , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think India will ever be able to manage its own affairs . The main arguments they raise are , first , the incompatibility of Hindu and Moslem , and , second , the inability of the Indians to guard their country against external aggression . " Full Dominion status , " said Sir Malcolm Dailey , the present Governor of the Punjab , " means a Dominion government . I have not seen any serious thinker who pretends that India is in a position or will in the immediate future be in a position to create a Dominion army . " On the other hand , a cautious liberal Indian like Sir Sivaswany Aiyer points out that " none of the British Colonies was in a position to assume its defense at the time when self-governing status was granted to it . The Home government had to contribute toward the military expenditures of the Colonies . We , on the other hand , from the beginning have paid for our army , raised our troops and paid for the British troops in India . As for defense against external aggression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominions even now . " So far as political developments are concerned , that is where the question of India rests at present . But no recital of political history gives any inkling of the terrible undercurrents of passionate hatred which are sweeping her today . The dreadful Amritsar massacre of 1919 is neither forgotten nor forgiven , and especially since a London Court of Justice a few months ago brought in a verdict virtually condoning that massacre . In February , 1924 , occurred another shooting equally unjustified , when a body of Sikhs were fired upon by government troops as the dimax to a quarrel over desecration of a shrine , and a number of them killed and wounded . It , also , has raised a storm of protest . In October , 1924 , the VicesRoy promulgated an on , REPUBLIC Sot dinance to apply to the Bengal province which gives to the executive and the police officers extraordis nary powers to make arrests without warrant . Hundreds of arrests were immediately made . The resentment against this ordinance is immense . For many years , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the British in India , distinctions not dissimilar from those made againt the Negroes in our own South . No matter how much one has heard of such things , however , they mean little until they have come under one 's personal experience . I could fill a volume with incidents observed in the course of a recent trip across India , but one may serve as a sample . I remember one day getting into a railway third-class compartment ? Indian third-class , not reserved for Europeans ? which was only half occupied . I had my sun hat on , and observed with surprise that no one else tried to enter our compartment , though the rest of the train was desperately overcrowded as usual . Travelers took one glance at our compartment and then hurried off and struggled to squeeze in elsewhere . I asked one of my companions , a Vakil ( country lawyer ) to explain . " They are afraid of you , " said the Vakil . " They think you are English . " " But , " said I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well put out of the carriage people who have paid for their fares as much as I have . " " That shows , " he said , " that you have not been very long in this country , or you would know that the English can do here many things not permitted by law . " He added , " If you take your sun hat off , you will look like a Parsee . See what happens . " He was right . As soon as I had no hat on they came flocking in , When I saw that one more in our carriage would mean suffocation , I put my hat on again and no one else entered . I tried this repeatedly , all over India , and it always worked . A trifling incident , you will say ; and perhaps you are right . But multiply it not by the thousands but by the millions , see similar things happening every day and hour , year in and year out for generations , and perhaps you will begin to understand why so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are today so close to the breaking point . If the Great War had not taken place , the smouldering resentment might have continued to smoulder . Until then , millions of the conquered believed with the conquerors that the latter had a superior civilization , were made of finer , stronger stuff , and by some decree of Providence were en-tided to rule . But the East saw European civilization tested in that war and found wanting . And they saw these superior white men descend to the last depths of barbarism , cruelty and horror in the effort to win . The lesson thus learned has not been forgotten . We are likely to hear more of it , not Less , as time goes on .
