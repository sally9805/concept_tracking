txt The first annual meeting of the American Petroleum Institute began its sessions today under the chairmanship of Thomas A. O'Donnell , its president . There was a laree attendance . Among the subjects discussed by various groups , following the morning session , was that of finding methods of compiling statistics of the industry from the various companies and which would be centered in the American Petroleum Institute . The transportation problems of the Industry in relation to the movement of oil by tank cars was discussed by A. M. Schoyer , traffic manager of the Pennsylvania Lines , who stated that there has been a considerable improvement in the movement of tank cars . In 1919 , he stated , the Pennsylvania Lines East of Pittsburgh handled a total of 3,500,000 tons of freight in tank cars , about 11i ' : ; of the total tonnage . Forrest M. Towle , . head of several of the large Standard Oil pipe line companies , discussed the pipe line situation in general , and particularly regarding any new extensions which , he stated , depended largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present mid-Continent trunk system to the Wyoming fields , he said , would probably not occur until indications were such that production there was sufficient to take care of the Wyoming refineries and assure a sufficient surplus for movement by a new , big line . He did not believe , under present conditions , that a satisfactory pipe line could be built to the newly discovered well at Fort No Man , in northwest Canada , due to the distance and climatic conditions , but that this would have to wait for determination until the field was more fully developed . Ile stated that developments in Colombia indicates a field of considerable oil possibilities had been found . Two pipe lines , he stated , are under contemplation , one to the Colombian coast and the other to the Venezuelan seaboard . but added that he understood a pass had been found over the Andes Mountains on the border of the two counttree , , not more than one mile high , and that in that event only one line would be needed , as oil could be piped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At some Act distant time , he stated , pipe lines will undoubtedly he needed to handle oil production from shale deposits in Colorado , 1.1. , ; .. 11 , Wyoming and Nevada , as he expected we will drawn considerable of our oil supplies from shale in future years . Speaking of the petroleum problem from a world viewpoint , and particularly in its . relation to Amerlea , Walter C. Teagle , president of Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey , said figures of production and zonsumption emphasize the relatively smaller part our home production is going to play in the future , and that American oil men must seek production in foreign countries . The world 's consumption of petroleum this year he estimated et Cl 5 , oty ) . one barrels , contrasted with ; i17 , - 000.000 barrels in 1910. while in 1921 the world will call for close to 700.000,000 barrels . Even though the United States is producing upward of 445,000,000 barrels this Fear , it will require about 120,000,000 barrels of foreign crude oil . mostly Mexican . to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in endeavoring to explain the position their government has taken since the armistice , have argued that , as the United States is now supplying 7O ' 1 of the world 's current production , we should he well content with things as we are . This is an entirely fallacious view . They should state their deduction in this way : The United States is now spending its petroleum wealth for the world 's benefit , in order to meet 70e1 ' of the world 's present demand . " Americans have done this primarily because they had the most accessible oil , and the facilities for refining and distributing : it . Is it reasonable , however , to ask that they go heedlessly on to the quick exhaustion of their supply , and then retire from the oil business ? " The American oil industry , he continued , must look for new production outside this country , domestic crude not being sufficient for current needs at home , and that it is absolutely imperative that American producers " proceed actively and intelligently to develop oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of the Royal Dutch-Shell interests emphasized the European situation in regard to oil and said : - The European situation today plays the leading part on the world petroleum stage . It is the logical outcome of the lessons of the past six years which actuates Great Britain with the desire to go out into the world to seek its own supplies of petroleum . It is the first principle of the doctrine of eel f-preservat ion . Great Britain is today desirous of acquiring a share of the potential oil-hearing lands throughout the world . There will he competition , but competition of a healthful and stimulating character which is so essential for success of business enterprises . In this eon/petition I ani of the opinion that the rights of the United States and its citizens will he respected , and it may he recalled that the British Premier in speaking of Turkey stated that the legal rights of ? America must be safeguarded . " There has been no general exclusion of any aliens from oil production in the British Empire . as American interests are developing the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large tracts of oil-hearing lands . American interests are also represented in the oil industry of Trinidad . And it may not be out of place to mention that An/erica has a number of concesidons in the Dutch East Indies and has within the past few weeks added to her holdings in that territory . " It seems to me that the problem which faces Great Britain today is to work out a policy which will be fair and non-discriminatory , and which will . at the same time , give some recognition to the prior rights of its citizens in the development of its petroleum reserves . NOT SEEKING MONOPOLY " Motives which have been ascribed to Great Britain of seeking to create a monopoly over the potential oil lande of the world are untenable . Such a grip of the world petroleum industry is impossible . The ' United States enjoys the balance of power in petroleum within her own possessions and . in addition , she controls by for the gi  --  latest share of the production of Mexico . Her holdings of the potential oil-hearing lands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those held by ail other countries . So etrongiy entrenched is the United States in the great world reservoir of oil that it would be wellnigh impossible to take the lead away from her . even assuming that there was the slightest eviden. , . ? of a desire to do so . " The European nations have no such aspirations . Their treasuries have been sorely depleted , and , coupled with farreaching domestic and international problems , their lot is not an enviable one . Is it fully realized that tt requires over 100,000,000 marks to lay down a single cargo of gasoline in Germany , or 2:3,000,000 francs to lay down the same cargo in France , or 40,000,00 lire in Italy , or ** pounds in Great Britain ? " Keee , oste : ON MENU Frederick R. Kellogg Mexican Petroleum Co. attorney , stated that President-elect Obregon of Mexico , has indicated ins intention of improving relations between this country and Mexico and that for this reason " the hope of the oil producers is that one of the tiret steps he will take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President de la Huerta , will be to cause the MexiCan government to abandon , once and for all . the discredited Carranza confiscatory scheme . " He related the attitude of objection taken by American oil companies to the famous Article 27 of the Constitution of 1917 , which , in effect , confiscate- subsoil minerals . " Men will not risk their fortunes rid their lives United States and the exports of refinery products , taken together , have but once in the last two years been less than our domestic production and for about half of the time the consumption has exceeded both the domestic production and the imports . This Iviing beyond our means makes the question of our present oil supply not only a national but an international problem And the outlook is not improving ; indeed , never was the gap between consumption and production /rider than it is now . In September of this year , the daily output of the United States oil wells was slightly over 1250,000 barrels , but the daily of three-eighths of a million barrels was met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are already dependent upon a foreign supply of oil . Shortage of transportation is the one weak spot in the oil industry today , according to W. H. Reed , traffic manager of the Union Petroleum Co. , who said : " In August , 1920 , keels were laid , and there were on the ways in course of construction in the United States yards , 105 tank ships , totaling 791,073 tons . Out of these 105 ships under construction in August there have been a number launched , and contracts called for completion of practically all of them before June 1 , 1921 . There are now in service 220 tank ships on the high seas flying the American flag . The 105 , when completed , will make a total of 325 tankers owned and controlled by American interests which will be actively engaged in the distribution of petroleum to all ports of the world . " Statistics indicate that on March 1 , 1920 , there were registered under foreign flags 346 ships , with a total of 1,621,675 tons , and 52 building in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
