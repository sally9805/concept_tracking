SOCRATES AND PLATO . Greek Philosophy : Part I , Tholes to Plato . By John Burnet . New York : The Macmillan Co. $2.50 . For this volume of Sir Henry Jones 's Schools of Philosophy no scholar in Great Britain was , from one point of view , better prepared than Professor Burnet , both by his extraordinary knowledge of Greek in genereral and by his special studies in editing the text of Plato and in writing his history of " Early Greek Philosophy . " And he has excellent qualifications as a writer . He is always clear and precise and vigorous , though it must be admitted also that his style lacks something of grace and fails to rise in eloquence to the greater heights of his theme . This defect is due , no doubt , to the same bluntness of imagination , or lack of intellectual refinement , which led him to transliterate the personal appellations directly from the Greek , giving us such needless crudities as Sokrates ( why not Sdkratas ? ) and Sokratic . If consistency is so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common usage , why , one asks , does he write Cyrus for Kyros or Kuros , or the Persian form of the word , whatever that may be , and Zeno and Plato for Zenon and Platon ? There is even a certain absurdity in his system when on the same page he gives " Themtetus " as the name of the dialogue , yet transliterates the protagonist of the dialogue as Theaitetos . But , if not elegant , the book is one to read and digest , to learn much from , and in part to disagree with sharply . No one interested in philosophy can afford to pass it by . Professor Burnet 's treatment of the earlier Schools we must leave unnoticed , though there is scarcely a page in these chapters which does not show the working of a mind keenly original and enormously erudite . Particularly noteworthy is the section on Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans , and , indeed , one of Professor Burnet 's pet theses is thedeep and continuous influence of the Italian school on Socrates and all the later modes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students will be ready to follow him far , though , perhaps , not quite so far as he would like to lead them . The most important , or at least the most debatable , aspect of the Pythagorean influence is in the doctrine of ideas . These he connects skilfully , and no doubt correctly , with the actual geometric forms produced by the arrangement of points to represent the square numbers ( 4 , 9 , 16 , etc. ) and the oblong numbers ( 6 , 12 , 20 , etc . ) . In this way the connection between form ( eiclos ) and number is presented in a simple and visible manner , and a perfectly clear meaning is given to Plato 's exclusion of any one not a geometrician from his Academy . The questionable-phase of the theory is seen in Professor Burnet 's insistence on translating eaclos always as " form , " instead of rendering it by " idea " as is customary when dealing with the more advanced philosophy of the Platonic school . He sins a little by over-simplicity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Professor Burnet 's Pythagorean-ism gives an easy explanation of Plato 's continued interest in numbers  --  his mania , some would say , thinking of- certain hard passages in the " Republic " and " Timsius " ? but it leaves out of the Platonic " ideas " too much of that overgrowth of the imagination and that poetic visualization which have made them for two thousand years one of the great sources of inspiration , for good and for evil . To , discover only a bare intellectualism or conceptualism in the visionary flights of the " Pheedrus " is to miss one-half of Platonism . " The ' supercelestial region ' of that dialogue , " he maintains , " is clearly identified with that of pure thought , and the forms the mind beholds in it ? Righteousness itself , Soberness itself , Knowledge , itself  --  do not lend themselves in any way to crude pictorial fancies . " To use the word " crude " is really to beg the question ; but to suppose that the " Phsidrus " does not exhibit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fail to see in it a mysticism of vision which the negations of dialectic can not reach , is to make of Platonism something very different from what innumerable scholars have confidently believed it to be  --  and from what the listeners in the Academy themselves heard . ? And the same sort of reservation must be applied to Professor Burnet 's analysis of the later dialogues and to his account of Plato 's matured system of teaching in the Academy . The description of that school as the first great university of Europe , the insistence on the scientific research in which the students were engaged , the emphasis on the practical side of the political discipline which sent legislators and rulers from Plato 's classrooms over the Greek world  --  all this is an excellent corrective to the too common notion of the Academy as a congregation of visionary and talkative dreamers . Professor Burnet might have enriched his description by quoting from Cicero 's marvelIons description of the Old Academics in the fifth book of the " De Finibus " : From their writings and teachings can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of style ; moreover , they include such a variety of sciences ( arttum ) that without the equipment that they give no one can be adequately prepared to embark on any of the higher careers They have produced orators , generals , and statesmen . To come to the less distinguished professions , this factory of experts in all the sciences has turned out mathematicians , musicians , and physicians . Professor Burnet has done well to lay weight upon the character of this olnnium artificim officnia as a great school of scientific research and of practical sociology ; but he does not do well to slur over the chief aim of the school in its work of producing " liberal culture " ( doctrzna ltbera/zs ) and in its profound religious inspiration . He closes his discussion of the Academy , and his book , with the statement that by solving the problem of the irregular motion of the planets Plato " laid the ghost of the two-world theory which had haunted Greek philosophy since the time of Parmenides . " Such a statement is worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed transcend the dualism that runs through so much of earlier Hellenic thinking ; but he did this only by introducing , and fixing as part of the world 's spiritual heritage , a profounder kind of dualism . Professor Burnet has read through his Plato many times . He should not have forgotten : the " two-world " feeling that permeates the later dialogues , written when the author had passed quite beyond what Professor Burnet holds to have been the more mystical philosophy of Socrates . " We must suppose , " says the Athenian in the " Laws , " " that there are at least two souls in the moving universe , one the author of good , the other able to accomplish the contrary of good . " That " two-world theory " was not disposed of by mathematical demonstrations ; and to ignore it is to miss the heart of Platonism from its inception to its close . As already intimated , Professor Burnet reaches this view of Plato as a scientific rationalist by means of an original , not to say startling , view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this theory , all the dialogues up to and largely inclusive of the " Republic " are purely dramatic and contain nothing of Plato 's own contribution to philosophy . Plato , in fact , had no thoughts of his own during this period of his life , but was content to sink himself entirely in his teacher . The doctrine of ideas , as presented in these dialogues , is not Platonic , but was taken over by Socrates from the Pythagoreans and made his own by substituting the theory of participation for that of imi-tation : The Pythagorean doctrine of imitation left the sensible and intelligible as two separate worlds ; the doctrine of participation makes the sensible identical with the intelligible , except that in sensible things the forms appear to us as a manifold instead of in their unity , and that they are only imperfectly embodied in the particulars . Socrates thus occupied , so far as " ideas " are concerned , a middle ground between the dualism ( chOrisinos ) of Pythagoras and the scientific monism of Plato And not only is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , but the mysticism , the religious feeling ( Or " religiosity , " Professor Burnet might perhaps say ) , the poetical enthusiasm , are also non-Platonic , having come full-fledged to Socrates from , the Orphic and Pythagorean cults , though held in check by his peculiar sense of " irony . " It is important to present this view in Professor Burnet 's own words : I am firmly convinced that the mystical side of the doctrine of forms " ideas " is due to Sokrates and not to Plato . We know certain facts about him , such as his " voice " and his trances , which prove him to have possessed the mystic temperament , and we know certain facts which explain the manner in which he conceives the mystic love He was indeed a visionary or " enthusiast , " in the Greek sense of that word , but he was also uncommonly shrewd . His critics called him " sly , " using a word ( erpc , w ) which is properly applied to foxes . The Scot 's word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes nearest in meaning to the Greek . . . To a very large extent , we gather , " the accustomed irony " of Sokrates was nothing more or less than what we call a sense of humor which enabled him to see things in their proper proportions . That , according to Professor Burnet , is the true Socrates as he was in his later years and as Plato knew him . Of Xen.onhon 's " Memorabilia " our author takes slight account , waving them aside as of no historic value . But there was also an earlier and different Socrates , of whom we have scattered glimpses in Plato and a full-length portrait ( caricatured , of course ) in Aristophanes . It has been one of the problems of scholarship to reconcile the picture of Socrates in " The Clouds , " as a fantastic investigator of nature and leader of a band of pallid students , with the philosopher of the streets , who brought philosophy down from the sky to this earth . Professor Burnet solves the difficulty by frankly accepting both portraits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away by the scientific theorizing of the day and the mature philosopher whose interests were wholly ethical and religious . Now , any theory of so complete a scholar as Professor Burnet is worthy of consideration , and his thesis in regard to Socrates and Plato has the unquestionable value of offering a correction to certain current views But in some points , and those of very grave importance , it is , in the opinion of the present reviewer , demonstrably false and even pernicious . That there was some sort of cleft in the life of Socrates , a period of interest in the physical causes of phenomena preceding his ethical period , is a well-attested fact ; but it may be questioned whether Professor Bur-net 's treatment of this division does not raise it into the region of conjecture . In the main , we think the conjecture is sound and useful , though probably somewhat exaggerated . Professor Burnet is not the first scholar with a theory to push it too far  --  even outside of Germany . Again , that there was a deeply religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates seems to us demonstrable , and to set this forth as Professor Burnet has done is to perform a good service , in view of the inadequate conception of Socrates made widely current by the " G-riechische Denker " of Theodor Gomperz According to that brilliant and much-quoted history , we are to reject all the religious and exhortatory traits of the Platonic Socrates for a mere questioner and promoter of the Auflclarung . The teacher of Plato was no Mahnredner or Tugendprediger ; the story in the " Apology " of his self-dedication to the service of the god is pure moonshine ; he had one simple task , to set forth the unity of knowledge and virtue , and to that end there was no need of exhortation or animating appeal , no room even for any positive ethical teaching , etc , etc . Now the Socrates of Gomperz is simply impossible  --  a creature manufactured in a Teutonic phrontist6rion , and not the living man of Athens from whom the deepest inspiration of philosophy has flowed even to this day . Gomperz himself offers a corrective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume the words from Clemens Alexandrinus : " Wherefore also Cleanthes in his second book concerning Pleasure says that Socrates always taught that the just man is the happy man , and cursed the first man who distinguished between the just and the profitable as one who had done an impious thing . " There is decidedly something of the Illahnredner and Tugendpredtger in the words underscored , though we need not , for all that , picture Socrates quite as a Lutheran parson . If Clemens is right , and Plato was not a mere mystificator , and there is any propriety in calling all the later stream of Greek thought Socratic , and if common-sense has any place in the study of philosophy , then Gomperz is wrong . We may be certain that beneath the irony of Socrates , deeper than his questioning of popular phrases and his search for precision of definition , lay a power of very positive ethical teaching and an emotional appeal , in the master 's own way and at his own time , which smote the heart even of such a worldling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vibrate in the hearts of living men . This is , perhaps , not exactly the tone of Professor Burnet 's treatment of Socrates , but his emphasis of the religious and even the mystical side of Socrates 's character is in the right direction  --  even if carried by him too far . But why must he rob Peter to pay Paul ? To maintain that the thought of the earlier dialogues is purely Socratic and in no sense Platonic , to hold that Plato was a mere dramatist when he wrote the " Republic , " with no philosophy of his own to develop and expound , is to go to the other extreme . Such a view seems , to the present reviewer at least , to be little short of nonsense . Professor Burnet bases his revolutionary theory mainly on the intricate question of " ideas , " taking refuge in a metaphysical jungle from which it would be difficult to dislodge him . It is easy to maintain that between the earlier dialogues , including the " Republic , " and the later dialogues there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " idea , " and to conjecture , therefore ( it can be only conjecture ) , that the one use is Socratic and the other Platonic . But the difficulty of dealing with such an argument lies in its obscurity ; notwithstanding all that has been written on " ideas " and may yet be written , we are not likely to hav clear conception of what they meant exactly to Pythagoras or Socrates or Plato . It is safer , therefore , to waive that argument altogether and to approach the distribution of the Platonic philosophy from another angle . If we can find one question of supreme importance the treatment of which in the principal dialogues of the earlier period shows a perfectly clear progress from the simple point of view known certainly to be that of Socrates to a point of view not essentially different but more profoundly developed , we shall be pretty safe in concluding that these dialogues are not merely dramatic expositions of Socratic teaching , but indicate chronologically the growth of Plato 's own philosophy . Professor Burnet argues from the supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas appears in the very first dialogues and remains the same through the whole early group , and then undergoes a sudden change ; his inference loses its force if another philosophical thesis , simpler and clearer in itself , shows a complete development within the early group . Now , just such a thesis we find in the relation of justice to pleasure ( hedon0 ) and to happiness ( eudairionia ) , as expounded in the three great dialogues , the " Protagoras , " the " Gorgias , " and the " Republic . " The matter is too large to be adequately treated in a review , but the essential steps ? in the progress may be indicated thus : In the " Protagoras " - the argument runs that pleasure is a good and pain an evil . If , therefore , men are to be persuaded to follow justice or virtue , they must be taught that such a life in its sum imparts more pleasure than the contrary life The conclusion may be given in the excellent language of Berkeley 's attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " II , xviii , abridged ) : But Socrates , who was no country parson , suspected your men of pleasure were such through ignorance of the art of reckoning It was his opinion ( Plato in Protag ) that rakes can not reckon . And that for want of this skill they make wrong judgments about pleasure , on the right choice of which their happiness depends To make a right computation , should you not consider all the faculties and all the kinds of pleasure , taking into your account the future as well as the present , and rating them all according to their true value ? And all these points duly considered , will not Socrates seem to have had reason on his side , when- he thought ignorance made rakes , and particularly their being ignorant of what he calls the science of more and less , greater and smaller , equality and comparison , that is to say of the art of computing ? That , if we know anything of the matter , is the pure Socratic logic , admirably summed up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato soon found that the identification of happiness with the larger sum of pleasures offered an exceedingly slippery foundation for morality . In the " Gorgias , " therefore , he attacks the question of pleasure , and in the insolent words of Collides carries the philosophy of hedonism to its logical extreme . In reply Socrates proves that pleasure is not identical with the good which all men pursue , and can not in itself be made the support of justice . Not even the great King of Persia , to whom every source of pleasure is open , is necessarily happy , for we do not know how he stands in the matter of education and justice . Here , and elsewhere in the " Gorgias , " the great conclusion is adumbrated pleasure and happiness are not distinguished quantitatively , but qualitatively , and the just life is to be preferred for reasons apart from any computations of pleasure and pain . We find Plato groping , as yet darkly , for this certainty of self-knowledge by which he was to make the Socratic philosophy the religion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth that is the contrary of the Socratic hedonism of the " Protagoras " ; in another sense he was merely rendering explicit what was implicit in that hedonism , or , rather , correcting Socrates 's imperfect logic by Socrates 's perfect intuition ; for the final fact for which Socrates stood was not a theory of pleasure and knowledge and virtue , not a rationalizing hedonism , but the simple affirmation of ignorance of everything save of this one truth-that justice is preferable to injustice , that it is better , if needs be , to suffer injustice than to do injustice , and that somehow - he had never met a man who could argue against this intuition without in the end making himself ridiculous . This correction of Socrates 's logic by a reexamination of his hypotheses in the light of his own intuition , adumbrated in the " Gorgias , " is , in the " Republic , " wrought out in all the splendor of reason and imagination . The psychological dualism upon which rests the distinction between pleasure and happiness is elaborated and illustrated ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in such a way as to leave little room for further development , and justice , now defined as a condition of the soul known to the man himself by his happiness , is rescued from the ambiguities of a calculating hedonism . If this analysis of the three greatest of the early dialogues is correct , the whole theory of Professor Burnet , based on the doctrine of ideas , falls to the ground . It may seem that much space has been taken to refute a book which the reviewer confesses to have found in many respects admirable . . EA a matter of fact , Professor Burnet 's pages are scattered with keen apeigns , and his scholarship is everywhere in evidence , but the main thesis of his work is at least of a sort that challenges disagreement . A CRITIC ON HIS ART . Crzticzsm . By W. C. Brownell . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . 75 cents net . When kr . Brownell sent forth this little volume on the art of which he has been for nearly thirty-five years an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voce the somewhat melancholy words of the " faultless painter " to his Lucrezia . " You do n't understand nor care to understand about my art , but you can hear at least when people speak . " Every one , of course , who knows anything of these matters knows that Mr. Brownell 's " French Traits , " his " French Art , " his " Victorian Prose Masters , " and his " American Prose Masters " are works of rare distinction in the field of American criticism  --  works in which singularly acute and unintermittent thinking is expressed with almost flawless precision . To that select audience which writing of this nature and quality makes for itself , it need only be said that the treatise before us is related to the preceding critical essays as Poe 's " Philosophy of Composition " is related to his verse and his stories , or as Arnold 's " Study of Poetry " is related to the second series of " Essays in Criticism . " As for that amiable Lucrezia , the general American public , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up " to Mr. Brownell 's impeccable art from her otherwise inexplicable failure to exact of him a higher degree of productivity . It should be pointed out that a critic of his standards will hardly enter upon his task before the age of forty . He must outlive so much emotional ferment and acquire so much intellectual culture before he can attain the high rational disinterestedness , poise , and serenity proper to criticism . Though technical expertness is not to be demanded of him , he must be prepared to deal with multifarious " moral data , " to " disengage the qualities which inform the technique , " and to value them . His function presupposes a " large and luminous view of life and the world , " to which an adequate acquaintance with history , aesthetics , and philosophy is essentially contributory . His criterion is not the epicurean delight of the impressionist nor the rigid formularies of the academic dogmatist , but principles tested and approved by taste , time , and reason or sense , which last is to be incessantly engaged in checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is by a close persistent analysis to establish a preconception of personality redefined in an ultimate synthesis . And the highest service of criticism " is to secure that the true and the beautiful , and not the ugly and false , may in wider and wider circles of appreciation be esteemed to be the good . " To move the widest circles , Mr Brownell is a little too impersonal , a little too free from prejudice , a little too civil , urbane , and catholic , - and a little too remorselessly intellectual . His style , furthermore , is somewhat too elaborately considered . Though it is invariably clear and bright , it is slightly deficient in charm ; it is brilliant but devoid of glamour . One is tempted to quote to him his own comment upon Rodin : " In fine , the most one can say , I think , about the inadequacy of Rodin 's technical ' finish ' is that his devotion to expression . . . perhaps blinds him to an occasional opportunity of decorating sufficiency of expression , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeableness which adds nothing  --  save pure delight ' ? to its force or significance " To which Mr. Brownell might reply that in rejecting impressionism he has deliberately eschewed the " irresponsible exercise of the nervous system . " As he elsewhere puts it in his admirable essay on Arnold , whom he regards , despite a deficient interest in paint-mg and the plastic arts , as the first of critics : " What criticism lacks , and what will always be a limitation to its interest and its power , is the element of beauty , which it of necessity largely foregoes in its concentration upon truth " Mr. Brownell 's criticism pursues truth with fine concentration upon its object  --  and with very notable technique . One wishes for this discourse a wider influence than it is likely , one apprehends , to exert ; for it is full of valuable distinctions , wise counsel , and technical hints of which American criticism generally stands in crying need . One wishes particularly that this book may put readers and writers upon a reexamination of Mr Brownell 's other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
