txt While the general death rate in the United States is going down , the accident death rate is mounting steadily . The Statistics Committee , headed by Mr. LOUIS I. DUBLIN , under the National Safety Council , has just published its report of accidents in 1927 . That year promises to show the lowest general death rate recorded for the country , but no improvement is shown for accidents . If this year 's increase is as great as that of 1927 over 1926 , 100,000 lives will be lost in accidents . The committee , in setting forth these depressing facts , also gives hope of bettering the situation through intelligent analysis of causes . Accidents have been grouped in four types  --  motor , other public accidents , home and industrial . Concerning all except home accidents a great mass of information has been collected and tabulated . Many large and small cities are cooperating with the committee to cut down specific hazards in certain locations and situations known to them . Since the establishment of the Safety Council in 1913 the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced nearly one-half . But in the same period the total of accidental deaths has gone up 20 per cent . This is due to an increase of 1,050 per cent . in automobile deaths . The increase of 1927 over the preceding year is about 10 per cent . The gravity of the problem has led to careful analysis . It is particularly tragic that more than a fourth of the number killed in automobile accidents are children under 15 years of age . By far the greatest proportion were playing in the streets . This at once suggests the remedy that should be applied , though how it can be done in congested districts is not always easily discoverable . Of the nearly 200,000 drivers of cars reported in accidents only 6 per cent . were women . It is also interesting to note that their death rate in such accidents follows the general accident rate in comparison with that of men , being about a third of that for males . People often blame motor accidents on an unfavorable road or weather and light conditions . Statistics show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear weather with the benefit of either daylight or good artificial lighting . One might suppose that when the motorist is far from home on a holiday trip he would be inclined to cut loose from the restrictions of his local constable . However , most drivers have their accidents in their home towns . Much less knowledge is available concerning falls , burns , scalds , cuts and scratches sustained at home . They may cause as much pain as being knocked down by a truck , and they frequently result in time lost from work and in hospital bills . But unless they result fatally the facts are usually not recorded . Claims paid by insurance companies for home injuries indicate that there must have been several millions of them which were never heard of beyond the premises . Some cities which work hard at their accident problems report a remarkably large proportion occurring at home . During the last five years , Providence , R. I. , reports home accidents causing half of all accidental deaths in the city . This presumably does not indicate that homes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer .
