SCENE : The interior of a typical mountain cabin . Noonday , June 5 , 1917 . Fireplace , with mantelpiece , at right . A door in the flat opens to out of doors . A door to left leads to the back room . In the corner between the outside door and the fireplace is a ladder reaching to an opening in the loft . Right of the outside door is a small window . It has window panes , and also an inside wooden shutter which pushes shut and open . The furniture consists of a bed in the corner between the two doors , a rough table , covered with oil cloth , in the center of the room , a bench beside the table , three small straight-back chairs , and an old cupboard . Cooking utensils are near the fireplace . A gun hangs over the door MRS . CAGLE is seated before the fireplace smoking a corn-cob pipe . Her thoughts seem far away . The door opens , and PAP TODD enters TODD Thought I 'd come and set with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does not look up to greet her visitor ) Pull ye up a chair . TODD ( Pulling a chair toward fireplace ) How air yer to-day ? WIDOW CAGLE Jest tolerable . ( As TODD seats himself and takes out pipe ) Bring yo ' own terbacker ? p. 3 TODD Yer , I brung my own . ( TODD fills his pipe and they sit for a moment without conversation ) Shore is a fine day . WIDOW CAGLE Shore is . TODD ( As he lights his pipe . Takes straw from a broom near fireplace and gets light from fire ) ' Pears like thar is goin ' to be war . WIDOW CAGLE ( Without concern ) Who 's a feudin ' now ? TODD Hai n't that kind er feudin ' . ' Pears like hit 's the country . WIDOW CAGLE Yankees agin ? TODD Reckon so . WIDOW CAGLE Ye must be mistaken . Ai n't no reason for war . Did n't the Yankees free the niggers more than fifty years ago ? TODD Maybe they want ter make ' em slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thar 's somethin ' up . Bud heared all about it when he wuz over to town . WIDOW CAGLE Bud never could tell nothin ' the way he heared it . ' Tai n't so . Thar ai n't no reason fer war , unless us poor folks fight the rich uns for the way they air bleedin ' us to death with the prices for meat and bread . I tell ye , Pap Todd , we uns ought to rise up and fight the rich leeches , but we wo n't . Poor folks ai n't got guts ' nough . That 's whut makes ' em poor . p. 4 TODD Yer got no right ter complain , Mis ' Cagle . I reckon Rufe makes a good livin ' fer yer . He made a good erap last year , and Bud heared over in town that yer had been offered eight hundred dollars fer yer place . WIDOW CAGLE Bud heared right once . The sheriff wuz over to see me t' other day . ' Pears like a city man has bought the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will spile his view . But I ai n't a sellin ' out to ' blege no rich man . TODD Eight hundred dollars is a lot o ' money . WIDOW CAGLE Yes  --  till hit 's spent . TODD Well , as I said , Rufe makes a good crap . WIDOW CAGLE Yes , Rufe makes a good crap , but if he 'd raise more corn , and fear the law less , he 'd be more of a man like his pap . TODD Moonshining ? WIDOW CAGLE Yes , blockadin ' . Why not ? TODD Reckon Rufe is too young to hanker a'ter a jail term . A'ter spendin ' about twenty year o ' my life thar I ai n't a blamin ' him much . WIDOW CAGLE Rufe 's pap wuz a Cagle . I wuz an Owens . Thar 's many a Cagle , and an Owens too that laid down out thar on the hills and died , but thar ai n't one of ' em yit that 's ever gone to jail . p. 5 TODD Yer ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be yer , Mis ' Cagle ? WIDOW CAGLE No , ye wuz always kind o ' puny . ( TODD turns away ) And if ye ai n't got nerve ' nough to stand behind a gun and shoot , I ai n't got nothin ' in my heart but pity for ye . TODD Well , the last time I wuz caught I did n't have no gun . WIDOW CAGLE That 's worse than goin ' ter jail . TODD Ai n't powerful fond er me , be yer , Mis ' Cagle ? In case Rufe wants ter marry my Emmy , yer would n't let that keep ' em apart , would yer , Mis ' Cagle ? WIDOW CAGLE When Rufe gits old ' nough he kin marry who he wants . Emmy 's maw wuz good stock . TODD Well , maybe she wuz . WIDOW CAGLE I thought Emmy wuz a settin ' her cap for Sheriff Weeks . TODD Kinder thought so myself . I sorter aigged it no  --  not that I got anythin ' agin Rufe  --  WIDOW CAGLE Kinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reckon . TODD Well , yes , and he 's older than Rufe . But seems to me lately she 's a hankerin ' a'ter Rufe , and I ai n't agin him . p. 6 WIDOW CAGLE Do n't reckon they 'd ask ye any odds if they want ter git married . TODD Reckon not . WIDOW CAGLE Be mighty funny young folks if they did . EMMY ( Entering door without knocking . She carries a pan covered with a tin plate . BUD enters with her . BUD has a knife and stick and whittles ) Howdy , Mis ' Cagle . WIDOW CAGLE Howdy , Emmy . Pull ye up a chair . EMMY ( Placing pan on table . BUD sits down on bed and gazes into space ) Mis ' Cagle , we had a mess o ' fresh meat for dinner . I brung ye and Rufe a bite . WIDOW CAGLE Hit will taste mighty good , I reckon , Emmy . Rufe 's a plum fool about fresh meat . EMMY Yes'um , I know he is . Pap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got . ' Tai n't more than half covered the corn patch . Think ye better send him to town a'ter more ? WIDOW CAGLE Maybe Rufe has got some extra seed . TODD Yer , maybe he has . EMMY Will he be home soon , Mis ' Cagle ? WIDOW CAGLE Any minute , I reckon . He wuz powerful sot on goin ' ter town this mornin ' . He 's done wasted half a day now . He oughter be here . ( There is a knock on the door . All eyes are turned toward door ) Bud , will ye see who that is that cai n't open the door for hisself ? ( BUD opens the door . SHERIFF WEEKS enters ) p. 7 SHERIFF WEEKS Good day , Widow Cagle . How you , Mr. Todd ? Good mornin ' , Miss Emmy . How you all ? WIDOW CAGLE Howdy , Sheriff . Pull ye up a chair . SHERIFF WEEKS No 'm , ai n't got time . Rufe ai n't round ?

SHERIFF WEEKS Would you mind stepping out here and showing me just whar your boundary line runs ? Hate to trouble you . WIDOW CAGLE ( Rising and putting on fly bonnet which is hanging on back of her chair ) ' Tai n't no trouble , but what ye worrin ' ' boutmy boundary line fer ?

CAGLE Looked to me like the Sheriff wuz a takin ' the whole outfit to jail . EMMY Oh , Rufe ! Shame on ye . CAGLE ( Laughing at his own joke ) I 'm glad he left ye here . EMMY Why ? CAGLE Save me a trip over to yo ' house . EMMY Is comin ' ter my house all that trouble ? CAGLE No trouble , but ' pears like Pap Todd and Bud air always a stickin ' a round . p. 9 EMMY Uh huh .

CAGLE ( Holding out his arms to her ) Come here , and whisper yo ' answer quick . EMMY is shy , and RUFE comes forward and takes her hand . ) Will you marry me right away , Emmy ? EMMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAGLE Because , Emmy , I 've got to go away soon . I ai n't takin ' no chances leavin ' ye behind , unless ye belong to me  --  unless ye air mine .

SHERIFF WEEKS ( Off stage ) Much obliged ter yer , Mis ' Cagle . WIDOW CAGLE ( Off stage ) Yer ai n't needin ' ter be . ( MRS . CAGLE enters , followed by the SHERIFF . EMMY moves up stage ) SHERIFF WEEKS Howdy , Rufe . CAGLE Howdy , Sheriff . SHERIFF WEEKS You going along pretty soon , Miss Emmy ? EMMY Yes , I 'm agoin ' soon . SHERIFF WEEKS Then I 'll walk a piece with you . CAGLE ( Coming up to EMMY . As he follows EMMY to far end of room ) Reckon I 'll go long , too , if ye do n't mind . SHERIFF WEEKS I ai n't exactly pinin ' fer yer company  --  ( TODD and BUD enter . Without comment they sit in their respective places . MRS . CAGLE relights her pipe . EMMY and RUFE sit on the bed by the window . A glance passes between EMMY and the SHERIFF ; another glance between EMMY and RUFE . RUFE grins ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to sell yo ' place even at a better price than I offered you last week . p. 12 WIDOW CAGLE No , I ai n't goin ' ter sell . SHERIFF WEEKS Eight hundred dollars is a pretty good price , considering it 's war times . In ' nother year it wo n't be worth that much . WIDOW CAGLE Whut ye mean by war times ? SHERIFF WEEKS You do n't mean to tell me that you do n't know ' bout the war ? WIDOW CAGLE No , I ai n't heared nothin ' ' cept whut Bud said . SHERIFF WEEKS ( Pulling a chair up and sitting down ) Lord , yes . The whole country is at war with the Huns . WIDOW CAGLE Huns ? Who is Huns ? TODD I fought in sixty-three . WIDOW CAGLE Never heared of ' em . TODD And I got shot in the leg . SHERIFF WEEKS Well , Huns , that 's jest a nick-name they call ' em . Yes , they done passed a law that every man between twenty-one and thirty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WIDOW CAGLE Register ? Whut ye mean ? SHERIFF WEEKS Why , sign his name , and tell the Government whar he lives . TODD They did n't do that in sixty-three. p. 13 WIDOW CAGLE Whut fer ? SHERIFF WEEKS So they can know whar to find ' em when they get ready for them to fight . They 've got to do it to-day , too . ( Turning toward RUFE ) Rufe , you and Bud will both have to register . ( RUFE rises ) WIDOW CAGLE ( As RUFE leaves EMMY 'S side and comes forward ) No , they wo n't . That 's all tommyrot . SHERIFF WEEKS Yes , they will . It 's the law , and if they do n't register the Government will deal with them . Shoot ' em down , I reckon , like deserters . BUD ( Frightened ) Shoot me ? Whut I got to do to keep from gittin ' shot ? WIDOW CAGLE Nothin ' , Bud , nothin ' . SHERIFF WEEKS Yes , Bud , you got to go to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give ' em your name , your age , and tell ' em whar you live . ( BUD looks from one face to the other ) WIDOW CAGLE No , ye do n't , Bud . Ye stay right here , and plant yo ' corn . Whut 's the law got to do with you and Rufe ? CAGLE But , Mom  --  WIDOW CAGLE Ye got a gun , ai n't ye ? That 's as much as the law 's got . p. 14 SHERIFF WEEKS But Mis ' Cagle , the country is at war . You ferget they owe the Government something . WIDOW CAGLE ( Springing up ) Whut does Rufe or Bud owe the Guv'ment ? The Guv'ment kept Bud 's daddy in jail for twenty years ' cause he tried to make an honest livin ' outen the corn he planted and raised . Whut did the Guv'ment do to Rufe 's pap ? Shot him dead . Shot him in the back while he wuz a protectin ' his own property . Fight ? Well , I reckon if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own fight , and agin not fer the Guv'ment . CAGLE ( Coming forward , a few steps to upper end of table ) Mom , ye air right as far as ye go . Whut ye say is true , but Pap Todd , and my pap too , wuz a doin ' whut the Government told them not to do . They wuz a breakin ' the law . WIDOW CAGLE Whut right has the Guv'ment to tell us mountain folks whut to do or whut not to do . Air we beholdin ' to them ? Air they doin ' anything fer us but runnin ' up the prices of bread and meat till hit 's all we kin do to keep body and soul together ! CAGLE Well , Mom , that ai n't the Government 's fault . TODD They treated me purty well while I wuz in jail . WIDOW CAGLE Who kin ye lay the fault to , then ? p. 15 CAGLE It 's because we do n't know much . We need larnin ' . We air ignorant . SHERIFF WEEKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WIDOW CAGLE ' Pears like the little ye both got ai n't doin ' ye much good , ' cept to make plum fools outen both of ye . ( Sits down ) CAGLE ( Laughing good-naturedly ) Neither one of us is got ' nough to run us crazy , Mom . TODD Emmy 's eddicated purty well . Cai n't tell much ' bout Bud . ( BUD looks up ) He wo n't talk . He kin write some . ( BUD goes on whittling ) WIDOW CAGLE Well , if larnin ' air whut we need , air the Guv'ment givin ' us schools ? SHERIFF WEEKS Yes'um , now and then , and I reckon we would have more schools if our folks would patronize them . Last school we had in the village , the teacher said she had to quit because the children would n't come . I guess them that did come did n't larn nothin ' . WIDOW CAGLE Well , I reckon it wuz because the most of ' em wuz a hungry . Ye kin fill a young un @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goin ' to run out if thar 's a hole in his stomach . SHERIFF WEEKS You cai n't say it 's up to the Government to feed ' em all , can you , Mis ' Cagle ? p. 16 WIDOW CAGLE No , but it kin let ' em alone when they try to make money the only way they know how  --  blockadin ' . SHERIFF WEEKS That 's why I say they need larnin ' . Larn ' how to do somethin ' else . WIDOW CAGLE I ai n't never bin again larnin . ' I did n't have none , and Rufe 's pap could n't read , but I allus wanted Rufe to larn as much as he could . CAGLE Yes , ye did , Mom . Ye done all ye could . I kin recollect once when school wuz a goin ' on five miles down the road , I wuz too little to walk it . ( Turns to the others ) In the mornings Mom used to tote me most of the way . Then when I started home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corn field , meet me , and tote me the rest of the way home . WIDOW CAGLE But I would n't a had ye larn nothin ' if I 'd a knowed it wuz a goin ' to turn ye into a law lover , and make yer fergit the laws of yo ' own folks . CAGLE I ai n't fergot , Mom . I never will , but that little bit o ' larnin ' taught me to respect somethin ' a little higher than my own way of wantin ' ter to do things . I 'm agoin ' ter larn more , some day . WIDOW CAGLE I want ye to larn books , then , not foolishness . CAGLE Well , Mom , ai n't whut I knowed made me the best farmer on the mountains ? Do n't I make ye a good livin ' ? p. 17 WIDOW CAGLE I ai n't a complainin ' . I do n't keer how much larnin ' ye git if ye do n't turn skeered puppy , and lick the boots of them law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mis ' Cagle . CAGLE I ai n't , Mom , but ye would want me to do whut I thought wuz right , even if it wuz to go to war , would n't ye ? WIDOW CAGLE In this Guv'ment feud ?  --  No  --  If ye want to fight , son , git Zeb Turner , the man who killed yo ' pap . ( A commotion is heard outside . BUD jumps up excitedly , and looks out of the door ) BUD Rufe , Rufe , the cow 's out with the calf  --  the cow 's out with the calf . Hit 's suckin ' all the milk  --  ( The SHERIFF rises ) CAGLE ( Rushing to the door , and out ) Who left them bars down ? WIDOW CAGLE Pap Todd , you wuz the last one that come through them bars  --  ( Goes out as she puts on her fly bonnet ) TODD ( Rising ) Never teched them bars . I jumped the fence . ( Follows to the door and goes out . BUD follows him ) BUD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHERIFF WEEKS Now ai n't I lucky ? EMMY ( Coming down a step near fire-place ) How come ? SHERIFF WEEKS Got a chance to talk to you . EMMY Whut ye got to talk about ? SHERIFF WEEKS Our gittin ' married . EMMY ( Turning away ) I think there 's somebody else wants me to do the same thing to him . SHERIFF WEEKS Who ? EMMY If ye do n't know , I ai n't a sayin ' . SHERIFF WEEKS ( Putting his hands in his pockets ) Well , that ai n't hard fer me to guess , but I calculate , Miss Emmy , that you air a woman of sense , and want to do the best thing fer yourself in this here gittin ' married . Do n't you ? EMMY ( Turning away ) I ai n't a sayin ' . SHERIFF WEEKS ( Taking a step towards her ) Well , the difference between me and Rufe  --  Rufe 's a good ( gestures with right hand ) boy  --  but the difference is this . Rufe ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little farm , and an office besides . Rufe ai n't never made nothin ' of hisself , and I 'm kinder looked up to , and respected . p. 19 EMMY Yes  --  SHERIFF WEEKS I calculate I could be worse lookin ' , could n't I ? ( Pause . EMMY looks him over ) EMMY Yes , a little . SHERIFF WEEKS I 've told you that I love yer , and I figure there 's a little love in your heart for somebody , ai n't there ? EMMY I reckon so . SHERIFF WEEKS Well , is it fer me ? EMMY I ai n't sayin ' jest yit . SHERIFF WEEKS Well , seein ' us together , I 'm willing to take my chances with Rufe . I 'll let you choose between me and him . But I 'll say this much in my favor . As conditions air , Rufe has got to go to war . I ai n't . You stand more chances of being Widow Cagle than you do of bein ' Widow Weeks . EMMY ( Rising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? To war ? SHERIFF WEEKS Yes , he will have to go and fight . EMMY How come you do n't have to go ? SHERIFF WEEKS Well , I 'm an officer of the law , and besides , I 'm a little over the ago limit . EMMY Ye too old to go ? p. 20 SHERIFF WEEKS No , not too old . I could go , but it ai n't compulsory . EMMY Rufe do n't have to go neither . SHERIFF WEEKS Yes , he will have to go . EMMY When ? SHERIFF WEEKS Pretty soon . Now you think it over , Miss Emmy , and you 'll say it 's better all the way ' round to be Mis ' Weeks , wife of Sheriff Weeks  --  EMMY Hit would be wife of Deputy-Sheriff Weeks , would n't it ? SHERIFF WEEKS Yes , but everybody calls me Sheriff , and in time  --  ( RUFE and MRS . CAGLE enter , quickly followed by PAP TODD and BUD . TODD is excited ) TODD I tell yer , I jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When ? Twenty years ago ? ( Takes tobacco from her pocket and begins to fill her pipe ) TODD I did n't leave no bars down . All the time yarmin ' about me . WIDOW CAGLE Set down . Pap . EMMY ( Coming forward to meet RUFE ) Rufe , I cai n't come to the pasture gate to-night . p. 21 CAGLE ( His countenance falling ) How come ye cai n't , Emmy ? ( SHERIFF grins , and evidences great expectancy ) EMMY I want to give ye my answer now , Rufe . SHERIFF WEEKS That 's right , Emmy . EMMY ( Coming close to RUFE ) Air ye willin ' , Rufe ? CAGLE As ye say , Emmy . EMMY Then , Rufe , I 'll marry ye . CAGLE ( Clasping her in his arms ) I knowed ye would , Emmy . SHERIFF WEEKS Why , Miss Emmy ! ( Sits down meekly ) TODD Air ye proposin ' to Rufe , Emmy ? WIDOW CAGLE ( TO TODD ) Set down , Pap Todd . ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAGLE is sweeping the floor with a brush broom . RUFE enters and puts the hoe inside the door . CAGLE ( Wiping the perspiration from his brow ) Well , Mom , the corn 's all hoed . It wo n't need no more workin ' . WIDOW CAGLE ( Looking up ) All right , Rufe . How ' bout the tater patch ? Put that hoe outside , son  --  CAGLE ( Putting the hoe outside the door and going to the basin to wash his hands ) That 's done , too . ( He washes his hands in the basin ) ' Tai n't nothin ' more to be done ' cept gatherin ' the crap . Ye do n't have to worry ' bout that . I 've done fixed it up with Bud . He 's goin ' ter do it all . WIDOW CAGLE ( Sweeping hearth ) How much did ye agree to pay him ? CAGLE I done paid him . WIDOW CAGLE ( Stops sweeping ) How ? CAGLE ( Going over and drying his hands on her apron ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolin ' . p. 23 WIDOW CAGLE I did n't want ye to spend that , son . CAGLE Well , I heared the Government wuz a goin ' ter pay us wages . WIDOW CAGLE ' Tai n't so . CAGLE Maybe it is , Mom . If it is , I kin save that all the time I 'm gone , ' cose they say we wo n't need no money in France . WIDOW CAGLE Whar is France ? CAGLE I do n't know . I heared it wuz ' bout forty miles ' t ' other side o ' Asheville . WIDOW CAGLE Goin ' a mighty long ways to fight , seems ter me . CAGLE Maybe it ai n't so far . Think it wuz old man Todd that told me . WIDOW CAGLE I reckon he thinks he 's been thar . CAGLE ( Sitting down ) I reckon . WIDOW CAGLE ( Laying the broom down , she gets a pan of green beans from the cupboard , then sits on her chair and begins to string beans ) Shore is a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope it will stay dry , though , till I git to France . I allus hate to tramp in the mud . ' Speet them roads over thar air pretty bad . WIDOW CAGLE Yes , I reckon . p. 24 CAGLE Mom , I 've already fed the cow and the hogs . Sorter early , but I did n't want ter leave it for ye . Bud said he 'd milk fer ye to-night . WIDOW CAGLE I ai n't afeered o ' work . CAGLE I know ye ai n't , but it 's my place to do it . I 've done it ever since Pap was kilt . WIDOW CAGLE Yo ' pap wuz a fine man , Rufe . CAGLE I know he wuz . That makes me think o ' somethin ' I wanted to say to ye , Mom . Sometimes I 've felt that you thought I wuz n't like my pap  --  that I wuz one of them skeered kind ' cose I would n't make whisky . WIDOW CAGLE No , I never thought ye wuz askeered , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make money the easy way . Heap easier ter make moonshine than hit is to make a crap . CAGLE Well , Mom , it 's like this . I ai n't afeered o ' nothin ' . Ye ought ter know that , but I do n't believe in whisky . It 's bad stuff . I do n't drink it myself , and I do n't want to sell it to nobody . Look at old man Todd . He made it , and he drunk it too . Bud told me jest t' other day that he knowed he would have more sense if the old man had n't drunkard . Jest look whut corn juice has made outen that ole man . WIDOW CAGLE Well , if whisky had n't done it , killin ' , or somethin ' else would have . He wuz jest naturally born without any backbone . p. 25 CAGLE No , I reckon he ai n't got much .

CAGLE I 've done ask Emmy to live here with ye , Mom , so 's ye wo n't be all by yo'self . WIDOW CAGLE Well , the gal will be company , and she 's welcome , but I calculate we 'll have the old man and Bud most of the time . CAGLE No , I done told Bud to eat at home , and let his pap do the cookin ' . I told him plain I wuz a payin ' him fer his work without eats . Bud ai n't no fool , if he is a little queer . WIDOW CAGLE No , he ai n't no fool . ( Pause ) CAGLE Seems kind o ' strange to think o ' me gittin ' married . WIDOW CAGLE Ye do seem kinder young , Rufe . Do n't seem more than yisterday that ye wuz a playin ' ' round with mud pies . Times and children do change . CAGLE Well , Mom , I want ye to know that if I married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in my mind . WIDOW CAGLE Hit 's only natural . I reckon if ye air old enough to fight , ye air old enough to git married . ' Pears to me like a man jest gittin ' married ought ter stay at home with his wife . p. 26 CAGLE Mom , I hate to go off and leave ye feelin ' like that ' bout my goin ' . I wish ye could see it like I do . If ye cai n't now , maybe ye will some day . WIDOW CAGLE Yo ' pap wuz a brave man . CAGLE Mom , it 's because I 'm Pap 's son that I want to go . He died fer whut he thought wuz right . Why , Mom , way back fifty years ago even ole Pap Todd had a chance to fight the Yankees . Now , Mom , it 's fer ye , and the ole wimen like ye , that I want to go . They say they air goin ' to make us slaves this time . We air almost slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worse , Mom .

WIDOW CAGLE Then it ' tai n't fer me to say no more . CAGLE I 'll come back as soon as I kin . WIDOW CAGLE It jest seems a little queer to me that ye air goin ' off to fight the Yankees with Zeb Turner , the man who killed yo ' pap , still alive .

And I found him , Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lifted his arms and cried " O God , " and , Mom , it jest war n't in me to kill a man with the name of his maker on his lips . p. 27 WIDOW CAGLE The feud would a said  --  go with him till he got a gun . CAGLE Maybe I ought  --  but when I wuz little , down to the mission school they larned me somethin ' different outen the Bible  --  WIDOW CAGLE ( After a thoughtful pause ) Larnin ' air a strange thing , son . But if yo ' pap wuz alive , ye would n't be goin ' off to war . CAGLE Maybe not , Mom  --  maybe not . WIDOW CAGLE Got all yo ' things together ? CAGLE Yes , and my ole rifle is all cleaned up .

In the midst of the laughter there comes from the distance strains of " The Star Spangled Banner . " Instantly the laughter ceases . All eyes are turned toward the music , and all listen intently . SlowlY MRS . CAGLE rise to her feet ; awkwardly RUFE rise . This is done without any knowledge , or intent , of patriotism . The music strikes to their stoic souls , and they known not why .

CAGLE calmly smokes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch RUFE as he goes down the path . The shadows deepen . She appears to strain her eyes as if to catch a last look at him . Then she goes slowly back to the doorway . The hoe RUFE left leaning against the house attracts her attention . She lifts the hoe up tenderly , as if it were a living thing , and moves her hand over the handle as if to caress it . The darkness comes . The pipe drops from her mouth ) @x SCENE : The interior of WIDOW CAGLE 'S cabin , at night . A fire burns on the hearth . A lighted lantern is on table . RUFE 'S hoe leans against the wall near the door . Outside a blizzard is raging . Now and then with the increasing violence of the storm , the door of the cabin shakes . There is a weird howling , or whistling of the wind WIDOW CAGLE sits by the fire smoking . Now and then she looks up , and listens to the storm . A yellow envelope is in her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enrelope near the lantern she looks it over with great interest . She then goes to window and opening the wooden shutter peers out into the darkness . She hangs the lantern on a nail by the pane of glass and leaves the wooden shutter open . Still holding the envelope she returns to her chair by the fireplace , and goes on with her smoking . A man 's voice is heard above the raging of the storm . VOICE Hallo  --  Hallo  --  ( MRS . CAGLE rises and listens . She goes to the window and looks out ) Hallo  --  Hallo  --  Hallo there ! WIDOW CAGLE ( Unbarring door . Calling ) That ye , Bud ? VOICE Let me in . Please let me in . I 'm almost frozen . p. 43 WIDOW CAGLE ( Opening the door wide ) Who be ye ? Whut ye want ? VOICE Let me in , for God 's sake . ( A man stumbles in the door . He is bareheaded , and without an overcoat . His coat and trousers are much too large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted ) Please let me warm , and give me food . ( Hurries to fire and shakes the snow from his clothes ) WIDOW CAGLE ( As she closes the door ) Did Emmy send ye ? Did ye come from Pap Todd 's ? STRANGER No , I eame from  --  I lost my way in the snow . WIDOW CAGLE Well , set down , stranger , and warm yo'self . I got Emmy 's supper a warmin ' by the fire . Ye kin have part of that .

WIDOW CAGLE Did n't ye have no hat or overcoat ? STRANGER I lost them in the storm . It is terrible out . p. 44 WIDOW CAGLE The worst in many a year . ( She places the food that is warming by the fire on the table and takes the lantern from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ) STRANGER Does that wooden shutter close ? WIDOW CAGLE Yes , hit s uts . STRANGER Would you mind if I close it ? It would make the room seem warmer . WIDOW CAGLE ( Going to window and closing the shutter ) No , I ai n't got no reason for keepin ' it open . Jest thought Emmy might like to see the light when she started home , but I reckon Bud will come with her part o ' the way , anyhow . STRANGER Who is Bud  --  who is Emmy ? WIDOW CAGLE ( Looking closely at him as she answers the question that seems to her impertinent ) Emmy 's my daughterin-law , and Bud 's her brother . Bud 's a little queer in the head  --  STRANGER I see . How far is this place from Asheville ? WIDOW CAGLE I do n't know . I 've heared tell of Asheville , but I ai n't never bin thar .

STRANGER No , not tonight . The roads are almost beyond travelling . WIDOW CAGLE Ye kin move yo ' chair up , and eat now . STRANGER Thank you . ( Moves his chair up to table and eats ravenously ) Could you keep me for the night ? I have a little money . I can pay you . WIDOW CAGLE No , I do n't keep no boarders , but I reckon ye air welcome to sech as I got . ( Looking at him very carefully ) I reckon that ye air honest ? STRANGER Well , yes . I try to be .

STRANGER ( Reaching out to take it ) I 'll try . WIDOW CAGLE ( Opening the envelope ) I kin open it . STRANGER ( Looking at the single page of contents . Falters as he hands it back to her and answers ) No , I 'm sorry  --  I ca n't read that . WIDOW CAGLE ( Sitting on bench . She shows disappointment as she encloses the page in the envlope ) Well , no matter . Emmy , his wife , will be here soon . Her pap is sick and she 's gone to see him . STRANGER How long has your son been gone ? WIDOW CAGLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . I 'm glad ye come . p. 47 STRANGER Thank you . Was your son drafted ? WIDOW CAGLE He registered  --  that whut ye mean ? STRANGER Well , yes , and then afterwards they called him  --  made him go . WIDOW CAGLE No , he went of his own free will . STRANGER ( With something like bitterness ) I suppose you 're very proud of him ? WIDOW CAGLE He 's a good boy Rufe is . STRANGER Yes , of course , but I suppose you 're very proud of him because he joined the army of his own free will . WIDOW CAGLE No , I think he 'd a showed more sense if he had a stayed home and gathered his crap . STRANGER Then you are opposed to his going ? ( MRS . CAGLE looks at him inquiringly ) I mean you were n't willing for him to go ? WIDOW CAGLE Well , he wuz sot on goin ' . Seemed to think he oughter . I did n't say nothin ' to keep him from doin ' whut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guv'ment done to his pap , Rufe figured he outer help ' em out agin ' the Yankees .

WIDOW CAGLE Air ye figurin ' on goin ' ? STRANGER There 's no way out of it . WIDOW CAGLE If ye air a man thar is . If ye stay at home they cai n't do no more than shoot ye . That 's whut they 'll do to ye out thar . I 'd ruther die at home than somew'eres out thar in the mud . STRANGER You must n't talk that way . If you were heard saying that , they might  --  shoot you . WIDOW CAGLE Let ' em shoot . The law killed my man . Hit 's got my boy out thar somew'eres . Shootin ' me would n't matter .

I 'm on my way to see her now  --  if nothing happens  --  ( There is a lull in the storm , and voices are heard outside . The STRANGER looks up frightened ) SHERIFF WEEKS ( Calling outside ) Hallo , Widow Cagle . You gone to bed ? ( The STRANGER springs up with terror in his face ) p. 49 WIDOW CAGLE That sounds like the Sheriff 's voice . STRANGER ( In a frightened whisper ) Do n't let them in . They 're after me . I 've got to get  --  home . WIDOW CAGLE ( Rising and looking at him closely ) Whut ye done ? STRANGER Nothing that 's really wrong . I swear it . ( There is a knocking at the door ) WIDOW CAGLE Ye air goin ' home to see yo ' maw ? STRANGER Yes . WIDOW CAGLE Then they cai n't get ye . Go in the back room . Git in bed and cover up yo ' head . STRANGER They 'll find me in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( STRANGER hurries into the back room . Heavy knocking is heard . MRS . CAGLE takes the gun from the corner and goes to the door ) Who be ye ? That ye , Bud ? SHERIFF WEEKS It 's me , Widow Cagle , Sheriff Weeks . WIDOW CAGLE ( Opening the door ) Whut ye want , Sheriff ? Lost in the storm ? ( SHERIFF and a man enter ) SHERIFF WEEKS Hate to trouble you , Mis ' Cagle , but me and this here man air looking for a deserter from one of the Army camps . p. 50 WIDOW CAGLE I reckon ye kinder froze up , and want to git warm . Well , if it wuz n't sech a cold night I 'd make ye go on . Pull ye up chairs , and thaw out . SHERIFF WEEKS ( Looking around as he goes to the fire .

Go ahead . Maybe the next time ye come snoopin ' ' round ye 'll take my word . SHERIFF WEEKS ( to his assistant ) Bob , you go up in the loft by yourself . I want to git my feet warm ' fore we start out . ( Goes to the fire . BOB goes up the ladder to the loft ) Mighty sorry , Mis ' Cagle . It ai n't that I dispute your word .

Looking up ) Heared from Rufe lately ? WIDOW CAGLE Today . SHERIFF WEEKS How 's he gittin ' along ? WIDOW CAGLE Pretty well . ( The SHERIFF turns his attention again to the fire .

WIDOW CAGLE ' Tai n't no place fer him to hide . EMMY Under the bed ? WIDOW CAGLE The Sheriff made sure he war n't under thar . I reckon he must a squirmed through that window hole , but he shore did n't look little ' nough fer that . Wharever he is , God help him . ( Going toward fire . EMMY follows her ) Yo ' pap sobered up yet , Emmy ? EMMY Yes'um , he 's ' bout over it . Swears he wo n't never tech ' nother drap . WIDOW CAGLE No , I reckon he wo n't tech ' nother drop , but he wo n't mind techin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter , Mis ' Cagle . WIDOW CAGLE Yes , and I 'm powerful anxious to hear it , but ye eat yo ' supper first , and then ye kin read Rufe 's letter . ( She sits down and lights her pipe ) EMMY Let 's read the letter first . WIDOW CAGLE No , he 's well , or he would n't a wrote . Yo ' supper is a gittin ' plum dried up and ruined , whut the stranger did n't eat of it . STRANGER ( Appearing in back room door ) I hope I left you enough to eat , EMMY . ( Takes plate and sits on floor before fire at MRS . CAGLE 'S feet . Looks up frightened ) Oh  --  yes  --  plenty . p. 56 WIDOW CAGLE ( Turning towards him . Does not show any surprise ) Thar 's plenty . Emmy ai n't a big eater . Whar wuz ye ? STRANGER Under the potato pile . There was a lull in the storm , and I happened to hear your daughter 's footsteps as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean another search , so I put the bolster in the bed , and was about to crawl under it when I spied the potato pile in the corner . So , I got behind it , and pulled the potatoes over me . WIDOW CAGLE Mighty lucky fer ye . I thought he wuz about to git ye . I wuz already to shoot . STRANGER You would have shot to save me from arrest ? WIDOW CAGLE I promised that I 'd hide ye , did n't I ? Besides , I 'd like to shoot at Jim Weeks . STRANGER But I did n't expect that much protection . I do n't know how to thank you . WIDOW CAGLE Ye air welcome , Stranger , as long as ye air honest , and I reckon ye air if ye ai n't done nothin ' worse than run away from war . Pull ye up a chair , and set down . STRANGER ( Sitting down on the bench beside the table ) Perhaps it was n't an honest thing to do , but there were circumstances  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STRANGER I mean it was a bit unusual . I was drafted and  --  WIDOW CAGLE They forced ye to go to war ? STRANGER Yes , I 'm ashamed to say . WIDOW CAGLE Did n't ye try to protect yo'self ? STRANGER You do n't understand . I 'm ashamed that I did n't go like your son  --  of my own free will . WIDOW CAGLE Wuz yo ' maw agin yo ' goin ? STRANGER She took it very hard . But I suppose it was because I whined around so . If I 'd been more of a man she would n't have felt so badly about it . WIDOW CAGLE Does she know ye air a comin ' home ? STRANGER No , I was home on leave last week . Yesterday I got a letter from my sister saying that Mother had been crying ever since I left . I kept thinking about it , and brooding over it , and last night we got word that we were to start for France in two or three days . And when I thought what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand it . I ran away . I did n't have much money . I could n't ride . I bought these clothes to hide my uniform . I intended to walk home , but the storm was so terrible  --  EMMY Ye got a wife ? STRANGER No . I had a sweetheart , but she threw me over when she learned that  --  I was afraid . p. 58 WIDOW CAGLE Afeered of gittin ' shot , Stranger . STRANGER Yes , I was  --  WIDOW CAGLE Well , thar air many a thing that 's worse . Being afeered is worse . STRANGER Yes , I am beginning to realize that . EMMY Rufe wuz n't afeered . WIDOW CAGLE No , my boy ai n't afeered o ' hell . I did n't want him to go , ' cose I could n't see no use of it . But I war n't sayin ' nothin ' agin him goin ' when he though hit wuz right . EMMY He said it wuz to pertect his hills , and his home , and his wimen folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I calculate his hills do n't need no pertectin ' , and I reckon his wimen folks kin pertect themselves . STRANGER ( Turning to EMMY ) Your husband was right . ( To MRS . CAGLE ) You 're wrong , Mrs. Cagle . That 's your name , is n't it ? WIDOW CAGLE Yes , that 's my name . STRANGER I hope you 'll pardon me for contradicting you , but you and all other women could n't do anything against the enemy your son is fighting . WIDOW CAGLE Men folks is always seein ' some terrible thing ahead . p. 59 STRANGER It 's not the coward speaking now , Mrs. Cagle . It 's the man who knows . WIDOW CAGLE My maw told me when they fought the other war , they wuz allus a skeerin ' ' em , and a tellin ' ' em about the Yankees a comin ' . They did come to some places , but Maw never seed one . She wuz n't afeered then , and I ai n't askeered of no Yankee nohow . STRANGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to . They 'll always be Yankees to me . STRANGER But Mrs. Cagle , it 's not the Yankees this time . That war 's over long ago . In this war the Yank and the Rebel are fighting together . WIDOW CAGLE Ye mean they air fightin ' on the same side , Stranger ? STRANGER Yes , side by side . WIDOW CAGLE Who air they fightin ' , Stranger ? STRANGER The Germans . WIDOW CAGLE I reckon they 've come ' long since my time . I never heared of ' em . Whut 's it over , Stranger ? STRANGER Well , for one thing to protect our country . EMMY That 's whut Rufe said , Mis ' Cagle . He knowed . WIDOW CAGLE Yes , I heared him , but I did n't think the boy knowed so much . I heared him say this country belonged to us ' cose God A'mighty let us be born here . He said this land had brung us up , and nursed us  --  kinder pretty speech for a boy like Rufe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . He is right . WIDOW CAGLE ( Taking the envelope from her bosom and handing it to EMMY ) Read his letter , EMMY . Rufe could allus write sech nice letters . I reckon ye wo n't mind hearing it , Stranger ? STRANGER ( Rising . With some uneasiness ) No . ( Moves back of table ) EMMY ( Rising . Looking at the letter ) Why Mis ' Cagle your name is printed . ( Goes to the lantern and looks at the envelope closely . MRS . CAGLE follows and looks over her shoulder ) WIDOW CAGLE Read the inside , Emmy . EMMY ( Cries out ) ' Tai n't from Rufe , Mom . ' Tai n't from him . WIDOW CAGLE ( Fiercely ) Who 's it from ? EMMY I cai n't read it . I cai n't read it . MRS . CAGLE .

EMMY ( Sobbing as she takes the letter . The STRANGER starts forward as if to take the letter , but stops ) I 'm so afeered  --  p. 61 STRANGER I 'll help you .

She stands erect , and rigid , but does not evidence any great emotion otherwise ) DIED  --  EMMY ( Sobbing as she sinks to a chair ) O , Mom , Mom  --  STRANGER ( Taking the telegram from her hand and reading ) February fifth , in action . ' That means he died  --  fighting . WIDOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means my boy is dead . It means the law 's got my boy same as his pap . p. 62 Act 3 , Scene 2 ACT THREESCENE TWO SCENE : The same as Scene One . A few hours later . Early morning The stage is dark except for the glow that comes from the fireplace . A figure sits near the fire . It stirs the fire . A brighter glow comes forth . A frying pan or two and a coffee pot are shifted as if a breakfast already prepared is being kept warm . Outside the crow of a rooster is heard several times . The figure of MRS . CAGLE arises , and goes to the window . She opens the wooden shutter ; the faint glimmer of approaching dawn slips in WIDOW CAGLE ( Going and shaking a figure that is lying on the bed ) Emmy  --  Emmy . Wake up , Emmy . ( Going to the back room door ) Git up , Stranger . ( Knocking on door ) Air ye awake , Stranger ? STRANGER ( From the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from EMMY 'S bed ) WIDOW CAGLE ( Going to bed and speaking kindly ) Git up , Emmy . Hit 's day-break  --  at last .

EMMY Did ye lay down , Mom ? WIDOW CAGLE No , I jest sot here and kept a thinkin ' . EMMY Ye oughter let me set up with ye , Mom . WIDOW CAGLE No , I wuz a thinkin ' . Seemed to me like Rufe wuz a little boy agin . Seemed to me like hit could n't be so that he 'd growed up , and gone off , and wuz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he must be little agin , and a sleepin ' thar in the bed , and me a settin ' up with him sick . I jest kept awaitin ' fer him to cry out so 's I could take him up in my lap . EMMY O , Mom , maybe thar 's some mistake . WIDOW CAGLE No , thar ai n't no mistake . I kin remember when he used to stump his toe , or hurt hisself , I 'd feel the pain as much as him . And jest like he wuz little agin , somew'eres in here ( clutches her breast ) I kin feel the hurt of a bullet . Jest like when he wuz little , and had hurt hisself. p. 64 EMMY O , Mom , hit 's a killin ' me , but I 'm proud of him . He done whut he thought wuz right . WIDOW CAGLE Yes .

STRANGER You are very kind , but I do n't like to take your son 's things now . If you can lend me just a hat , or a cap  --  WIDOW CAGLE Ye air goin ' to shoot the dogs that killed him , ai n't ye ? STRANGER Yes . WIDOW CAGLE Then ye air welcome to his coat too . STRANGER Thank you . ( MRS . CAGLE goes into the back room ) I can never repay you for all your kindness . EMMY I hope ye come back .

Your husband had so much to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  p. 66 EMMY I 'd a loved him jest the same even if he 'd bin afeered . STRANGER ( Studying her closely ) I reckon you would have . Perhaps  --  after all  --  it 's women like you who keep men from being afraid . WIDOW CAGLE ( From the back room ) Emmy  --  EMMY ( Springing up and going toward door ) Yes'um ? ( The STRANGER rises and watches EMMY with an admiration that is akin to reverence . His lips move as one who dreams of a thing that might be .

Ai n't ye fitten to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men folks whut 's without guns ? SHERIFF WEEKS Now , Mis ' Cagle , all this talk ai n't going to soften my heart to let this here deserter go  --  p. 69 WIDOW CAGLE I ai n't tryin ' to soften yo ' heart . Ye air goin ' to let the stranger go . He ai n't no deserter . He ai n't nothin ' more than a boy . He wuz homesick , and he is a goin ' back to war this mornin ' .

No , Sheriff , Rufe ai n't come home . ( She throws a shawl over her head and goes out the front door . SHERIFF goes toward EMMY and makes an effort to comfort her ) SHERIFF WEEKS Now , Miss Emmy , do n't take hit so hard . I 'd most rather give up my job than to make you cry . Of course , Rufe took the woman I loved , but I ai n't a holdin ' that agin him . I calculated he wuz the best man to do it , but this here is a case of where I have to do my duty . If he will come out and give hisself up , and do n't make no trouble , why fer yo ' sake I 'll do whut I can fer him . Whar is he ? p. 70 EMMY Whar is he ? He is a lyin ' dead out thar on the battlefield whar he wuz a fightin ' . SHERIFF WEEKS ( With great surprise ) Rufe ai n't dead ? EMMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEEKS I 'm sorry . They did n't tell me the name and I did n't look at the warrant . I thought this here deserter wuz him . Mis ' Cagle did n't say nothin ' to me  --  I wisht him better luck than that . EMMY ( Angrily ) I do n't believe ye . Ye come here to take him to jail .

I thought ye wuz brave , but that day Rufe registered I come to know that Rufe wuz the man that wuz n't askeered .

WIDOW CAGLE Sheriff , the law ai n't never took nobody outen my house . SHERIFF WEEKS Then ye admit that this deserter is hid here ? WIDOW CAGLE Yes , he 's hid in the back room . SHERIFF WEEKS ( Starting toward the back room door and then stopping . After a moment 's pause he turns back ) All right , Mis ' Cagle . Outen respect to you in yo ' trouble I 'll jest wait outside fer him . My deputies wuz to be here at sun-up . We 'll surround the house . Thar ai n't no use of him tryin ' to git away . If he 's a man he 'll come out and give his self up . WIDOW CAGLE A man ai n't givin ' hisself up to the law . p. 73 SHERIFF WEEKS ( Becoming irritated ) Now , Mis ' Cagle , I 'm a hatin ' to say these things to you , when you 're in trouble , but last night you harbored a deserter . That 's the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kin throw ye into jail today . I ai n't a wantin ' to do hit , but I 'll have to if you interfere any further with the law .

WIDOW CAGLE I told ye I 'd hide ye , Stranger . STRANGER You did , and I thank you . But to fight like this , Mrs. Cagle , it 's all wrong . p. 75 WIDOW CAGLE ( Looking at him closely ) Ye ai n't afeered air ye ? STRANGER ( Hesitating , and showing something of the fear in himself ) Maybe . I tell you what I 'll do . I 'll watch my chance , and run for it  --  WIDOW CAGLE They 'll git ye in the back . STRANGER ( Peering out the window ) No , I can make it . Miss Emmy , you go out for wood and leave the door open . I 'll take my chance and make for that clump of trees out there .

SHERIFF WEEKS In this case it mought have been better if yer had .

She stares straight at the back room door , and when she speaks it is to herself rather than in answer to EMMY 'S questions ) I fed him  --  EMMY Whut 's happened ? WIDOW CAGLE And I hid him  --  EMMY Tell me whut 's up . Mom . WIDOW CAGLE I wuz about to shoot to save him  --  EMMY Mom , who is he ?

She stands for a few seconds staring at the back room door . BUD pays no attention to her . EMMY watches , too confounded for words or action . MRS . CAGLE finally moves toward the door , slowly , but firm in step . She stops for a second at the door , and then in a quiet but commanding voice speaks ) Come out , Stranger . STRANGER ( Entering he feels the tenseness of the scene ) Has the  --  Sheriff gone ? p. 80 WIDOW CAGLE Ye air safe from the Sheriff . STRANGER Thank God . WIDOW CAGLE Yo ' name , Stranger .
