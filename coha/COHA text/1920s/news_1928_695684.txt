txt Forced liquidation was on a moderate scale at the opening and when prices did not decline as sharply as many had expected , the belief spread that the market already had been sufficiently purged- This element adopted the long side again and for a time caused good recoveries from the lowest However , a new selling wave started again in the afternoon on which many stocks broke through their previous low points , giving the market a weak appearance . letuite a large number of those who bought for a recovery placed stop orders in the stocks taken . These again were uncovered during the late reaction and aided in bringing the lower levels . It is reported there are many stops in the market at somewhat lower levels , so the possibility of a drive to uncover these exists . Bear traders brought pressure against the market throughout the session and supplied the bids when the rally was in progress . Call money renewed at 10e ; and worked lower later in the day . This was not considered significant , as the belief prevailed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week end . Most bankers are looking for a firm tendency in money again next week , so the effect of yesterday 's comparative ease was only momentary . Sentiment is still decidedly pessimistic . A few observers have been inclined to repurchase stocks , but most observers are advocating a policy of waiting until the market has demonstrated conclusively that a rally can be sustained . Professionals and others who have been active on the long side still insist that nothing more than a technical correction is in progress , but no one was willing to predict when the market would turn again definitely . Trading Because of margin selling and a supply brought into stocks by advices from leading commission houses , the largest firms again were selling on balance . A moderate new demand was encountered on the reactions , but it was by no means sufficient to absorb the supply . Floor traders , and others who have been inclined to be bearish . continued to cover shorts on the reactions , and caused this element to be buyers on balance , although many professionals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Reserve Bank for the past week increased $104.690.000. or nearly 2 , ; .. This gain was higher than Wall Street had been estimating , the highest predictien being in the neighborhood of SSD , - 000,000 . Loans are at a new high record of $5,394 , - 590,000 .

There was a decrease of 81.724,000 in the loans for the account of others to ** This is the first drop shown in this latter item since October 3. last . Dist vitiation That heavy distribution has been in progress in the past two weeks has been the opinion of conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made unusually strong , while the general list was being supplied as bids came from outsiders . Confirmation of this distribution is seen by sonic in the fact that during the past three weeks the loans to brokers reported by the Federal Reserve Bank have expanded more than $410,000,000 . Part of this increase can be attributed to the higher prices which have been established , but the bulk is credited to outside buying for margined accounts , which has been unusually large . Margin Calls It was only natural that margin calls were sent out after the close Thursday . A crop of nearly 11 points in the industrial averages made such calls necessary . Compared with the extent of public interest in the market and the abrupt drop , the number of such calls could not be considered large . There was some outside liquidation at the opening yesterday as a result of these calls , but in most instances it was reported that customers deposited additional funds to Increase their equity against their holdings . The one interpretation placed upon this attitude is that the public is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prominent in the break It has been stated hei e several times recently that as a result of the advices from conservative observers many clients 01 commission houses have adopted the use of stops as a protection against accumulated profits . Naturally such stops were reached on the reaction , particularly in the stocks which broke through their lows of last week , for these were the limits recommended in many quarters . With such selling it is the normal conclusion in many firms that the technical position has been materially improved , for a weak long interest has been largely reduced by the liquidation which was forced during the sharp reaction . " Mr Pockets " It is probably true that some " air pockets " exist in the market as . a result of the reaction , and traders who have been bearish for some time are expected to attempt to uncover weak positions . Action of the stocks which are attacked will he watched with interest , and ability to resist the pressure will be viewed as indicating a better situation . Buying Advice Hornblower &; Weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull side up to Wednesday of last week , when customers were advised to take profits all around on the theory that a sharp reaction was impending , has reversed its posit ion again , and recommended the purchase of leading stocks yesterday morning . It was stated that the firm believed a ma3ority of the leading issues had seen their low levels for December during the break late on Thursday or early yesterday This turn-about brought considerably buying into the market and caused a good rally . Loaning Values In the past week many of the banks have reduced the loaning values on a number of stocks . This fact has been responsible for some of the liquidation , as customers reduced their holdings to meet the more stringent requirements of the lenders . It is probable that this action prevented the break from being greater than actually did occur . Money It is the opinion of some of the leading bankers that call money has not yet seen its high for December Periods of small supply and withdrawals of loans are anticipated during which considerable stringency is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is probable that any flurry will cause new selling to come into the market from time to time . Bails During the general wave of seUing the rails held better than industrials in the averages . This is not surprising , because the carrier group did not harbor such a large weak outside long interest as the industrials . There are sonic observers who still give preference to the rails because they believe this department may actually hold steady Gr move forward during the periods when industrials will be irregularly lower . This view seems to be based on the fact that excellent accumulation has been in progress in several leading rails in recent weeks . Northern Pacific In quarters which are usually informed from the Northwest it is said that the prospects indicate an early increase in the Northerr . Pacific dividend . Such a move would not be unusual because conditions in the territory served by the company have been good and earnings in recent months have made favorable comparisons .

It is maintained that other favorable developments are not far away , including split-ups. etc . American Tobacco is favored as one of the logical leaders of this group when the situation in the stock market becomes more settled . , and scale buying has been in progress in that issue on all recent reactions . Oils Those who have been optimistic on the oils for some time expressed the view that most of these stocks bed reached levels at which they could be accumulated on a scale . They contend the t constructive developments of far-reaching , importance to the industry are being worked out and eventually will be reflected in higher prices for these stocks . Of course , most interest is being shown in the progress made on the formation of an export organization under the Webb-Pomerene act . This is viewed as a most important step in the direction toward bringing greater stability in the entire industry . Bethlehem Steel A house which has been active in Bethlehem Steel right along was a buyer of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purchasers point out that there are several developments ahead which should be reflected in the price of the stock , including particularly the good earnings being recorded and the plans to resume dividends on the stock at the meeting of the directors late next month . Chrysler Throughout the financial district optimistic talk is heard on Chrysler . This has been responsible for some of the buying which has come into the stock recently . Stop orders were uncovered on the reaction , but this supply represented forced liquidation by outsiders who followed previous strength in the issue . Well informed interests maintain that the holdings of important interests , which were accumulated at much lower figures , have not come on the market even at the recent high prices . Coppers Copper shares have suffered with other departments . and because of their previous sharp upturns on outside buying they have been meeting liquidating sales in rather large volume . Authorities in the leading companies are still very optimistic on the outlook and predict that 1929 earnings will be materially in excess of those for the current year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
