txt 29 Students Get Library School Certificates and 3 Get Diplomas for Advanced Work . Carl B. Roden , librarian of the CMcago Public Library , appealed for greater recognition and support of the public library as a national force in America in an address at the commencement exercises of the Library School of the New York Public Library yesterday . Certificates were ' awarded to - twentynine students at the exercises in the library building , and diplomas in recognition of advanced work were presented to three . The graduates represented many parts of the United States , Norway , Mexico , Holland and Russia . The Library School was established in ' 1911 by the Board of Trustees , and funds for its support were provided by Andrew Carnegie and the Carnegie Corporation . Mr. Roden said the public school and the public library , " both conceived in the spirit of democratic ideals , " represented in common " the aspirations of the democracy toward that intellectual freedom which only universal education can promote and which is both the source and safeguard of the political freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn with sanguine eyes . " he continued , " to regard the public ' thrall , ' as the one agency charged with responsibility for all that remains to be accomplished in the education of the democracy after the few niggardly years allotted to the public schools are passed , what do we find ? We find an Institution that occupies a choice and pleasant spot in the topography of many an American community , and an equally amiable one in the esteem of most of its constitutents . It has come to be regarded as a sort of abstract symbol of culture . " The amount of material support accorded it as compared with that of the school may be taken as a fair Index to the relative public appraisal of the institutions . In the town with whose affairs I am most familiar the ratio happens to be something like one to forty , and that is usually an equally fair index of its approximation of accomplishment to opportunity . If it were not for the huge benefactions bestowed with a lavish hand by a single inspired individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , be still greater . " In short , we find an institution that receives almost universal approbation and inadequate means of subs .. , ten .. e ; an institution vibrant with poss. /3 ; 11de ? for touching and influencing tile : Lve5 of all citizens and humbly content Witt ) serving a willing but wavering minorit , - ; one that democracy created out of its own need , to fulfill a function in publiz education not otherwise covered , but which thus far neither democracy on the one hand has been prevailed upon to acknowledge and support , nor the library , on the other hand , to define , delimit and yet to perform . " Mr. Roden said that , " in spite of the Fundamentalists , " evolution was a natural procesa that could neither b d forced nor retarded , and if there was a higher destiny before the public library there was also an appointed time for its manifestation . " The appointed time is now , " Mr. Roden continued , " and it is not a case of forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are living in an age of seething restlessness . The cataclysm that imperiled the foundations of the world has left behind it a huge aftermath of wreckage  --  material , political and moral . " Ideals , illusions , age-old standards and values are in process of being scrapped , and out of the ruins a new structure is to be reared to house new conceptions of human responsibility and old ones realized . From all sides sounds the call for leadership . Are we altogether wrong in believing that this is the time and here the place for the , emergence of the public library from its long novitiate to the front rank of those forces to which the world looks for re-demotion ? I " One of the most significant symptoms ' of the times is the rapidly spreading movement for adult education . lt represents that ancient and elemental hunger for self-improvement that is the very mainspring of the world 's momentum . What is adult education if It is not exactly that service which the public library should be prepared to render ? " Here are spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . And the vocation of the new librarian will be to discover the- road back to the individual and the way to bring the souls of men and the souls of books together . "
