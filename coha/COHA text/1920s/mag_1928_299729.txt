Federal Judge William Hawley Atwell of Dallas , a big blonde blue-eyed Texan , is a stern and conscientious jurist . For two months he has served on the bench of the Federal Court , Brooklyn , N. Y. , during the absence of a resident judge . He took with him a righteous whip which he had learned to crack below the Mason-Dixon line . He flayed what he conceived to be the lax , despicable mores of New York law courts . <P> Last week he went home , carrying two mementos . One was a set of complimentary resolutions tendered him by admiring jurors ; the other was notice of a $50,000 slander suit brought against him by Attorney F. R. Serri of Brooklyn , no admirer . And as he entrained for Texas , echoes of indignation from New York 's Negro districts filled his ears . <P> A month ago , Judge Atwell called upon two policemen to testify that they had bought a pint of whiskey from Mrs. Angelina de Luca , defendant . Attorney Serri , counsel for the defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prohibition agent who tells the truth on the witness stand . " Judge Atwell bristled , thought of the impeccable Texas constabulary . After the conviction he loudly rebuked Mr. Serri , said : " His recital of the bootleggers ' game is astonishing to the court , and I can not understand how any reputable attorney could have such first hand information . . . . In my country had you made such an accusation against an officer of the law he would have smashed your face before you got out of the court room . " Continuing , he suggested that Mrs. de Luca should move out of the Negro neighborhood in which she lives , that she was unfortunate in her choice of counsel . The " atmosphere of a United States Court is novel to him . " Then he climaxed : " Your client is now on her way to jail . Do you want to go along with her ? " <P> Attorney Serri , fuming , not a bit rueful , retaliated with a letter of complaint to Chief Justice William Howard Taft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garibaldi Sargent and the Brooklyn Bar Association . Wrote Mr. Serri : " By indirection , with almost unspeakable vulgarity . . . Judge Atwell practically approved and incited the repetition by the officers of such conduct in this city . I doubt whether in all judicial annals there can be found such open incitement to public disorder and breach of the peace as the words of this judge . ... I submit to you that for a Judge to act as an understudy of Providence and deliver pronouncements which are nothing but the expression of his private prejudices . . . reflecting a mixture of prejudice , naivete , ignorance and abuse of power difficult to match . . . not only merits the severest reprimand , but raises a grave question of his fitness to sit on the bench anywhere in America . " <P> Chief Justice Taft replied that he had no jurisdiction to review the complaint . Attorney Serri , still undaunted , continued action with the slander suit , " as a test case ... to call the attention of the legal profession to the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
