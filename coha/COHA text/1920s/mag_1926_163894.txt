In Manhattan Joseph P. Day cuts somewhat of a swath . He is the real estate dealer who in January semi-cyclonically sells lots out of doors and in his shirt sleeves . He is the man who , together with Herbert Bayard Swope ( dynamic executive editor of the New York World ) and other skillful publicists brought the 1924 Democratic National Convention to Manhattan ( TlME , Jan. 28 , 1924 , PRESS ) . He knows he is well known . Yet last week he declared himself obscured , declared in paid advertisements in Manhattan newspapers : " The Telephone Company never makes mistakes , but just the same they omitted from 40% of the Winter Manhattan Telephone Directories My Telephone Number . . . . " He declared too he had tried to make the telephone company pay for the advertisements , something they refused to do , for they never claimed infallibility.
