McKelvie Boomed <P> Sirs : <P> On reading your article " McKelvie v. Lowden " I wondered whether there was any significance behind that title . . . . . A few months ago one of the leading bank presidents of the country , at a conference of influential men of the Great Central West , I am informed , introduced ex-governor McKelvie of Nebraska as the next president . Does n't it seem reasonable to surmise from these circumstances that have arisen during the past few months - McKelvie 's conference with the President at Washington ; the first overnight guest of the President at his summer home ; the recipient of the only visit made by the President on a private individual while at his summer home ; and , as you say , the spokesman of the President in regard to the Farm legislature and one who is apparently pleasing to the financial interests of the country ; - that here is a man who is proposed to fill the bill of the Republican Convention next year ? <P> Mr. McKelvie was a splendid executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influential Farm paper and has been a most successful business man . His varied interests in civic and state activities have always been felt in the right direction . He is held in the highest respect by every citizen in Nebraska . <P> J. E. M. THOMPSON , M.

Manor <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , page 21 , Sept. 5 , ' 1927 , under " Death of Strachey , " says , " Mr. Strachey was , to use an old English expression , ' to the manner born . ' " <P> The old English expression is , properly , " to the manor born " - implying a natural inherited talent for the particular accomplishment under discussion . It is most frequently employed to connote social grace or charm . <P> S. D. HOFHEIMER Philadelphia , Pa . <P> Webster authorizes that it be spelled either way . - ED . <P> " Atlantic " Flayed <P> Sirs : <P> . . .

In vain I have looked for news about Puerto Rico for the last six months . <P> Why have you not mentioned the several notable events that have taken place concerning this island from all angles of view : political , artistic , sport , etc . ? <P> For instance : ( 1 ) Two Porto Rican young men , brothers , whose surname is Figulroa , who won the Sarasate award , that is , the first prize in violin and piano , at the Royal Conservatory of Music , at Madrid , Spain . <P> ( 2 ) The Porto Rican young men who started on a 24,000 mile trip on foot from New York to South America . <P> ( 3 ) The Victory obtained in chess by Rafael Cintron , a Porto Rican , over several American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being carried on by Sr. Albizu Campos , Porto Rican , whose object it is to raise moral power in Latin American republics in behalf of the independence of Porto Rico . He has begun a series of conferences in behalf of our cause , and has established committees with that purpose . <P> Do you , omniscient TIME , know that Puerto Rico exists at all ? <P> E. VER'A <P> Guayama , Puerto Rico . <P> Dislikes Hearst <P> Sirs : <P> I have just started . on an essay on Governor Smith , having completed one on Woodrow Wilson a fortnight or so ago . <P> When I am at my writing I have no time or thought for anything else but to that work and arrange for plenty of paper , pens and ink and good lighting . Think of it , so busy in my 88th year . <P> There are two people whom I think utterly unworthy to appear in the columns or on the cover of TIME . Fatty Arbuckle especially disgusting and William Randolph Hearst a poor creature to have the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once thought him a regular Bayard without fear and without reproach and I wrote a campaign song for him to no purpose but - oh he is worse than a rattlesnake . <P> Please accept my check for a six months ' renewal for I prize TIME as a news me dium . <P> FRANCES E. FRYATT <P> Gayhead , N. Y. <P> Bowling Defended <P> Sirs : <P> I have read your magazine with great interest from cover to cover ever since the first issue , and with the one exception of your article some time ago on Great Lakes Shipping , I have never been tempted to do anything other than praise what I have read in the magazine . <P> However , your article in TIME , Aug. 29 , SPORT , headed " Bowling on the Green " will certainly cause many ardent admirers of the game of Bowling or Ten-Pins to express their resentment pretty forcibly . I refer of course to the words in that article " bowling or ten-pins played now in indoor alleys by bar-flies and roustabouts . " This really is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bar-flies and roustabouts which is of course an absurdity . For example , the International Bowling League will hold its annual tournament in this city next winter and there will be 16,000 people attending . Surely they are not all roustabouts and bar-flies . <P> While on the subject of this article , I can not help but remark that it would have been much more interesting if the really important feature of the game of Bowling on the Green had been mentioned . What makes it a real game , and a scientific one , is the fact that the balls are not perfectly round and in addition , I believe , are weighted so that it is possible to make them roll on the green with a curve either from left to right , or right to left , exactly as is done with curling stones in the game of curling , although of course in the latter game the ability to curve the stones does not come from the fact that the stones are not round , but because the stone slides on the edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a certain traction on the ice when turned one way or another . However , the two games are exactly alike in principle and as that principle is the one thing that makes each of them a fascinating and scientific game , your article seems rather pointless when it is left out . <P> I do not play either Bowling on the Green or Bowling . <P> M. W. GRIGGS <P> St. Paul , Minn . <P> To TIME 'S Sport Editor a thorough-going rebuke . To the International Bowling League a well-merited apology . Upon the occasion of the League 's winter tourney in St. Paul , Bowling-in-the-Alley will be accurately described . - ED . <P> Epstein Queried <P> Sirs : <P> Subscriber Epstein wishes it known TIME , Sept. 5 that he " bowls in an alley " . Does he , perchance , live in one ? <P> L. R. CRAIG <P> Springfield , Mass . <P> Children Upheld <P> Sirs : <P> I was delighted with your reference to the word " kiddies , " so frequently used , as " insulting . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enclosed lines were printed . <P> C. B. BURR <P> Flint , Mich . <P> Time ( Sept. 5 ) said of " kiddies " : " That portion of the population sometimes insultingly termed ' kiddies ' has a new toy . . . . " <P> Said **25;17457;TOOLONG Burr in his Sayings : " To apply to them the name of a domestic animal , distinguished for butting and objectionable odor , cheapens children . " - ED . <P> Sussman 's Reply <P> Sirs : <P> One of the great fundamental beliefs that I have had has just been changed . I always was of the opinion that only the opposite sex was curious but thanks to NichQlas Cuyler Bleecker TIME . Sept. 5 , a complete metamorphosis has taken place within me . <P> Since I am an Hispanist ( I have been so called by the Spanish daily , La Prensa , for my activities as a sympathizer and well-wisher of the Spanish-speaking nations of the world ) , any article relating to Spanish-speaking peoples interests me particularly and it is one of my hobbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their countries . If Mr. Bleecker will observe more closely my letter , he will notice that I attached more importance to explaining about the Basque country than I did to Paolino 's nationality . This statement answers , I trust , the question of Nicholas Cuyler Bleecker . <P> Now concerning Paolino Uzcudun , whom I am personally acquainted with , I resent very much the statement made by Mr. Bleecker in which he calls the former a " pug . " I do not doubt Mr. Bleecker 's right to describe the Spanish pugilist as he sees fit but he certainly does not know Senor Uzcudun in using the epithet " pug . " Mr. Paulino Uzcudun is a gentleman and a man of culture and refinement , as different in his manners from our common American fighters as night and day . The American public does not know the Spanish fighter . They are guided in their opinions by such types of individuals as Mr. Nicholas Cuyler Bleecker who evidently can not understand why I should spend my time in writing about Paolino . <P> May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME was to correct an obviously over-looked error . <P> I hope that I have satisfactorily answered Mr. Bleecker . <P> MORRIS SUSSMAN <P> President Spanish Students Club Elizabeth , N. J. <P> In a letter published in TIME , Nicholas Cuyler Bleecker said : " ... I must ask why a person named Morris Sussman should excite himself as to whether this ' pug ' Paolino Uzcudun was born north or south of the Pyrenees . ... I shall welcome ' one ' Sussman 's reply to my questions if TIME will publish this letter . " - ED . <P> Extreme <P> Sirs : <P> I still favor saving TIME rather than space . <P> Recently , I wrote you a letter objecting to your use of " &"; instead of " and " and referring to such couplets as " hands &; feet , " " room &; board , " " John Doe &; wife . " I note your reply in the current issue that you use this grotesque abbreviation to conserve space . <P> More space might be saved by using the figure 1 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . A good example : " Pres. &; Mrs. Coolidge &; Sen. Norbeck &; wife were entertained by 1 Mr. Smith .
