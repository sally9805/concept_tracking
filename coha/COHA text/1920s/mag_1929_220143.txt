People throughout the world last week looked and looked at pictures of " Captain Barker , " the woman who long persuaded the British Army that she was Captain Leslie Ivor Victor Gauntlett Slight Barker , a " Mons man , " a devoted husband , a first rate boxer ( TIME , March-18 ) . <P> The pictures appeared as the result of her discovery by a sharp-eyed prison surgeon in Brixton Jail , where the callipygian captain was temporarily detained a fortnight ago on a charge of bankruptcy . One of the most fetching of these pictures ( see below ) , shows her wearing the collar of an officer in the Legion of Honor , while across the scarlet bosom of her mess jacket dangle the British D.S.O. ; the Star of Mons , the Cross of a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor , and the Belgian Croix de Guerre with palm . <P> Last week " Captain Barker " was arrested again . Her offense before the law was not that she had worn men 's clothes , or even that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry her , but on a common charge ' of perjury , for she ' had falsely sworn in high court that she was " Captain Leslie Ivor Victor Gauntlett Slight Barker , " when she was really Mrs. Lilias Irma Valerie Barker Smith , mother of two .
