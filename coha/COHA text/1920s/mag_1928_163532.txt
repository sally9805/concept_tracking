While China continued to welter , last week , in virtual anarchy , certain events emerged with significant stability from the general chaos . <P> The Nationalist Government at Nanking has obtained as its Foreign Minister the able and versatile General Huang-Fu . Some five years ago he administered this same post with marked success for what is now the rival reactionary Government at Peking . Later the facile General served as Chinese envoy to Germany , and more recently he was Mayor of the Chinese settlement at Shanghai . Last week he quietly put forward the Nationalist claims for revision of China 's " unequal treaties " with the Powers but displayed in his statements to the press a healthy consciousness of realities and a willingness to bide his time . <P> The prestige of the Nationalist Government has recently been enhanced by visits to Nanking from the Japanese , British and French ministers accredited to Peking ; and last week U. S. Minister John Van Antwerp MacMurray followed their lead and began a tour through Nationalist territory . <P> A reminder that Chinese are now prospering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borneo &; Java was put forward , last week , by U. S. Methodist Bishop Titus Lowe , as he arrived in Paris from his bishopric in Singapore . Said he : " The Chinese have invaded Malaysia by thousands . Not only do they supply men for day labor but they run banks , steamship lines and other great business undertakings . " <P> Concluded the good Bishop with ardor : " The greatest single rubber operator in the world is a Chinese named Tan Kah-kee with headquarters in Singapore . " <P> Manhattan rubbermen recalled that rubber tycoon Tan Kah-kee is a slender , old fashioned Chinaman some five feet two inches tall and about fifty years of age . He founded his rubber business in 1910 at Singapore , and now enjoys a. fabulous income which enables him to live luxuriously at Amoy , on the coast of Southern China . Uneducated in the western sense , and speaking only Chinese &; Malayan , he has a passion for educational philanthropies and makes up each year the large deficit of a university which he founded at Amoy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve not to set foot in the U. S. , although much of his rubber dealing is done with U. S. firms . Although untutored , potent Tan Kah-kee has been elevated to the rank of Chief Justice of the British-fostered " Chinese Court " in Singapore . <P> Again came reports that Chinese tycoons are hurrying their money out of the country as fast as they can . <P> The re-emergence of Canton as a separate Chinese Government was signalized , last week , when the British Governor of Hongkong , Sir Cecil Clementi , received a visit from Dictator Li Chai-sum of Canton and accorded to him every honor . Sir Cecil then prepared to return the Dictator 's visit by announcing that he would go himself in full &; formal array to Canton .
