Baptized in 1929 by the Protestant Episcopal Church : 3,338 fewer persons than in 1928 . <P> Confirmed in 1929 by the Protestant Episcopal Church : 2,027 fewer persons than in 1928 . <P> Such was the prime news of The Living Church Annual , official P. E. almanac , out last week . <P> The falling figures were partially accounted for by The Living Church Annual , thus : ' ' It should be remembered that the attempt to count membership on a basis of baptized persons instead of communicants goes back only two years , and the reports for the previous years included estimates in a number of places , the exact record not being available . . . the decrease shown this year is probably not an actual decrease , but rather a closer approximation to exact figures . " <P> Total P. E. membership ( baptized persons ) , as given in the 1930 Annual : 1,876,119 . <P> The Protestant Episcopal Church stands midway between U. S. Catholicism and U. S. Protestantism . Many Protestants , remembering instances of Episcopalian refusal to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's Bishop William Thomas Manning 's ) forbidding Dr. Karl Reiland to allow Presbyterian Henry Sloane Coffin to officiate at a communion service in an Episcopal church ( TIME , Nov. 25 ) , think Episcopalians have no right to call themselves Protestants . Many high-church Episcopalians agree with them , dislike the name Protestant , would like to change their church 's name to something like American Catholic. * Last week the P. E. high-church weekly , The Living Church , printed an article by Dr. Frederick Henry Lynch , Congregationalist minister , editor of Christian Work and Evangelist , entitled , " Is the Protestant Episcopal Church a Protestant Church ? " <P> Said Dr. Lynch : " The Episcopalian Church is much more closely identified with Catholicism than with Protestantism , and every attempt to practice Church Unity with Protestants proves it . I can not help feeling that the Anglo-Catholic party which wishes to drop the word ' Protestant ' has not only all of the logic on its side , but all of the evidence , both historical and contemporary . Furthermore , every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant minister as equally valid with that of an Episcopalian priest , or refuses to permit a Protestant minister to officiate at its altars or even refuses to join in a common Communion service with Protestants , it proves this contention . Would not the Episcopal Church be much truer to both history and facts if it dropped the word ' Protestant ' from its title and called itself what it really is : ' The Catholic Church ' - Anglo- Catholic in England and American-Catholic in America ? Then no Protestant minister would expect to be asked to share in officiating at its altars . He can not , for the life of him , see why this act should be refused while the Episcopal Church calls itself Protestant . " <P> In hearty agreement with Protestant Lynch was the editor of The Living Church . Said he : " Evidently it has waited for a Congregational minister to frame the real issue ; and we thank Dr. Lynch for doing it so well .
