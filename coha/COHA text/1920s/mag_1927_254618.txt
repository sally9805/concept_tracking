Mr. Lloyd George has visited the French Riviera for his health al most every winter ; but this year , for the first time since his eclipse as Premier , he was officially welcomed and fted near Saint Raphael by the local Prefect and representatives of the French Government . " I was astonished , " said Mr. Lloyd George afterwards . " I tell you they 'll be naming a street after me next . . . . " <P> The so courteous Prefect , M. Cameau , did not welcome Mr. Lloyd George under the mistaken impression that his power is on the rebound in England . It is not . But the British coal strike has disrupted the business of thousands of Britons who would formerly have been able to afford a winter vacation on the Riviera . They have not come to Cannes , Nice , " Mo te , " * or Mentone . Therefore the arrival of Mr. Lloyd George was an occasion for demonstrating that tourists are excessively welcome . <P> Cold and Cash . A prolonged and most exceptional cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still further hurting Riviera tourist trade . Twenty persons died of the cold in France last week , when the thermometer fell to 14 above zero in several cities. + Moreover , Signor Mussolini has lured many tourists from the French to the Italian Riviera by " cutting down Italian tourist taxes while those in France remain high . Finally the doubling of the gold value of the franc in five months ( TIME , July 26 ) has scared away still more tourists and produced a serious fiscal crisis . <P> Industrial Crisis . Last week , due to the higher cost of francs , U. S. importers canceled large orders for French laces . Steel importers canceled so many orders that the Cartel d'Acier ( French Steel Trust ) cut production scales to 2,000 tons monthly from 10,000 tons . Similar curtailments in other lines threw some 30,000 Frenchmen out of work during the past month . <P> Political Crisis . Such industrial hardships came fatefully on the eve of elections affecting one-third of the French Senate which will be held in mid-January . The present Senate is predominantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poincar has based his efforts to increase the value of the franc . <P> Now that these efforts have succeeded with almost disastrous rapidity , the more radical political groups have begun to whisper among the electorate that " Poincar and the Bankers ' Senate " are increasing the value of their money at the expense of unemployment for the worker . <P> Side by side with this attack on the Conservative element , agitation developed last week to expel foreign workers from France and thus " leave more work for Frenchmen . Fulminating upon this point the potent French League of the Rights of Man , a radical organization , issued a manifesto last week : <P> " The French state department must take measures to prevent the formation of foreign colonies in France . France should regulate its immigration in the same way as does the United States .
