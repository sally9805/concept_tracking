May 11 ) for the Brazilian exploration ( 12 white men , 100 Indians ) of Dr. Alexander Hamilton Rice , continued last week : . <P> The trekking-menage sat down to dinner . Such succulent meats ! What were they ? Before the white men lay crackly tidbits of wild tapir ( pig ) . The coppery Indian guides gorged on chunks of monkey carcasses , on the crisped torsos of giant lizards . <P> That music-what was it ? In the dank fastnesses of the jungle along the banks of the Rio Parima , towards whose source the white men were hacking their way , , stirred unearthly strains . " Debbils , " groaned the natives . " Station KDKA , Pittsburgh , " chortled the expedition 's justly proud radio expert , John Swanson . A deep , pontifical voice broke the hot silence .

Threading up the Rio Parima , Lieutenant Walter Hinton , trans-Atlantic flier and air-scout for Dr. Rice , had sought trails from the Parima valley into the Orinoco country . He found none , but located a tribe of furtive , stunted " white " Indians , the Shiritanas , who exhibited neither fear nor curiosity at sight of the white men and their aircraft . The Shiritanas favored cocaine as a relish for their diet the trees " like jaguars , " without making a sound or causing a rustle of the leaves .
