txt General Charles G. Dawes , the new American Ambassador to England , made his eagerly anticipated first public utterance in that capacity tonight at the Pilgrim Society dinner in his honor . It was a great diplomatic success , both in the narrowest oldfashioned social sense of the word and in the newer and broader sense of ? the open and aboveboard international relations in tune with constructive efforts to assure permanent world peace . The theme of his - message was naval reduction as the first ' practical step toward putting reality hate tilt Kellogg anti-war treaty , the ratifica ' tion of which ' the ; Ambassador de ? scribed as " an agreed-upon expression of world intention . " 1 The speech is printed textually on page 2 , as is also a speech by Premier made in Scotland at the same time . Other Ambassadors Guests . The dinner environment and the atmosphere in which : this message was delivered were primarily AngloAmerican , but there was more than mere international courtesy in the significance of the fact that the Ambassadors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Charg ? d'Affaires- of Italy shared the head of the table with General Dawes and Arthur Henderson , the Foreign Minister of the new Labor Government , and Sir Austen Chamberlain , recently retired Foreign Minister of the defeated Conservative Government . The whole tenor of the affair made it plain that the participation of the whole world is contemplated in the peace plans set afoot by President Hoover and which have been coming to realization in the conversations since the Ambassador arrived in England four days ago . When General Dawes said in the course of his ? speech , " New agreements should have , not partial but world sanction . " he turned directly to the French Ambassador . And in the letter which Mr. sent to the dinner from . Scotland , the Prime Minister said that no offensive or defensive alliances were wanted , but that all the nations should come into companionship with England and . America . Premier Sees World Impulse . Prime Minister Ramsay , who was not able to be present because he was also making a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , sent a letter to Lord Desborough , chairman of the Pilgrims ' dinner , in which he said : Fortunately there are no great issues , standing between our two countries . We are rather like men between whom there are ' few neglected roads with a slightly rough surface and with some overgrowth , but who are determined to smooth them ont ? so that they can get more directly in contact with each other . Moreover , we are placed in the extraordinarily fortunate position that our coming together in no way mean 's that we are leaving somebody else . It is a great world impulse to ' get side ? by side , which both ? America and ourselves are feeling . ? ? We long for no alliance , either of common offense or of mutual detense , but rather for that.good-will which , when demonstrated in the eyes Of men , will make . the whole World applaud as being . both an example and . an encouragement for other flattens to come into the same companionship . Therefore ; although 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of General Daws , allow me to ' join my heart and voice with ' yours in giving hini ' a hearty ? and'hospitable British welcome and in-Wishing for him a prosperous ' and ' distinguished term ' of . office : ? ; Arthur .

Says British Only Seek Peace . They are animated by common ideals of peace and human wellbeing . They are at one in their desire to eliminate war from international relationship and to translate the powerful and popular sentiment of peace into practical measures for peace . Whatever mischief-makers and busy-bodies may say to the contrary , - , I assert , without any hesitation or qualification , that the British people look upon the United States and upon all other nations - with only peace in their hearth . We desire to see the ideals of peace realized . We desire that peace shall endure , not merely as a condition representing the absence of war , but as a system of human relationships represented by active cooperation between the nations . It was . I think , Abraham Lincoln who remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he.made so many of them , " and It may safely be said that the peoples of the world desire peace , that they yearn for that freedom which is possible only when war shall be no more . If we accept that , it is the duty and primary function of statesmanship the world over so to conduct affairs as to insure to the peonies increased opportunities for happiness and human well-being . and I can imagine no greater service statesmanship may render than that of uprooting war from human society and lifting the burden of armaments that lies so heavily upon mankind . Minister Sees New Hope . I hope and believe , Sir , that our respective countries are inspired by the true comradeship of peace and that both are anxious to join with the other nations in a new concerted effort  --  and a successful effort  --  to reach the goal of definite disarmament .

If any diplomatic fear bad been aroused on the Continent of Europe by the recent love feast tinge to Anglo-American affairs or that the rczt of the world was being left out , such fear should be dispelled by tonight 's Pilgrim dinner . There were a dozen stories within the main affair of the dinner itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever enacted was in the mere seating of the men at the head of the table . Where was Lord Desborough at- the centre , of course , with General Dawes at his right hand and Arthur . Henderson ; Foreign Minister , at his left . Sir Austen Chamberlain was at General Dawes 's right and next to him . was his great good friend , the French Ambassador . But going in the other direction from the chairman , the balance of political and international likes was kept true by the German Ambassador next to Arthur Henderson . As usual , there was much formality . - with frequent calls from the official toastmaster of " My lords and excellencies and gentlemen . " Dawes Gets Up to See Friends . Perhaps General Dawes found it difficult to talk to Sir Austen . sitting next to him , when what he has really got to say must be said to Mr. Henderson later on . At any rate , the Ambassador suddenly left his seat just before the dessert and began talking to a lot of personal friends who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large-sized model of New York harbor 's Statute of Liberty in ice was placed at the General 's place as a special honor .

There are a dozen old reparation friends of mine here I want to say hello to . " As soon as the toast to the King and President , before which nobody at an English dinner can : smoke , had been drunk , out came the Dawes pipe , which in place of former Premier Baldwin 's pipe and . alongride Sir Austen Chamberlain 's monocle gave the party a strangely Tory appearance for the moment despite the presence of Mr. Henderson . Tory and Laborite Applaud . Perhaps the highest tribute to the success of General Dawes 's speech was the fact ' that both Mr. Henderson and Sir Austen applauded the high points . with equal vigor and apparently the same enthusiasm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acclaim and . equally significant applause and silence , as for example when General Dawes said that he would expect failure to agree on any plan of naval reduction if it were left entirely to naval experts . No report of the dinner would be complete if it leis out of account the ' bully " sportsmanship of Sir Austen Chamberlain in good-naturedly making fun of himself on not being Foreign Minister to . greet General Dawes and in his accord With his successful Labor rival , Mr. Henderson , in endorsing the Ambassador 's message . " I now belong to the Minority party , " said Sir Austen " and minorities must be under the special protection of Providence and the Prime Minister . But I know that tile : greet , fags of my right honorable= friend and successor as Foreign Minister , Mr. . Henderson , to Ambassador Dawes are not from his party atone. but from our whole nation .
