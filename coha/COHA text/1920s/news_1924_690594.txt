The flimsiest reason that could have been aNivanced for the readjustment of stock prices last week was that investors and traders were stampeded by a " Third Party scare : ' There is no form of business acitivity in this country . that would suffer so much from radicalism en , throned as the railroads , yet they took the selling as well as any department of the market . Two of the most import tant and active issues made . conspicuous advances on Thursday and again on Friday during the heaviest of the selling . Studebaker took the selling well and Chandler was especially weak , to select two stocks in the same industry . Is there any reason for expecting that the radicals-would dismantle the Chandler plants and spare Studebaker ? Directors of American Woolen , whatever else may have actuated them , were not moved to pass the dividend on account of the political situation , although their action moved several politicians to pass inane comments . The radicals in the last session of Congress did not actually theaten to suppress the petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the oils advanced on Friday . Standard of New Jersey , the grandfather of all trusts and most likely to draw the lightning of the communistic gods , sold up on the day , as did three other of the most active oils . Famous Players was an especially weak spot , yet there are really fewer censors among radicals than among consevatives . American Ice was strong and General Baking weak . The dopesters who prefer to generalize rather than to specialize can assume that , in the northwest , where most of the radical strength is supposed to lie , ice is so common that it is seldom used and , therefore , excites no political hatred . Just conclude that some stocks were too high and others too low ! After that , do n't rob the bears of their just due ! Maxwell Motor Corp . is estimated to . have earned in July and August after depreciation and interest approximately $1,100,000 against a balance of less than half that amount in the first six months of the year . Net earnings before taxes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year Maxwell earned $3,072,532 in the first six months , but in the last half the company lost money . This year the situation is reversed with the first six months showing up poorly , after absorbing Chrysler development expense , while the last half promises to be the big earnings period . Present indications are that company will do nearly as well as in 1924 as last year when final earnings , after allowing for 8.7 , . dividends on the A stock , equaled between $1.15 and $2 a share on the B stock . SELLINC ; OF ' WOOLWORTIL While there was nothing in sales report of the F. W. Woolworth Co. to warrant a bearish attitde on the stock , floor traders included it in their list of issues which deserved the attention of their selling orders and consequently it reacted over four points in Friday 's market . This was in line with their activities in recent ' trading days when specal stocks were picked upon as centers of attack . To Woolworth stockholders , however , report of business progress will be more comforting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just under $2,000,000 , or 13.11% over August , 1923 , one of the best monthly gains this year . and an unusually good one considering weather conditions . In the eight months period the gain was $13,500,000 . Continuing at this rate Woolworth should make good estimates that it would reach the $220.000,000 sales mark in 1924 . Studebaker established a record high price of 40 for the new common while other mats of the list were losing ground rapidly . The high price is equivalent to par for the old $100 stock . Recovery from the esctrerne low price this year is equivalent to 25 points on the old stock , but even at its ' highest price the issue yields 10% on its current dividend of $4 a share , which was practically earned in the first six months . MOTOR CARS FOR socronr More than 400.000 American motor cars and trucks will go to 114 foreign countries in 1924. " says Alfred Reeve ' , manager of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce . Automobile shows will be held in Paris , Berlin . Amsterdam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers are expected to contract for American cars . It was only . slightly more than a decade ago that total production of the American automobile industry was less than estimated exports of 1924 . In 1923 when production was 485,000 vehicles , it had for the first time crossed the 400,000 mark . EXPLOSIVE% IN PE WE 3iost people consider the manufacture of explosive : primarily a war-time activity , but one of the largest con. tracts in the history of the powder industry , reported between 50,000,000 and 100,000.000 pounds , has just been awarded to the du Pont company by the government . the explosive to be used for the construction of highways , agricultural purposes and other peaceful industrial pursuits . Automobile production in August was at the rate of nearly 1,250,000 vehicles annually , contrasted with production in August last year at the rate of over 4,000,000 , Output in the first eight months of 1924 is only 175,000 below last year 's record . As production from now until the end of the year will closely follow actual demand , with out any attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na output of around 1,000,000 vehicles in the last four months against 1,300,000 in the last-four months of 1923 . Those timid little rails  --  Lackawanna and Nickel Plate  --  apparently have n't heard of Lamar 's release . A. firm of attorneys , in the original Nickel Plate consolidation , obtained for certain stockholders $91.50 in cash . This stock was exchanged share for share for stock now worth $118 in cash . Nothing could surpass the condescension of the Mayor , who is willing to permit private corporations to operate free buses .
