But the chief is the fact that speculators had abandoned thought of the relation of security prices to the earnings of underlying business ventures . <P> It is inaccurate to say that any one security issue started the break last week . But if one is to be set up as a black example it is the Bank of Italy . On the San Francisco and Los Angeles exchanges Bank of Italy stock broke 160 points-from 284 to 125 . Related issues acted likewise . Bancitaly dropped 86 points-195 to 109 ; Bank of America 120 points - 270 to 150 ; United Security 80 points-245 to 165 . In New York the drops in these issues were as great . <P> Millions of paper profits disappeared .
