A first lieutenant in the dental corps of the army rises to captain in three years , to major in 12 , to lieutenant-colonel in 20 , to colonel in 26 . <P> A first lieutenant chaplain rises to captain in four years , to major in 14 , to lieutenant colonel in 20 , to colonel never . <P> Only the chief of all chaplains becomes a colonel , whereas the chief of the dentists , veterinarians , surgeons , becomes brigadier-general . <P> The inequity of this situation was pointed out last week by a large committee of Protestant divines . The committee further pointed out that the present law provides only one chaplain for every 1,200 soldiers ( 125 in all ) , and that while this ratio might be adequate for a mobilized army , it is inadequate for a force so widely scattered as the army of the U. S. The committee pleads for one chaplain for every 800 soldiers , and for greater advancement in rank .                @ @ @ @ @
