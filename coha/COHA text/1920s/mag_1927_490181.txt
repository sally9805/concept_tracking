IN all the ballyhoo about Lindbergh 's peace flight to Mexico , we thought we detected an artificial stimulus . We suspect that the average peon 's idea of relations with the United States today is something like this : an aviator named Lindbergh came down to collect a debt which a man named Hearst owes to four Mexican senators on account of a speech which a man named Will Rogers made about this man Morrow , President of the United States . Fortunately only a scattered few Mexicans know , or care , that on the same day Ambassador Lindbergh arrived , Secretary Wilbur suggested that we build seventy-one new ships of war at a cost of seven hundred and twenty-five million dollars  --  presumably in case Mexico , or any other country , ever gets tired of young aviators .

" A Friend of Jimmy 's THE tall , dark young man often seen at Mayor Walker 's left hand in orchestra circles is Mr. William Seeman , one of the many called but one of the few really chosen a friend of the Mayor . He is , in fact , probably Mr. Walker 's closest friend . His career , he has been quoted as saying , is devoted to the canning of White Rose salmon and to Jimmy Walker . Mr. Seeman came here from Cornell in 1911 to take charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Hudson Street . Soon after that he met Mr. Walker and within a few months they were intimates . Often considered by his and the Mayor 's friends for public office , he has never had one because of two votes against it : his own and the Mayor 's . Mr. Walker has often entertained his friend at French Lick and otherwhere , and in return Mr. Seeman extends the hospitality of his apartment above the Pepper Pot , in Fourth Street , where the tradition of the old French salons is kept alive by an intellectual ( more or less ) group skilled in handling fragile teacups and flashing banter . Here are often seen not only Mr. Walker , but Mr. Buddy de Sylva , who plays , in place of the lute , Mr. Seeman 's player-piano , traps , or any one of his twelve ukuleles . The salon has been decorated by Mr. See-man 's brother-in-law , Mr. Rube Goldberg , the mural painter .

More than eighty when he died  --  during the Civil War  --  he was buried in the cemetery behind the Chapel of the Intercession on upper Broadway . This Christmas Eve children will gather about his tomb , cartying lighted candles and singing the verses of his poem . Meanwhile , in a home on West Seventy-first Street , the household of Dr. William S. Thomas will await the coming of St. Nicholas as one of their own family . It is their contention that Dr. Thomas ' great grandfather , Henry Livingston , Jr. , wrote the poem in a big house near Poughkeepsie more than a hundred years ago and read it to the family one morning at breakfast . The story of the literary feud is interesting . Dr. Moore was a notable scholar . His father , Protestant Episcopal Bishop of New York , asTHE NEW YORKER sisted at the inauguration of Washington and administered last rites to the dying Alexander Hamilton . Dr. Moore loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book entitled " A Compendious Lexicon of the Hebrew Language . " He also liked to turn out pieces such as one called " Observations upon Certain Passages in Mr. Jefferson 's Note on the State of Virginia which Appear to have a Ten ... a watch .

" There was only one other in the same metre ( anapaestic ) and it was not so good . It was long before the Civil War that the descendants of Livingston announced their claim . The story of his writing the poem has been a family tradition for a century . One tale is that a friend of the Moores in the house at the time he read it asked for a copy of the poem and introduced it later into the household in Chelsea Square . The original of the poem has never been found by either family . Mr. Livingston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poems too . " ' T was the Night " is n't included in it but nearly half of the verses are in its metre and many of them are said to display the same tricks of expression and phrasings . No writing of his has been found claiming the authorship of the poem . He had been dead eight years when the poem appeared under Dr. Moore 's name . An interesting quirk to the mystery is that the poem first appeared in print in the Troy Sentinel in 1823 , prefaced with a note by the editor saying that he did n't know who had sent it in . Dr. Thomas has spent years collecting documents on the subject . A literary researcher who examined his papers some years ago wrote a piece for a magazine seeming to cast the laurel on Livingston .

Music by Romberg THE most prolific operetta and musical comedy composer of the day is Sigmund Romberg . So numerous have been his works that we have heard it suggested that his name must be that of a syndicate of song writers . It is n't , however . He is an individual , and has been rather well known al on g Broadway for years . He is a genial man of forty , swarthy and bald , who speaks with a decided foreign accent . He was born in Hungary , trained in Vienna , and he used to be an orchestra leader . At the moment of writing Mr. Romberg is represented on Broadway by three musical shows , " My Maryland , " " The Love Call , " and " The Desert Song . " In addition he did the music for one show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Moon , " still to open , and , with George Gershwin , he wrote the score for Marilyn Miller 's new show , " Rosalie . " These behind him , he is preparing to start on the music for three shows which he has already signed up to do for next season . All told , he has done some twenty-five or thirty shows in recent years , among them " Maytime , " " Blossom Time , " " The Student Prince , " and several of the Winter Garden offerings . The Broadway legend is that Romberg wrote his first song on a wager with one Harry Carroll , who composes music for vaudeville revues . Romberg 's Viennese education had been along the lines of civil engineering and bridge building , but when he came to this country he did n't catch on in any of those fields . Being musical , he went into the business of hiring musicians and placing them in small restaurants . This ended in his taking charge of the orchestra at Bustanoby 's . One evening Carroll dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and an eye to business . He asked Romberg to assist in his musical advancement by playing it . The orchestra leader had to confess that he had never heard the tune before and that , moreover , his musicians played only music of merit . From the way he pronounced the title of his song Carroll gathered that the director not only had never heard of it but had never heard of the Mississippi River . One thing led to another and Romberg bet Carroll twenty-five dollars that he could write a better and a more popular song . A few days later he turned up with two , " Some Smoke " and " Leg of Mutton ! ' After hearing them Carroll admitted that he had met his master , paid the bet , and immediately took Romberg to the Shuberts ' office . That is the legend and it is generally accepted . At any rate , it is true that Romberg 's first show was written for the Shuberts and that since then he has become a much whistled , much recorded , wealthy composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . He does his composing in a sound-proof room in which he has both an organ and a grand piano . He works out his things on the organ first because it gives them more substance . His recreations are musical evenings at home and the drama  --  not musical shows . He likes his drama strong . A good mystery show will take his mind off his work . His maggot is the size to which the theatrical world has grown , which makes it impossible for the workers to know all their fellow laborers . He thinks that if the critics knew him , for instance , they would understand his work better and would be kinder . He was bewildered by a letter to the editor printed in a Baltimore newspaper attacking his score for " My Maryland " on the ground that the music is imitative of southern airs . He had written it that way intentionally .

Evenings he drank , joyously and well ; mornings he slept , profoundly and deep . The person who narrated this to us happened to overhear one of the old ladies discussing him with a companion . She was particularly pleased to have discovered so friendly a young man in her travels . " I think he 's just the nicest boy I 've ever met , " she confided " Is n't it a shame he has so many sick headaches ! " Paradise Eno ' w THE printed statement that New York has imported this year more California grapes ( twenty-five million dollars ' worth ) than the entire grape output of California in 1916 , led us to ask a few questions . We learned that the traffic in wine grapes has become so heavy that railroad facilities are not large enough to handle it on the lower West Side . Rather than build huge new terminals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special yard at Kearny , N.J. , where twice as many grapes are handled , in season , as the New York trade in apples , peaches , pears , oranges , lemons , grapefruit , and potatoes , combined . A special train is run on sales days to Manhattan Produce Yards , N.J. , as the special ticket calls it , and this train is well filled with buyers who bid for the shipments . A carload produces about two thousand gallons of wine and they say that it would take this year 's vintage half a day to flow over the Croton dam . It is nothing for eight hundred cars to roll into the New Jersey yards in one day during the busy season , which but recently ended , and when the auctioneer is going well these are auctioned off at the rate of one every twenty seconds . Yards gossip has it that a certain dealer had seven hundred carloads in transit at one time this fall and that one manufacturer made a thousand barrels of wine during the year . The sale of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least interesting phase of the industry is that the Department of Agriculture lends a skilled hand in helping the shippers and dealers . In its official reports it refers to grapes as " black juice " and " white juice , " and department inspectors will tell you frankly that none of the output has much value either for eating or for producing unfermented grape juice . These inspectors are available at the THE NEW YORKER receiving point to rush out with their hydrometers and see if the grapes have the required sugar content , important in making wine . All shipments and arrivals are reported daily over the government 's leased wire system and the department officially grades the grapes to avoid confusion and unseemly pushing by the wine makers . Moreover , the department assigns its ablest inspectors to this duty . Those of lesser ability help the apple and potato growers . The price of grapes has been somewhat higher this year than last , the market value being about fifteen hundred dollars a carload , but that has n't prevented an increase of three million potential gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York will soon he the largest wine producing centre in the world . Institutional ONE of our dearest friends says he remembers clearly a visit a few years ago to Brooks Brothers in quest of a union suit . That eminently conservative shop simply raised its eyebrows . At that time , it appears , it was still holding back , waiting for the strange new garment to meet the test of time . Not many years ago we were in the store ourself to buy a hat and mentioned to the clerk that we heard brims were going to be wider . " Ours , " he responded firmly , " will be the same . " The sobriety , the right-living of Brooks has ever been with us , a cold , clean influence  --  like that of Queen Mary  --  and it was as if the world had dropped out from under us this week when we heard of the experience of a young Englishman who went into the men 's shop of one of the department stores to purchase a tint of clothes .

The mere character studies of those who stop there to " buy a paper from your home town " wouldbe worth something , than that . The gentlemen journals from Win Cary , North Carolina , the various Springfields , not to mention Dubuque , are , we have learned by personal investigation , more than mere salesmen . They art , in their fashion , psychologists of no mean ability and aids to what is known as the social order . Their adventures must give them a good deal to talk about when they go home at night .

The news salesman has his tip from the detective department and the rest is easy . Quite frequently a young lady will make her way to the stand and ask for the paper from Ashtabula or Tampa . The dealer , with quick recourse to his card-indexed memory , will inform her that it has not yet arrived but that if she will return in an hour he will save it for her . Back she comes , to find a detective who frequently convinces her that she is n't on her way to a fortune and that perhaps she ought to go back home and see the family . Only the other day the slender , tall gentleman with the mole on his left cheek , and the shy , rather furtive blonde , who asked for the Smithville paper , turned out to be the factory cashier and the choir singer whose disappearance was shockingly chronicled in the paper they had just bought .
