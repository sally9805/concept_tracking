Last week Augustus John held a one-man show in London . Everyone knew that he wanted to raise money but most dealers were doubtful . They were thinking of the " Artists ' Own Exhibition , " at which the contributors agreed to sell for the highest bid that was placed , in a sealed envelope , under a painting . Some of the best painters in England sold their canvases for $5 ; a painting by Sir John Lavery went for $37 . But Augustus John , that swaggering British Van Dyke with his great soft hat and his little sharp beard , is a shrewd business man as well as a capable painter ; he knew that when people are watched they are generous but that the offers one seals up in privy envelopes are apt to be mean . His show brought him $25,000 , with a top price of $7,500 for a portrait of Princess Bibesco ( Lord Asquith 's daughter ) - returns that have only been surpassed , among contemporary painters , by Sargent .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
