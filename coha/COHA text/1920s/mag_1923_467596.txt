Hollywood : An American State of Mind BY KATHARINE FULLERTON GEROULD peat , a state of mind . Let us get away at once from the conception of it as a hectic town near Los Angeles given over wholly to the production of motion pictures , and consider it as a mental condition , an attitude of some millions of souls . That the motion-picture world offers a good culture for certain germs of which we go spiritually in danger is probably true . Otherwise " Hollywood " would not be the title of this essay . But I wish to make it clear at the beginning that I am not referring to the private lives or the private moralities of motion-picture folk , which , for all I know , are as good as the average . The youth of the country , if it is menaced by Hollywood at all , is menaced less by what it hears of the vices of the film folk than by what it hears of their virtues . The worst phase of the matter is really that the American public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself shows that the disease is widespread ; that the state of mind is common . Au analysis of this temper which ? perhaps rather wickedly ? we call " Hollywood " for convenience would be mightily assisted and clarified if I could quote for you , at random , half a dozen paragraphs from almost any of the motion-picture magazines that clutter our news stands . I have , before this , recommended to anyone who wants to know his contemporary world , an occasional glance at these publications ; though , of course , I did not expect anyone but a movie fan to adopt my suggestion , and the movie fans know them already . At all events , I speak , myself , from a fairly intimate acquaintance with them during the last year . ( Perhaps I , too , am in danger of " Hollywood . " ) They are perilously easy reading for anyone who likes good films well enough to like to know what is going to be produced and by whom . It is only fair to say that a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . So are the cooking receipts and the knitting directions in the women 's magazines . It is , in both kinds of periodicals , the implied philosophy of lifethat is appalling ? and , I may say , astonishingly similar in the two . Yet you will not know your own generation until you know something both of Hollywood and ? again , for convenience , may I say ? ? " McCall Street . " Those of us who read " Side Talks with Girls " in our youth , when Bokhood was in flower , can recognize Ruth Ashmore 's very voice when a film ingenue is being interviewed . One of the great prices we have paid for being a nation of successful business men is that we have forgotten how to face any facts save financial ones . I am told that the Tired Business Man is a myth ; but he has certainly , in all good faith , been made the apology for cheap and easy art . I am inclined to believe that he is real . I am told also that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men folk with leisure beyond that of any European woman ? is the most cultured in the world . That , I am very disinclined to believe . That she spends more time deliberately looking for culture , I admit . No other country has developed women 's clubs and Chantanquas . In no other country do the women habitually attend lectures and " classes " and courses , of a nonacademic , but informing nature . But the women of the country at large have made the same mistake which the men have made : they have believed that they could transfer the rules of " efficiency " to the kingdom of the mind , and make up a budget for the spirit as they could make it up for food and clothing , by using one of the much-advertised little blank books that come for the purpose . Over any mistakes that give us pause we throw the veil of optimism . The fact is that , except in an obvious material sense , we are unwilling to work . The man knows that he must work , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " McCall Street , " at alI events ? that she must work in order to keep her household comfortable . Beyond that , neither is willing to toil . They expect knowledge , culture , " standards , " to be somehow broadcasted to them while they sit comfortably . The very radio advertisements give us away : the man in the Morris chair , with his feet up , ravished and listening . The fact that the best things can not be broadcasted is not mentioned in the advertisements . It is not precisely time that we are unwilling to spend ; it takes no longer to read an author than to go to a course of lectures upon his work . It is effort that we grudge . We like to have things done for us ; and we naively believe ? the wish being father to the thought ? that it is possible . " Oh , for that , " says Kim 's lama , about the railway , " one but asks a question and pays money , and the appointed persons despatch all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , canned music , canned information , canned culture . . The basic trouble with the much criticized " younger generation " is , I fancy , that it is so ignorant . Its ignorance is a by-product of this mental laziness which we have allowed to invade the national soul . We are always looking for the cheap and easy way ; and if Coue or some one else tells us that by taking thought we can add a cubit to our stature , we are only too ready to believe . If the " younger generation " has cast away all standards , it is because the preservation or the creation of standards is hard work . We do not , I fancy , write free verse , originally , because we believe in free verse : we write it because it is easier than metrical forms . Then , because we are determined to be not only clever but good , not only good but clever , we invent poetic theories to fit our productions . The younger generation finds it easier to ignore everything produced before 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were developed before that shining date : therefore it says that no art worth the name existed before the twentieth century . The ignorance would not so much matter if it called itself ignorance ; when it masquerades as knowledge , it becomes a menace . Laziness it-self does not matter so much until vanity insists on giving it fine names . But the " younger generation " would never have been able to hypnotize the public if the public had not forgotten how to think for itself . The public , in matters artistic or intellectual , has developed the pathetic habit of having to be " told " by some one else . We have lost the habit of dealing with intellectual facts , because we have lost the habit of mental effort . Unfortunately , along with our demand for mental ease , we have developed an inordinate capacity for self-praise . It is the two working together that have produced the state of mind to which I referred earlier . Our vocabulary of eulogy is extraordinary . When we praise , for cause , we know no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motion-picture star . No one would dream of advertising a complexion clay without promising you perfect beauty , or a correspondence course in dressmaking without asserting that , in three months , you can make your friends believe that you have imported your clothes from Paris . Every woman knows in her heart that perfect beauty is not to be bought , as she knows that the handiwork of the home dressmaker can be recognized across any room . But it is all part of our hectic optimism . We refuse to believe that anything is inaccessible to us ; we refuse to believe that there is any intangible good ? beauty , or chic , or wisdom ? which we can not acquire by paying a little money for a magic formula . Why " Hollywood " ? Let me quote a few sentences from a recent motion-picture magazine about Charlie Chaplin : " He has made himself king , and , while to he born a Guelph or a Ghibelline , a Hapsburg or a Hohenzollern might be thrilling or a bore , there can be no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all history Mr. Chaplin 's only rival for that distinction is Napoleon , and Napoleon , after all , died leaving plenty of worlds to conquer . Charles Chaplin has completely conquered his world . He is monarch of all who survey him . There is nothing left for him to vanquish. . . r1 , King with no worlds to conquer , it is now clear to him , is indeed an unhappy mortal . .. . Like the rest of the extant kings , he now knows that he shall never be able to know who is his friend . Were he not possessed , as he is , of a sensitive , high-strung nature , still would he never again be able to distinguish the true friend from the fawning sycophant . . . . " And much , much more . " In all history . . . " Our easy superlatives ! This was not an interview , and Mr. Chaplin is not to blame for it . It . is only part of our eulogistic habit . The writer probably knew as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States who would not cross the street to sec Charlie Chaplin in the flesh than there are people who would It does not matter : facts do not . Mr. Chaplin , I fancy , comes nearer than most residents of Hollywood to being " universally beloved , " but the same kind of praise is meted out to many , many others . No woman since Helen of Troy is so beautiful , no woman since St. Catherine of Siena is so good , as practically all the movie actresses are in the magazines . No marriages are so happy , or so cooed over ? until divorce proceedings have been started . Mothers are honored in Hollywood as nowhere else in America ; children are nowhere so adored by their parents . The origins of these people are always romantic ; if they are not , like Charlie Chaplin , children of the slum elevated by sheer genius , they are descended from one of the oldest families in the South . They all work hard , and go to bed at nine o'clock , and , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mille interiors . When you see a new vulgarity reported from Hollywood you feel like exclaiming with the poet : Ah , what avails the sceptre ( ' race , Ah , what the form divine , What every virtue , every grace ? . . When I said that the youth of the country was more menaced by the accounts of Hollywood 's virtues than byany report of its vices , this is what I meant . If Hollywood is the Mecca of thousands of young American men and maidens , it is not because they believe the kind of thing we have been citing , and think that only in Hollywood are so much beauty and virtue met together . It is because they know very well that most of these actors and actresses are very ordinary folk , and that nowhere outside of the motion-picture world does a boy or a girl without education , or breeding , or experience of life , or brains , or any of the things that mean toil and trouble , stand such a good chance of getting both cash and adulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , until he or she has been filmed , knows whether or not he or she will film well . There is always a chance . A stage success means hard work ; success in any other esthetic field means hard work . This , comparatively speaking , does not . I am not so ignorant as to suppose that motion-picture actors do not work very hard while they are producing a. picture ; and it must , too , be work of a nerve-racking kind . But I can think of no other career that comes so near offering the great , American desideratum of earning big money without serving a long and arduous apprenticeship . A man does not expect to succeed in the competitive struggles of the business world without giving years of keen thought and service ; nor is he always rewarded with wealth at the end . No serious artist in any field expects to master his medium save by unremitting toil ; and ? genius apart ? he ' knows that the most brilliant promise flickers out unless it is backed up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But less and less , as a national community , are we willing to sweat for them ; and , on the other hand , less and less are we willing to admit to ourselves that all the rewards are not ours . We are materialistic , as everybody says ; but we are materialistic after the fashion of children ? not so much brutally as foolishly . Our greatest danger lies in believing our own fairy tales , run out to a movie while the dinner perfects itself . Fifteen minutes a day of easy application will make you a desirable dinner-guest at any table in the land . You can learn professional dancing in a few lessons by mail . All you need , in fine , is to give up a little of your spare time ? those moments when you would not be doing anything , anyhow ? to become a Talleyrand , a Madame Recatnier , a successful artist , or a captain of industry . Perhaps some of you remember " Dolly 's Economical Ways . " They succeeded , I believe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the garret and found an antiquated evening coat of father 's , long since discarded . She cut off one of the tails , ripped it open , lined it with pink silk , and had then an opera bag , " not only pretty but , on account of its shape , unique . " No Dolly nowadays , I fear , would be content with uniqueness of just that sort . No periodical nowadays would pay Dolly a salary for suggestions so humble . That there is a brave aspect to this optimism of ours is undeniable . In a practical sense , we could not do better , perhaps , than try for all these alleviations of our lot . An opera bag is not a very important thing ; and there is something rather fine about making an object out of old coat-tails and then making oneself happy by calling it an opera hag . Make-believe often keeps adults happy as well as children . The danger conies when we transfer our make-believe to things of the mind and the spirit . Then , abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the arduous steps necessary to achieving the reality ; therefore we do not get it . But , even as we are content with the semblance of effort , so we are content with the semblance of achievement . We do not want the thing itself so much as we want the reputation of having it . The process is relentlessly logical . First , we wanted all the things that had a prestige value ; then , knowing that they were hard to come by , we took any short-cut that advertised itself ; now , being almost as shrewd as we are sentimental , and realizing uncomfortably that you can not often get something for nothing , we incline to be satisfied if we can convince some one else that we arc what we are not . What the advertisements really promise you is a successful camouflage . And , more and more , we are becoming content with successful camouflage . John Milton told us , long ago , the ultimate truth about prestige values : Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live laborious days ; But the fair guerdon when we hope to find , And think to burst out into sudden blaze , Comes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears , And slits the thin-spun life . " But not the praise , " Phoebus replied , and touched my trembling ears ; " Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil , Nor in the glistering foil Set-off to the world , nor in broad rumour lies ; But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes , And perfect witness of all-judging Jove ; As he pronounces lastly on each deed , Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed . " That , expressed in perfect poetry , is the sense of the sane man concerning fame ? which is reputation writ large . Fame , or the desire for it , may be the last infirmity of noble mind ; it is also what causes a man " to scorn delights and live laborious days . " Otherwise , he would be sporting with Amaryllis in the shade . Earthly fame is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumour " is not to be had , in a sensible society , without living laborious days . Milton obviously disapproved of folk who were content with " broad rumour " alone ; but the folk who expected to get it without living laborious days , he would hardly have understood . That was not a peril against which it would have occurred to him to warn us . If it had , he would have apostrophized us along with the unconscientious clergy as " blind mouths ! "
