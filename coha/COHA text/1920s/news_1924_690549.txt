txt Short range comparisons of steel are apt to be misleading , for they can scarcely escape bringing in the fancy paced rate of production the steels industry attained last March and then promptly lost . That performance was altogether unprecedented and comparisons nowadays should not refer to it , except as to something that one could not reasonably expect to be repeated . A few general comparisons may be helpful . The average rate of steel mill operation , proportionate to the existing capacity from time to time , has been 66% from January 1 , 1919 , to August 1 , 1924 . The rate was down to 40% in the fore part of July and is now around 50% . Thus it has gained one-fourth in a short time and it Is one-fourth below the average of five years and seven months . In the first seven months of this year bookings of fabricated steel contracts represented 68% of the fabricatting shop capacity , precisely the same average as shown by the first seven months of last year . and the past seven months made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month the business seems to be running about two-thirds as heavy . Steel buying continues to increase , and slowly . It could not be expected to increase rapidly . There should be no disappointment that steel prices do not advance , for the uniform experience in the steel market has been that after a dull period prices recede for a time while buying is increasing . There was such a spell from July , 1921 , to March , 1922 . Increased inquiry furnished broader opportunity and incentive for price competition . Shapes and plates have declined $2 a ton in the past week , in harmony with this principle . Sheets have become steadier having , already had a very substantial decline . Pig iron is now showing an advancing tendency .
