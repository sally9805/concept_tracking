txt Captain Sir Hubert Wilkins , the Australian explorer , and Lieutenant Ben Eielson , his American pilot on last April 's airplane flight across the Arctic regions from Alaska to Spitsbergen , received New York 's cordial welcome and warm congratulations on their success yesterday morning upon their arrival on the Norwegian liner Stavangerfjord . The city tug Macom , decked from stem to stern with bright flags , with its siren screaming a welcome and a band playing , took the fliers off the liner at Quarantine and landed them at the Battery to the accompaniment of whistles from river boats and a miniature Niagara from the lofty hoses of the fireboat John Purroy Mitchel . Over them in the harbor circled a Junkers monoplane containing George King , Eielson 's partner in the Alaskan Airways Company , who had come all the way from Alaska to greet him . Eielson recognized King , and waved to him as King 's handkerchief fluttered from the airplane cabin . The plane was piloted by Prod Melchoir .

At the Battery a fair-sized crowd cheered and applauded the fliers. who returned the greeting with doffed hats and smiles . They rode up Broadway to City Hall in an open car , decorated with American and Australian flags , at the head of an automobile *procession , receiving a tribute of respect from those in the street . Entering City Hall to receive official welcome , the fliers were cheered by a crowd of several hundred who had gathered in the plaza . They were greeted on behalf of the city and congratulated for the flight by Acting Mayor Joseph V. , President of the Board of Aldermen , and William P. MacCracken , Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics . D. M. Dow of the Australian Commission in New York also spoke . The fliers responded briefly . Others present at the ceremony in City Hall and at the greeting on the Macom were Vilhjalmur Stefansson , the Arctic explorer ; Dr. Isaiah Bowman , director of the American Geographical Society , scientific sponsor of Sir Hubert in both Arctic and Antarctic expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Sikorsky , airplane builder , and George F. Maud , representing the Mayor 's Committee for the Reception of Distinguished Guests , in the absence of Chairman Grover A. Whalen . Get Hearty Welcome . After the City Hall ceremony the automobile procession , with its motorcycle escort , took the fliers uptown to their headquarters in the Waldorf , and again the people in the streets were able to see them . The reception was nothing like that previously accorded to transatlantic fliers . The crowds were smaller and quieter , and the familiar paper snowstorm did not occur beyond a few flurries of ticker tape and torn paper from buildings near the Battery . Yet the welcome , both official and unofficial , was a hearty one , and the fliers evidently were pleased that New York had a place in its heart for them . They had not expected as big a demonstration as those that had gone before , and the city had not planned the reception on the same scale as past ones . Sir Hubert , who was knighted by King George on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him , showed much interest in his interview with reporters , in talking about his plans for his forthcoming Antarctic expedition . He made it plain that this was not to be regarded in any way as a race with Commander Richard E. Byrd . Although both are to leave on Antarctic expeditions this Autumn , he explained , their objectives are entirely different . Far from competing with Byrd , he went on , he expects to cooperate with him as much as he can by getting together and exchanging views as to their mutual preparations . To Fly in Different Directions . Whereas Commander Byrd intends to fly from the base of the Antarctic Ice Barrier to the South Pole and beyond , and to make side trips by air over the intervening territory to explore part of the high Antarctic plateau , Sir Hubert said he planned to fly in a different direction altogether , skirting the hitherto unexplored edges of the Antarctic continent from Ross Sea to Graham Land , in the hope of finding the most suita- ble location for a meteorological tion . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ber in a boat-Still-to - be selected , ' se. through the- Panama Canal , ? stop a Tasmania , and then go on to Ros Sea . His boat will carry a planeprobably a seaplane  --  which . Will star from - the Ross Sea when ' weathe : conditions-are favorable , most likein ' January . " We will take off-on a trip of 2,30 miles - from Ross Sea ' to - Graham Land , " he continued , " and ? during this trip will , fly over about 1,80 miles that have never been explored . We-:will make observations during the trip , and will come down at Graham Land , when we will return to this country by ' ship , arriving here probably in April or May . ' " Our exploration will be confined entirely to that one flight of about twenty-four hours , in which we will do all our actual work . We will not conflict with Commander Byrd 's . expedition in ? any way . We will be working along the coast , while he will be flying inland to the Pole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pole . Aim of - Expedition . " The purpose of our expedition is to explore the south side of the Pacific Ocean , with a view of locating the best point at ; which to establish a Meteorological station . This will be one : , of a series . of twelve- stations which I hope some day will be establiabed around the Antarctic continent to help forecast world weather conditions for long periods in advance , for the benefit of all primary producers of food and wearing materials and to learn something of the ' upper atmosphere so as to enable airplanes and airships to take advantage of the upper air streams . We already know eleven places in the Antarctic , which are accessible to ordinary means of transportation , where we can locate stations , but ' a twelfth station somewhere . on this unexplored coast line-is necessary to complete the chain .  - -  We-  must have one somewhere south of . the - Pacific Ocean . " After the twelfth location is found- I will try to interest the various Governments in establishing the stations . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international polar weather bureau . The same-thing will be done in the Arctic by  --  the Aero-Arctic Society of Berlin , . which ? hopes to establish thirty-five meteorological stations in the Arctic . Professor Hobbs of the University : of Michigan is already : working on one- in Greenland . " The - development of these Arctic : and Antarctic weather bureaus , however , will bb a long process , ' and we : are looking far into the future for - the " realization of our plans . ' It will be fifteen or twenty years before we " can- expect to be able to make any definite statement as to what we can accomplish . " - Considers Pacific Flight . After his return from the Antarctic , he went on , he might fly from the ' United States to Australia by circumnavigating. the Pacific via the far northern route , making four horisfrom San Francisco : to Seattle , to . Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands , to To ' Ida , to Brisbane . Sir Hubert said that the most important result of his Arctic expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soundings taken last year some 550 miles ' from Point Barrow , Alaska , which showed 17,000 feet , the greatest depth of water known to exist in the Arctic regions . The result of this year 's flight from Point Barrow to Spitsbergen , he went on , . had been ' negative , in that it showed that no ' land existed in a part of the Arctic where some previous explorers had believed . it did . " It gave us the assurance , ' he said , " that there was no land north of Point Barrow on which we might establish a meteorological station . However , the conditions we observed indicated that it might be possible to establish stations on the floating ice , which seemed quite stable and I to be moving only slowly . This is part of the program of the Aero Arctic Society . " He said , in answer to a question , that the most ' hazardous part of this year 's Arctic flight had been the landing at Dead Man 's Island , Spitsbergen , under severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilot had brought the plane down without the slightest damage. - " The plane is in just as fine ? condition as it was when we started , " he added . Complimented on Articles . A reporter for another newspaper complimented Sir Hubert on the article which ' he sent to Tim NEW Yoiuc Trams from Spitsbergen , and asked him to what he attributed his literary skill . The explorer said ' that ; if be wrote well , he attributed it to long association with famous newspaper correspondents ? Sir Philip Gibbs and others  --  dating back to the Balkan War , when Wilkins as a moving picture camera man took the first actual battle movies from an airplane . His first - story to Tian TIMES was specially mentioned . That gave a vivid description of the difficulty he and . Eielson had in getting - their plane off the ice at remote Dead Man 's Island to continue their flight to-Green Harbor , Spitsbergen . Eielson found he could not start the plane until Wilkins got out and twisted . the tail up from the ice. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the , plane - had started , and on one of these attempts he almost wrenched ' - out his ? teeth by clinging with them to a rope hung from the plane . " I wrote that dispatch between 3  --  and 5 o'clock the morning I landed in Green Harbor on scraps of paper that I - found in my hotel room , " Sir Hubert explained , " and handed it to the operator without correction . I did not have time to reread it . " Hands Too Stiff to Hold On . The reason he hung - on to the rope by his teeth , he added , was that his hands were too sti2f from the cold to hold it . He said the plane was traveling , at sixty miles an hour while he dangled by his teeth and tried to throw his ? legs over the fuselage and climb aboard. - Eielson could not see behind from his seat , and each time Wilkins dropped off the pilot had to circle around in the air before he could tell whether Wilkins was aboard or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were safe on the ice , and that they might be able to hold out until ice breakers arrived . He said the ice pack where they probably were might be expected to brea , : . . up at this time of year , but that there was still hope that the men might stay on large enough pieces of ice to remain alive . If Eielson can go with him , the explorer indicated , he wants him to be his pilot on the Antarctic expedition . Lieutenant Eielson explained , however , that he wants to develop an air mail service in Alaska , and intends to file a bid with the Department ofCommerce . If his bid is accepted he will stay there ; otherwise , he probably will go with Wilkins . Before joining Wilkins in 1926 Eielson operated an Alaskan air mail service for a ' time . Fliers Interviewed on Macom , The fliers were interviewed aboard the Macom in a long interval when the welcoming tug was cruising up and down the harbor and the North River , waiting for wireless word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the fliers at City Hall . They were taken aboard the Macom shortly after 8 o'clock , and did not go ashore at the ' Battery until about 10.45 . At the City Hall , Hector Fuller . of the Mayor 's committee , presented the aviators to Acting Mayor in the Mayor 's official reception room . Mr. expressed his pleasure at greeting them and his regret that . Mayor Walker was not present to welcome them . The Mayor left on a . Western trip after the ? Houston convention . Mr. said the city was proud to welcome the explorers and to praise them for having accomplished a wonderful . feat . He said New York particularly liked the modest way they had gone about it , saying nothing until they had done it . Through Sir Hubert he extended New - York 's greetings to Australia , and he told Lieutenant Eielson that the United States was proud of him . Assistant Secretary MacCracken especially welcomed Eielson as " one of our men , " as the pilot is an inspector for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that the association of an Australian ' and an American on the Arctic flight was an example of " how the fraternalism of the air is bringing the nations of the world closer together . " Commissioner Dow for Australia voiced the same thought , saying that he was particularly pleased that an Australian and an American were associated in the flight . Sir ' Hubert replied that he regarded New York 's welcome as " a very great honor . " He agreed with the previous . speakers that aviation was bringing about a " much finer feeling " among the nations and said he hoped his Arctic flight would emphasize the possibility of traversing the Arctic regions by air to decrease the distance between the continents . He . paid tribute to - the American Geographical Society for its support , and . to Stefansson for . his training . Had it not been for the experience in Arctic exploration he had gained under Stefansson , Sir Hubert went on , his Arctic flight would have been very hazardous , but with that experience it was comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year : was an incomparable example of courage in aviation , he continued , becauuse Byrd was not experienced in Arctic ' travel , and would have been subjected to great danger if he had had to land on the ice in making his - way back to civilization . Lieutenant Eielson merely said his experience in the Arctic had convinced him that its climate was not as good as New York 's . ? Last night the fliers attended " The Greenwich Village Follies " at the Winter Garden as the guests of the Mayor 's Committee . They had previously ' attended a dinner of the Ancient and Secret Order of Quiet Birdmen , an aviators ' organization , and about one hundred members of the order also accompanied them to the theatre . During the intermission , the fliers and the official party went back stage and met the members of the cast . Dr. Rockwen , star of the production , drew a caricature of Sir Hubert , and presented it to him on behalf of the cast . Among ' those in the theatre party were Comissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lieutenant Eielson. ' s father ? and brother . Ole and Arthur Eilson . This afternoon they will be guests of the American Geographical Society at a luncheon . Tomorrow at 3 P. M. they will unveil a monument at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory of Commander George W. De Long , U. S. N. , and his crew , who were lost in an Arctice expedition in 1881 . On Thursday they will be guests of International Rotary at a luncheon . Late this week or early next week they will leave New York on an aerial tour of the country in the same airplane in which they flew across the Arctic regions .
