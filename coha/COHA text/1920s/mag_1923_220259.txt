The players of Oberammergau will break a tradition of centuries . One hundred of the principal members of the cast of the Passion Play have signed a contract to appear in America . They are rehearsing now , and with their salaries they keep their village from starvation . The Passion Play last summer was an utter failure financially . <P> Arrangements for the tour were completed by Raymond F. Schindler , George Gordon Battle , Frank Waterman of the fountain pen company , and other New York lawyers and business men . <P> But after three months of negotiation , in which the whole village took part , it was decided to give no portion of the Passion Play in America . The act which the hundred players will perform will be a version of life in the Bavarian village , with especial reference to their woodcarving craft . Thus the tradition of 1644 , a unique relic of medieval piety , is partially saved from the taint of commercialism                  @ @ @
