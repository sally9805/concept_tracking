On the day that the World War Armistice was signed , Nov , 11 , 1918 , gallant Canadian troops took Mons. Recently a Canadian journal , the Port Hope Guide , said scathingly of this action : <P> " There was much waste of human life during the War , enormous loss of lives which should not have taken place . But it is doubtful whether , in any case , there was a more deliberate and useless waste of human life than in the so-called capture of Mons. . . . <P> " It was the last day of the War and the last hour , and almost the last minute , when to glorify the Canadian Headquarters Staff , the Commander-in-Chief conceived the mad idea that it would be a fine thing to say that the Canadians had fired the last shot in the Great War and had captured the last German entrenchments before the bugles sounded 11 o'clock , when the armistice which had been signed by both sides would begin officially . " <P> The onetime Commander-in-Chief thus flayed is General Sir Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since 1920 , the respected civilian Principal of famed McGill University . Last week he was engaged , at Cobourg , Ontario , in suing the Port Hope Guide for $50,000 damages . <P> Although the case will not come up for trial until April 16th , General Currie made public , last week , a quantity of Staff reports which appeared to show that the <P> Canadians had entered Mons at midnight and cleared the Germans out by 4:30 a. m. on Nov , 11 , 1918 , and that the news that the Armistice had been signed did not reach General Currie until 6:45 . <P> Observers doubted whether a jury would award $50,000 in the belief that at the fatal hour of 4:30 a. m. the Canadian Staff was still heavily discounting the fact that the Armistice negotiations had begun 3 days previously , on Nov. 8 , 1918.
