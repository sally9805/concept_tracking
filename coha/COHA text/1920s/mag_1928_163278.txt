With a harp on his back , James McLarnin , 135-lb . Irishman from Los Angeles , stepped through the ropes of a ring at the Polo Grounds , Manhattan , and smiled genially at Lightweight Champion Samuel Mandell . A great shout went up . As is usual in Manhattan , the shout was for the wearer of the harp . Champion Mandell had been too long in retirement to win favor . He came out of his corner to win it now . On the cherubic face of Harp-wearer McLarnin he dropped jabs that soon closed an eye , caused bumps to rise and blood to trickle . Nervy to the last gong , Harp-wearer McLarnin chased Champion Mandell , who beat him backing up , retained the title . This fight had been postponed twice because of rain , and Champion Mandell had to do some last-minute sweating to make the weight when the sky and Promoter Tex Rickard finally agreed .
