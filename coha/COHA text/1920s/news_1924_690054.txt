txt Governor PREUS of Minnesota has n't recovered from his defeat for the Senatorship by MAGNUS JOHNSON . He is still depressed by the vision of " Radicals and disaffected Republicans " in his own State and the Northwest . It is an easy explanation of his misfortune in 1923 to attribute it to " Radicals and disaffected Republicans , " and to attribute that radicalism and disaffection to cheap wheat , agricultural depression , " economic unrest , " and so on . The explanation is a little too simple . Mr. PREUS was a candidate for Governor against MAcrzus JOHNSON in 1922 . As a candidate for Senator the next year he got some 114,000 votes less than he got as nominee for Governor . MAGNUS JOHNSON got 5,000 less . The Democratic vote fell from about 80,000 to 19,000 . It is bard to see any tremendous " radical wave " in this result . Minnesota is no " hotbed of radicalism . " Mr. JOHNSON is a pretty mild sort of Radical . In 1923 a great number of voters kept away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and has been trouble in the Republican Party of Minnesota . Mr. PREUS may be said to have run his canvass on his own hook . Is it not possible or probable that a lot of conservative Republicans were opposed to him ? At any rate , there are old divisions in the Republican Party of Minnesota . They antedate cheap wheat , " economic unrest " and radicalism . None the less , Governor PREus views his - own State and other States with alarm . He looks at Senator I , AFOLLETTE with veneration , as does Senator WALSH of Montana , from a different angle . If Mr. LA FoLLETTE 's health will permit and he wishes to break out of the Republican Party , he can carry six or seven Western States , according to the Minnesota prophet . Even if Mr. LA FOLLETTE 'S health will not permit him " to make a thorough fight , he would carry them anyway . " Presumably Mr. LA FOLLETTE will prefer his position as an independent , technically within the Republican Party , and the holder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious political potentialities are perhaps more impressive if kept vague and not put . to the test . His strength , ' whatever it is , ca n't be transferred to any other third-party candidate . It is personal . Admit that he is going to run ; then there will be trouble which no Republican precaution can avert . Governoi PREUS is too inclined to see black . The recovery of agriculture is a slow process , but there has been effectual improvement in States where , as in Kansas and Iowa , the farmers have learned to look to themselves and not to the Government for the bettering of their faults . The Minnesota Republicans have not learned that . At their State Convention they approved the " principles " of the Haugen-qzmcq#Nary Export Corporation bill . President CoOLIDOE has done what he could for agricultural relief . Governor Pasus admits that neither economic nor political conditions in the wheat belt could be more than " slightly " improved by the passage of " practical and sane legislation " ? If Congress could agree on what that is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only effective legislator on the subject , and I Congress , with the best will and the keenest desire for votes , is powerless to do anything in the matter that would , even if intelligently planned and practicable , justify itself before the elections . Among the candidates for the Republican nomination for Governor of Minnesota is THEODORE CHRISTIANSON , tax reducer . The lowering of State expenditures has been his hobby for years . As Chairman of the Appropriations Committee in last year 's House of the Minnesota Legislature , he fought extravagance , making plenty of enemies , but more friends . The country Republican newspapers gave him a warm welcome . " More TED and Less Taxes " is their cry . He has no gift of rhetoric . He has simply gone up and down the State crying for economy and lower taxes  --  State , county , municipality and township . Tax relief will do more for the farmers than all the legislation passed or proposed for their benefit or all the windy programs of the politicians who hunt for their votes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " disaffection " of Republican farmers has been increased , has sometimes been caused , by the continual growth of taxation . " Lower Taxes " Is a sufficient platform for any candidate .
