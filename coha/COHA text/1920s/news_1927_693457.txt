txt The phrase is that of a Mexican newspaper , the Excelsior . It speaks of the expression of true American sentiment in Congress and in the press which " obliged President COOLIDGE to recede " from his warlike attitude toward Mex " ico . " But it is distance which lends to that view whatlyer enchantment it may have . Near-by observers perceived no such radical change in the policy of the Administration . at Washington . Even those who felt compelled to challenge some of the positions taken by the State Department , and who thought the methods of giving out scrappy and incoherent information about Nicaragua and Mexico were faulty , never imagined that the President was trying to work up a war feeling in this country , least of all to put himself at the head of a war party . CALVIN COOLIDGE can be conceived -f in many roles , but scarcely in that of a military hero . He may have been ill-advised at first ; he may have gone about the affair in Nicaragua bunglingly ; he may not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouse in that country ; but that he was really thinking all the time only of attaining peace by peaceful means only the congenitally incredulous and skeptical will doubt . Nevertheless , the whole story of the interplay of public opinion and official action during the past two weeks is of deep interest . It has a bearing on what might be called unwritten forms of government . The Constitution places the conduct of foreign affairs in the hands of the President . He can not be challenged or questioned in Congress or in a court for any decision that he may see fit to make . If he chooses , he may act upon the maxim , " Get the thing done , and let them howl . " When THEODORE ROOSEVELT was President , he made the phrase a little more biting by telegraphing to Mr : TAFT , who was then Secretary of War , to pay no attention to the " yelling " of Congress and the newspapers . But , of course , no President really does important things in that way . He can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments , which may be big with importance for his country , without seeking in some way to find out what his fellow-countrymen are thinking about , and how far they would be prepared to go in backing up some line of foreign policy which he believes ought to be followed . Whether President Cowman desired or invited such cooperation from the public or not , it is certain that he got it . ' From his own party in Congress and from newspapers which are glad in general to give his Administration hearty support , he received the freest expression of opinion . The gist of it was that our difficulties in Latin America , serious though they confessedly are , were not worth fighting about . There came to be a swelling demand that some other way out be found . Existing agreements to arbitrate international disputes were pitched upon , and a steady pressure from public sentiment to make use of them was applied . Presently we had the Department of State announcing its willingness to arbitrate with Mexico , while the Mexican Government was not long behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in principl% " Thus if there was a crisis in our relations with Mexico , it speedily grew less acute through the process employed . It was in reality the result of a kind of tacit consultation of the country by the President , so that public opinion played its legitimate pat in influencing public policy . One thing that must have swayed the Washington Administration was the evi. dence that its Nicaraguan and Mexican denim-cite had made an unhappy impression abroad . In ' South America and in Europe the critics of America used biting language . No doubt , the President believed that this was unwarranted ; that his purposes were misunderstood . Yet in the ' very fact that foreign opinion about us had gone wrong he may have discovered another reason for so shaping his course as to win back confidence abroad as well as at home . So . that it may be said that if there was to be seen in recent events at Washington a triumph of public opinion , it was world opinion that triumphed . Such is the gain , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind is on the side of peace and positively against war .
