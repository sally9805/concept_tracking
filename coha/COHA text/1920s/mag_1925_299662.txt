Finance Minister Joseph Caillaux appeared , one bright morning last week , before the Finance Commission of the Chamber of Deputies . To the gentlemen present he said that the " balanced " budget devised by his predecessor M. Clementel was in reality short on the credit side some three and a half billion francs . It appeared that M. Clementel was banking on receipts from Germany which had not been received-a favorite French practice-and had neglected altogether a mere matter on the debit side of some $87,500,000 . <P> M. Caillaux made it clear that the budget , which he had revised , would balance without recourse to expectations . He proposed to raise some four billions of francs by : <P> 1 ) A 33% tax increase on tobacco <P> 2 ) An increase ( unspecified ) on the salary tax <P> 3 ) A special measure to force French insurance companies to reinsure with the Government instead of abroad as at present . <P> The French public , which half expected a capital tax or the sale of some colonies , was much relieved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing taxes . <P> He also said that the receipts from Germany would be utilized as follows : two-thirds for reconstruction work , one-third for payment of the U.S. and British debts . There was no possibility , he averred , of improvement in the position of the franc until France 's external debt had been settled . <P> A day later , Premier Paul Painleve announced that negotiations with the U.S. would begin in Paris on June 1 concerning a settlement of the U.S. debt .
