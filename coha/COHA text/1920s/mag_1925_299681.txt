Some 30 years ago , a young girl died of tuberculosis at the Carmelite Monastery of Lisieux , which is on the Paris-Cherbourg railway line . She had written an autobiography-a simple story of her spiritual life . She was credited with saying that " God would permit her to remain on earth until the end of time " ; that she " would spend her Heaven on earth doing good " ; that she would " let fall a shower of roses . " After these things was she forgotten by that great mass-the outside world . <P> Then , the roses began to fall . Her autobiography was read by one person , another and another , until thousands had read it , until it had been translated into most known tongues . <P> Soon letters began to descend upon the Carmelite Monastery at Lisieux . They came first one at a time , then ten , a hundred , a thousand . These letters told of the good that the departed girl-nun was doing in her Heaven on earth . There were stories , attested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles : deadly diseases cured , sinners converted , moral and material help rendered , etc. , etc . Never was such a bed of roses prepared for mankind . <P> In the War , French poilus died with her name on their lips , fought under her banner , prayed to her on the blood-stained Marne , before the rain of steel at Verdun and in the hour of victory . After the War , soldiers went to her grave at Lisieux , covered it with their medals and swords . <P> Her fame swept throughout the world . At Paris , special permission was sought from the Pope to name a church after her-L'Eglise de la Petite Fleur . Welsh Catholics placed their Apostolate of the Faith under her protection . President Cosgrave of the Irish Free State planted the Irish standard before her tomb . The Bishop of Alaska confided his scattered Indians and Eskimos to her charge . A Catholic cathedral in the newest diocese in the U. S.-Monterey-Fresno-is to be built in her honor. *Two years ago , the Pope beatified her ; more than 60,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisieux , 100,000 persons were present ; the Pope sent a Legate and there were no less than three Cardinals , 14 Bishops and 500 Priests . In the past ten years , some million and a half persons have made pilgrimages to her tomb . In short , she is the greatest woman of our times . <P> Who is she ? Sister Therese Martin , one of the nine children of a jeweler of Alencon , a provincial town to the south of Lisieux . At the age of 16 - that was in 1889 - she decided to join the Carmelite Order , but was rejected because of her extreme youth . Taken on a visit to Rome , she threw herself at the feet of Pope Leo XIII , " the greatest of modern Popes , " imploring him to sweep away the barriers which prevented her becoming a nun . <P> His Holiness replied : " If it be God 's will , it shall be done . " It was done . <P> For eight years , Thrse lived with the Carmelite Sisters at Lisieux and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No supernatural acts were credited to her . No weighty theological thesis had flowed from her quill . Outside the Carmel walls her name was unknown .
