Since Professor Michael Idvorsky Pupin of Columbia University , Manhattan , penned his phenomenally popular autobiography , From Immigrant to Inventor ( 1925 ) , the literary world has shared the opinion of many scientists that Professor Pupin is perhaps the greatest living exponent of electromechanics . <P> Last week the Professor , who as a boy arrived at Manhattan in the steerage from Austria-Hungary , lunched at the Manhattan clubrooms of the American Jugoslav Society with M. Pavle Karovitch , Consul at Manhattan for Jugoslavia , a nation which now includes Idvor , the birthplace of Michael Idvorsky Pupin . <P> Since Consul Karovitch will shortly return to Jugoslavia , Professor Pupin addressed to him a warm personal farewell . As he spoke , two red apples and a baseball lay before him on the table . <P> " Friend Karovitch , you are returning to the land where many of us have relatives and all of us have friends . <P> " It is our fondest hope that Heaven and its Holy Trinity will always protect their peaceful homes , their grazing flocks of sheep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden grain , which are now preparing for the merry harvest season . May the happy harvest songs of their busy busy boys and honey-hearted girls soon resound from one end of Jugoslavia to the other , praising the Lord for his abundant harvest blessings . <P> " And now we do not want you to go emptyhanded . Here are two gifts representing the best products of the blessed land of America . <P> " If suitable opportunity is offered , present these two American apples to their gracious Majesties , the King and the Queen of the Serbs , Croats and Slovenes Jugoslavia , to remind them of generous American friendship . <P> " And here is another gift , which please deliver to the little Crown Prince Peter of Jugoslavia . It is an American baseball , a symbol of everything which spells joy and happiness to the heart of the American boy . It will remind the Crown Prince that little American boys love him and love the boys of Jugoslavia. "                @ @ @ @ @
