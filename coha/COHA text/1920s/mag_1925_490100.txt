Notes and Comment IT is now clear that only Brooklyn and Queens can save the Mayor from tragedy on the Ides of September . He holds those boroughs , they say , in the hollow of his head . If they pull him through , it would be a graceful little act to change the name of the regions across the river to Long Hyland . THE publication of the income tax returns panders to the basest form of curiosity . Not only that , but the lists have been so non-alphabetical that it is almost impossible to find anybody 's name . OR own vulgar curiosity goes even farther . What news is left out of a paper to make room for eight pages of pitiless publicity Whistling kings , jacks queens , dumb-bell statements by returning notables , desperate attempts by Swampscott correspondents  --  so far as we can see , we have n't missed a thing .

WHAT will that hotel at 122nd Street which is not to allow drinking , dancing or smoking do with twelve roof gardens ? THE salesmanship shown by the police force in disposing of tickets for Field Day has not only been commendable , but magnificent . And the fact that not once during the drive did we come across any ticket speculators goes to show how firm the police can be in such matters when they set their minds to it . The Week R. MAX D.

Mr. Albert Boni , I learned , plans to convert a lower floor into a little theatre , for which project he has secured ample financial backing from a millionaire , not Mr. Otto Kahn . He has drawn to him , as associate in producing , Mr. George Cronyn , a classmate at Harvard , who has been conducting at the University of Montana a course somewhat like Professor Baker 's late efforts at Cambridge . The upper storks will be turned into apartments , to be rented , if possible , to those having interest in the theatre . Further , there is talk of a restaurant which would attempt to attract a distinguished patronage . At present sentiment inclines to a permanent repertoire company for the theatre . If this is effected , Mr. Jacob Ben-Ami may he recruited , for he is deeply interested , and Mr. De Balta , the impresario . Further , there is Miss Elizabeth Mack , who conducts a school of the theatre in Paris , but who is aching now to make a dramatic invasion of her native land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

A RROWSMITH " goes its golden I1 way towards the one hundred thousand mark , but even its popularity ? not so great as " Main Street , " how ever  --  and the sixty thousand dollars he received for the serial rights to that work have not impaired Mr. Sinclair Lewis 's industry . He has about finished a new novel , although in what magazine it will be printed before book publication is not yet known . The reason for the uncertainty is that the magazine serial rights arc open to all bidders ; the highest takes it . Thus far , three sealed bids have been received and several others are due very shortly . One understands Mr. Lewis 's hesitancy . It is one with the auctioneer 's when he holds suspended the gavel which sounds a sale , reluctant to let it fall lest some higher offer be voiced . Income THE compilation of America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the compilation of the annual Income Tax Return lists  --  disclosed a new force in urban journalism . Efficiency has apparently got its teeth into the reputedly amiable and haphazard business of reporting . I dropped into the Internal Revenue office at Fifty-seventh Street , where most of the Dukes and Earls , not to say a few Princes of the American aristocracy , file their claims to nobility . I do n't know just what I expected the gentlemen of the press to be doing , but there was a hazy notion they would be scrambling and quarreling and killing time over the precious volumes . But it was quite different from that : The leading papers each had a single reporter present . And his job was no more arduous than to sit as foreman over a battery of typists , who were reeling off the lists in expert fashion . The typists , I gathered , were working in shifts : a complete roster of forty young women . And furthermore , carrying the efficiency idea to an incredible peak , the typing apparently was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard one of the foremen-reporters say , " individuals on white paper , corporations on blue . " The paper itself was tricky . Perforated sheets , to be torn into narrow slips , each slip bearing a single name . And at the Times office , I was told sixty more clerks were employed and a special table had been built , equipped with slots lettered A to Z. It was relatively simple to co-ordinate the slips alphabetically , by dropping them into the proper slots . It was thus that we learned all about each other 's business all in a few days . The Times , they said , would print some ninety columns of names , discarding all who paid an income tax of less than $500 . The World was to print every name , if they died for it . While the Herald Tribune struck a medium between the two . The afternoon papers , it would seem , were content with the old-fashioned method , reprinting most of their lists from the morning papers or from a city news association to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no cataclysmic upsets in the peerage . The Fords preserved their dynasty , occupying the top of the list with the obvious title of Imperator . Andrew Mellon retained his rank as Grand Duke , while all the Rockefellers , when the returns were complete , held to their titles as Princes of the Blood . THE one striking elevation in rank which caught my eye was in the case of Cyrus H. K. Curtis , a mere Baron of last year , who presumably by magnificent deeds of derring-do in THE NEW YORKER 5 behalf of his Saturday Evening Post was hoist to the blood royal . His return of $583,872 gives him , past doubt , the right to name himself marquis . The intrepidity of Marquis Cyrus in our ceaseless commercial jousting is worthy of comment , if you are not in a hurry . He sells for a simple niekie a book which costs him to produce twenty-eight cents the copy , or which did , at any rate , a year or two ago . I rely upon the statement of Mr. Edward Bok for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper and printing he sells for five cents . Once it was proposed to him that he hike the fee to a dime , and spend a couple of million in advertising to salve over the hurt to this vast nation 's pocketbook . " Not so , " exclaimed Mr. Curtis . " Our best advertising , indeed , is the very fact that we charge only a nickel . Have n't you heard them marvel , standing beside the newsstands , ' All that for a nickler ? " Figure out for yourself , if you are that curious , the value of advertising in a week 's issue . ? SOMEWHAT familiar silence story from Swampscott : " Do you wish to say anything about prohibition ? " asked a journalist of Mr. Coolidge . " No . " " About the coal strike ? " " No . " " About the world court ? " The newspaper man turned to go . " By the way , " added Mr. Coolidge , " do n't quote me . " Origin FOR Mr. William Ran dolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned virtues , one of which is his deeply sentimental regard for his mother , while she was alive , and for her memory now . Before the Governor 's mother died , during his first term in the Executive Mansion , the Hearst newspapers opened a heavy offensive upon Mr. Smith , Among other things was printed a cartoon in the Evening Journal , depicting the Governor as an ogre , snatching milk from the thin lips of woefully anaemic babies . As a public man used to the amenities of journalism , Mr. Smith was unmoved when first he saw it , but the afternoon the cartoon appeared was chosen by the Governor for a visit to his mother , in Brooklyn . He found the old lady wracked by sobs and at her feet he saw the reason for her tears , the Journal 's virulent cartoon . An old friend of Mr. Smith tells me that his bitter and undying political enmity for Mr. Hearst was born that afternoon .

This will be it , then , and the gentleman awarded the distinction of central character will he Bill Nye . Mr. Nye was giving a reading to a crowded house when , during a pause , a voice called from the balcony , " Louder . " " Why do n't you pay more and come down where you can hear ? " demanded Mr. Nye . " Because it is n't worth it . " Titles SS OME of those who journeyed to Atlantic City for an earlier view of " The Green Hat " commented on the scantiness of the stage version as compared with the book . For such sensitive souls , a shock is in waiting when " These Charming People " tread the boards .

The play concerns an elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of these is a SheImerdyne , or a Tarlyon . Indeed , the comedy originally was entitled , " Dear Father , " and as such was offered first to a producer , other than Mr. Charles Dillingham , who decided not to present it though his staff advised acceptance of the work . It was Mr. Dillingham who saw the advantage that would accrue from such a title as " These Charming People , " and it was he who suggested the change . Further , it is to him that the engagement of Mr. Cyril Maude for the comedy should be credited . Custom PEOPLE apparently go to Canada chiefly for one reason these days , and when they return , naturally , they try to bring some back with them . This involves difficulties with government inspectors which are not , however , insuperable , as witness : Twn gentlemen whose compartment was stacked high with case goods , wandered back to the observation platform as the time for the border search drew near . Before leaving their compartment they were careful to place a fifty-dollar bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspectors to forget that such a man as Mr. Volstead ever had lived . The federal search progressed , and presently a loud voice was heard calling in the observation car , " Who 's got Compartment Z , Car Two ? " Fear seized the guilty pair . Arrest , imprisonment , disgrace  --  all the tremors of innocence assailed them . But at last they acknowledged possession . " Come with me , " commanded the inspector . Dejectedly they followed , in a silence that held until they reached a vestibule between cars . Then the inspector spoke . " The tightwad next door did n't leave anything , " he informed the trembling pair , " so we put his five cases in your compartment . Good luck to you . " MR . DAVID H.

" Price THE train pulled into the South Norwalk , Connecticut , station and the passengers dismounted , hurrying towards the taxi stand , where waited , apprehensively , a meek , lowly , battered Chevrolet touring car , The taxi starter met the arrivals in order . To the first , a somewhat dapper clerk , he explained that he might ride in the only vehicle available at the moment , or wait a few seconds for a more lordly and comfortable sedan . The clerk , disdainful of the shabby automobile , chose to wait . To the second arrival at his stand , the taxi starter made the same proposal . " Fine ! " said this burly , fleshy individual . And the meek Chevrolet bobbed under his weight as he clambered into the rear seat . The motor groaned loudly and away clattered the puny touring car , bearing to Hickory Bluff , his huge estate near Darien , Mr. James Farrell , president of the U. S.

Which is , those sprightly comments on people in the day 's news and the " Follies ' " audience were not always so impromptu as they seemed . In other words , Mr. Rogers knew they were there even before he went on the stage ; and he knew where to look for the celebrities when he did face the footlights . A certain row in the New Amsterdam Theatre is reserved each night for Mr. Ziegfeld 's personal guests among whom the press agent for the " Fol ties " makes sure to include , by invitation , well known persons at the moment in the public eye .

That was the ship which crumpled into flames above the Humber . It was the plan then to build another such ship and divide possession of it between the army and the navy , six months to each service during the year . The army board returned from England .
