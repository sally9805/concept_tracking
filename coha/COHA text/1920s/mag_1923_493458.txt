body could beat such a combination ? even Nicholas Murray Butler . It is plain that Murphy 's pro ? posal conceals ulterior designs of some importance . IF Governor Pinchot were absolute Tsar of Penn ? sylvania he could make rapid progress toward a settlement of the problem of anthracite coal . He could reduce the operators to submission by the threat of taxing the unearned increment out of their holdings . He is not Tsar , but a democratic executive narrowly limited in what he can do by a legislature very far from sympathetic with the whole of his program of reform . The same is true of the governors of the coal using states . If they were Tsars they could go far toward con ? trolling the price of coal through regulating the dealers . They are rendered impotent by the feeble ? ness of their legislative control . And so they try to save their faces by passing the buck . In the meantime the consumer is heavily mulcted and the coal operators and distributors wax fat and im ? pudent . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinchot accomplishes nothing else , at least he is arousing the people to an acute sense of the outrages practiced upon them . Sooner or later they will drive the legislatures to action . JUDGE MORROW of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals has made himself famous over night by a California decision which , if it is sus ? tained in the United States Supreme Court , will put an end forever to trade unions in the land of the climate and the home of the booster . Section 697 of the penal code of California forbids em ? ployers to use coercion or . compulsion in making employees agree not to join labor unions . Judge Morrow has declared this law invalid and has en ? joined the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers from organizing non-union workers of the Pacific Electric Railway , holding that the statute in ques ? tion is repugnant to the " due process " clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Press dispatches state that Judge Morrow reviewed the war-time activi ? ties of strikers and declared that union labor has , because of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pending study of the full text of the decision , we refuse to believe that a federal judge could seriously employ such an argument ? ment as this ; but in any case the decision as it stands turns back the clock of progress a full cen ? tury , and leaves the individual worker at the mercy of his employer . Being a hundred years behind the times is a condition which would hardly be noticeable in the California of today ; but other parts of the country are certain to protest against this revival of eighteenth century " morality . " SWITZERLAND seems to have invented a new version of the unwritten law . It is all right to murder a representative of the Russian govern ? ment , it seems , provided you can show that you do n't approve of Bolshevism and provided some of the jury agree with you . Maurice Conradi , who shot down Vorovsky , representative of the Soviet government at the second Lausanne Conference , has just been acquitted under a " plea of provoca ? tion " after a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alleged practices of the Russian government at home . Five of Conradi 's nine jurors wanted to convict him of the crime of which he was admittedly guilty ; but the other four seemed to have a general feeling that assassination is only a minor peccadillo when its victim belongs to a political faith you do n't approve of , and es ? pecially if he is a foreigner . This is not a new doctrine ; but it seems somewhat surprising to find it turning up in a country so supposedly devoted to law and order as Switzerland . There is discontent abroad in the land ; there is threatened disintegration in the Republican party . The discontent and party difficulties arise not because of pop ? ular government but from the lack of it . . . . Reaction and progress must fight it out again in the Republican party in the coming presidential primaries . I question not men now but their philosophy of government . That which obtains at Washington does not fit present-day needs . Ultra-conservatism thus rules , progressivism challenges it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a party representing alone its rank and file , the instrument neither of static reaction nor de ? structive radicalism . Only such a party with the broad understanding , vision and human sympathy of progres ? sivism can solve our present day domestic problems . HIRAM JOHNSON has announced his can ? didacy for the Republican presidential nomi ? nation in a statement of which the preceding quotation contains the essential matter . Progres ? sives , no matter whether they are or are not Re ? publicans , will welcome the announcement . Un ? der existing conditions it would be a confession of weakness on the part of the Republican party to consent to President Coolidge 's nomination without a sharp contest . The President himself has as yet done nothing either to deserve or not to deserve a testimonial of confidence ; but he represents , as did his predecessor , the conservative wing of his party and he inherits from Mr. Harding a heavy burden of failure and disappointment . Since March , 1921 , the American people have become increasingly discontented and restless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was costly to all classes but from which some classes and some sections suffered much more severely than others . They attribute much of this to tell his fellow countrymen more of what he pro ? poses to do after they elect him to the presidency . The discontent which he seeks to capitalize is as ? sociated with living grievances which demand some indication of specific remedies . The specific remedies will not be easy to formu late . There is no progressive program at the pres ? ent time which is capable of uniting as many of the discontented in its support as did the Progres ? sive platform of 1912 . Senator Johnson is reluctant to specify what progressivism means in relation to domestic policy for one very good reason . He is campaigning for support in all parts of the country , and he knows that a railroad , a taxation , an agrarian or a labor policy which would help his candidacy in some states would injure it in others . He is afraid to choose and to risk his candidacy on the success of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not choose quickly and successfully , other progressive candidates in different parts of the country will by means of appeals to local griev ? ances take delegates away from him . This brings us to the real question raised by his candidascy . Is he sufficiently able , enlightened and convinced to put together a platform which will dramatize and focus the prevailing discontent and qualify the pro ? gressivism of 1924 to be concrete , militant and specific without ceasing to be national in its appeal ? SECRETARY MELLON 'S letter proposing a reduction of $323,000,000 in taxes is so straightforward and full of so much common sense that it upsets completely the devious plans of our politicians . The taxpayer looks at the finance minister 's revised schedule and sees that his income taxes are cut practically in half . This holds whether his income be four thousand dollars , ten thousand , or ten million . A protest against such a program dies as a gurgle in one 's throat without ever coming to vocal utterance . In the year which ended on June ' 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? 007,000,000 . Its ordinary expenditures were $3 , - 295,000,000 . This left a surplus of $712,000 , . - 000 . With this surplus Secretary Mellon paid $614,000,000 of debts , and added $98,000,000 to the balance in the general fund of the Treasury . These are figures which any one can understand , and they speak well for Mr. Mellon 's administra ? tion . During the twelye months which ended Sep ? tember 3o , 1923 , the results were even more favor ? able . The ordinary receipts of the government amounted to $4,102,000,000 , and the disburse ? ments to $3,250,000,000 . Out of the surplus of $852,000,000 the Treasury cancelled $686,000,000 of debts and added $166,000,000 to the net bal ? ance in the Treasury . During the present calendar year the collections of the Treasury will amount to almost exactly $4,100,000,000 . Of this amount $3,400,000,000 will come from customs duties and taxes , as fol ? lows : The remaining seven hundred million comes from miscellaneous receipts . Almost two hundred andfifty million of it will come from payments of principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come from the sale of surplus property ; and about one hundred million from estate taxes , or inheritance taxes , as they are popularly termed . Of the income taxes collected this year , about eight hundred million will be paid by corporations and one billion by individuals . The receipts from every class of taxes enumerated above have been higher so far this fiscal year than they were in the corresponding period a year ago . If the present schedule of taxes and rates were left in force , the tax collections for the calendar year 1924 would be at least $3,600,000,000 , and might well run several hundred million more than this . This , to ? gether with the miscellaneous receipts , would bring total receipts to $4,300,000,000 . If the present tendency to reduce expenditures were continued , it would be possible to reduce the national debt by more than a billion dollars next year . But Secretary Mellon knows that a revenue sur ? plus of more than a billion dollars will not be al ? lowed to go for debt cancellation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political sop in the form of a bonus would call for an appropriation bill adequate to wipe out the surplus and more too . Secretary Mellon evident ? ly believes that the Republican party has more to gain by avoiding the disastrous experience of 1892 than by distributing bonus lollypops at this time . For surely any bonus that has as yet been proposed , or any that is at all likely to be provided by Con- , gress , can be considered as nothing more than a sop to the men who risked their lives in the trenches . It is an insult for those of us who re ? mained at home to pretend that we are discharging our obligations to these men by paying them a few hundred dollars . From the standpoint of broad financial states ? manship , Secretary Mellon 's proposal to reduce the surplus by lowering taxes is a sound one . If Con ? congress could be trusted to leave the surplus to be applied to the cancellation of our public debt , that would probably be the more desirable course . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
