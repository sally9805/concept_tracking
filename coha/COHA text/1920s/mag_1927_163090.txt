Last week Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York , golfing on the Greenbrier course at White Sulphur Springs , W. Va. , drove so vigorously , * approached so deftly and putted so accurately as to complete 18 holes in 83 strokes . His score would have given pride to many a golfer whose game was not handicapped by the fact that the player was also a governor . Many a hole was made in par . Enthusiastic cameramen , having pictured the Governor golfing , wished him to pose clutching a tennis racquet , bestriding a horse , pitching quoits . No tennis-player , no horseman , no quoiter , the Governor refused thus to be photographed under false pretences . <P> *He made a 150-yard carry over a water hazard .
