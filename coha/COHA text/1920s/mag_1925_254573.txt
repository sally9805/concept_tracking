Ever since the auto bus began to be developed as a serious competitor of railroad and traction companies , there has been a vivid interest in Wall Street in Mack Trucks , Inc . Earnings on the stock have been sensational , and prices for it have soared on the anticipation that soon a big " melon " would be split for the special benefit of the shareholders . <P> The Company , however , has needed money development too much for this . Last August the stockholders were permitted to subscribe to one new share for every five shares held , at $80 per share , thus increasing the outstanding common stock from 283,110 to 339,732 shares . Incidentally , at present prices every share purchased at $80 shows a profit of over $100 . <P> Recently , the Company decided to own its service stations and thus be able to give service on its products during their entire life . A subsidiary called the Mack Trucks Realty Co. was therefore organized . It will be financed by a $3,000,000 serial 6% note issue . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accordingly , all stockholders of record July 20 will be given the privilege of subscribing to one new share of common for every five shares held , at $100 a share . With the stock already selling at $184 a share , this means that the new " rights " are worth $14 a share on each old share-a handsome return to shareholders . This financing will bring about $7,500,000 of fresh capital into the Company , and increase the outstanding common shares from 339,732 to 407,678.
