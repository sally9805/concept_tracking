New York City exercised ingenuity last week in diphtheria prevention work . At the suggestion of its Diphtheria Prevention Commission ( Morgan Partner Thomas William Lament , president ) , Health Commissioner Shirley W. Wynne borrowed a half-dozen trucks from the street cleaning department , cleaned them , placarded them with warnings against diphtheria , and advice to use toxin-antitoxins . Aboard each car he loaded a doctor , two nurses and a refrigerator full of toxin-antitoxin . Then these " healthmobiles " rolled forth among the city 's millions like itinerant waffle carts . Spectacular , convenient , they " sold " the idea of preparing in July for winter 's diphtheria , administered great numbers of immunizing doses , all gratis . <P> Diphtheria is an acute communicable disease of childhood . Bacilli breed in the throat , cause grey patches to form there , sometimes produce growth of false membranes which block the breathing . <P> Until 1894 there was no exact method of curing diphtheria . That year the German , Emil A. von Behring , progressing along research lines which Louis Pasteur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diphtheria germ gave out stimulated , if injected into an animal , antitoxins in the animal 's blood . Such antitoxins , injected into an active case of diphtheria , counteracted the effects of the toxins , cured the disease . <P> Later Dr. Theobald Smith , of the Rockefeller Institute , found that if a little diphtheria toxin were added to antitoxin the mixture would immunize animals against the disease . At once Dr. William Hallock Park , director of New York City 's health department laboratories , and his associate , the late Dr. Abraham Zingher , began to immunize children with the toxin-antitoxin mixture . That mixture is what the " healthmobiles " were administering last week . Three to six months are necessary before immunity is established .
