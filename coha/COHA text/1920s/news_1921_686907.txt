txt A vivid and terrible account of famine conditions was published in Moscow today by a writer named Irenitskin , who has just visited the worst . sections in the Samara Government in the automobile of M. Kalenine , President of the Famine Relief Committee . Under the headline " Living Death . " he tells of the inhabitants , of two villages he visited trying vainly to fight the slow agony of hunger by eating a horrible green mixture - of weeds and leaves , or yellow cakes whose principal component is clay , or by scouring the fields in search of scraps of carrion . . He writes : . ? automobile is jolting across the wide Samara prairie . All around is wilderness and desolation . Here and there are bones of dead horses , with the frayed remnants of skin adhering . Rarely . we pass furrows of black earth , and occasionally a peasant still working the fields with a team to prove that the land our people hold so dear has not been entirely abandoned . We meet , too , little flocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastures that will feed them no longer . " Our- goal is two villages , VysoVigai and Sukhayavyasovka , whose population , according to the official report of the Samara : Government , is literally . dying by inches . Now we are approaching Vysovigai  --  black barns and thatched huts surrdittided by meagre gardens .. Men and women glance at the automobile with dully curious . eyes , and children appear in doorways- to see us . " At the headquarters of the local Soviet we are . greeted by the President , . a tall , burly peasant , whose face grows , purple with excitement at the sight of the distinguished visitor , for M. Kalenine 's arrival was unexpected . Woman 's Story of Conditions . " We would have rung the , bell to announce your , coming , ' he say 's , ' but ow- , ing to the separation of Church , and State we must first ask the permission of the Church Soviet . ' " While Kalenine is discussing tile situation with him and the affair of the bell is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a few steps I am accosted by a talkative old woman . " ' People wo n't gather quickly , ' she began . ' They are out gleaning the fields . Formerly the gleaners used to get up to ? 5- a day , but now the fields are stripped bare . We are eating pigweed , wild oats clay and sunflowe heads . It burns your insides , your stomach swells and then you die . For the sake of Mary , Queen of Heaven , do n't let us all die of hunger . " ' Yesterday they buried two children . Their father collected some bits of carrion in the fields and gave it to them , but they got worse and died . We 've eaten everything . The cattle have been cut up and eaten , the last scraps of bread are gone and the mothers ' hearts are being wrung by the cries of children for whom there is nothing  --  nothing . In the fields our mother rye blackened and died before our eyes . ' we cut up the weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now even the grass is dying . Oh the red sun , - what misery is ours ! ' she exclaims as she crosses herself toward the fiery globe in the West . " ' It is a living death , ' she continues . ' One walks as if always going up hill , and the legs refuse to move under one . ' " She begins weeping noisily , and t ! e deep rote of the bell rings out like a death knell overhead . " My attention is attracted to a.young woman , almost a girl , who is staggering along from fence to . fence , holding to the rails . " This is Agra.ppena . Her . husband is working in Tashkent , ' my companion sr ys . Dizzy from Starvation . " I shake her hand . She raises a lined and hollow face . Her eyes are puffy like those of an old man . This girl is 19 . " ' What 's the matter ? ' I ask . Ste doesn't. answer , but stares blankly as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , ' she says , suddenly , in a matter-of-fact voice , in which there is no note of complaint . " ' ' I ' , 311 him all about it . ' says the old woman . It 's going round , going round , ' the girl repeats drowsily . ' I keep falling down I ca n't walk ' at all . ' " Gradually a crowd ' of women and children was surrounding us . Seeing that I was writing in a notebook , they begin to implore me to put down their names also . My companion explains that ani a newspaper man , but they do n't believe her . " ' Write my name , ' cries one ; ' Helen Grebenkin , husband away a year at war in the Red Army and no news of him . I 've sold all our clothes and my child is living on grass and water . ' " Write me , little father , ' breaks in another . ' ' Last : Winter we had six horses . two cows and twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speck of dust left in the house and there are eleven of us to be fed . ? ? We sowed fifteen acres , but did n't reap a single ear . The locusts ate all it . ' ? " ' Comrade , at least write my child , ' came r. pleading voice . ' We ground but 35 pounds of barley from three . acres . That was all and it 's gone . ' The women thrust forward a little girl , 3 or 4 years old , wearing a ragged shirt that showed her bare shoulders . which suddenly she bites ' greedily . I shudder- and am sickened as she gobbles it . There 's Paskovia , ' cries the old woman who first joined me , as through the crowd comes a woman with a youngish face , strong and- proud , and a calm baby in her arms and another child tugging at her skirt . " ' Come to my hut , ' she says , ' and see how we live  --  our only food is pigweed and raw pumpkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a I clean hut smelling of dried grass . On the floor there are pieces of cucumber rind . " The children picked that up on the road , ' says the ' woman . ' I told them not to , but they still do it . Their tummies hurt so ; they 're so : hungry . I took them to the orphanage , but they ca n't take them there . As we were coming back they cried , " Mama , mama , we 're so hungry . Are we going to die ? ' " ' I looked at the children . Their poor pinched faces were as fine as their i mother 's  --  splendid stock . ' Anyway , we  --  will freeze in the Winter . ' Paskovia continues . We exchanged all our wood for milk . We had four little sheep ; but they 're gone and we 've sold everything down to the last empty boxes . Even the cat is dead . It , spun round and round , then jumped in the air and died . What shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she sat there , brave and tight-lipped , that my heart well nigh burst at the thought that such as these must die . " By now the bell had summoned a crowd from the fields and Kalenine was already addressing them . Why should I say more ; it is everywhere the same picture . It is not a newspaper ' horror . ' but in the very truth the Samara : region is dying quietly and unsensationally . Those who had the money fled , to wander hopelessly along the Volga piers or the railroad depots of towns . Many such are returning to their home villages  --  to die . So there 's no crying aloud nor cursing , no murmur of revolt , but they all say it is a living death . ' " As we drove away a woman 's voice was raised , sobbing from the midst of the respectful crowd , ' Take us away , comrades , take us away , for we are dying . ' " LONDON . Aug . U. ?

" Write her . down , comrade , or she will die , for already we are eating grass like horses , ' her mother insisted . " The child is a skeleton , with . hollow cheeks , fever-bright eybs and arms and legs llkei stalks of fennel . Under the little shirt . a swollen stomach sticks out as big ' as a ripe melon . I touch her flesh , which is as hard as stone . It feels smooth and slippery and ' Is covered with a network of blue veins . The child is as still as a tiny corpse dragged out of its coffin .
