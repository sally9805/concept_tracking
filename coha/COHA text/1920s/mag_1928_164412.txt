Three British statesmen were terrestrially in motion , last week , in the furtherance of their several missions : <P> Sir Austen Chamberlain , the British Foreign Secretary , journeyed to The Hague and settled down for a fortnight 's visit as the house guest of U. S. Minister to the Netherlands Richard Montgomery Tobin . Presently Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands bade Sir Austen to come and take dinner at the unpretentious , neatly painted mansion which serves as Her Majesty 's palace . Placid Dutch courtiers admitted that Crown Princess Juliana , 19 , is beginning to ponder whether she should take as a useful consort one of the British King-Emperor 's younger sons : Prince Henry , 28 , or Prince George , 25 . <P> The Earl of Birkenhead , Secretary of State for India , set out from London for Berlin with Baron Ashfield , famed London subway and omnibus tycoon . A suspicious circumstance was that both peers stated that their mission would be to play many a round of golf-in Germany of all places . <P> Before quitting London the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address to the famed Authors ' Club on the subject : " Women 's Position in Literature . " Said scathing Lord Birkenhead : " . . . Women have no position in literature . " <P> Sir John Simon returned to London from India last week . He is the great Liberal barrister who is Chairman of the Indian Statutory Commission ( TIME , Jan. 9 et seq . ) . The Seven Wise Commissioners have now completed their first visit to India , a visit which has been punctuated by numerous riots and demonstrations against them . Their mission is to recommend , after much further study , what additional measure of sovereignty shall be extended to Indians . Last week Sir John struck a significant keynote when he said : " The Commission will recommend no sweeping changes in the Indian form of Government . The Indian people are not yet ready for a large measure of independence , but we will suggest many minor changes in order to encourage them to govern themselves . " <P> He added : " Two months in India do n't qualify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown us the complexity and the multitude of Indian problems . Each province , in fact , has its own difficulties and their solution will not be found in a repetition of vague generalities . India is the real meeting ground of the East and West .
