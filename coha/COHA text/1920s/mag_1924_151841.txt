At the Oak Tennis Club , Larchmont , N. Y. , William T. Tilden , II , tennis champion , engaged in a " circus " match , " did wizard tricks with his racquet and ball . " <P> In a singles match he " toyed " with Harold Throckmorton , 6-1 , 6-2 . When things grew dull , or when Throckmorton strove a little too valiantly , Tilden let loose a few fast ones that made Jove and his thunder look like a slow-ball pitcher . <P> But the " circus " came to town when " Bad Bill , " playing double courts , took on Throckmorton and Voshell , also playing double courts . He beat them in a one-set match 7-5 . <P> At the close of the day , which had been cold , wet and continually disagreeable , Tilden and Frederick Baggs went down to defeat before Throckmorton and Voshell , 6-4 , 6-4.
