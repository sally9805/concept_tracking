Men have heretofore been the chief concern of pious , strapping Marshal Feng Yu-Hsiang , who keeps a private army of 150,000 stalwart soldiers , each trained in some peacetime trade as well as in war . Last week , however , the Marshal bent his thoughts on women . At Kaifeng , the capital of Honan province , he opened the Chinese Institute for Women , a school constructed at his private cost , " to teach the principles of social welfare and government . " <P> Addressing a meek little group of Chinawomen , the first recipients of his educational bounty , Marshal Feng declared last week at the inaugural ceremonies : <P> " When we compare such women as we have in China with the great women of the West , I do not wonder that our women fail to get equal treatment with men . . . . I regret the need of pointing out the weakness of our women-some of whom care more for face powder , perfumes and jewelry than for the welfare of their country-yet the willingness of many to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " roared the six-foot Marshal at the trembling Chinawomen , " you shall learn ! In fact I am looking forward to the day when you ladies will surpass the achievements of our Western sisters Madame Curie and Madame Kollontay . " <P> Though few Western women will hesitate to yield place to the discoverer of radium , many will be vexed that Marshal Feng passed them over to single out for praise Mme. Alexandra Kollontay , one-time Ambassadress of Soviet Russia to Mexico , now Soviet Ministress to Norway , tireless exponent of Bolshevism.
