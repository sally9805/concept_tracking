Smug Broadwayfarers learned last week that the shoguns of the show world , principally the Brothers Shubert , Albert Herman Woods , William A. Brady , Arthur Hammerstein , had bickered among themselves , had dickered with one David R. Hochreich , president of Vocafilm Corporation of America , makers of a talking picture device that theretofore had been obscured by Movietone ( parade music , gunfire ) and by Vitaphone ( Ben Bernie , tapdancing , Frances Williams ) . Unofficially , the newspapers said that Hochreich and the theatre shoguns had made a deal : Hochreich to receive money , the producers the rights to his invention . <P> Many a movie man smiled ; it was a moral victory for the motion picture over the stage . The " legits " had been forced to fight the cinema with weapons that the cinemagnates introduced . But no smile twisted the cheeks of the more astute picturemen . To these wiser ones the action of the stagemen seemed a threat . The Brothers Shubert alone own , control or have easy access to more than 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en masse are Hammerstein , Brady , Woods , lesser lights . The Vocafilm reputedly costs less to install than does Movietone , Vitaphone . Further , cinemagnates recalled that the popularity of " talkies , " particularly Vitaphone , was due largely to ability to present to audiences in Pottsville , Pa. , or Missoula , Mont. , stage stars who otherwise would not be heard and seen in such towns . A report that the autumn hits will be Voca-filmed , distributed among controlled theatres near and far , to run contemporaneously with the successful pieces , was not denied . <P> Of salaries to be paid legitimate actors , nothing was printed . Rumor said performers would be paid flat sums for Vocafilm recording as now is done by Vitaphone , Movietone . Satisfactory terms , sufficient to prevent the stage stars being lured to the movies , surely would be arranged . Few artists , no hams , can wage private salary war against a **31;10767;TOOLONG combination .                    @
