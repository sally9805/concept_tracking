L. 0 , As you no doubt realize , the price of nickel is quite low and this militates against International Nickel 's profits . However , we understand that the low price is resulting in many new uses of nickel and'that demand for Monet metal is steadily increasing , being larger than ever before . Use of nickel in special steel 's id showing favorable upward trend and new uses of the metal are pronzising in a reasonable length of time to replace the drop in consumption that resulted from curtailment of armament expenditures throughout the world .

Capitalizing the goodwill or other intangible assets of the partnership does not subject it to tax as that , too , is not realized taxable income . The partnership as the equation now is , is not subject to tax in either instance .. In the event that the partneaship were to incorporate , the increase in value of the assets and the creation of a capital asset out of goodwill would enter into computation of the capital stock tax to which corporations . are liable , but as this does not appear to be contemplated the ?
