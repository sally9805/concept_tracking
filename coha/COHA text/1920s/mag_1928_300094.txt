Though Queen-Empress Mary must display impartial interest in hundreds of nursing homes , some intrigue her more than others . Particularly is Her Majesty known to approve of a certain super-spick-and-span nursing home in Berkshire . <P> Just before the Court left for Scotland Her Majesty motored out from Windsor Castle , quite unaccompanied except by her chauffeur , for a visit to the Berkshire nursing home . What happened next became a secret which has been weeks in leaking out . <P> Alighting from her limousine Queen Mary climbed the stoop , pressed the bell . She waited some time , for a new , slow and surly Cockney wench had just been taken into service by the home . <P> " Well ! " said the wench , opening the door two inches , " what name ? " <P> Queen-Empress Mary , imperturbable , replied : " Tell matron the Queen has called . " <P> " Go on ! " snapped the surly Cockney , " Do n't yer get pokin ' fun at me ! W'ot 's yer real monniker ? " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , her chauffeur came bounding two steps at a time , and uttered curt words which carried conviction to the Cockney wench . <P> Though Edward of Wales often goes about unrecognized , and although Motorist George V has had several encounters with stupid traffic policemen , London editors could not recall that Queen Mary has ever before escaped recognition or suffered pert speech from one of her female subjects .
