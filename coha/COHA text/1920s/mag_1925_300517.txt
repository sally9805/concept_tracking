Two thousand excited young men and women ( from 245 institutions of learning ) , all of whom had heard that there is a World Court at The Hague , assembled last week at Princeton University to attend a National Collegiate World Court Conference , which had been convoked there very largely on the strength of a report that a famed Chicago shirtsleeve-barrister , Clarence Darrow , would address the gathering . <P> While everyone waited for Mr. Darrow to tear the Court to tatters , U. S. Senator Irvine L. Lenroot of Wisconsin , affirmative speaker , broached the subject , in part as follows : <P> " There are only four methods of settling disputes when diplomacy has been exhausted : by resort to the League of Nations of those states that are members of the League , by resort to arbitration , by resort to the World Court , by war . Resort to war by weak nations is impossible . . . . <P> " You may ask if we adhere to the Court what objections will be imposed upon us . I answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the expenses of the Court , which will amount to about $35,000 a year . <P> " Next , you may ask what benefits will we receive if we adhere to the Court . Frankly , I answer none , except as we are interested in the peace of the world . " <P> Lawyer Darrow then adjusted his thumbs for battle , in the armholes of his vest , and twitted Senator Lenroot as follows , for having grown tedious at one point , anent the Court 's organization : <P> " I would have been pleased to have heard from my distinguished friend more of a discussion of what this World Court was going to do . I gathered from it that the principal part of it related to the method of the appointment of the judges and the payment of their salaries . If it is not to stop war , if it will not stop war , or has any tendency to end war and if we will not be bound by anything it does , in case we go in , I wonder what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the youth of America to get all ' het up ' over it . " <P> To many the pungent Darrowesque phrases seemed often melodramatic and irrelevant . Mr. Lewis Fox ( Princeton , 1926 ) , originator of the conference idea , was able to point to an almost unanimous pro-Court vote at its close .
