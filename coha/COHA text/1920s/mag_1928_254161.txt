Van Lear Black* famed as the U. S. businessman who has taxied by air the largest number of miles , last fortnight gave up temporarily his most extensive taxi-tour . With one valet , two Dutch pilots and a sturdy triple-engined Fokker Jupiter plane , he set out a month ago to tour the world . No Jules Verne hero , he intended to break no record of speed , altitude , distance or endurance . He would go in a leisurely way from Croydon Airdrome , England , to Tokyo , and back , with sundry detours about the Mediterranean coast , in South Africa , and Mesopotamia-a matter of 40,000 miles in all . A broken wing and damaged engine forced him back to London , to wait for a new plane to be built . A luxurious traveler , in any case , Van Lear Black retreated from Khartum , Egypt , by special train . <P> <P> * TIME , March 5 , referred to Van Lear Black as the British born " owner of the Baltimore Sun papers , purser of a blockade-running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea and air .
