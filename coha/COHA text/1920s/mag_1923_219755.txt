At the dedication of the Tempelhofer Field-once the parade ground of the ex-Kaiser 's famous guard regiments - as Berlin 's airport , members of the municipal government went up in eleven airplanes . The eleventh machine crashed on landing , killing two city fathers and injuring a third official and the pilot . This was an unfortunate though dramatic finale to a celebration intended to advertise the Tempelhofer as the biggest airport in Europe . Almost on the same day at Cracow , Poland , a military plane lost a wing and fell through the roof of an apartment house . The gasoline tank exploded , killing a man ill in bed as well as the occupants of the airplane , and setting the house on fire .
