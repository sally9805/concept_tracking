ON EVERY side is the spectacle of persons lusting after culture and willing to give perhaps twenty minutes a day to get it . There are dim ladies who attend lectures ; callow commercial giants who read the best sayings of all ages ; suburban yearners who subscribe for books selected by a committee ; and flowery old dames who go to the opera just for the ride . All this has driven us to an anti-culture attitude , and has led us deeper into an old conviction of ours : namely , that when babies are born pink into the world some are naturally perspicacious little devils , and others are just real good correspondence school prospects . SILLY and hopeless is the plan adopted by the public school principal in Brooklyn who punishes any pupil caught reading a tabloid . The principal takes the paper away , tears it up , and hands the pupil a cake of soap . This is plain discrimination . The natural and quick inference in the adolescent mind is that the tabloid has something to offer which the full-sized newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son in that school , we should direct him , on receiving such a rebuff , to tear up the cake of soap and hand the well-meaning principal a lecture on liberty . THE Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists , popularly known as the crazy ones , is on at the Waldorf , and the stage is set for the customary flood of recriminations and mocking laughter . The more conservative public loves this show because it is the only show of the year it can dislike without feeling guilty . And the more radical artists love it because they run less danger of being " understood " at the ' Waldorf show than at any other . No really independent artist likes to be insulted . DART of our duty is to observe and 1 report what becomes , eventually , of the country homes of the millionaires . They are , in almost every case , either transformed into a golf club or subdivided by the busy realtors . The latest news concerns the Munsey estate on Long Island , which is to he sold at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers ' leniency long enough for us to remark , entertainingly enough , that every doggy estate has its Joseph P. Day . IT WAS our fortune this week to hear two men  --  lunching at a university club  --  discuss the defects of modern higher education . They were saddened ( and rightly ) at the whole collegiate picture , the futilities of campus and faculty , the coonskin diplomas . And their conclusion was that it is all a bunch of bunk and no good purpose . But in this they went , we feel , too far . Suppose these two men had n't gone to college -- where could they go now for lunch ? THE COURT 'S decision that theatre tickets may be sold for what they will bring is , to our hollow mind , a good decision . It is no great secs et that the agencies , while charging the legitimate fifty-cent fee , have been in cahoots with persons or organization ( supplying clubs and hotels ) who charged plenty . This is merely the American way of doing business , and the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we think , remain virtually unchanged . What sometimes appears to be noxious graft is often nothing more nor less than those good old cronies , Supply and Demand . And we are not at all sure that our townsfolk are not tickled to pieces to scurry into an alley at 8:25 P.M. and emerge bearing a perfectly terrible seat for which they have paid $8.80 . History UNTIL last week we had never been privileged to be in attendance at the birth of a big newspaper story . We rejoiced , therefore , when our good fortune took us into the smoking-room of a theatre at a moment when an excited young man was just completing a telephone call . " I said I wanted the city editor ! " he shouted in exasperation . " No , no , no ? the city editor , and in a hurry ! .. Mac ? ... This is Carl . Listen , I 've got a big story . I 've just been tipped off that Texas Guinan has had her face lifted . " He had spoken . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw the story prominent in several of the papers  --  although , to be sure , we noted that it was denied on the following day . THIS is tourney time in chess land and for a prize of $2,000 six middle-aged men are sitting in the ballroom of the Manhattan Square Hotel , going gradually crazy . They are the best chess players in the world . We stumbled dizzily into th- International Grand Masters ' Chess Tournament without knowing one chessman from another , and decided then and there never to learn . The battle is conducted on three small tables , lined up in the center of a ribboned enclosure . On each table are a chessboard , two time-clocks , a pad and pencil , and a drink of water . At each table arc two chairs , and these are occupied , from time to time , by the players  --  when they are not off somewhere having fun . In a chess tournament , when it is not your turn , you can go out arid talk to the desk clerk . A ROUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs , absolutely silent . Behind them are the news photographers , creeping softly about , squeezing bulbs . Anything like a photographer is a source of immense annoyance to the players , as being in the category with a cough , a squeaking shoe , or a radiator . For the whole secret of chess ( as outlined to us gravely by the secretary of the committee ) is looking ahead further than your opponent ; and frequently one of the grand masters of the game looks ahead so extremely far that his eye becomes caught and held by a news photographer . In a flash the entire strategic campaign is gone , and the twenty-odd contemplated moves have to he gendered up all over again . The whole matter worries the players terribly , and you will see them , hands behind back , pacing up and down in apparent agony . It is never possible to tell when a chess player is going to move . Sometimes , after a deadly stillness , a hand shoots forward . " He 's after it , " you murmur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink of ice-water . The game is almost as great a strain on the audience as on the players ! pHERE is more truth than poetry 1 in the statement that chess drives a man crazy . For we were informed again by the secretary  --  that at the completion of the tournament , after five or six weeks of play , the men will all he literally on the verge of a breakdown from the intense concentration . The incident that really made possible chess tournaments occurred in 1859 . In that year a man named Morphy was playing a man named Paulson . Mr. Morphy , it seems , had the game in the palm of his hand , but in order for him to win , it was necessary that Mr. Paulson should make a move . It was Mr. Paulson 's turn . Seeing his dilemma , Mr. Paulson flagrantly omitted to move for fourteen hours , during which time Mr. Morphy went into hysterics and then into nervous fainting fits until his health was permanently injured . This led Back Stage CINE of our more temperamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal because the part assigned fo her , that of a girl of questionable character , was directed in the manuscript to say " ai n't . " " Why , dearie , " she informed the playwright , " you know this girl would n't say ' ai n't . ' The fellow she goes around with has a car . " I T IS told of another blonde in- gentle that , after a recent success she received in her dressing-room a feminine admirer come all the way from Brooklyn to talk of art . The call had fallen somewhat flat , due largely to the fact that the ingenue would talk of little but her fine old Southern family . Finally the visitor turned in desperation to an old standby . " I suppose , " she said , " that your great ambition is to play Shakespeare . " " Well , " said the actress , " he has written some nice parts . " Horses , Horses , Horses Ma . WILLIAM D URI . AND , in whose riding academy at 5 West Sixty-sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straddle a saddle , has retired . He will not admit that he has bowed to the motor car . There are , he assures us , more saddle horses today than ever before . But Mr. Durland is an octogenarian . The cares of a great institution are a burden . And so at last the real estate company which has for months been trying to dislodge the exclusive Riding Club from its valuable site on Fifty-eighth Street just east of Fifth Avenue has persuaded him to sell his rambling structure , which , in sequence , has been turned over to the club for its future home . Forty-three years ago Mr. Durland came to New York from Jamaica , Long Island . There , at the age of nine , he had learned to ride and later to deal in horses . Before he had reached his majority , he was known as one of the best judges of fast road horses on Long Island . When he visited New York he always found himself in Central Park or on Seventh Avenue where drove the horsemen of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his record of 2:237/2 in 1860 , had just failed in an effort to run a stable for the Riding Club ( the same organization which now has displaced Mr. Durland ) at Sixtieth Street and " the Boulevard . " Mr. Durland , who still calls Broadway " the Boulevard , " took it over . In 1886 a roller-skating craze collapsed and an enormous rink at Broadway and Sixty-second Street became vacant . Mr. Durland took that over and opened a riding academy . Twenty-six years later he built the structure which he has just relinquished and where , on the day he sold out , six hundred and twenty-five horses were quartered . IN the forty-three years of his Career he has known all the famous horsemen of the city . Senator Roscoe Conkl ing visited his academy frequently  --  always , Mr. Durland says , with a loaf of sugar or an apple for the bay he expected to drive . Then there were C. K. G. Billings ( who once paid $40,000 for a trotter ) ; the Vanderbilts , Alfred Gwynne and Reginald ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who introduced polo to New York , George J. Gould and Theodore Roosevelt . Whenever the last-named rode in a parade in New York , he sent to Mr. Durland for a mount . He asked for spirited animals . Mr. Durland finally found a particularly fiery animal , named him President , and kept him always on hand for T. R. Now Mr. Durland has retired to a chair by a window which overlooks Central Park , where , he says , he will always be able to see horses . He will also see automobiles , but he bears them no grudge . His son sells them . Tale IT WAS in one of our less sedate clubs that a member inadvertently slipped into a state of intoxication the other afternoon and , in his bewilderment , sought one of his fellows . " Charles , " he said , " it 's four o'clock and I 'm tight . What shall do ? " " If I were you , old man , " was the sympathetic reply , " I 'd call a cab and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir , " he said , " when I want your advice I 'll ask for it . " ? THE ATTENTION OF gentle- - 1- men who complain that their laundry is often late , is called to the patience of Sir Eustace Fiennes , British Governor of the Leeward Islands . Having visited the Plaza Hotel some time since and ( we are told ) become enamored of its laundry work , he now sends his linen there every two weeks . It arrives in charge of the captain of a ship and is returned to him by the officials of the Plaza just before he sails back . Expose THE LATEST addition to the repertory of parlor tricksters is an involved bit of pseudo-clairvoyance done with paper , pencil and a tele phone book . The victim is requested fo select four figures , ciphers excepted , and to arrange them graduated as to size from the left , as , say , 8631 . He is then asked to reverse the figures and subtract . Taking 1368 from 8631 the result is 7263 . Again he is requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3627 plus 7263 gives 10890 . From this total the last figure is crossed out , giving 1089 . At this point the telephone directory enters . The victim is requested to turn to the page which corresponds to the last two figures ( 89 ) and take the name corresponding with the first two ( tenth name from the top ) . " Well , " says the magician , " the name is Evelyn Bareed . " Inasmuch as he has seen none of the figures the trickster is given so much attention that we feel it our duty to expose him . The fact is that any such combination of figures will always come out 1089 . All that remains is for him to memorize the tenth name on the eighty-ninth page . It is just as simple with a Brooklyn telephone directory , the name being Morris Black .
