Last week the President conferred with Secretary of Commerce Herbert C. Hoover , picked well-trained minds of radio and one able jurist to reign over radio . They will form the commission , created by the White-Dill Radio Bill ( TiME , Feb. 21 ) to rule for one year and have the last word in all disputes thereafter . <P> For listeners , broadcasters , these five men are tsars : <P> Rear Admiral William Hannum Grubb Bullard , Republican , blunt strong-minded naval veteran of two wars is the President 's choice for chairman ; he will serve six years . <P> Orestes H. Caldwell , Republican , is " the perfect radio fan . " He will serve five years . ( See below . ) <P> Eugene O. Sykes , Democrat , gentleman-scholar , onetime ( 1916-24 ) Justice of the Supreme Court of Mississippi , knows little radio , will serve four years as the commission 's legal mind . <P> Henry A. Bellows , Democrat , Harvard graduate and teacher , edited magazines until the Washburn-Crosby Co. saw in him broadcast genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WCCO at Minneapolis . <P> Col. John F. Dillon , Republican , old army man , radio inspector first at Chicago and later district supervisor at San Francisco , punished many a radio culprit under the old Hoover regime . He has the shortest term , two years . <P> The Senate received the appointments , confirmed Appointees Bullard , Sykes , Dillon refused to act on Appointees Bellows and Caldwell , failed to vote an appropriation for the work of the commission . Senator Dill , co-author of the bill , led the opposition to Appointees Bellows and Caldwell , said they are Mr. Hoover 's henchmen . In back of the opposition to a Hoover-dominated commission is a disagreement on Mr. Hoover 's policy in clearing the air . Secretary Hoover believes the large stations give better listener-in service and favors saving them . The opposition maintains that claims of large and small broadcasters should be treated impartially . <P> Later , the President gave Messrs . Bellows and Caldwell recess appointments. * <P> When the name of Orestes Hampton Caldwell , able editor , + pratical engineer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio commission , radiophiles recognized his name . " This man is one of us . Radio is his hobby and his livelihood . " Newsgatherers hastened to his home in Bronxville , N. Y. , investigated . At the door they found a doorbell surmounted by a pilot light to point it out to late callers ; inside they saw a household in which electricity is maid-of-all-work . Stoves , dishwashers , bread-mixers , all are run by electricity . No one need shout up the stairs ; a system of house telephones is available . The household works , eats , plays to broadcast programs , for each room is wired for radio . In the morning an automatic timing device turns on the radio and wakes the Caldwells up to do their daily dozen ; in the evening it turns the receiver off after they have gone to bed . Gas heats the house , but an electric thermostat regulates the heater . States Mrs. Caldwell : " We light the gas in the fall and forget about it until spring . " <P> Editor Caldwell , 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years .
