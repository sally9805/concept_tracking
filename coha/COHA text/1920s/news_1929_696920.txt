In governmental circles generally there was a tendency to look upon the White Paper as one addressed more to the British public than to the United States , inasmuch as it dealt with a group of international subjects to which this country is not at present committed , such as the League of Nations and the optional clause of the World Court statutes . While the White Paper discussed prominently the World Court , and the Administration favors American Adherence to that judicial body , the fact remains that the United States has not joined the court , and will not do so until the Senate acts , which will not be until long after the London naval conference . In foreign diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with British reactions than those of the American public to the White Paper at this time . The Labor Government , it was pointed out , has but a slender hold in Parliament , and , if it consents to reductions in the British navy , it must have a favorable atmosphere at home . regarding future prospects of national defense . Diplomats generally- looked upon the paper solely from that standpoint . There were some indications that the hesitancy of officials of the Hoover Administration in commenting was due to a realization of the delicacy of this aspect of the situation . Clause Not Before America . Although the White Paper contended that the optional clause was a proper complement to the anti-war treaty , as a definite act providing machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes , Secretary Stimson made clear this week that the ? question of , signing , the clause was not before the American Government and was not being considered . In so far as the League of Nations is concerned , the United States is not a member , and it is admitted throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member . As for the Kellogg pact , Secretary Stimson has repeatedly said it depends solely upon the force of world public opinion for its efficacy . In his recent appeal to Russia and China in the name of the treaty for peace in Manchuria , he took the greatest care to point out that the United . States was . not attempting to determine the aggressor . Arguments that the treaty will require the determination of the aggressor have been combated here from the time the pact had its inception under former Secretary of State Kellogg . At the same time it has been admitted from the beginning that a codification of international maritime law is greatly to be desired . This subject , according to authoritative pronouncements both here and in London , is not to come formally before the London naval conference , but it is recognized that it will lurk prominently in the background for the reason that a proper definition of rights on the high seas can not be dissassociated from naval limitation and reduction . There are indications that formal attention may be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prove a success , and that , before long , international treatment may be given the subject . The complexities of the questions involved , however , are so great that it is felt no single paper can deal with it adequately . Diplomats pointed out today , for example , that President Hoover s humane suggestion of immunity for food ships in time of war could easily lead into the whole problem , of international relations , inasmuch as in application it might cripple the League of Nations in acting against a recalcitrant member . Moreover , it is not everywhere conceded that the Kellogg treaty makes war impossible , even with all promises under it observed . It is well known that strategists regard it as fqr from au absolute guarantee against war . In the first place , as construed by them , it permits defensive war , which in itself may be stretched to cover a wide field . In addition , under the correspondence which accompanied negotiation of the Kellogg pact , it is argued that it would not ban war against a recalcitrant member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Locarno pacts , or civil war . Under these conditions , it is con ' tended in circles most closely identified with , the problems of national defense , there is yet a prospect of war which might raise acutely the problem of American neutral rights or . the high seas . Root Calls on the President . Elihu Root , former Secretary of State , paid a short and formal call upon President Hoover today before leaving for New York tomorrow morning . Mr. Root has been here attending a meeting of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . He said he did not discuss this country 's adherence ' to the ? World Court with Mr. Hoover today , and was not apprised of when the matter would be brought up in the , Senate ? or how that body . would deal with it . It still seems certain that the Senate will vote adherence to the court , but  --  the ' chances are that the subject will not come up for discussion until after the London Naval Conference , perhaps not , until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
