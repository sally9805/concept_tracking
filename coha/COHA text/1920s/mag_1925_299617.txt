A staid person is the easiest to shock . What can shock New England is hardly considered worth mentioning in Central America . <P> Last week it carne about that New England was shocked by a slight earthquake . Shortly after eight o'clock one January morning , an ague set in north of Boston , People rushed from their houses in Marblehead and Salem . Slates fell off the roofs at Gloucester and pictures off the " walls a . Swampscott . Bric-a-brac fell from shelves in Medford , and antimacassars were disarranged in Maiden . After 10 to 90 seconds of tremor , New England settled down , though her people were still agitated . <P> Geologically , the land of New England is as unemotional as her people . Only four other shocks have been recorded in about 300 years .
