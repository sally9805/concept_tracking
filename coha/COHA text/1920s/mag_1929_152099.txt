One way of measuring pork production is to estimate the weight of pig litters at the age of six months . This system forms the basis of an annual nationwide contest , conducted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture , in which farmers pit themselves against each other in the matter of six-month-old litters , of a ton or more weight . Last week the results for 1928 were announced . Farmers in 30 states produced 492 ton-or-more litters , Pennsylvania winning with 65 . Idaho had the heaviest litter-14 piglets totaling 4,156 pounds .
