Gaunt and grimy stokers , silhouetted in furnace glare , are no longer an integral part of a ship 's bowels . Even coal burners can do without them . Last week members of the Fuel Conservation Committee of the U. S. Shipping Board sweated in the test furnace room of the Todd Dry Dock Co. ; peered at an intricate machine which was busily pulverizing soft coal and blowing it into furnaces . Hitherto , on the experiment freighter Mercer , the coal has been pulverized in one machine , then distributed to three furnaces , but the latest improvement provides each furnace with its own pulverizer and does away altogether with the problem of distribution . The new pulverizer is attached to the door of any furnace . Like a large coffee mill , it grinds the coal until talcum powder would look coarse in comparison ; sprays it into the greedy furnace where it becomes incandescent almost immediately . <P> Pulverized coal is not a recent invention . The Ford Co. , the N. Y. Edison Co .. all the big new power stations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship owners . But the separate furnaces on vessels created problems of distribution and firing that made powdered coal impracticable for them . These problems have now been solved .
