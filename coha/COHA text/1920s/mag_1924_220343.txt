Empty Hands . Readers of the novel by Arthur Stringer , from which this film was fashioned , hold that its chief interest lies in the development of the devices by which the man and the woman existed and finally made themselves comfortable in a hidden wilderness . When they arrived , via a gorge of rapids , the woman had no standard equipment at all ( her bathing suit had been torn off by the torrent 's claws ) and the man had only a coat , trousers , undershirt and a hunting knife . Before the rescue , a good many weeks later , they were living in a log bungalow with a full line of cooking utensils , clothes and toilet articles . Manufacture of these things did not interest the producers ( quite properly ) . They were forced for reasons of dramatic necessity to stress the wickedness of the young lady ( Norma Shearer ) before she reached the purifying atmosphere of loneliness . Indeed , if her mother 's ghost had not walked at just the right moment , she might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father whisked her away to the open spaces , where a heartily disapproving young engineer ( Jack Holt ) went to her rescue down the rapids . The opening phases of the film are struck off with the old rubber stamp . There was even the midnight bathing-party , at which everyone got drunk and hurled the fat guest into the pool for comedy . But comedy ceased when the man and the woman were hurled into the canyon rapids . From that point forth , the adventure gained in entertainment values . <P> Fools in the Dark . Every now and then some producer reaches the absolute end of his dramatic rope and decides to make a melodrama on the theory that old things are best . Accordingly , he stirs up daggers , skeletons , an avalanche , death traps , mystery yachts , a Hindu villain , an airplane rescue . In the present instance , a death ray was included to give that natty modern touch . No matter how often you have been to the cinemas , the incoherent multitude of these manufactured thrills serves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaction . Matt Moore and Patsy Ruth Miller assist materially in making the discerning spectators feel like fools in the dark for enjoying such arrant debris .
