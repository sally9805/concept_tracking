THE PRIVATE LIFE OF TUTANKHAMEN-G . R. Tabouis-McBride ( $3.50 ) . <P> Recently Tutankhamen , " handsomest of the Pharaohs , " has enjoyed a glory , almost a fad , that is far more than his due . The wondrous relics found in his tomb far outshine the history of his political achievements . Mile . Tabouis , learned , impassioned , recites that history , conjures up its sociological , scientific and commercial background . But the illustrations in her book are only added testimony that this mighty man would be forgotten were it not for the glittering chrysalis of stone and metal in which he lived .
