txt There was a direct connection between the enormously increased valuation.i of real estate and the announcement by the Controller that the tax rate would be lower . That the Regional Plan Committee should have chosen this particular time to make public its report on public finance is probably a mere coincidence . Yet its discussion of various questions of municipal policy , particularly in regard to public improvements , could hardly be more apposite . It lists a number of projects , " seriously put forward by public authorities " for completion in the next fifteen years , at an aggregate cost of just under $3,000,000,000 . It might have quoted the more detailed figure : 3 in the thoughtful analysis published by the committee of which Lieut . Gov . LEIINIAN was chairman , which set the total of local public improvements to be financed outside of the budget during the years 1928 to 1932 at *1,062 , - 000,000 . Neither figure is all inclusive . Either is large enough to make it clear that the city can not depend forever on mounting assessments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss a number of ways in which the city could find relief from its present and prospective burdens . The traditional method is to evade high taxes by making the next generation carry the public improvement load . That increases the bonded debt . When it gets close to the constitutional limit , the city appeals to the Legislature for further exemptions , as it did two years ago in the case of the $300 , - 000,000 for new subways . The present report suggests that if the proposed New York City Bridge and Tunnel Commission were constituted . the borrowing power of the city for other projects might be increased , " since the bonds , for bridges and " tunnels would otherwise be included " within the constitutional debt limit " of the city until the improvements " for which they were issued become " self-supporting . " Such a measure is.now pending at Albany . Local assessments offer a source of revenue ' which New York has never adequately tapped . The Regional Plan report calculates that only 3.8 per cent of the city 's revenues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its revenues in that way , and other municipalities in the West and Middle West have followed suit . Chairman DELANEY of the Board of Transportation long ago urged local assessments as a contributory source of revenue for new rapid transit construction . Mr. UNTERMYER endorsed this method , and so did ithe Lehman committee . In the way of its adoption are opposition by certain real estate interests and the exigencies of politics . The report of the Regional Committee goes to the heart of the problem when ' it discusses the possibility of making existing public services to a larger extent self-supporting . It contains an interesting table , furnished by Controller , BERRY , indicating that the deficits which the city incurred in 1926 in the operation of its various public utilities - - municipal ferries , docks , subways , trackless trolleys and . soon  --  amounted to over V19,000,000 .. Of course , the biggest loss of all is chargeable to the subways , which are responsible in the case of the existing lines alone for a " frozen credit " of $250,000,000 . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it " would not only relieve the city of " this necessity payment of the " $13,000,000 deficit out of taxes " but would greatly enlarge its bor " rowing power . " Without some reform along the lines indicated which will relieve the budget of pressure from the subway construction account until other needs are taken care of , the city will not be able to supply the facilities of transportation , education , recreation , health and public welfare on which its future depends .
