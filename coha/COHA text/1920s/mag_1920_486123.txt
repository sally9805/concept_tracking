travagant hope . The muddled inert forces of American optimism and good-will had found real if accidental expres  --  sion in the Fourteen Points . For a moment it seemed as if those sluggish streams of true democratic feeling that had been rambling further and further underground in the years of topheavy industrial organization since the Civil War might have reached the surface in a really living foun  --  tain . Yet the tragedy of their drying up to leave American thought the same muddy bog as before may have been due only to the lack of a pump , of an efficient machine to bring clear water to the surface ; a tradition in other words , something similar to the great agin-the-government tradi  --  tion that England inherited from the turbulent seafaring folk that crowded into the island out of northern seas . It is that tradition that in spite of centuries of various impe  --  rialisms has kept Great Britain the leader of the world 's desire for liberty . In America , too , there must be left enough of the swaggering independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Yankee skippers to form a steely rebellious core in the flabby dump  --  ling of our national docility . In the present disorganization of our public opinion it is our Hun-haters and lynchers and Bolshevik-baiters , our Palmers and Burlesons who  --  through the efforts of the jingo press  --  are considered the typical Americans . Europeans ask themselves in bewilderment what they can have seen in all this welter to pin their faith to . No other voice can be heard above the howling of the dervishes of militant capitalism . The barbarities of our marines in Haiti are known all over the world , but the protest against that miserable business will soon be for  --  gotten in the files of liberal weeklies . Yet no one can say that more Americans were involved in the chain of events leading up to the massacres than protested when the facts became known with healthy indignation . We have heard a great deal in these last years of the duty of the individual to his government ; it is time something were said of the duty of the individual to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good round eighteenth century term . Not until a large and aggressive body of our citizens has formed the habit of loudly and immediately repudiating every abuse internal or external of the government 's authority and every instance of bullying mob intolerance will we as a nation show that " decent respect for the opinions of mankind " necessary to reconquer the confidence of the only body of foreign opinion whose confidence is worth having . Some  --  how , in these dark days ahead , a compact Opposition must be built up which shall keep up contacts with the outside world in spite of the Chinese wall reactionary journalism is building up about us . And particularly , for the sake of our peace with our nearest neighbors the Latin Americans , Spanish-speaking peoples must be made to feel that there is more in the United States than ignorance and intolerance and aggression , that there is a body of opinion that puts humanity before national interests and class interests . We must outshout the priests of Baal . Then , perhaps , after all this bitterness , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold of the immigrant 's dream by a land toward which the lacerated peoples of Europe can again aspire , where in a certain ele  --  mental freedom of thought and action the foundations will have been laid for a life that people  --  in the sense the donkey boy on that blazing road in Spain intended  --  can enjoy , the " liberty and pursuit of happiness " of that original too long forgotten declaration of our aims . Driftway S OMETIMES when the Drifter studies the faces that be  --  siege him in the subway , he weakly loses faith in de  --  mocracy and fears that these pale dissatisfied countenances do not reveal the stuff of self-governors . How different are the mighty ones of earth ! How much better shaved and clad they be , and what wisdom hides beneath the impene  --  trable solemnity of their faces ! What wisdom indeed  --  the Drifter has had a revelation of those mighty minds in reading the minutes of a recent session of that Reparations Commission created by the Treaty of Versailles to govern areas of the Teutonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nations . * * * " The session opens , " the minutes read . M. Louis Dubois speaks from the chair . M. Louis DUBOIS . My dear colleagues , I have the honor to suggest to you two rectifications of the minutes of our last meet  --  ing . I note that on page 2 the minutes read , " Messieurs X. Y. Z. " Does it not seem to you that this should be corrected to read : " Monsieur X , Monsieur Y , Monsieur Z " ? Another point : on page 8 , proper names are printed in the same type as is used for the text . Type No. 4 should be used for proper names . Do you approve the changes I suggest ? ( General approval . ) M. BERTOLINI ( the Italian member ) . Mr. Chairman , I have often said , as have my colleagues , that you have full power to make such changes on your own authority . I formally propose to my colleagues to authorize you to make any merely formal change in the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) This was too much . M. Dubois rose again . M. Louis DuBois . Gentlemen , I thank you for the new proof of confidence which you are good enough to accord me . I beg you to believe that I have a proper appreciation of the honor that you do me . But you ask me to add still further to my crushing responsibilities . I reserve the right to consult my French colleagues before making a decision . SIR JOHN BRADBURY . Permit me , Mr. Chairman , to give my support to the words of our honorable colleague , M. Bertolini , and to ask you , in the name of all of us , to accept the offer made you . M. Louis DuBois . It would be ungracious longer to resist this friendly insistence . It shall be as you wish , and in the interest of the successful functioning of the Commission , I accept , in so far as I am concerned , M. Bertolini 's proposition . ( General approval . ) M. Louis DuBois . Gentlemen , I am needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our honorable colleague , M. Bertolini. * * * * * The Drifter turns from these minutes with a new sense of what it is to be a great man , a statesman , and a diplomat , and with a faint glimmering of understanding why , under the burden of its crushing responsibilities , the Reparations Commission , has not yet been able to set the total of the German indemnity . * * * * * Newspapermen , the Drifter long ago learned , are cynics . Perhaps because they have seen too much of the great men of their time . His newspaper friends are not amazed when he reads them the minutes of the Reparations Commission . They have learned to expect from politicians and statesmen a distillation of the pettinesses behind the subway faces . THE DRIFTER
