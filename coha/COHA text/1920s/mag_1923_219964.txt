A brief summary of the main features of the Foster criminal syndicalism case follows : Last August the secret convention of the American Communist Party was raided by Federal officers in the sand dunes near Bridgeman , Michigan . Warrants were issued for 32 delegates , about two-thirds of whom were captured in the raid . The remainder surrendered voluntarily shortly before their comrades were to come to trial . William Z. Foster , leader of the Steel Strike of 1919 , and next to Eugene Debs the most prominent radical in the country , was the first of the Communists to be brought to trial . The specific charge was violation of the Michigan state criminal syndicalism law . The prosecution contended that Foster was a member of an organization ( the Trade Union Educational League , a subsidiary of the Communist Party ) which advocated violence in overthrowing the Government of the United States .
