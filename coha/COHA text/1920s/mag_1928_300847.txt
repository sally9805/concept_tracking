Not so long ago the bitter-brilliant publicist Maximilian Harden went to a State Reception held at the Foreign Office of the German Republic . He skulked about . There were mountains of caviar sandwiches , sideboards snowy with ices , trays of brimming champagne goblets ; and all the women had shaved and powdered under their armpits . These things put Publicist Harden into a towering , democratic rage . <P> Afterward he recorded his bitterest impression thus : <P> " Under the middle chandelier stands a stocky , pale gentleman in faultless evening attire . His bald head is a palish gray ; his prominent eyeballs , framed in reddish half-closed lids , have a lustreless prismatic glint ; a shapeless little poodle nose surmounts a self-indulgent mouth which prepares us for his ample waistline and the folds of flesh above his stiff collar . He stands alone because the cercle round him has formed at a respectful distance . Now ... a sycophant advances with a deep obeisance , shakes the great man 's hand . . . and then withdraws backward , wriggling his rump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <P> Today lean , brittle Maximilian Harden is the tenant of a grave ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) . Doubtless his ghost was in a towering rage , last week ; because the fat , poodle-nosed man whom he had called " King Gustav " was quietly celebrating his fifth anniversary as German Foreign Minister . The Poodle-Man is Dr. Gustav Stresemann. * He celebrated at Oberhof , a Thuringian spa , where he has been convalescing from an almost fatal kidney attack ( TIME , May 28 ) . Telegrams , cables and flowers poured in , for Dr. Stresemann is the outstanding and most potent German statesman . He has held the Foreign Ministry while nine Cabinets have fallen . Previously , as Chancellor of the German Reich ( 1923 ) , he wangled the French out of the Ruhr ( which they had seized ) , and laid the German side of the foundations for the Dawes Plan . He was one of the Locarno Peace Pact signatories ( TIME , Dec. 14 , 1925 ) ; and he got Germany into the League ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he won the Nobel Peace Prize ( TIME , Dec. 20 , 1926 ) . <P> In short , everyone knows all about " King Gustav " ; and it becomes preferable to write of a svelte and charming woman whom one does not hesitate to call , in homage , " Queen Kate . " She , Frau Gustav Stresemann , was Fraeulein Kate Kleeseld . Her father was one of the great industrialists , including Hugo Stinnes , in whose service Gustav Stresemann began to grow great . <P> They married in 1903 . He was the son of a Saxon beer merchant ; and , being a smart son , won his Doctor 's degree with a thesis entitled : Upon the Development of the Berlin Bottled Beer Trade . <P> He was 25 when they married . She may have been lovelier then , but it is hard telling from photographs ( see Cut ) . She has always remained slim . Her Wolfgang was born in 1904 , and her Hans in 1908 . When strangers see Wolfgang and Hans with her , today , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepmother . <P> He became a Deputy in 1907 . They lived in Dresden . The toothpaste tycoon , Lingner , the man who has plastered Europe with ODOL signs , was one of the first to discover Deputy Stresemann 's talent for wangling things , and paid well .
