Mellon and Distillery <P> Sirs : <P> <P> . . . There is one question that has been called to my attention of late , owing to the nearness of the election and that is : Does Andrew Mellon still own his distilleries , and make and sell whiskey to the druggists ? If you can give me any enlightenment on this subject I will be very grateful to you . . . . <P> <P> OLIVE JOHNSON <P> Springfield , Mo . <P> <P> The following statement has been received from Mr. Mellon : <P> " I once owned some stock in a distillery company as I owned stock in many other business enterprises . The stock in this company was disposed of before I took office as Secretary of the Treasury ; in fact , the distillery company absolutely ceased from doing any of its manufacturing business over three years before the prohibition amendment went into effect , and the entire business was subsequently wound up . At no time was I ever actively engaged in the distilling business . I have no interest in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very truly yours , <P> A. W. Mellon Secretary of the Treasury . " - ED . <P> Fake Oath <P> Sirs : <P> Congratulations on exposing fake oath falsely attributed to Knights of Columbus .

CHEWNING <P> Harrisonville , Mo . <P> <P> Nobody Lying <P> Sirs : <P> Is somebody lying ? I was boasting to a friend that TIME was the speediest magazine for printing the news and circulating it on earth . I told him that three years ago you went from Manhattan to Cleveland to speed up your national circulation , and last January from Cleveland to Chicago to make it speedier . I told him also that last summer you moved your editorial offices from Cleveland back to Manhattan to get the news quicker and more authentically . <P> Then he showed me this advertisement : " Readers of the Literary Digest will receive the fastest service of any national magazine-within 8 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . " <P> Maybe the Literary Digest do n't know that you exist yet . Maybe they do n't think you are a national magazine . Maybe they are quibblers and in this way recognize TIME as the national newsmagazine and themselves as an ordinary national periodical . <P> Please tell us the truth ? <P> <P> MELVILLE WILLSON <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> <P> TIME goes to press Tuesday , includes important Tuesday news . Three days later , most of its 220,000 weekly copies have reached subscribers . No magazine can compare with TIME in the matter of speed . However , no one is lying .

S.-ED . <P> <P> Sears Roebuck Tires <P> Sirs : <P> Your telegram of August 17 , came to the attention of the writer asking for information on our sales figure .
