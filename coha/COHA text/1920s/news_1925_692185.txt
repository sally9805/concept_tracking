txt Although directors of Atlantic Gulf &; West Indies S. S. Lines failed to resume preferred dividends at Thursday 's meeting , resumption on a $5 annual basis will not ilong be deferred . September 's net income of $230,848 , after all charges including depreciation , is not an accurate index to the trend of earnings in fourth quarter . In that month only four of Agari 's tanker fleet carried cargoes , leaving eight idle and making results a testimonial to the earning power of threesubsidiaries alone : the Clyde , N. Y. &; Porto Rico and Mallory lines . In the fourth quarter , October should more or less closely approximate September , but all tankers were occupied during November and will continue in full operation until well on into the new year . Their , operation should very nearly double the September net income , bringing net for the last two months of 1925 to over $600,000 ; net for the quarter to between $800,000 and $900,000 , and net for year , to about $2,500,000 , equivalent to $18 a share on 137,429 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduction of full 5% dividends on the preferred issue , to $9 a share on 199,512- no par value common shares . It is understood that the Ward Line , which , , as operated slightly in red figures since Ag-wi took it back into the fold in September , will complete the year on the profit side . Profit from this subsidiary may be negligible in estimating results of the lines as a whole . The influence of improving business over its routes should be reflected in the first quarter , however , and indications are that Agwi will report the largest quarter since the war in the first three months of 1926 . ' Meanwhile , dividend action seems improbable at the December 30 meeting of the board , but a strong-belief exists that at the January meeting , when November re ' sults will be considered , directors will reinstate the pre , ferred stock on a dividend basis .
