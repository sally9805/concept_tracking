Some 15 miles off the coast of Devonshire , the super-submarine M-1 floundered suddenly and inexplicably , sank down and down , with all hands on board , to depths at which the Admiralty announced that she must have been crushed like an eggshell by hydraulic pressure . <P> For several days minesweepers searched vainly for the sunken vessel , plowed futilely back and forth through choppy rising seas . The Admiralty sent out divers and ships equipped with a recently and secretly developed instrument for magnetically detecting sunken masses of iron . The sea bottom was explored by every possible means . Then a startling announcement was made . The trouble it seemed lay not in locating sunken ships but in distinguishing the M-l from the many vessels sunk in that vicinity by the Germans ! The sea bottom was described as " littered with ships , " and despatches announced that the Admiralty had practically abandoned hope of discovering even the crushed hull of one of Britain 's most powerful undersea craft . <P> In London and indeed throughout England the most widespread sympathy was expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down with the M1 . It was recalled that her Commander , Lieutenant Alec M. Carrie , had been married only eleven months . A Mrs. Bertie Jones , wife of one of the submarine 's petty officers , was harkened to with indignation when she asserted that her husband had often told her that " the M1 's machinery frequently went wrong . " <P> Before an audience of Plymouth women , the Viscountess Astor fulminated against submarines in general . Apropos of the disaster said she : " I would go around the world lecturing five times over if I thought I could do anything to persuade the nations of the world to abandon submarines and poison gas ! " <P> The British press , in general , made only very restrained comment ; and late in the week published the following short bulletin from the Admiralty , as a definite and official announcement that the tragedy was an assured fact : " The Admiralty deeply regret that they can no longer hold out any hope that the crew of the M-1 still survive . " <P> Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monitor " class of submarine had been developed by the British Admiralty during the War , and constituted a class of " super mystery ships " which were never employed against the Germans for fear of rousing them to construct a similar and equally deadly naval arm . <P> The special feature of the " M " boats , of which the M-1 was the first , consists in the fact that they are the only submarines which are equipped with a regular 12-inch dreadnaught gun . Thus a fleet of such " monitors " might slip into an enemy port unobserved , possibly during the absence of the enemy fleet , and deliver a bombardment of dreadnaught calibre at close range before effective measures could be taken against them . <P> Naturally , since Britain had quite literally the upper hand of the seas during the War , she was far more anxious to keep the secrets of the M-1 class of submarine out of German hands than to reap a slight advantage from employing " monitor subs " herself .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
