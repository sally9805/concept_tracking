txt Three years ago the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad agreed with the shop crafts unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor to cooperate In an attempt to increase production and to improve working conditions . The management bound itself to recognize the unions . to deal with them and , as far as possible within the . limits of existing railroad wage standards , to allow their membership a share in the benefits that might follow . The unions pledged the shopmen to strive for efficiency . A system of meetings between the company and men was set tip . The experiment was first put into operation with 300 men in the Glenwood shops . A year later . the plan was applied to the entire force of 22,000 shopmen , on the road . It has subsequently been adopted by the Canadian National , the Chicago &; Northwestern and the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railroads , and embraces today over 50,000 men . Mr. 0 . S. BEYER Jr. , who , as consulting engineer for the shopmen 's unions , shares the credit with President Wn.L.tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sums up the results of its operation in The New Republic . He mentions the following gains ; " ( 1 ) Elimination of unemployment in the B. &; 0 . shops ; ( 2 ) decline in grievanties submitted for adjudication on the same road from an average of 1 in every 58 men to 1 in every 131 ; ( 3 ) a total of 20,000 suggestions for increased shop efficiency. , better worki4 conditions , more satisfactory recruiting of employes , &c..; 16,000 of which have ac : tually been put into effect . In addition , Mr. BEYER cites intangibles of even greater importance which may be summed up-as an " increased sense of responsibility on the part of em " Ployes for the success of the railroad " and on the part of the management " for the welfare of the employes . " The great failure of modern Industry has been to furnish an incentive to the wage worker sufficient to elicit his wholehearted support in production . The average factory worker sees no connection between his wages and his daily output . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to increase wages Is not to increase production , but to coerce the employer Into paying more . From this has flowed a train of evil consequences  --  soldiering on the job , ca ' canny , sabotage , with waste beyond calculation . As a result the vast mechanism of modern production halts and often fails altogether . The B. &; 0 . plan has the great merit of facing this issue and offering a remedy that respects the rights and interests of both employer and employed . Its present weakness , as Mr.1 BEYER points out , Is the lack of definitecorrelation between increased output and higher wages . The elaborate and fixed wage structure of the railroads which makes different wage scales on different roads impracticable at the present time , and the fact that production in repair work is more difficult to measure than in ordinary manufacture , have hampered the experiment . But its remarkable success in spite of these odds Makes it even the more impressive .                 @ @ @ @
