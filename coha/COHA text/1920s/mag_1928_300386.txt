Spent is the age when rearing spires could dominate a city . Coming up the New York harbor you see many a Wall Street office building , but the towers of Trinity and St. Paul 's are visible only after you turn the corner into lower Broadway . If any Gothic soars into the morning , it commemorates not God but the Woolworth five-and-ten cent stores . <P> Therefore John Davison Rockefeller Jr. , generous donor to the 36-story Broadway Temple now being completed at Broadway and 174th Street , pleaded last week for skyscraper churches which would lift the glory of God as high as the glory of life insurance and stocks &; bonds . Said he , at a banquet of Temple-building bankers : " We do not want the business world to look down on churches . . . . " <P> Meanwhile work was being started to remove the chimes presented by Mr. Rockefeller to his Park Avenue Baptist Church from that church 's tower . Residents of the expensive apartment neighborhood complain that chimes disturb their Sabbath sleep .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
