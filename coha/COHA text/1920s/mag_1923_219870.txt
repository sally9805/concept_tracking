The Supreme Court of North Carolina has upheld a conviction for murder in the second degree in a case apparently unparalleled in criminal history . <P> The defendant , one Ves Wingler , married Candace Miller in 1891 , and went with her to a cabin in the mountains " 17 or 18 miles from North Wilkesboro , N. C. " In May , 1893 , she met a violent death . Her husband was the sole witness . On his testimony the coroner 's jury brought in a verdict of accidental death , caused by a fall from a loft in the cabin onto the stone hearth in front of the fireplace . In April , 1922 , Ves Wingler was arrested , tried and convicted and the judgment affirmed by the Supreme Court carried an indeterminate sentence of from 25 to 30 years . <P> There is , of course , no Statute of Limitations running in the case of murder , and a murderer may be required to have one trial at any time of his life . <P> The conviction of Wingler resulted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor assaulted one of Wingler 's daughters , and Wingler swore out a warrant for his arrest . The assailant fled , but the neighbor countered by reporting to the authorities a confession alleged to have been made to him by Wingler in 1893 . The arrest and conviction followed , although a strenuous defence was maintained and although the only explanation the neighbor gave for his sudden revelation was that he had recently got religion . <P> Even so august a body as the Supreme Court of North Carolina realized the dramatic possibilities of the case before it . <P> In addition to two quotations from poems , the opinion closes with such moral observations as : " Though justice sometimes treads with leaden feet , if need be she strikes with an iron hand . Verily , the wages of sin are death and sin pays its wages " ; as well as such grim humor as : " There is no error appearing in the record , except the great error of the defendant in murdering his wife .
