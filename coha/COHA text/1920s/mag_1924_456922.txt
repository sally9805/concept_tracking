Tue mongooses to whom this ' In Memoriam ' is dedicated belonged to the African variety known to the naturalist as Herpesies zebra or fasciatus , as distinct from , but less well known than , the two most celebrated varieties of this rich species , viz. Herpestes Javanicus , to which belonged the mongoose of mongooses , Rudyard Kipling 's llikki-Tikki , and Herpestes ichneumon the ' rat of the Pharaones , ' once as sacred as the cat , but now fallen from its high estate . In appearance , the African variety are quaint-looking , cobby , ' rather clumsy little creatures , not larger than a guinea pig when full grown . Their legs are short , and those in front are bent like those of dachshunds , to whom they have a certain resemblance . To sit up is , with them , a pose as familiar as it is with the bear , and when they do so , and let their bent forelegs hang down on both sides of their chest , they look very much like penguins on shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jaws is of a much lighter shade of gray than is that of the rest of the body , so that they appear , when looked at en face , as if they wore whiskers . Their chief strength lies in the neck and jaws , which are , comparatively speaking , of tremendous power ; this quality , joined to the extreme accuracy of their aim , of which their game affords so startling a proof , supplements , when they hunt or fight , any disadvantage which may be due to deficiencies in their build , and explains the fact that they almost invariably succeed in seizing a snake behind the head , before it has had time to strike . Nevertheless , I did not encourage my mongooses to tackle snakes , except small ones , for it always appeared to me as if a zebra mongoose , owing to that clumsiness of shape just mentioned , must be at a disadvantage when confronted by a full-grown and wide-awake cobra . In my own experience , I have known only one instance of a snake 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the snake a small green tree-snake . The mongoose was apparently lacking in the inherited instinct of its race , and seized the reptile , in a desultory sort of way , far below the neck . The snake struck , without much energy , at the jaw of its aggressor , who at once dropped it , and slightly shook himself , but showed no further signs of distress . He did not , however , renew the attack , and the snake made off . I was not sure that the latter was venomous , but I watched the mongoose with some anxiety for the next twenty-four hours . Nothing happened , and I concluded that everything was all right . A month later , the mongoose died with all the symptoms of having been poisoned ; but its mate died at almost the same time , showing exactly the same symptoms , and as these pointed to sublimate , of which my boys ? who hated the mongooses ? knew the effect , and which they could , besides , easily procure , I incline to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindictiveness rather than to the self-preserving instinct of the snake . Brehm mentions somewhere , and seems to disbelieve , a statement which he heard from Arabs in the Sudan : that ichneumons combine to attack and kill large snakes . I have never seen this happen , but I have been assured by natives in Taveta that mongooses do combine to attack and kill pythons , and that they do not devour the dead reptile , but let it lie and putrefy , returning to the spot every day , until they find that the maggots are large and numerous , when they will feast on these . It has also been said about our mongooses , that they imitate the call of gallinaceous wild birds , and thus attract them near enough to seize and eat them . There is no doubt that among the many various sounds which they are able to produce , there are some which are an almost exact imitation of the voice of the francolin ; but here the story ends , for mongooses , like dogs , refuse to eat game birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their species , banded mongooses are no danger to poultry , although they will sometimes start charging chickens for fun , as dogs do . Their natural food consists chiefly of amphibians , small reptiles , mollusks , insects , spiders , and mice . Of snails they are extremely fond . To break their shells , they seize them with their hands and , with unerring aim and marvelous strength , propel them through between their hind legs , against a rock or a tree in front of which they post themselves for that purpose , sometimes bucking with incredible swiftness , just in time to let the projectile pass clear underneath . They treat large eggs in the same manner , a habit which accounts for a common belief that eggs form the chief item of their bill of fare . As a matter of fact , they much prefer a snail to an egg , and they will not eat the latter if they have other , more congenial food , although they will generally break the egg , just to amuse themselves , even if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are also very keen on eating batrachians . They dig these out of their aestivation-holes , which they discover by the scent . Frogs they will eat without preparation , but toads they roll about first like a rolling-pin , the object being , no doubt , to make them get rid of their secretion . They handle hairy caterpillars in the same manner before falling to . Out of a number of mongooses which I have possessed , three stand out prominently in my memory ? never to be forgotten . One of them , Rikki-Tikki , was my companion for close on eight years ; the two others ? two ladies , called Maskini ( Swahili : ' poor person ' ) , and Mshenzi ( Swahili : ' uncivilized ? entered into my life two years after he did and preceded him in death by one year and six months respectively . Only once , as long as this symbiosis lasted , have we been separated for the duration of thirty-six hours . I can therefore write about them with as much authority as could Boswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent , uninterrupted and solitary , in a forestof the Shire highlands , my chief pleasure consisted in the rambles which I took every morning in the company of these three friends and my two fox terriers . The five of them enjoyed these excursions even more than I did , being scarcely able to restrain their impatience when , after my early breakfast , the time to start was getting near . The greatest sport for the mongooses , and , par ricochet , for me , who watched them , was the hunting of tarantulas . These love to build their underground dwellings ? which are shaped somewhat bell-like with a small , sometimes invisible , hole on the surface ? along the native paths . When the mongcoses followed these , they now and then stopped short , and applied their little pink noses to the ground , sniffing . If the scent appeared promising , the lucky discoverer at once started digging with the greatest energy and an excitement which increased as the orifice grew larger . From time to time the digging was interrupted and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the work was resumed with renewed activity . Occasionally the digger was shoved off by her mate , ? never , however , by Rikki-Tikki , who , like most male mammals and birds , always gave precedence to the ladies , ? when a short tussle ensued , and the burrowing was taken up again by the winner of the contest . Sometimes it happened that , after repeated aspirations , the digging was abruptly discontinued , the hunter having come to the conclusion that the fortress was tenantless . But when this was not the case , as soon as the size of the hole allowed it , the long-clawed hand and arm were inserted into it to the elbow , and a most careful and thorough groping began inside , guided by the sense of touch only , with what sensations for the unfortunate tarantula one may imagine : feelings which must be identical with those of the boy in Wells 's War of the Worlds , when the mechanic tentacle of the Martians was groping for a victim inside the but where he was hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ascertained beyond a doubt , came the denouement , as quick as lightning . One sudden backward movement of the groping foreleg , and the spider , jerked out of the hole , came flying in an arc to a foot or two beyond the aperture ; before it had time to recover from its surprise and indignation it was seized , and its dangerous mandibles crushed with a single bite . Then the hunter sat down , and deliberately , and with evident gusto , munched the fat body . But it would be a mistake to conclude that animals which stand as high in the scale of sentient beings as zebra mongooses are addicted to no other pleasures than those of the table . They are also passionately fond of music , and they love perfumes . It sometimes happened that , carried away by the ardor of the chase , they turned a deaf ear on me when I started to return to my camp . On these occasions I always resorted to the same expedient . One of the two boys ' who usually accompanied me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stray , was sent back to the camp for his limba , ' the native guitar , which he started playing as soon as he had come back to our hunting-party . The moment he struck the first chords , the three mongooses desisted from whatever pursuit they happened to be engaged in and ran toward him , and then , as we all turned homeward , followed close on his heels , tumbling one over the other , and never left him until the music ceased ! We must have looked a funny procession ! First , the boy pinching the strings of his instrument ; then the three eager mongooses , the white man , the two fox terriers , the other native , all walking single file on the narrow path ; I imagine the surprise which a European fresh from Europe ? nothing of course surprises an African ? would have felt if he had suddenly encountered us in the forest . No doubt he would have thought that he was facing a colored reincarnation of the Pied Piper of Hamelin ! That they are fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest when they inhale the odor of flowers , frequently standing up on their hind legs and stretching themselves in order to reach to the height of the blossoms . Their favorite smell , however , is civet . Civet cats are very frequent in the Myombo forests of Nyasaland , where one often hears at night their monotonous call as they walk about in search of those berries and fruits which constitute their principal food . They have the curious habit of getting rid of their surplus wealth by rubbing themselves against the foot of trees ; such spots are conspicuous by the odor of civet which emanates from them and permeates the atmosphere in their immediate neighborhood . To strike one of these places on our wanderings was , to my mongooses , an occasion of excitement and pleasure . It almost seemed as if they became intoxicated by the powerful perfume ; they would rush to the anointed tree , embrace it and rub themselves against it with all the appearance of the greatest enjoyment , and it was only with difficulty that they could be prevailed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also love the smell of tobacco . Both Maskini and Mshenzi rolled about on my knees with delight when I blew the smoke of my cigar at them , and tried to catch the clouds of smoke with their paws ; one of the favorite tricks of Rikki-Tikki was to seize unexpectedly the burning cigar in my mouth , with his half-prehensile fingers , jump to the ground with it , roll it about until the fire had gone out , and then tear it to pieces and wallow on the debris . But woe to me if I attempted to recover the cigar once it had been taken possession of ! So far , however , from indiscriminately favoring all kinds of perfume , my pets were , on the contrary , fastidious in their choice . I once bought , for their special benefit , a bottle of strong scent of the kind which is sold in native stores and in great demand with Negroes . They treated it with the utmost contempt , turning away with an expression of disgust after one inhalation . Zebra mongooses are strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and differ from one another probably as much as human beings , although certain qualities and defects , as , for instance , courage , and a quick temper , are common to all . In their tastes they vary as much as in their qualities . No two individuals will favor exactly the same diet or prefer the same dishes . All my mongooses , for instance , liked pork and chicken , but only one of them ate beef , and only one goats ' meat . Maskini doted on tadpoles , which neither Rikki-Tikki nor Mshenzi would touch . The same applies to their sympathies and antipathies . ? Rikki-Tikki loathed all Europeans except myself , and attacked them savagely when he had the opportunity , so that I had to shut him up every time I saw a visitor approaching my dwelling . When , the visitor gone but still visible in the distance , I released Rikki-Tikki from his confinement , he would rush to a place whence he could overlook the road and stand there , head erect , uttering savage screams , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiar way he had , which appeared very human . But to all natives , without exception , he behaved in the most friendly manner . The Sultana Mshenzi was just the reverse . She greeted all white men with the greatest cordiality but could not stanch natives , not even those of my ' boys ' whom she had known for years . They had to be constantly on the lookout when moving about , for , when they passed too close to her she VOL. 738 ? NO. 4 immediately made a dash at their feet , an idiosyncrasy which , alas ! brought about her untimely end . And Maskini , the second female , who had the sweetest of tempers , entertained no color-prejudices of any kind ! It was interesting to observe the behavior toward one another of the mongooses according to their sex . Two male mongooses , except when they have been brought up together from childhood , will not tolerate each other and keep on fighting like stags until they are separated . The manner of these contests is very peculiar ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , apparently , to no other purpose than that of making the antagonist lose ground . But these seemingly harmless efforts , which are carried on with the greatest patience , are from time to time interrupted by a sudden , fierce seizing-hold with the teeth , on the soft part of the nose , or the lips , or the nape of the neck , where severe wounds are inflicted . I have found it quite impossible to accustom to one another two adult male mongooses . Female mongooses also fight , but never without a special reason , and their battles are much less fierce than those of males , being almost entirely restricted to the shoulder-to-shoulder wrestling just mentioned . Very rarely do they make use of their teeth . What they lack in dash and violence , however , these fights make up in dogged pertinacity , for they may last for hours ! Whenever Mshenzi and Maskini engaged in one of these wrestling-matches , Rikki-Tikki used to behave in a very characteristic manner . It was quite obvious that he took an intense and painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a sportsman to interfere . He would , on these occasions , approach without haste to within a couple of yards from the two litigants , and then watch them , his eyes riveted on them , standing quite still . His expression , while he did so , was incredibly human . He looked puzzled , shocked , and sometimes I thought I saw a slight flicker of amusement pass in his gaze . After standing and watching like this for some considerable time , he would move away abruptly , follow his own occupations for a while , then come back straight to where the fight was proceeding , and again stand and watch with the same half-sorrowful , half-whimsical expression ; and in this way he continued to behave until the two antagonists became tired and separated . As a rule , these fights originated in an attempt on the part of one of the two ladies to seize a plaything of which the other had taken possession . All mongooses , and the sedate and worldwise Rikki-Tiliki made no exception to this rule , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for their national game of Fives , which I have described above in connection with snails and eggs . For they do not use foodstuffs only , in this manner . They take the greatest delight in propelling any small , hard object against a solid surface , with a strength which is prodigious for their size , and in seeing it rebound to a distance of many yards , when it is eagerly searched for ? this is also part of the entertainment ? and then used again and again for the same purpose . As it is quite impossible to recover by force , without being severely bitten , an object of which a mongoose has taken possession , one had to keep carefully out of their reach all those things , like , for instance , watches , or liqueur glasses , which would have suffered if they had been used as high-velocity ammunition . They were awfully keen on getting hold of small coins , and used to ransack all my pockets for odd shillings and pennies , inserting their hands into each one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , they brought it to the surface with their fingers , seized it with their teeth , jumped to the ground , and made off . Maskini and Mshenzi I had to watch on those occasions , for there was always the possibility of the coins getting lost if they were taken too far away or into remote corners . Not so , however , where Rikki-Tikki was concerned ! For , strange to say , that little creature , which had been bred in the wilderness and belonged to an order as remote from human influence as are lions , leopards , or tigers , possessed an innate sense of honesty , such as is only rarely found in the first representative of the Primates , who is still supposed by some to be the fountainhead of all the virtues ? . No mat , ter how far out of sight and to what distance from the but or tent Rikki-Tikki had taken the borrowed coin , he invariably brought it back of his own accord , when his game was finished , and dropped it on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment afterward to see if I had noticed it . Needless to say , there had never been the slightest attempt on my part to teach Rikld-Tikki to retrieve . What a mongoose does , it does proprio mote . It is easier to train a hyena than to train a mongoose , for there exists no creature in the world more impatient than the latter of coercion or interference . I have been snarled at by mongooses because I had tried to interfere with their mates while they were near ; and , once when a young mongoose , for some reason , got angry with me and attempted to bite me , another , standing by , jumped toward it and shoved it off , growling . I have known only one other mongoose which shared that peculiarity of Rikki-Tikki 's to return property which it had commandeered . I did not keep it very long , for unfortunately it died before it was full-grown . It must be added , however , that Rikki-Tikki was already over two years old when I first became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite sport . Mongooses take a long time before they are full-grown , and they do not attain maturity until they are two years of age . None of the mongooses which are offered for sale on the coast are full-grown , just as in the case of grivet monkeys , and I do not remember ever having even seen a full-grown mongoose in Zanzibar , where so many used to be kept . They are probably all Killed before they attain full size , either because the natives fear the temper of the adults , or because they want their skins . The long time they take to grow up ? so much longer than do cats - would seem to indicate that , in congenial surroundings and under favorable circumstances , they might live to a considerable age . Rikki-Tikki was still in the prime of life ? nearly eight years old ? when he became ill and died . To my great regret , all my mongooses have remained without issue . I have never heard of zebra mongooses breeding in captivity , however great may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations in this respect have been confirmed by all the natives whom I have consulted on the subject . My pets were absolutely free to roam about as they liked , wherever I lived at the time , the only restrictions on their movements being occasioned by my anxiety lest they should stray and be killed by natives . Yet this moderate measure of interference was sufficient to prevent them from breeding . No doubt , their ideas of liberty differ from ours ; however great may be , in our own minds , the freedom which they enjoy , they themselves still look upon it as captivity . I regretted this circumstance all the more , as both Mshenzi and Maskini gave me evidence enough of the strength of their maternal instinct . I happened to keep , at one time , a female Nyasaland cat , a breed of domestic cats indigenous to Nyasaland and Zambesia , which in appearance is indistinguishable from that of the wild bush cat and most probably identical with it . It was a great event in my household , when Shri , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of three kittens marked exactly like herself , which she had , so far , kept hidden in the thatch of the roof . The two female mongooses , when they saw them , went beyond themselves with joy . It was the latent maternal instinct suddenly awakened , manifesting itself in a touching and pathetic way . They put their arms round the necks of the kittens , and licked and fondled them , as if they had been their own , and when I had prepared a place for Shri and her brood , they remained with the latter , and were not to be persuaded to leave the room . In the beginning I felt some anxiety , because I was not quite sure what unexpected turn these demonstrations of affection might suddenly take . But my apprehensions disappeared as minute after minute passed without bringing any marked alteration in their quality . I had also feared that Shri , who could be terribly fierce on occasion , and who , moreover , was considerably larger than the mongooses , might object to their endeavors to monopolize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other ways , she was perfectly surprising . Wiser than her master , she did not for a second show the slightest doubt as to the benevolent character of the endearments which her babies had to endure . After a day or two , she even came to the conclusion that nothing could be more convenient than this unceasing attendance of Mshenzi and Maskini on her family ; for she allowed herself , between fulfillments of her unavoidable maternal ministrations , the relaxation of frequent and prolonged strolls in the neighborhood . Rikki-Tikki , as might be supposed , took no part in this cajoling , but , after one coldly surprised glance at the newcomers , ceased to take any notice of them . As long as the kittens were too small to leave the room , the interest with which they inspired the two lady mongooses never flagged , and included all their actions . I shall always remember the day when one of the kittens , for the first time , gave voice . Both mongooses began to scream in a way which is common to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which caused two Negroes , who witnessed it , to roar with laughter . Strange to say ! From the day when the young cats first followed their mother outside , they forfeited all the affection of their two friends , and were henceforth ignored . The reference to the ' eternal feminine ' brings me , reluctantly , to the mention of the least pleasant side of my long and affectionate friendship with Rikki-Tikki . Alas ! he , like elephants , stags , and camels , became musth ' every year at the beginning of the rainy season ? a most trying ordeal for myself and my household , but particularly for myself . He had three or four fits of musthness during the first half of the rainy season , at intervals of about a month 's time , and each fit lasted nine days . Rudyard Kipling 's mahout says about his musth elephant : ' It is me he wants to kill , because he loves me most of all ' ? or words to that effect ; and the same was the case with RikkiTikki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hatred of which he was capable were then concentrated against me , and me alone , while he left my native servants unmolested . As is the case with lions , leopards , and the large birds of prey , Zebra mongooses are monogamous , and the amorous passion of Rikki-Tikki , whenever he had been hit by Cupid 's arrow , had for its object one only of his two companions , and that one always the same through all the years ? Mshenzi , the negrophobe . All his efforts , during these periods of trial , tended to one object ? to keep me and the Sultana separated . These fits of temporary insanity did not ap . pear all at once in their full strength ; they evolved gradually , from what was , during the first two or three days , merely a display of bad humor and ill temper , into the maniacal fury of the end . At that time , he tried to prevent his consort from taking any food at all , so that the poor creature had to subsist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she managed to pick up on the run ! Several times I tried to feed her while I was sitting on a table with my legs drawn up ; but Othello would have none of this and chased her away mercilessly when she attempted to stop . On one of these occasions he jumped up and caught my hand and fastened his pointed fangs into it like a ferret , so that I had the greatest difficulty in shaking him off , the flesh being badly lacerated in the action . On another occasion he tore away with his teeth a large piece of leather from a mosquito-boot which I was wearing . Fortunately he just failed to reach the foot . Whenever I happened to live in a house , I kept the two shut up in a separate room as long as Rikki-Tikki 's dementia amorosa lasted ; but this was impracticable when I was camping , and under the latter circumstances ? a stockade in the open being excluded from fear of leopards ? there was nothing to do except to be incessantly on the lookout during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut them both up in a cage into which they had to be decoyed . I think I hear some people saying : ' I can not understand how you could , put up with all this ! I should have ed the brute if I had been you ! ' To which I make reply : ' I do not think you would have , not even if you are a professional slayer of elephants , not if Rikki-Tikki had shared your fortunes , as he had mine , with unwavering devo- tion and loyalty , year after year , the short intervals of " musth " excluded . Not if you had ever seen him when , the period of his trial over , he crawled up , timidly to my chair , and then , after some anxious hesitation , having noticed no discouraging gesture , he climbed up on my knees , and thrust his cold little nose under the bosom of my shirt , and nestled close to me ? humility and apology and affection personified . Of course you would have forgiven him every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown the stronger for the ordeal through which it had passed ! ' During the remainder of the year , Rikki-Tikki showed no preference for either of his two companions , and he often used to play with one or the other after the manner of cats or dogs . But there could be no doubt that the sweet-tempered Maskini recognized Mshent A 's position as favorite and meekly submitted , for whenever she was engaged in playing with Rikki-Tikki and the Augusta approached , she immediately ceded her place to the latter andwent quietly away , while Mshenzi herself accepted this self-effacement as her due . One of the most wonderful attributes of zebra mongooses is their copia verborum . They dispose of so many different sounds , uttered in so great a variety of intonations , and with such convincing expressiveness , of joy , of sorrow , of anger , of regret and disappointment , of expectation , of longing , of desire , of surprise , of anxiety and fear , that it amounts to a language . Unlike any other mammals known to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight of one another , as , for instance , when they happen to be in two different rooms . They often talk in their sleep , and Rikki-Tikki , from time to time , gave vent , while sound asleep , to an endless lament , a series of long-drawn though not unharmonious wails in a rising and falling cadence , expressive of heartrending sorrow and distress , painful to listen to in the silence of the night . Yet another curious peculiarity of theirs is , that they look , intently , and with evident interest , at stretches of country lying in front of them , when they find themselves at the top of a hill or of a mountain where they have not previously been . Their eyesight is marvelously sharp , and they detect birds of prey ? the only thing in the world which they fear , apart from leopards and servals ? at incredible altitudes in the sky . IV Those wild creatures of the bush are capable of feelings of affection and love as strong as those of men . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from maturity , two years before the appearance on the scene of Mshenzi and Maskini , I owned a nearly full-grown female mongoose , a charming and affectionate creature whose name was Mzuri , and the twa became great friends . About a year later Mzuri was killed by a native who threw a stone at her , accidentally , as he said , because he wanted to prevent her from following him out of the camp . Rikki-Tikki was not present when this happened , nor did he see the body of his dead comrade . During the first twenty-four hours after her disappearance , he gave no signs of worry or uneasiness , obviously thinking that she was somewhere about and would soon turn up . On the second day , however , he began to show symptoms of distress , and started searching about the camp and in its vicinity , standing still to listen from time to time . As his search proved fruitless , his unrest developed into a perfect fever . He extended the field of his investigations far from the camp , diving into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the while he was calling her in the most affectionate tone of voice , as if he thought that she was in hiding somewhere , and that he must persuade her to come back . These untiring efforts lasted from morning till evening , when he returned into the tent , quite exhausted , to sleep with me as was his habit . Once , during the night , there was a noise heard near the tent , as of some small animal passing or approaching . Never to my dying day shall I forget the cry of joy which Rikki-Tikki gave when he jumped down from my bed and out of the tent ? only to crawl back slowly and disconsolately a few minutes later , to regain his post by my side . I had , by that time , decided to return to Mwakete , where I had spent a former rainy season and built a larger shed , almost a house , which I had used as my headquarters . My return-journey to that place took me over country which I had not yet passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange surroundings and to the excitement of travel , Rikki-Tikki 's grief , during that short journey , which took me about five days , appeared to be sub . siding . I began to feel hope that he would at last recover from it . But I was , alas , destined to be disappointed . Both Rikki-Tikki and Mzuri had been in 1VIwakete with me when I had lived there last , and , as soon as we arrived , the familiar surroundings kindled afresh , in the former 's mind , the memory of his lost friend . He again began his hopeless quest . It was not the habit of my mongooses , as a rule , to leave the immediate vicinity of my camp , unless they were following me , and that Rikki-Tikki should have de . parted from this habit in his anxiety to find his vanished companion shows how profound was his affection for her . Once , as I had lost trace of him , I sent after him a search-party of boys , who found him at a distance of over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to resign himself to the inevitable , and I succeeded at about that time in pro . curing another lady mongoose to keep him company ; but she was still very young , and , although the two became friendly , she did not obliterate altogether from his memory the image of his first love . After the lapse of six months , I left Mwakete for Buanji , a country situated at the northern end of the Livingstone Range . In the course of this journey my safari crossed a former track of mine , where I had passed a year before , when Mzuri was still alive . We camped at the same place where we had camped on that first occasion . After the tent had been pitched , and Rikki-Tikki released out of his traveling-box , he became restless , started ferreting about in one direction and another , and finally took up the search again with such intensity , that , as I in-. tended to continue my march on the following morning and feared that I might be delayed if he strayed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the death of Mshenzi , six years later , ? she had been preceded in death by Jlaskini , ? it took much longer ere he realized that she had gone from his life forever . I did all that was humanly possible to find a successor for her , but I failed ? and Rikki-Tikki , once he had given up hope , refused all food , and died , worn to a skeleton . A few nights before the end he uttered , while asleep , in an inexpressibly tender and wistful tone of voice , the call which he used toward her during her lifetime . The affection of mongooses for friends who belong to the human race is as great as that of dogs . My mongooses , when I had to dispense with ? their company on leaving the house or camp , had to be prevented by force- or stratagem from following me , for nothing else would deter them from doing so , even in a pitch-dark night , although ; they are diurnal animals . When , from my camp , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would run hundreds of yards to meet me , and when t they reached me and I stopped to greet them , lie down and lay their heads on my feet as a sign of submission and love . Although zebra mongooses are fond ; of bathing and like to splash about with water in a shallow tub , they do not as a E rule enter deep water of their own act cord , good swimmers though they are in an emergency . Yet I have been told about two of them which jumped after their master , a carpenter of the Berlin Lutheran mission , into a deep pool . ? In the house , they show their affection for their master , and the pleasure which they take in his presence , in many small ways , by act and speech . My affection for Rikki-Tikki turned almost to idolatry after a bad accident which I had in a wild part of Ukinga where 1 happened to spend eight months without meeting a single European . He was the only mongoose in my possession at that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my faithful old fox terrier , had been killed by native curs a short time before . During the six weeks which my illness lasted , and which I passed almost entirely on my bed , as I was unable to move without feeling excruciating pains , RikkiTikki voluntarily shared my confinement and never left my presence except for a few moments at a time . I feel not a shadow of a doubt that he knew that something was wrong with me and that he remained with me day and night for that reason . He gave up his habit of running about in search of beetles and other creatures , a habit in which he always indulged when I was well , and which he took up again as soon as I had recovered . Apparently insignificant actions sometimes throw more light on the psyche of man and beast than a more spectacular behavior . I should class within the former category the fact that my mongooses , when they wanted to be scratched , ? a proceeding which they greatly liked , ? intimated their wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as they were young , when they felt hungry they had a habit of climbing on my knees and pointing with their own mouths at mine , in a marked and quite unmistakable way , until I tumbled ' to their meaning . Their skill in opening complicated fastenings , including bolts and hooks , was astonishing . No box or basket was safe from their investigations for any length of time . And although it takes days for a cat or a dog to discover the proper way to get inside a mosquito curtain , mongooses find out at once that what they have to do is to lift it and pass underneath . In the preceding pages I have attempted to show that zebra mongooses possess some of the qualities which we admire most in men . One may safely assume that if , while remaining psychically unchanged , they walked about exclusively on their hind legs and had no caudal appendage , some society for the protection of aborigines would include them in the number of its proteges .

It is with a bitter feeling that I bear testimony , in conclusion , to the melancholy fact , that the missions do nothing to prevent this wanton destruction of highly gifted , sensitive , and harmless creatures . Neither must I omit to mention , 0 Christians ! that the Herpestes Zebra has one ally , one only : the True Believer does not hunt it . Allah Akhbar !
