txt While leaders in the Modern Churchmen 's Union of America are keeping their ears every moment to the ground waiting for the word that Bishop Manning has summoned Dr. Parks to a trial for heresy , the Rev. Dr. William M. Gilbert , rector of St. Paul 's Episcopal Church , Yonkers , pointed out yesterday that Bishop Manning has not at present sufficient grounds to try Dr. Parks Dr Gilbert is a member of the Standing Committee of the Diocese of New York and a close personal friend of Bishop Manning . He recalled that Bishop Manning did not have as good a case against Dr. Parks as he had against the Rev. Dr. Percy Stickney Grant a year ago , when DI . In a sermon , questioned the divinity of Christ , Bishop Manning called on him either to retract or face P. trial . Dr. Grant did not retract , but he sent Bishop Manning an explanation which made it impossible for Bishop Manning to consider his sermon a denial of the deity of Christ . Dr. Gilbert also pointed out that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodily resurrection of Christ ; that he did oot say whether he disbelieved in these doctrines ; that he simply discussed reasons why some could believe and others could not , and argued that disbelief In these two articles of the Creed did not disbar one from being a good churchman . Bishop 's View of Grant Case . Dr. Gilbert called atti.ution to the declaration of Bishop Manning before the Episcopal Church Club of New York Feb. 8 last at a dinner in the WaldorfAstoria Hotel , when the Grant controversy was at its heig-ht . Bishop Manning said at that time : " I am receiving a great many touching letters , " he said , " fr , im earnest Christian people of all Churches who are perplexed and troubled by certain recent events , and I do not wonder that they are perplexed and troubled . " To reassure the writers of these letters and others who feel as they do , I want to say with all possible plainness at this representative gathering of our diocese that if any minister of this Church , Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our i .. ord Jesus Christ and express this denial in words clear , courageous and unambiguous , such as the Church can deal with , no one need have the least fear that the Church will shrink from meeting this issue and that she will fail to take definite action , and the whole body of the clergy and people of this Church will approve and support-such action . But the point to b. , kept clear in the mind is that the Church can not take formal action against denial of her ' faith unless the denial is expressed in words that are clear arid unevasive and are acknowledged by their author . " In conclusion Dr. Gilbert said that although members of the Modern Churchmen 's Union were arguing that Bishop Manning would have to take action against Dr. Parks because of the declaration in his Waldorf-Astoria speech , ou the other hand it gave Bishop Manning the surest ground in the world for not taking any steps to try Dr. Parks .

He said : " The ' Modern Churchmen ' say the Bishops ca n't change the doctrine of the church , which is true . But it is the Modernists who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bishops do in the pastoral letter is simply to uphold the doctrine of the Church as it has always been believed and taught . Theo Bishops did exactly what they are required to do . Of course they can not put forth new doctrine . And that is the very last thing , I am informed , they attempted to do . The Bishops did not try to change the doctrine . They issued a ' Pastoral Letter ' telling the Modernists that they can not make changes in - the doctrine . " Liberal Revolt Spreads .

He said that the next move was up to Bishop William T Manning of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of New York , who:n Dr. Parks in his sermon last inundav defied to bring him to trial as a heretic . The Modernists do not expect Bishop Manning to ignore Dr. Parks 's defiance , said Dr. Tyson , and anticipate some definite action . Bishop Manning remained silent again yesterday . He gave no hint of what course he intends to follow , and declined to discuss the case with newspaper reporters . Dr. Parks also kept his peace .

It was apparent that Dr. Parks 's dramatic gesture had brought to a climax a situation affecting the whole religious world . In practically all the churches the same battle is going on .

" After going over the case with Mr. Heaton I called up Bishop Manning and told him that after a careful consideration of the whole matter I did not think there ought to be a trial and that I was going to write to Bishop Moore of Dallas to this effect . Bishop Manning was willing to accept my view of the case . He explained to me he was entirely willing to write to Bishop Moore and express the hope that no trial would be found necessary in the case of Mr. Heaton . And Dr. Manning did write this letter .

" Dr. Stires said that his own theological views were in complete accord with the position taken by the House of Bishops in their pastoral letter of Nov. 14 and 15 , requiring all ministers of the church to Subscribe to the virgin birth and other doctrines enunciated in the creeds . It was this pastoral letter , which all rectors were directed to read to their congregations , that provoked the present storm of protest by the modernists . Dr. Stires said that the pastoral letter expressed the unanimous opinion of the bishops present at the meeting in Dallas . Texas , last month , and that " if other bishops differed it was unfortunate that they did not attend the meeting and make their position known . " Says Mr. Heaton Refuses Transfer .

' " Dr. Tyson denied charges that the modernists were seeking to split the Episcopal Church . ' , Every liberal minister loves his Church and desires to stay in it , " said Dr. Tyson . " No liberal minister forces anybody to accept his beliefs . He rejoices that the Church is comprehensive and many-sided . The last thing lie wishes is to drive his fundamentalist brother from the Church . But he is determined that he shall have the same liberty that he gladly gives to others . " Speaking on " The Bible in the Light of Modern Thought " before a meeting of the Tyson Lectureship Foundation at the Hotel Plaza yesterday afternoon . Dr. Tyson said that the modern man stood for unrestricted inquiry into the origin and reinterpretation of our religion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a Fundamentalist production . The Protestant Fundamentalists are a unit in agreeing that God 's revelations to man were completed in the seventeenth century . They have a conception of religion that belongs to the Middle Ages . Calls Bryan Ignorant . " The Fundamentalists believe that whatever is found between the covers of the Bible is literally true , that there can be no error in it , that it is the infallible last court of appeal and that every part of it is equally true . Mr. Bryan is an ignorant man in questions of history . He knows nothing of history and shows it every time he opens his mouth . He believes that he is speaking the word of Jews Christ , whereas he and other Fundamentalists are doing nothing more than reproducing a seventeenth century Western European tradition . " There are Fundamentalists and Modernists in all the denominations . There are Modernists in the Catholic Church , too , but the marvelous system of discipline in that church makes it probable that it will be some time off before Modernism appears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modernism before his congregation , he is whisked off to a monastery , and you never hear of any Modernism in the Catholic Church . Not a newspaper in New York dares to print anything derogatory to the Roman Catholic Church . The newspapers know this and we know it , and we know Why they do n't print it . It *ill be a long time before we will hear of Modernism succeskut in the Catholic Church , but we will hear of it eventually , because it is incredible that any group of Wien should stand apart from the rest of mankind . " Presbyterian Objections . Spring , which decreed that the virgin birth , the physical resurrection and three other articles of faith were essential parts of church doctrine . Three New York ministers are reported to have signed the protest against the five articles . They are the Rev. William Pierson Merrill of the Brick Presbyterian Church . the Rev.

One of the Presbyterian Modernists said yesterday that the protest statement does not repudiate the five articles , as has been reported in some newspapers , but that it insists they are tot essential and can not be made a test ' for the people of the church . " The church is big enough for everybody , " this man . said . " This is no insurrection or organization of liberals . It hi merely the act of a group of people who have got together to reaffirm the belief that the church can hold people who differ in opinion on these matters . " The Rev. F. M.
