Reflecting that all good things come slowly , that Rome was not built in a day , that patience is a virtue , that duty comes before ambition and business before pleasure , etc. , etc. , Candidate Smith passed a busy and contented last week in his executive mansion at Albany . He functioned in different capacities : <P> Financier . He reported to the people of New York on the state of their finances at the end of another fiscal year . The <P> State budget had increased some 16 millions , reaching $232,641,701 . He explained how the money was spent , for highways , education , hospitals , prisons , conservation , claims , public works . He pointed out that the Legislature , controlled by Republicans , had only been able to lop $25,000 from his Administration figures , and had tried to add on " unnecessary " appropriations of $219,000 , which he had vetoed . He anticipated a political outcry against " extravagance " by promising to defend his fiscal policies and the $16,000,000 increase anywhere , any time . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixth of May , and nobody gave me a tumble . If any photographers had been there I 'd have stood on my head for them . " That was Father Smith talking-joshing with reporters before the stately wedding of his daughter , Catherine . He pretended to know nothing of the plans . He perspired , showed his gold teeth , welcomed the guests , pointed out presents , laughed a lot and made jokes . Now and then he quietly put his arm around the slender , highstrung girl of 24 , who , on the bright Saturday forenoon , became Mrs. Francis Joseph Quillinan . At the Albany Cathedral , Patrick Joseph Cardinal Hayes of Manhattan performed the ceremony and transmitted a special blessing from Pius XI . Afterwards , a father 's natural emotions on his daughter 's wedding day were merged with the recurrent emotions of a Candidate . For besides the " boys " from Tammany Hall , many a bigwig Democrat was in Albany to toast the bride and smoke a cigar and have a chat-Boss Frank Hague of New Jersey , Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo and the Bosses of Syracuse and Utica . <P> Patriot . James Thomas ( " Tom Tom " ) Heflin , Alabama 's curious senior Senator , who mortally hates and fears the Roman Pope , advertised a Protestant rally backed " by the Ku Klux Klan and other patriots , " to be held June 17 in Hurstsville , just outside the Albany city limits . Senator Heflin promised to heffle ; admission , 25 . <P> Rome . Observers marvelled , and wondered what Candidate Smith and his managers would think , when James John Walker , New York City 's glib and dapper Mayor , rated to be as smart and faithful a supporter as the Brown Derby could have , touched upon a ticklish subject , in a public speech ( to some Roman Catholics ) as follows : " It is not so long since I was forced to listen to a tirade of a sort not unfamiliar to you , when a friend from one of the bucolic districts asked me if it were not a fact that all my public acts were dictated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him-they were not , but more 's the pity . <P> " Then he said to me : ' Now really , do n't you know that if Al Smith is elected President he will take his orders from Rome ?
