txt German Law on Foreigners ' Money . To the Editor of The New York Times : When I arrived at Hamburg an official requested me to State how much money I had brought in foreign values . in return for which I received a permit , by reason of which I have since been allowed to take out as much as I brought in . During my stay at one of the German watering places a German confided in me that he had accumulated a number of Haiglish pounds and American dollars and be wanted to know whether I could help him to get it out of his country . In order to avoid payment of taxes , for self-preservation , as they term it , the Germans attempt to export all their belongings of value . This explains to you that the law controlling the taking out of money from Germany is perfectly just and Americans should respect laws of the country they live in or travel through . Id .
