Gentlemen visiting the House of Representatives ' Chamber in the Capitol often used to point out a striking , little cripple on crutches , his hair awry , his lips compressed . Obviously , he wanted to talk . Gentlemen would turn to their guide , say curiously , " Who is that man ? " And their guide , if well informed , would perhaps answer thus : " Well , he has a name-William David Upshaw-but is commonly known as ' Earnest Willie . ' He comes from the Bible-loving , liquor-hating region of Georgia , and like most cripples who do not become incurably bitter , he is an incurable romantic . When he was 18 , he fell from a load of wood , hurt his back , remained for seven years in a bed constructed upon four tree trunks coming up through his house because vibration caused him agony . That was 42 years ago . " <P> Courageous , chivalrous , when he ran for the first of his three Congressional terms seven years ago he talked from a wheel chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar Watkins ever went to worthy combat or shivered lance at Camelot or Stirling . " Himself lost in Camelot 's misty lore , Knight Upshaw may often think in terms of questing a Holy Grail . <P> If so , the grail for him is a wineglass , empty , upside down . He speaks for Prohibition ( sometimes at $100 a speech from the Anti-Saloon League ) fanatically , * beautifully , *interminably. * <P> He advocates such extremely malignant Prohibition policies as imprisonment of all men who take a drink . But he is colorful , sincere . . . . <P> His career is , at least temporarily , checked . Last week , Georgians became politically active , held a primary-Democratic , of course . Mr. Upshaw lost the deciding county of his district by 24 votes to one Leslie J. Steele . <P> Vexed , chagrined Congressman Upshaw announced : " Private investigations have revealed that there is indisputable evidence of more than $100,000 of vote money having been sent into this district to defeat me . . . . " <P> <P> * A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends , and comrades of a sacred fellowship , and fathers , most of you , of sons and daughters who are to be your crown and joy or your voiceless despair , I summon you to the comradeship of helping to make Washington safer for our homes here and the homes of the Nation everywhere . I do this for the sake of making the most beautiful flag in all the world ' a stainless flag ' before the eyes of all the world . I do this for the sake of the Constitution . ... I do it for the sake of the ideals that must control your own children , who are dearer to you than the ruddy drops that gather in your hearts . I do this for the sake of my own little daughters and the homes they are to make some day , perhaps for some of your misguided sons . ... I hold aloft this picture dream of my own girlies and declare : ' These are my jewels . ' And these are my reasons , my radiant , priceless reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demons of hell with the poisoned enemies of our homes , our churches , our schools , and our threatened civilization . . . .
