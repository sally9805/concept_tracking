txt AID NEEDED FOR GOOD WORK Commissioner Coler Makes an Appeal for the Big Sisters . I wish to call your attention to a movement which , in my opinion , is not . only making a success of a peculiarly delicate piece of welfare work , but is at the same time proving the feasibility of an idea which must eventually become the governing principle of all private philanthropies in New York City . The Big Sisters , headed by Lady Armstrong of the Catholic Big Sisters ; Mrs. Sidney Borg of the Jewish organization and Mrs. Willard Parker Jr . of the Protestant , places women representatives in the courts to lend a helping hand to women and girls who get into difficulties . This work , conducted by these three separate but harmoniously " adjusted organizations , is in itself deserving of generous . support . At the moment , however , I should like to centre attention upon the significance of the Cooperative Committee which determines the policies of . this organization and Conducts its united financial appeals . This committee is a convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Catholic and Jew can not work together and at the same time retain their spiritual independence . Nowhere within my observation is the spirit of cooperation and understanding among the three great faiths so well exemplified as in the work of this body . Mutual recognition of a great principle is the thing that makes possible this splendid cooperative effort . If there are elements in the three great faiths that will always keep their devotees in some degree separated as social groups , there are other elements that will always bind them together in the common service of humanity . Notably among the latter is the basic principle of the preservation of the family . This principle is sacred alike to all three of the faiths , and at the same time fundamental to the welfare of the State . Common adherence to this principle , regardless of religious distinctions , is creating a definite trend among private philanthropies which promises well for the future . I feel that this trend is toward organizations based upon some great spiritual conviction , and that all so-called non-sectarian work which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are certain things that the State must do . Ambulance service , for example , could not be left to the uncertainty of private support . On the other hand , there are services that only private organizations imbued with spirituality can perform well . The Big Sister movement is one such service which I could never imagine being performed either by civil employes or by social workers with a background of materialistic social philosophy . The great Catholic and Jewish federations of social work in New York are fine expressions of this trend , and I am sure it will not be long before the recently formed - Protestant Federation will have equal strength . An intimate council of representatives of the three great faiths would , in my opinion , go far toward solving some of the perplexing problems in charity financing and administration which now confront our city . Neither of the faiths would lose anything that is essentially its own ; on the other hand . they would all gain in increased public confidence and support . The Big Sister movement is at the present moment conducting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his way clear to send me a check for this fund , I shall accept it and turn it over to the organization treasurer , not only as a contribution to the fine work of the Bir , Sisters , but also as an endorsement of the enlightened attitude toward cooperative social work which the organization , represents .

In 1800 , his last year , on earth , he similarly donated $384,000 of Florida bonds Issued prior to 1845 . None of these bonds was ever paid . His trustees In 1871 addressed a memorial to the Mississippi Legislature in the hope that some provision might be made for the redeinlition of the securities . The only response was an amendment to aid Mississippi State Constitution . adopted shortly afterward. forbidding payment or redemption of the bonds defaulted since 1842 .

Mrs. E.- G. ALERIWETHER. - New York . April 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution Differ From Opinions of Some People . To the Editor of The New York Times : . In these days when professional patriots ' and blind worshipers of things as they are with respect to Constitution and government presume to proscribe all advocacy and advocates of change or improvement , it may be helpful to quote a few remarks by one of the real founders , Thomas Paine , whose distinguished service to the cause- of American independence was attested on numerous occasions ' by his close friend and co-worker George Washington , as shown by authentic historical records of the early days before and after the Revolution . Regarding constitutions and allied matters , in Part II of " The Rights of Man , " written in 1792 ; Paine says : " The Constitution , of America , and also that of France , have either affixed a period for their revision or laid down the mode by which improvements shall be made . It is perhaps impossible to establish anything that combines principles with opinions - and practice which the progress of circumstances , through a length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent ; and , therefore. - to prevent inconveniences accumulating , till they discourage reformations , or provoke revolutions . it is best to provide the means of regulating them as they occur . The Rights of Man are the ' rights of all generations of men , and can not be monopolized by any . That which is worth following will be followed for the sake of its worth ; and it is in this that its security lies and not in any conditions with which it may be encumbered . When a man leaves property to his heirs , he does not connect it with an obligation that they shall accept it . Why , then , should we do otherwise with respect to constitutions ? " The best constitution that could now be devised , consistent with the condition of the present moment , may be far short of that excellence which a few years may afford . There is a morning of reason rising upon man , on the subject of government , that has not appeared before . As the barbarism of the present old Governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other , will be . changed . Man will not be brought up with the savage idea of considering his species as his enemy because the accident of birth gave the individuals existence in countries distinguished by different names ; and , as constitutions have always some relation to external as well as to domestic circumstances , the means of benefiting by every change , foreign or domestic , should be a part of every constitution . " Government ought to be as . much open to improvement as anything which appertains to man ; instead of which , it has been monopolized , from age to age , by the most ignorant and vicious of the ? human race . Need we any other proof of their wretched management than . the excess of debts and taxes with which every nation groans , and the quarrels into which they have precipitated the world ? " Whatever the form or constitution of government may be , it ought to have no other object than the general happiness . When , instead of this , ' it operates to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is on a wrong system , and ' reformation is necessary . " The foregoing embodies the real spirit of . Americanism , which , is the exact antithesis of the shoddy substitutes so smugly and noisily proclaimed on every hand by individuals and groups which exploit patriotism as a thing of individual and group benefit , than which there could be nothing more false and shameful . Patriotism , to mean anything , must mean . unselfish devotion to the good of the country ; and the good of the country must include all , not merely a few , of its inhabitants . What is most needed today . is a renaissance of the real spirit of Americanism , for the good not only of Americans but of all mankind as well . America today is sunk in the mire of sordid statesmanship , cheap partisanship and unprincipled exploitation of every variety , and the only salvation lies in a return to the moral principles and grandeur of its true founders .

Captain Casablanca and His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : As a footnote to your comments upon the part the Comte de Grasse played in the victory over Cornwallis at Yorktown it is perhaps not uninteresting to recall that among the officers of de ..

He was himself an officer of conspicuous ability , ' Ior at ' the Battle of the Nile he succeeded to the command of the French fleet upon the death of the Admiral . nut he owes his immortality chiefly to the heroism of his ' 10-year-old son  --  the boy , who " stood on the burning deck .
