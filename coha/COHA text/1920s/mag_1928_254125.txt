It was a hot , humid , but happy Houston . Discord waned . Celebrities furnished the atmosphere of a glorified picnic instead of a political dogfight . <P> Mrs. Woodrow Wilson arrived regally and went to stay with the Jesse Holman Joneses in their bungalow atop Mr. Jones 's new Lamar Hotel . So far as the convention was concerned , Mr. Jones , who arranged it all , was the most important man in town . A Mr. Smith , of course , was the most important man , not in town . William C. Hogg , whom oldtime Houstonians might call their first citizen and whose father was governor of Texas ( 1891-95 ) , published a letter upbraiding Mr. Jones for " a consistent and calculating career of mendacity which would belittle even Jesse James , who was romantic enough to ride a horse . " Mr. Hogg also imputed " stalwart avarice " and " piratical trading " to Mr. Jones , but few took note . They just admired Mr. Jones and decided he was a real Democrat when , to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Wilson he said : " She 's home , frying the chicken . " <P> Mrs. Wilson was for Mr. Smith and so really was Mr. Jones . Governors , Senators and Bosses steamed into town and , following the withdrawal of Maryland 's Ritchie , the opposition to Smith ebbed steadily . Georgia 's George , Tennessee 's Hull , and Mississippi 's Harrison declined to be sheer " anti 's . " Arkansas ' Robinson said his delegates were free . So did Ayres of Kansas . Young Governor Moody of Texas refused to lead the dry bloc . Indiana offered to shift to Smith after one ballot for Banker Evans Woollen . Ohio 's Newton Diehl Baker , long a Smith endorser , sent word from Cleveland that a united party was the essential thing . Before the first gavel fell , the Smith managers were concerned lest their progress look like " steam-rollering . " They confined themselves to distributing 50 cases of Smith literature and discussed the platform more than their man . Odds rose to 9 to i on the Smith nomination . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sidewalks of San Francisco " prepared his speech to second the Smith nomination . " There are two kinds of big men , " said Mr. Hickey . " Those who grow and those who just swell . Well , Al 's growing all the time . " <P> North Carolina 's Simmons remained hostile . Virginia 's peppery little Glass arrived , was given a hotel room without a bath , lost his famed temper ( TIME , May 28 ) , vowed he never would vote for Smith . Missouri 's Reed , after seeming to have quieted down , snapped " I am tired of this rot , " and issued a statement which was a transparent attempt to rally the dwindling dry bloc . But it seemed that nothing upsetting would really happen-unless there came a fight over the party 's platform .
