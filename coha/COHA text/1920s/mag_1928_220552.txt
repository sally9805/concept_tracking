Four Sons . New York newspapers cluttered their columns last week , puffing up Margaret Mann , white-haired , 60 , for years an extra , but now the featured player of Four Sons , the latest candified cinemotherlove . At the expansive opening in the Gaiety Theatre , Morris Gest sniffled . <P> Four Sons parades the emotions of Bavarian Mother Bernle who sees three sons goose step to war and death . The fourth and youngest had sailed before the War to the U. S. , but he too eventually holds a bayonet . Evil appears in the person of a Prussian , monocled and stooped , mannered and sneering . But Director John Ford sees to it that the boy is safely returned to New York and mother . <P> Notables nicely cast were Archduke Leopold of Austria as the Prussian ; Ferdinand Schumann-Heink , son of Singer Schumann-Heink , as a staff surgeon , and Miss Mann , conspicuous by the paucity of her history . Born in Aberdeen , Scotland , one of ten , she abandoned schooling for work at nine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , D. C. She first put on costume as a pageant player , dressing as Martha Washington . At fifty she had her initial extra job ; ten years later she was singled out as the ideal lead for Four Sons where the lined maternity of her face is pleasant but almost smothered in plot glucose . <P> <P> Sporting Goods . The tradition that youthful salesmanship ranks in romance with search for the Holy Grail forms the basis for this fossilated farce . Richard Dix , as a brawny , broken-nosed , commercial traveler , twines love and business , achieving girl and commission . It gags and gurgles about the young salesman and his sweetie who admires him for being both opulent and deceitful . Ethics are somewhat mixed , the principals in an excellent poker sequence shifting cards until Dix acquires four of a kind , raking in thereby $4,000 . Director Malcolm St. Clair , smart maker of the recent Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , was more interested in scenery than story . <P> Thanks for the Buggy Ride . This is one more somewhat rickety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is an antiquated wagon , moving along upon wheels of device so often employed that they squeak loudly : thus , at a picnic , pigs gobble the sandwiches ; when the picnickers , a young songwriter and a dancing instructress , seek nearby shelter they are embarrassingly mistaken for a married couple , which , later on , they become . Thanks for the Buggy Ride seems to be unconscious of its triteness . It has a careless , youthful , bumptious gaiety , which gives it the quality of a nutting bee , or a hayride in a Ford truck organized for the amusement of juvenile sophisticates.
