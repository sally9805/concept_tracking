A great gnarled auction block from which men and women are still annually knocked down stands in the market place of the ancient city of St. Etienne . <P> Last week , when the lusty auctioneer began his hawking there were few bidders present . Teeming and jostling , however were the ranks of neat farm wenches and strong peasant youths , all eager to be auctioned . <P> Loud , prolonged hawking showed that not more than 2,500 francs ( $100 ) could be realized for a wench , however buxom , and not over 3,750 francs ( $150 ) was bid for any youth , however strong . Shamed were more than two score of young women for whom the auctioneer could not raise a single bid . Crestfallen and sullen were a score of youths . <P> As each human was knocked down , all present were called to witness that he or she had agreed to labor for one or more years in return for the sum bid , plus board &; keep and one new set of outer garments . Since French peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wage scale of auction bidding was deemed adequate .
