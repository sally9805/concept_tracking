TO Valhalla and remote settlements at the headwaters of the Bronx River has spread the glad news that the New York Central Railroad is going to issue a new kind of commutation ticket , simpler and easier to buy and to use than the old kind . On station platforms all along the line , little groups of devout commuters have gathered , in this harvest season of the full cellar and the overflowing bin , to thank a generous Providence for their new blessing . Of course , the forthcoming tickets sound very practical , and probably they will be a great improvement over the other kind . But what the commuter really needs is what no railroad has ever provided him with : namely , a ticket for his other suit . MOSTLY , city dwellers notice the weather less than do farmers and ranchers , because it means less to them . Weather comes and goes in New York , like conventions of hotelmen , and makes almost no dent in the calm life of the town . Having no flocks to guard against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his begonia plant safe from drought and his goldfish fat with plenty , the city man is almost oblivious of the elements . Yet not quite oblivious . Even in the city , there are signs and portents . Persons who live within earshot of the Metropolitan chimes know instinctively what the weather will be next day , by the sound of the hells : when the wind is in the east the chimes clearly notify West Side people of coming rain . News of clear weather comes to them when , lying abed at midnight , they hear the whistle of departing liners , clear on the west wind . Downtown , Wall Street workers have their intimations , too ; hidden from sun and sky , they can smell rain a day ahead , on the coffee wind that blows . MRS . JEROME NAPOLEON BONA-PARTE. , prominent in the society of New York , Newport , and Palm Beach , is an enthusiastic admirer of Borzoi Books . That much has been definitely established . In recent advertisements of Alfred A. Knopf , Mrs. Bonaparte has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a look of admiration for it in her right eye . Her endorsement , incomplete though it was , touched us deeply ; somehow we could n't dismiss the matter , and went around thinking about it , wondering which Borzoi Books she had read , why she liked them , and why the publisher thought we cared whether she did or did n't . Before long a curious , haunting refrain was running through our head : " Mrs. Bonaparte likes Borzoi Books , Mrs. Bonaparte likes Borzoi Books . " Finally the refrain became confused , and gradually changed into another song ? a lilting lay such as shepherds used to sing : " But does she like animal crackers , DOES she like animal crackers ? " NEVER in history have college students had to face so much criticism as has been heaped upon them lately .

At Cornell , Dr. Smiley tearfully records that the health of undergraduates gets steadily worse from freshman year to senior year . And from Morning-side Heights comes an alarming bulletin that many graduate students are attending Columbia for purely social reasons . These statistics we do not pretend to challenge . We will , however , wager that for every student who spends more time on movies than on books , there are at least two university administrators who are spending more time on publicity and endowment campaigns than on pedagogy . ONE thing that frightens us about the machine civilization is the permanence which it accords trivial and dull documents . Letters , policies , deeds are typed in triplicate and solemnly filed against the ravages of moth and rust . Worse yet , the Bank of the Manhattan Company has taken to photographing every cheque received and paid during the day ; these facsimiles are laid gently away in files . If that practice catches hold , restaurants will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductors will photograph nickels , and the United Cigar Stores will take snapshots of every coupon issued , to avoid error . There is a theory , which we 've often heard advanced , that the human race will eventually be destroyed by insects . Our own theory is that the human race is gradually sinking to its destruction in a vast white sea , composed entirely of little pieces of paper . Groody in a crowd of people , and two seconds later she was pulling a honey bear around the floor by the tail . Only in the Waldorf do things like this happen . Even a child actor turned up  --  little Master Charles P. Walters , of the " Strange Interlude " cast  --  who appeared suddenly from behind a box of dog biscuits , where a lady had been combing his hair .

OBEYING the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Fifty-seventh Street and was waiting nervously to cross Third Avenue . The leading car was a Rolls , decorous and elegant as usual . As we started across the street , a ragged old tramp , slightly inebriated , sauntered along beside us . He had a corn-cob pipe in his mouth , and that air of knowing a great deal about life . When he reached the Rolls he stopped and surveyed it critically , in its gorgeous entirety , from its radiator cap to its rear bumper . Then , as though he had reached a conclusion , he slowly took his pipe from his mouth and knocked it out on the front fender , - while the ' chauffeur sat trembling in his wrath . Sleight of Hand NO hotel has as many tricks up its sleeve as the Waldorf . Chevrolets had hardly departed from its ground floor when Persian cats , lemurs , and schnauzers appeared on the roof .

We stood for a moment beside a lady in a fur coat , and the next minute a large chimpanzee wearing rubber pants appeared from her collar and began to eat a banana . We recognized Louise THE NEW YORKER 23 and then produced , out of the air , a boa constrictor about ten feet long  --  which he calmly arranged in the shape of a swastika .

Joseph 's Coat ALMOST everyone has seen about the streets recently the automobile  --  a Hudson we believe it is  --  covered on back , front , and both sides with license plates .

So You 're Going to Bloomingdale 's ! EVERY year we make it a point to shop early for our Christmas spirit at one of the big department stores , for there the holly wreaths first are hung and the artificial snow glitters soonest , and there Santa Claus may be found a month ahead of time . This year we visited Blooming-dale 's . Great frosty signs , just inside the entrance , read " This way to Santa Claus , " and we followed ; for , after a fashion , we collect Santa Clauses . There was , for example , one at Macy 's last year who said " erg " for " oil , " and who amused us for nearly an hour . The Bloomingdale Santa is quite young  --  not more than twenty-seven , we should judge  --  and we saw him quite unintentionally break the heart of a little girl by mistaking her for a little boy . Saint Nicholas must he infallible in these matters of sex or the country will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in toys to report . Our hopes of coming upon a display of gunmen or gamblers bearing some such legend as " Get the children a Tough Willie McCabe , " were dashed . From the toy department we wandered below to the basement . We recommend the grand tour of Bloomingdale 's basement to all those who may have missed it by thoughtlessly choosing to go to Europe instead . It is a trip not to be missed . Two strides from a lunch counter brought us to a Saturday special in Scotch heather , for the flower department begins where the luncheonette leaves off . It is a pleasant flower store , but one leaves it abruptly  --  just past the last clamen a table of fragrant fruit rears up , and four steps beyond is the shoe department , with its rich leathery smell . The tour is a high adventure in smells . Right back of the chairs where people sit trying on shoes , is the meat market . Recoiling from the insolent , unexpected smell of ham and bacon , we bumped into a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From here one wanders on past counters of chinaware , racks of Christmas cards , a thousand lighted reading lamps , tables of artists ' oils and smocks , picture frames , Friendship calendars , Supreme Peanut Brittle , and thus , in a great circle , back to where one started . Nowhere else that we know of can one run such an exciting gamut of sandwiches , poinsettias , cushion treads , dressed veal , step-ins , Haviland china , postcards for Mother 's birthday , and Almond Brunch . The romantic profusion of smells was fine for our Christmas spirit , for it brought old memories thronging . We left the store with a singing heart , and for the merry Salvation Army girl outside the door who gave us a " God bless you , sir , " we had a quarter and a " God bless us every one . " Nothing In It WILSON MIZNER , known on Broadway as a wit , known in Florida as a realtor , is at the moment in Hollywood , where a man can be both and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went there to write scenarios . The story being told about him is that he and the Scottie went into a studio and presented a piece of paper with about seventy-five words written on it . An executive read it . " What is it ? " the movie king asked . " It 's a picture , " said Mr. Mizner . The executive read it again and scratched his head . Then he handed it hack . " No picture in that . " " Goodbye , " said Mr. Mizner , taking the paper and starting for the door with his manuscript , his terrier , and his hauteur . At the door he paused . " You 're sure there 's nothing in it ? " " Not a thing . " Mizner threw a pitying glance at the executive . " That 's funny . It 's a play that ran on Broadway for more than a year . It 's ' The Deep Purple . ' " And so saying he went out into the night , man and dog . Fugitive WE do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has watched the big shots at their play has told us a little about McManus . His apparent friendliness with the police seemed natural when we learned that the upholding of the law has long been a fine old tradition in the McManus family . His father , now dead , was a lieutenant on the force , one of his three brothers , Stephen , is a lieutenant now , and another , Toni , is a retired patrolman . The third brother is said to have had no talent either for gambling or for arresting gamblers . George McManus himself was born on the east side of Harlem , where he went to a public school . Despite his great size and apparent clumsiness as a boy , he was an adept at tossing coins at a line . About fifteen years ago he fell in with Rothstein and others like him . McManus accepts with equal serenity the winnings and the losses which life brings to him . It is told of him that a few days before the racing closed at Saratoga last summer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally with very little . Nevertheless , he frolicked on the train . He is known as the life of the parties he attends , delights in parlor tricks , and has a valet who sees to it that his master is always dressed in style . We are informed that the papers never did get the straight of how McManus surrendered . It seems that his lawyer , Mr. James D. C. Murray , telephoned Detective John Cordes , whom McManus selected as the man to whom he wished to surrender , and told him that the fugitive would meet him in the barber shop at 242nd Street ? DECEMBER 8 , 19 2 8 and Broadway at eight-thirty the next morning  --  Tuesday of last week . Cordes did not arrive while McManus was being shaved , as was reported , but was half an hour late , either because of having overslept or because of the traffic , and while waiting for his captor to show up , McManus took a walk with his lawyer . In this stroll they passed several policemen , any of whom would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Cordes appeared , McManus welcomed him and then chided him for being tardy . Much was made of the fact that when McManus was captured he carried under his arm a copy of Charles G. Norris ' " Bread , " with which to while away the time in the Tombs . It turns out , however , that he finished this novel on the second clay of his durance , and sent out for half a dozen others , among them " The Bridge of San Luis Rey , " " The Foolish Virgin , " and " She Who Sleeps . " Out of Her Line VV. have just heard what may he ri old story , told this time about Mr. John Barrymore . It dates from the time that an outdoor production of " Hamlet " was being staged in Hollywood . For some reason the actor undertook to direct the ladies who formed Ophelia 's funeral cortege . Most of them had been to somebody 's party the night before , and they were still feeling a little festive . In any case , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnity . " A little more dignity , " he pleaded . " Try to be virginal , ladies . " One of the pallbearers sniffed . " Listen , Mr. Barrymore , " she said , " I 'm no character actress . " Glass House A THREE-STORY laboratory and A. factory , to be built of pretty glass , will be constructed in East Twenty-first Street some time next year , we have learned , and since an ardent authority tells us that at night when it is all lighted up it will look like a fairy palace , it is perhaps worth listing under the head of openings of note . People will probably go over to look at it just as they go to Coney Island for the fireworks . The Versailles touch in Twenty-first Street is such a brave dream that we asked for details . It seems that Mr. Ely Kahn , who is designing the glass house , got his inspiration from a building in Germany , which has glass walls eighty feet high . Mr. Kahn is a brave dreamer in architecture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have learned from his exhibits there . Kahn 's proposed building will be an adjunct of the present Pinaud building in Twenty-first Street . His plan is for a structure which , except for a skeleton of widely spaced upright brick columns connected by narrow bands of brick at each floor , will be entirely of glass . Small square units , or " bricks , " of glass held together by brass rods and concrete instead of the usual mortar , will be used . Each unit consists of two pieces of glass with a dead-air space between ? to prevent condensation of moisture on the inside . The glass is cast with corrugations which break up the light , as frosted glass does , and there are many patterns of these corrugations , permitting decorative treatment . Besides the spectacle it offers , glass has several advantages over brick or stone . For one thing , the surface is said to be absolutely permanent : no repairs are necessary and no re-stirfacing ; to clean it one merely turns on a hose and it is as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort which will resist city corrosion and dirt . For the facade of the new Bedell store in Thirty-fourth Street , for example , Urban is using black vitriolite . Glass also gives more light , and more floor space , since the walls are only four inches thick ; and the labor costs are Ices . ? IIN , DBERCH is not the only flier to have restaurants named after him . In 125th Street , the Graf Zeppelin Coffee Shoppe has opened its doors . These places are a boon to us , who frequently ca n't tell whether we are hungry or just dizzy . Success GRUBBING around on Hester Street , we paused long enough to overhear a conversation about life . A wizened little man in a brand-new Salvation Army uniform was talking to a thin-lipped derelict , unshaven , dirty . " Five weeks ago , " the Army man was saying , " I was nothin ' but a bum . Not a stitch to me back , sleepin ' in flop joints . Now look at me . Nice clean clothes , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get it ? Ask me ! Playin ' the goddam drum ! " Owl Cars THIS country , as you know , started to go to rack and ruin when a cup of coffee became ten cents instead of five . That decadence has always weighed on our mind , and so we were rather delighted to learn , from an excitable explorer , that , among other places , there are about two hundred lunch wagons in New York where coffee is still a nickel . These lunch wagons , incidentally , have a romantic history , beginning from the pegtoptrouser age of American civilization when the wagons were really wagons and when your night lunch came along on wheels , dragged by an old horse . They were called owl cars , and were nomadic and wondrous . Strange to say , some of the first owl cars that rumbled into this town came here for highly moral reasons . The Women 's Christian Temperance Union had an idea that it would he possible to keep men out of saloons by providing them with a moral equivalent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to Madison Square , Union Square , Herald Square , and Bowling Green . Then , our explorer informs us , a man named Tierney bought an owl car , landed in New Rochelle with it , and started manufacturing them . At first they were constructed from old trolley cars , but , like all American products , they soon became very grand . They were called " diners . " The horse was abolished , because horses are n't aesthetic around restaurants , and the carts acquired running water , gas , and electricity . They now have cedar trees on the doorstep , forced ventilation , and cost twenty thousand dollars to buy new . For the great fraternity of taxi-drivers , motormen , retired gunmen , and college boys , they are the official Reubens , and midnight is the official hour . We happen to he acquainted ourself with the West Shore Diner , in West Forty-second Street , where we have on occasion stopped for scrambled eggs before attempting the Weehawken voyage . It was here that we learned that a " piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamburger sandwich . The food , as most adult males know , is fairly good in dog wagons  --  much better than in the average Greek res taurant , for instance . Eggs are fresh , meat is tolerable , everything is piping hot , and life is rich and fragrant . And coffee , by all that 's holy , is five cents ! Little Gentlemen AYOUNG lady from Scarsdale left her roadster standing in Forty-ninth Street while she lunched in a tearoom . A firm believer in fair weather , she left the top down . While she was in the tearoom , dark clouds gathered above Forty-ninth Street and the great rains came . Before she had even finished the soup course , she realized that it was raining , but she was too indolent to do anything , and just sat there , thinking about the wet driver 's scat . Later , when she returned to the car , she found the top up : some doorman , she thought , had been divine . Where could the divine doorman be ? She looked around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
