The Week PRESIDENT COOLIDGE 'S message to Con-rgress contains few surprises , and is , on the whole , a thoroughly characteristic document . He sings a hymn of praise to economy , efficiency and abolition of waste , and links all three of these , and the prosperity of the country , to the protective tariff . Prices are down and wages are up ; there is nowhere , not even in agriculture , any " acute chronic depression . " We need no new policies . Until the war debt has been reduced , there should be no expenditures of any sort except under " the most pressing necessity . " He returns rather wistfully to his suggestion that income taxes for 1926 be reduced , for which he has been so heartily spanked ; but having saved his face by mentioning the proposal , he adds that if Congress wishes instead to reduce the debt , that will be all right with him . By a weird analysis of imports he shows that there is no hope of reducing duties in order to help our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $4,466,000,000 , but 65 percent of them were duty free , and of the remainder nearly one half is " subject to duties for the protection of agriculture " ? whatever that means . Another $300 , - 000,000 is luxuries . Therefore , by his triumphant reasoning , only $550,000,000 of imports is left as subject to a possible reduction ! The President believes that retaining high tariff on this amount means the difference between hard times and good , and that our foreign debtors can best be helped by continuing the tariff and what he regards as its result , high purchasing power in the United States . He is the Compleat Protectionist . THE NcNary-Haugen bill is conspicuous by its absence from Mr. Coolidge 's list of recommendations . He observes that the net income of agriculture has risen from $375,000,000 in 1920-21 to $2,757,000,000 in 1925-26 , and recites a list of measures for cooperative marketing and better credit facilities , passed by Congress in recent years . While cotton is depressed , the real remedy is for the growers to reduce acreage by one-third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 4,000,000 bales . He endorses freight rate : cadjustment , railroad consolidation , waterway projects , reclamation , fertilizer from Muscle Shoals , and he obviously hopes that the farmer will look at these and not at his bank book . Labor , the President assures us , is happy , though he hopes somehow to make it even happier . He endorses some sort of branch banking law , some sort of radio legislation , some sort of bill for the return of alien property . He asks for centralized control of the U. S. Merchant Marine and an emergency board to act in case of a strike in bituminous coal ; he deplores lynching , and the tendency toward centralization of government . The message is well written and informative , and worth any citizen 's attention . It is also worth putting away , to be resuscitated in June , 1928 , to see how many of the proposals asked by the President have become law , and what part he has played in obtaining their enactment . THERE is one serious new development in the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preamble to the Jones law states that the islands shall be set free when they have established a stable government ; but President Coolidge declares they must be held until they are " both politically fitted for self-government and economically independent . " What do these phrases mean ? The American occupation in at least one serious way is preventing " economic independence " for the islands , and in fact works in the opposite direction . The Philippines are a part of our tariff system and therefore a large and increasing majority of all their exports come to the United States . Opponents of freedom argue , and quite reasonably , that if we severed relations tomorrow and raised a tariff barrier against Philippine products , the islands would suffer an economic crisis of the first magnitude . If we ever mean to keep our promise ? indeed , our repeated promises ? to the Philippines , we must do one of two things : either arrange that after they are independent , we shall continue free trade with them , an arrangement which could do no harm to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of years prior to the date when the present relationship is severed , giving Filipino business men time to adjust to the new conditions . W. Morgan Shuster , who was Insular Collector of Customs in Manila for five years , and kmember of the Philippine Commission for three years more , proposed last week , at a luncheon of the Foreign Policy Association in New York , a plan whereby complete independence would be granted on Jan. 1 , 1948 . In the meantime , there would be an increasing degree of autonomy for the islands , and progressive measures would be taken to insure " economic independence , " in so far as it is affected by tariffs and other legal restrictions . We should like to know President Coolidge 's view of this plan , and whether he regards it as incompatible with the pious aspiration of his message . The Mexicans point out , correctly , that no objectionable action has yet taken place . They assure us that any American investor who feels himself aggrieved may appeal to the Mexican courts for redress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plea is it appropriate for him to bring the matter to the attention of his own government . NO ONE can deny that the new laws , if rigidly enforced , would constitute an impairment of property rights . A fifty-year lease on oil lands is something less than full ownership . Compulsory sale of majority control of a corporation within ten years , or of land near the border during the lifetime of the present owner or within ten years after his death , means some impairment of value . Yet it is not for a moment to be compared in seriousness with such confiscation as has been witnessed in Russia , or with the confiscation of foreign and domestic investment in American breweries and distilleries when national prohibition was enacted , or the destruction of property rights in slaves in 1863 . Practically speaking , oil lands become exhausted so far as all present methods of extraction are concerned , in much less than fifty years . Practically speaking , a decade is time enough in which to make even a forced sale of stock or land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing for their property by will , or by courts in settling estates . However , a practical view is just what Secretary Kellogg and Ambassador Sheffield do not propose to take . They couple to their ignorance of , and inability to negotiate with , the Latin temperament , a refusal to look an inch beyond the ends of their noses and see what results their tactics are likely to bring forth . If recognition is withdrawn , the border opened to gun runners and to revolutionists like Adolfo de la Huerta and his crew of precious scoundrels , if the Calles government is overthrown , and American life and property are rendered unsafe for another decade ? well , Kellogg and Sheffield will be surprised and sorry , and that will be all . BOTH the government and the people of the United States are fond of expressing a belief in the value of arbitration . Well , here is a case for arbitration , if there ever was one . The Mexican government would , in all probability , be glad to refer the matter to an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gringo-hating Mexican people to be more intransigent than its sensible administrators would wish . We have a treaty with our neighbors across the Rio Grande specifically calling for arbitration of such disputes as the present . Let the question be referred to a court , whose members would be subject neither to political pressure from Mexico nor to social and financial pressure from wealthy American investors . If we are afraid of the World Court , the Hague tribunal could take jurisdiction . We have said that we want no more than justice , that our deepest wish is to remain on terms of cordial friendliness with our sister republic to the south . Here is a chance to show whether we mean what we say , or have been indulging in mere political hypocrisy . THE session of Congress now in progress has before it a staggering array of problems . Farm relief , taxation , a $4,000,000,000 budget , the settlement of war claims , the problem of branch banking , control of radio , machinery for adjusting labor troubles in anthracite coal , an $80,000,000 River and Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal and the " all-American " route through New York state , adjustment of war claims and return of alien property are but a few of the questions the legislators are , in theory , supposed to solve . Shall we ratify the Lausanne Treaty ? Shall Arthur R. Gould , newly-elected from Maine to serve as Senator in this Congress , be seated ? Shall the Senate repudiate its resolution of adherence to the World Court ? Shall the government go into the business of distilling medicinal whiskey ? What about reapportionment of Congress on the basis of the 1920 census , which under the law should have been done long ago ? What ahout Muscle Shoals ? Railroad consolidation ? The disposition of the government-owned merchant ' marine ? IF you have tears to shed for the poor overworked law-makers , withhold them . Nothing is more certain than that this lame duck Congress will have left untouched most of the questions enumerated When it adjourns on March 4 , 1927 . The representatives of the farm states are determined to keep the McNary-Haugen bill in the spotlight during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted , they can prevent Congress from doing much else of importance ? assuming that it wanted to , which it does n't . Our readers are thoroughly familiar with the disadvantages of the present sys. tem , whereby a newly-elected Congress does not take office until more than a year later and men who have been repudiated by the voters continue to serve in Senate and House for three months . - The proposed Norris amendment to the Constitution remedying this situation has passed the Senate and is now pending in the House , after which it will be referred to the states . In the meantime , it is futile to expect very much of the lame duck short session , and on the whole it is as well that this is true . NEW YORK STATE has water power resources of vast extent . Those along the St. Lawrence River are alone capable of developing from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 horsepower , plus a similar amount on the Canadian side , and there are numerous other streams with large potentialities . These water power resources are , as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government looks toward public ownership and control , and in line with that policy , legislation was passed some time ago , under a state reorganization plan , abolishing the present State Water-Power Commission and its twin , the State Water-Control Commission , both Republican-managed , and substituting a new board responsible directly to the governor . The present commissions go out of existence on January 1 , 1927 . Suddenly , within three weeks of their demise , they have attempted to put over one of the most stupendous and impudent thefts of state property in New York 's history . They propose at the last minute to lease the St. Lawrence power rights for fifty years to a corporation which is a subsidiary of Secretary Mellon 's aluminum trust , and is closely linked with the General Electric Company and the E. I. duPont de Nemours Company . At the end of fifty years , the state would buy back the development at cost plus 15 percent , plus , according to the terms of the contract , a sum for watered valuation , which might be almost anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $40,000,000 ; and in the meantime the power trust would receive $20,000,000 a year on its investment of $240,000,000 . As a matter of fact , at the end of fifty years the development will either be worth nothing , because . of new methods of power production , or else it will be worth at least a billion dollars . EVEN more scandalous , though in smaller figures , is the proposal made for giving away the rights on the Salmon River . These are worth about $3,000,000 , and for them the people of the state would receive $720 a year . The joker making this possible was slipped into the state law by a former speaker of the Assembly , and it is hardly surprising that he now turns up as President of the company which stands to profit so enormously by his thoughtfulness . It may of course be argued that the politicians on the two Republican state boards are merely running true to form . Their behavior , while contemptible to the last degree , is no worse than is to be expected of men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican party , and the outstanding leaders of that party are the ones who must bear the ultimate responsibility for this barefaced steal . If the swindle is to be stopped , it must be by men like Charles Evans Hughes and Elihu Root , who combine party loyalty with a sense of the limits of public decency . We wait with interest to hear what they have to say . SHORTLY after the middle of November , daily newspapers throughout the country suddenly blossomed forth with articles charging that Mexico is " fomenting Bolshevism " in Nicaragua . These stories were under Washington date lines and revealed to any experienced reader their common origin . That sent out by the Associated Press , for example , began as follows : The spectre of a Mexican-fostered Bolshevist hegemony intervening between the United States and the Panama Canal has thrust itself into American-Mexican relations , already strained . The article went on to describe , in vague terms , the alarm of the new Nicaraguan President , Adolfo Diaz , and of the United States , at the spread of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , failed to carry conviction . The New Republic in its next issue said " the accusation that Mexico is spreading Bolshevism sounds like a cheap attempt to prejudice Americans , who can still be roused by that word to a state of fury which has no relation to the facts . " As it turns out , this description was wholly accurate . For a knowledge of the story behind the story we are indebted to Paul Y. Anderson , Washington correspondent energetic enough to find out the facts , and to his paper , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , brave enough to print them . Here is what happened , quoted and in part summarized from Mr. Anderson 's account : Assistant Secretary of State R. E. Olds ( formerly a law partner of Secretary of State Kellogg ) sent for the representatives of the three great press associations ? the Associated Press , United Press and International News Service . He pledged them to secrecy and then revealed that the State Department felt " morally certain " that Mexico was circulating Bolshevist propaganda in Central America . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this picture should be presented to the American people , and I desired to ask for your advice and cooperation toward that end . " " It can very easily be done , " one of the correspondents replied . " Let the State Department issue a statement to this effect over the signature of the Secretary of State , and every newspaper in the country will publish it . " Olds recoiled with an exclamation of apprehension . " Oh ! That is utterly impossible ! " he said . " Surely you must realize why the department can not afford to be in the position of directing such a serious statement against a government with which it is officially on friendly terms . " Finally , it was suggested that perhaps such a story could be tied on to the statement that the State Department had decided to recognize the government of Adolfo Diaz in Nicaragua . In connection with that announcement the story appeared the following day , in somewhat modified form , as the background which explained the present relations between the United States and Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of Secretary Kellogg is strengthened by the fact that no repudiation of the story has since come from the department . The seriousness of this action is heightened when you know that Mexico was at that time on the eve of sending her second and final note in the recent interchange regarding the land and oil laws ? as Messrs . Kellogg and Olds were of course aware . The " news " about Mexican Bolshevist activities in Nicaragua was well calculated to arouse resentment among American citizens and thereby cause them to support Secretary Kellogg in his arrogant and unyielding attitude toward Mexico . NOT the least serious aspect of the matter is the well justified belief that the incident is not so unusual as it appears , but is more in the nature of the-ordinary routine . The heads of the Washington bureaus of the three news services in question were interviewed by Editor and Publisher Magazine . Carl D. Groat , of the United Press , states merely that his service did not carry the reports about " Bolshevism , " as requested by Olds , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George R. Holmes , of the International News Service , also contents himself with denying that " any spectre of a Mexican-fostered Bolshevist hegemony " was reported to the clients of the I. N. S. L. C. Probert , Washington manager for the Associated Press , says : " We got the story in the usual course of news and we had no reason to doubt its accuracy . " The implication is plain , that Olds 's use of the press varied from the normal chiefly because of its ineptness ? and because , thanks to Mr. Anderson and the Post-Dispatch , he got found out . Here is surely matter for a Congressional investigation second in importance to none . THREE striking events have developed in Chinese affairs during the past week . First , Chu Chaohsin , representative of his government at the League of Nations , has announced that all unequal treaties will be terminated as fast as they expire . Second , Great Britain has definitely decided against any attempt to use force in China . The Yangtse-Kiang is not to be blockaded ; nor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs by the Chinese in ports now controlled by the Canton government . The British authorities , with extraordinary candor , admit that they sought to persuade Japan and the United States to join in a military campaign ; but both these powers refusing , they feel unable to take action alone . Third , there is a strong and growing tendency for foreign powers and individuals to treat with Canton as being the de facto government of China . The first and third of these actions were to be expected , in view of the movement of events , and must be welcomed by every friend both of justice and of peace . As for the second , we can only say that the policy of conciliation which it implies seems to us as wise as the attempt to use more force would have been unjust , unwise and monstrous . If the new policy of pacification had come far sooner , it might have been possible to avoid the present wave of anti-foreign feeling , which we discuss elsewhere in this issue , so far-reaching and so dangerous because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Republic is the property of New Republic and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listsery without the copyright holder 's express written permission .
