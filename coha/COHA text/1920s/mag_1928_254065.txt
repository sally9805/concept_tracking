In Central Park , Manhattan , where , under the dark trees , thousands of couples play every night , there occurred last week an event innocent and charming . A boy so fat that he looked like a pudding walked through a crowd of 33,000 screaming children while he sipped a huge mug of milk . <P> The fat boy was 12-year-old Jack Linder who weighed 341 pounds . He was the most honored guest at the garden party given by Thomas M. Farley , political leader of the Fourteenth Assembly District . Mr. Farley 's district is full of Jewish , Italian and Irish constituents . All of these have plenty of children and plenty were at Mr. Farley 's party last week . As demure and vagrant as fluffy rabbits , the little girls in their white dresses went creeping about the lawns giving vent to small cries . The stags at the party chased them from time to time : there was a regrettable fracas when one of the latter , finding himself next a small female with a loud voice , attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , perhaps her head , with his pocket knife . An alderman took action and the party progressed without further untoward incident until the time came for eating . <P> This precipitated a scramble so dreadful that it is impossible properly to describe it . Generous Mr. Farley had distributed 15,000 quarts of ice cream , 10,000 quarts of milk and five tons of crackers . <P> Finally filled , the children sat in regurgitating placidity while prizes were awarded . William Dattner , 12 , and Evelyn Williams , 13 , received awards for having more freckles than any of the other little children . Eilene and Peggy Goeble , dressed like Gold Dust Twins , got prizes for the most original costume . When it came to choosing the fattest boy at the party , Jack Linder of 1340 Third Avenue* flopped up to the judges to claim his due . <P> Most political district leaders give such parties but staunch Tammany Tom Farley 's are perhaps the most celebrated in Manhattan . The pre-eminent success of this particular Farley Fte , which produced more congratulatory editorials than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership of his district , could be attributed largely to the admirable Linder . Jealous Republicans , who can give no such parties in Manhattan , scoffingly suggested that the fat boy would have been kept away from the party for fear of frightening the other guests , had it not been for the fact that Mr. Farley , himself a 6-ft. package weighing 190 pounds , likes to see much made much of . <P> <P> *An address now famed in Manhattan .
