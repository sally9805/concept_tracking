While the City Sleeps . Because Underworld , crook cinema written by Ben Hecht , made record returns for Paramount a few months ago , hundreds of hideaways , spitting gats , Big Boys , molls , bulls , rods , and mobs have been photographed . Now Lon Chaney as a very plainclothes detective with bunions strides painfully through a convincing picture about bad men and a good girl . <P> While the city sleeps , the cops play pinochle in the assembly room and gangsters croak a jeweler on East 37th Street , Manhattan . On the trail of " Mile-Away " Healey , undertaker , suspected murderer , gang-leader , move the swollen feet of Detective Chancy . His face , which successfully suggests the face of an experienced bloodhound , looks through the window of a lunchroom wherein Mile-Away is quarreling with a recent mistress ; the same face pushes out of a coffin in Mile-Away 's funeral parlors and later appears suddenly in a dark corner of a fur store which Mile-Away 's gang is robbing . This face is dear to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mile-Away and Detective Chaney mutually admire . <P> In a series of tense sequences , finely directed and photographed , the story moves to the scene in which the inevitable machine rifle volleys death from a second-story window at the gang attempting a getaway . But the gang differs from past cinema gangs in that its members are not millionaires but needy-looking fellows ; the good girl would certainly have been bad if she had n't been watched . <P> This is the fourth straight make-up part played this year by Actor Chaney who in the past has used hideous disguises . Now nearing 50 , Actor Chaney likes his relatives to call him Alonzo , his real name . He has a married son and has himself been in the show business for 30 years , first in a singing stock company in Colorado Springs , then as a legit-actor touring the Middle West in comedy , tragedy and operetta , and subsequently as wardrobe man , property man , chorus man , transportation agent , scenery-shifter ( for Mansfield , Mojeska , Mantell ) , tourist guide , interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wild west two-reeler . His face had been smeared with pie in many slapsticks when a director selected it to be a crook-cripple 's in The Miracle Man . Alonzo Chaney 's present salary , kept secret by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , is thought to be about $4,000 per week . <P> <P> Three Comrades and 1 Invention is the first sample of Russian humor ever presented in the U. S. in cinema . The three comrades , one big , one little male and one , Olga Tretlakova , lusty and white-toothed female with no waistline , used an invention for making boxes as the mechanism for laughing at inventions , manufacturers , the Soviet government , country life . And U. S. audiences laughed at humor in the style of Gogol as heartily as in the past they have laughed at humor in the style of Sennett . <P>
