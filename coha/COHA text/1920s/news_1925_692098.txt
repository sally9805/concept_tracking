" Had Harry Moore been in the Legislature , " The American Issue continued , " he would have opposed all such legislation as Whitney supported .

Every man and woman employed in public office in Hudson County must pay tribute tothz , political organization which controls it . " I can not believe , " continued Senator Whitney , " that the people or New Jersey are going to surrender their right to govern themselves or submit to one-man rule , such as would come to them through having A. Harry Moore for their Governor . If I am elected I shall be unhampered by obligations and shall come to my own independent ? deCisions . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
