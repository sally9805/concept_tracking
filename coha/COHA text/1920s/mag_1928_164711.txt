Helena Springer Green Raskob is the mother of eleven children , is the wife of a man who made 80 millionaires and who now manages the Brown Derby . She is also a farmer . Several years ago in her native Queen Anne 's County , Maryland , she decided to turn two worn-out farms into a paying proposition . Patiently she coaxed the barren soil with flax seed . This season her determination was rewarded by 101 acres of flax , characterized by famed Flax Expert George Lowry , as " the finest flax I ever saw . " Neighboring farmers were , in turn , skeptical , respectful , imitative ; flax raising has been raised from an experiment to a county industry . Were more farmers like Flax Grower Raskob , the U. S. Department of Agriculture would not need to keep repeating , stressing its points . Hundreds of keen chemists , bacteriologists , plant pathologists bend busily over microscope and petrie dish in the many mellow brick laboratory buildings of Washington . Eagerly they experiment with farm problems ; clearly , carefully they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free advice : " Permanent pastures perpetuate parasites . Change your stock from one pasture to another , and change the kind of stock on the same pasture as far as possible . Follow sheep and cattle with horses and swine . " " This is a good time to dip your sheep for sheep ticks . Write for Farmers ' Bulletin No. 798-F. "
