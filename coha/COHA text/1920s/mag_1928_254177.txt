Chicken a la King . Now that summer has come , it is good to see Ford Sterling on the silver screen . He has a cool countenance and , at one point , he becomes covered with snow . In a quiet way he is funny . He plays a middle-aged married man named Horace Trundle who is shorn of his bankroll by two chorus girls in the accepted Gentlemen Prefer Blondes fashion . In the end , his wife , Erne ( Carol Holloway ) , gets him back . The cast is capable : Nancy Carroll as one of the girls , <P> Arthur Stone as a thimble-witted rascal of a brother-in-law . <P> <P> Ladies of the Mob . Now it can be told that Clara Bow can do things other than reveal her stimulating figure . She can act , tensely , convincingly . She has gone the way of Gloria Swanson-from sex appeal to genuine histrionics ( including sex appeal ) . In this picture , she is a lady gangster who has not forgotten that the forces of the law " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank robbery and a narrow escape , she persuades her young pal ( Richard Arlen ) to give up the gun game , marry her , take her away to a little home in California . There she is as loving a wife as any man could wish . But her husband grows restless ; he can not be happy for long unless he has a gun in his hand . He goes back into the racket ; and she , loyal but violently protesting , goes with him . And finally . . . no , that would be telling too much . Ladies of the Mob is excellent entertainment , if you refrain from getting analytical about the plot .
