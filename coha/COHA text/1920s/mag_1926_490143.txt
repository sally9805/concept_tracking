sand and mud seep out from under the foundations next door . When bed-rock is struck , it is leveled off and concrete is poured in . In the meanwhile the mud and ooze outside the caisson has not been disturbed in the least . It was in one of these things that they discovered the old ship 's hulls when sinking the supports for the new Telephone Building . They were five stories below the surface . It 's a Bear ASCHOOL teacher who has re- turned from a vacation in Alaska reports that she regrets ever having left the city . The call of the wild , she says , is a Siren 's song . Being very fond of animals , she fell to talking with the keeper of a large and beautiful captive bear in the far north . " What a perfectly thrilling bear ! " she exclaimed , " What kind is he ?

At the Bronx Zoo , in New York City . " Marie LIKE EVERYONE else , we at-tended a banquet arranged , as the speaker of the evening said , " to honor a Queen . " The engraved invitations , which mentioned " Decorations , " exhorted guests to appear before seven-thirty , in order not to arrive after the Queen . At seven-fifteen the room teemed with representative citizens , three women to one man , and from casual observation , three medals to every man ( an average supported by several gentlemen who fairly jangled with be-ribboned metal ) . As each table was seated , its members divided into two factions  --  those who bribed waiters and were well into their second course by the hour announced , and those stand-patters who would not lay hand on roll until the Roumanian national anthem was played . One admired their spirit ; Her Majesty arrived at eight-thirty . She walked slowly down the hall , the queenly figure so often and so well described . A man rushed past us , waving opera-glasses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang up here and there over the floor ; around the walls women stood on chairs . At last the Queen was seated and toasts to the President and King Ferdinand were drunk in Apollinaris . Following that , the quaint American custom of drinking ginger-ale and sarsaparilla was indulged in ; after all , the Queen had asked to meet Americans au natural . Jokes were cracked which sounded very much like the jokes which servants make about the mistress while munching chicken-bones in the pantry . Every few minutes some spangled creature would rise and level her glasses anew on a Queen so perfectly poised , so natural , that she might have been dining on her own terrace . Ten o'clock came , and eleven ; there were ponderous speeches . At last the Queen rose , spoke a merciful few words . Something snapped in the atmosphere , and there was a rough crowding towards the door . Seven hundred more Americans had " dined with royalty .

" Fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is now known to the New York public quite as much for the fact that he worked some twenty years ago as bar boy in Luke O'Connor 's Sixth Avenue bar , as for his poems . Mr. O'Connor , when interviewed today , habitually says , " Yes , sir , I remember him well . He was no common bar boy  --  kind of bookish , understand . A kind of studious lad . " And there is a noticeable photograph of the bar boy poet hanging on the wall of Mr. O'Connor 's present place of business , inscribed , " To my kind friend and master , Luke O'Connor , with many grateful remembrances from John Masefield . " The truth is , however , that some eight years ago Mr. O'Connor was not as definite in his memories of the poet . At that time Mr. John Butler Yeats , visiting from England , called at the bar and fell into conversation with O'Connor . " My friend John Masefield asked me to stop and see you , " said Mr. Yeats . Mr. O'Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of Masefield . They went into a back room and talked . " John Masefield is a famous poet , " said Yeats . After two hours or so of conversation with the Irish celebrity , Luke O'Connor 's mind began to work . " Yes , I remember Masefield well  --  a bookish fellow , " he said . " I remember him well . " But when Mr. Yeats left , the barman called on a reporter friend of his . " I will give you $100 if you will write me twenty intimate and harmless anecdotes about Masefield as a bar boy . " " Certainly , " said the reporter . That certain reporter has been lost track of  --  probably he is dead ; but the anecdotes he wrote still live and have their place today on the front pages of our great dailies . Again THE METROPOLITAN OPERA has opened for so many consecutive seasons without notable variations that it seems odd there should be any conversation on the subject at all , but there is invariably a Talley debut or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last season  --  or the announcement , as this year , of a new American Opera with Edna St. Vincent Millay 's verse set to Deems Taylor 's music . " The King 's Henchman , " the Malay-Taylor opus , is shrouded in mystery , which adds to its charm at the moment as a prospective surprise . All that seems to be known about it is that its setting is early English about the tenth century . Whether the libretto is to be pure lyric phantasy , or is to he tinged with the ironic as are so many of Miss Hay 's poems , is not known . This opera , which is said to be completed and ready for rehearsal , although it will not be presented until February , is the first the Metropolitan has ever commissioned ; but it is notthe first to be written by a New Yot k critic . William Henry Fry of the Tribune wrote an opera entitled " Leonora " way back in 1858 . It was produced at the Academy of Music , but was sung in Italian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Telegraph , composed " The Snow Bird , " an opera which has been produced in the West ; and his " Atlantis " is said to be ready now . The probable cast for " The King 's Henchman " has been announced but ca n't be verified , since operatic temperament ca n't be depended upon . Mr. Gatti-Casazza has stated definitely , however , that it will be " an all-American cast , " and it seems reasonably certain that Serafin will conduct it and that Edward Johnson will sing the tenor lead . Johnson is under a half-year contract and wo n't enter the ranks at the Metropolitan until after Christmas . He is a Canadian who came here a good many years ago , played in barber-shop quartets , singing here and there , and finally went into musical comedy . Later he disappeared and turned up in Italy as Eduardo di Giovanni , with an Italian Wagnerian repertoire which is no use to him now . Aside from the gossip as to when the plans for the new Opera Housewill take shape , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changes have been made among the boxholders , but apparently the only important sales are these : Mr. Frazier Jelke has bought Box Number 6 , which formerly belonged to W. K. Vanderbilt , and Mr. Robert S. Brewster has purchased , from Mr. Paul H. Helm , Box Number 4 , which once was the property of August Belmont . There is to be a slight reduction in the prices of certain main floor seats , and Tom Bull is still the imperturbable doorman . Experimental MODERN education still continues to be one of the most serviceable topics for dinner-table conversation . They are telling now the story of a pair of irrepressible small boys , scions of an old New York family , who were transferred this fall from the old-fashioned academic class-rooms to an " experimental " school of the most modern sort . The boys bore up bravely under the first day 's schooling until they were set before trays of beads and invited to string them . The boys then glared and demanded to be sent home . They were gently and firmly dissuaded ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new mother .

Instead of slowing down , she increased her speed , and was caught near the 110th Street exit . The policeman drew alongside . " Oh !
