These eleven also voted with the Democrats last week when thcidrY bills came up for advancement . Despite the claims of the drys that the bills will be passed in the Senate , it is generally believed/ at the Capitol that they will go down to defeat in the upper house at the hands of four Republican Senators . Lieut . Gov . Lowman said recently that unless the drys could muster up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in the upper . house . Lays Auto Deaths to Liquor . Assemblyman Jenks made , the principal speech in favor of the dry measures . Re said he was convinced that 50 per cent . of the automobile accidents " result from some one being filled up with booze . " " I have almost come to the conclusion . " said Mr. Jenks , " that either prohibition should be enforced or the automobiles taken off the public highways . The bootleggers , driving high-powered cars , are killing people right and left on our highways and getting away with it . " I have good reason to feel that these bills will be passed in-the Senate and sent down to Governor Smith . He is doing a whole lot of talking these days about the number of persons who are being killed at the grade crossings , but I do n't hear him say anything about those who are being killed by the bootleggers. ? - If the Governor wants to veto these bills and assume the responsibility for permitting the bootleggers to continue their slaughter of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane man in the State . knows that the bootleggers have never been so rampant as they have since the Governor signed the bill repealing the old Mullan-Gage State Enforcement act . " Assemblyman Galgano , Democrat , of New York , declared that the enactment of a State prohibition law would mean nothing " because every man here knows in his heart that it will not be enforced . ? ' The situation in this State ane ? country , brought about by prohibition , is disgraceful , ' said Mr. Colgan ? . " Time was when we did n't hear much about gin and whisky , but it is getting so now that the popular girl or boy in school is th ? one who can produce a flask and say ' come on , let 's have a Drink . ' " Assemblyman Bloch , Democratic leader , took the Republicans to task for - passing the buck " in connection with prohibition . " The present attitude of the Republican Party is to fool the Drys and , whether intentionally or not . to let the Wets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority leader . " Kansas is dry , but United States Attorney Buckner says the Federal courts in the ' Southern District of New York are paralyzed . The Republican Party desires to give the Drys a law and the Wets the enforcement they desire . In other words , the Republican Party Is playing that great game which they play with such skill and adroitness , entitleti ' passing the buck . ' " Tells of Rum-Running . Assemblyman Boyle . Republican , of Suffolk , drew a vivid word picture of how women and children were ordered off the beaches in Long Island so that the bootleggers could land their cargoes without being interrupted . " You may be surprised if I tell you that only three weeks ago a. four-masted schooner appeared off Huntington and later landed 2,000 cases of liquor which were transported to New York City , " said Mr. Boyle . " It 's time we put a stop to this . The Democratic Party always has been on the wrong side of every moral issue . and history snows that to be a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people due to the cowardly surrender of the State to the clamor of those with low appetites . " The remarks of Assemblyman Boyle drew the fire of Assemblyman Gavagan , Democrat , of New York . " If American liberty ' and law are to be handed out by Boyle and his crowd , then I prefer Russia with its Soviet Government , " shouted Mr. Gavagan . " Thank God we do n't have to go around in my county wearing sheets and pillowcases to enforce the law . " Minority Leader Bloch , . in a second speech . took exception to the remarks made by Mr. . Boyle . " Mr. Boyle tells us that 2,000 cases of liquor were transported through his county , but I would like to know who gave the bootleggers protection in Surloth County , " said Mr. Bloch . " There are many reports around New York that the Sheriffs in some of the counties are paid a rake-off of so much on every bottle of booze that is carried through their county . " It is expected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper house next week .
