A great outcry arose from twenty platforms full of women in Hyde Park , London , last week , and a still greater whine of approbation surged from the lips of 100,000 ladies there assembled . The females , mostly shod in flat heeled shoes , had marched to outlaw war and many a one of them had tramped , Chauceresquely , across the length of England to contribute personally her mite to the splendid idea . There were miners ' wives , actresses , professional women , society dames . . . . <P> Through the rain at the head of the petticoat parades rode equestriennes on white horses , attired in long blue mantles and three-cornered hats , while behind straggled the grim retainers . One delegation wore the regulation pilgrimage " jumper " with the word " Pax " and a dove of peace across the center of the back . <P> Among the equestriennes could have been seen blonde Mrs. Pethick-Lawrence , grand marshal of the crusade , onetime belle of the Weston-Super-Mare lite , later reclaimed for evangelical uplift among the fallen women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female Suffrage onslaughts , presently flying about speechmaking to the effect that <P> " The World is a Family Not a Barracks . " <P> Then there would be masculine Maude Royden , famed pulpit female , who has a reputation among the timorous British Christians as a dangerous missionary of socialism and amidst the red-hot socialists as a tame and sentimental apostle of Christianity . <P> And gospeling from the platforms could have been heard Margaret Bondfield , leader of British working girls . Lady Astor is one of the supporters of the movement , but her Parliamentary duties prevented her from joining the marchers . On arriving in broiling Hyde Park , the processions were met by actors , dancers , children , who gave a symbolic pageant representing the coming of peace . The speeches delivered , the dancing over , a resolution was adopted urging the government to settle all disputes by arbitration . The lady pilgrims expect that law will , or , at least , " should take the place of war . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
