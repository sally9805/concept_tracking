T HE Drifter saw her first as she walked deliberately through the crowded railway station by which he had just entered Manhattan . Her gray fur coat was grimy with the dust of countless city streets and her white neck was shadowed with the same dingy stain . But dignity was in every movement of the lithe body that found its way so easily through the tangled mass of human beings . As she passed the Drifter he looked into her eyes  --  and knew somehow that he had come face to face with reality . They were calm and wise  --  unjudging , and very tired . And because wisdom had come to her through sorrows they were old eyes  --  too old for the graceful figure that slipped through the crowd and vanished into the street . A FEW mornings later the Drifter took a turn along a parkway . A gray figure walked there , too , close to the fence . Her pace was steady , unhurried , but at intervals she looked back . The Drifter followed her glance . At a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and very excited . His tail was up , his step was eager . Every movement said : " Is n't this great ?

He caught a glimpse of the gray cat 's eyes . There was no fright in them  --  she was simply bored , tragically bored . He watched . The dog was gaining a bit . The cat turned a corner and her pursuer followed . They a s both disappeared . T HE Manhattan Cat . Who has not seen her ? Like a gray shadow she moves over the face of the city  --  and disillusionment is in her eyes . She may be black , she may be white , she may be black and white ; but always there is that indefinable grayness about her that distinguishes her from other cats . In every doorway she lurks  --  and woe to the youth who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she live ? The Drifter could n't tell . He has seen the little gamin sparrows visiting their nests on the shoulders of the saints in Trinity churchyard ; he has never seen the Manhattan Cat except on the move . He did see two bedraggled and frightened kittens under a stairway on Brooklyn Bridge the other day , but that is all . P ERHAPS there 's a cats ' heaven , where the streets are paved with eiderdown and the only dogs are toy dogs ; where the gutters run with milk and birds are sometimes , not too often , caught . But the Drifter fears the City Cat would n't like it . Three kittens were offered homes in the bosom of a refined family . All the comforts were theirs for the taking . But milk-fed cleanliness was not to their liking , and soft carpets were irksome to the pavement-hardened feet of their inheritance .

THE DRIFTER Correspondence Be Honest to the South To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : There is a significant article in the American Mercury for October called The Dilemma of the Negro by that eloquent and admirable writer , W. E. Burghardt Du Bois . The whole is a careful study of educational problems for the Negro , and it contains a strong plea for Atlanta University , which he says is starving today . " Despite its great record , it has not half the income it needs ; its teachers are wretchedly underpaid ; its equipment is painfully inadequate . " I can vouch for the needs of Atlanta University and for the beautiful spirit of faith and hope and loving service that is shown by the members of the faculty , both black and white . The South is fond of saying it understands the Negro best . It has even the impertinence to proclaim that it treats him best ! It makes an insincere pretense of desiring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spleen upon those white men and women who really try to lift it up . It amazed me to find that the most delightful white men and women were entirely ostracized for giving their lives to teach the Negroes . One woman professor at Atlanta University is the daughter of a former president of a well-known Wisconsin college , yet she is nevertheless completely ignored by white Atlanta , even her own friends coming down from the North falling into line with the local policy of neglect . And speaking of visitors from the North , I want to protest against the silence of those who loathe Southern injustice and yet are afraid to speak and give offense . It is not considered good form to utter one 's opinion on the Negro question , as if it could really be a purely local question , one in which the North is not just as much interested as the South . Thus the few liberals of the South ( and they are growing ) receive no support from the liberals of the North . They have begged me to pass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn . Let us no longer toady to Southern opinion , saying : " It is a bigger problem than we of the North thought . " " If we lived here we also would act as you do . " When we learn that taxes are taken from the Negro and little given in return , let us cease being polite and call it plain dishonesty as it deserves . When we learn that $9.64 is spent in the education of a white boy and $1.74 for a black boy , do n't let them tell you they are doing their best to educate the Negro . If the South wished to educate its Negroes , surely it would not dishonor the white teachers who are endeavoring to accomplish it . No , the next time you go South , leave your politeness at home . Tell the truth . New York , October 30 ANNIE NATHAN MEYER Library Censorship To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : " Were you born in this country ? " " Why did you come here ? " Thus spake Mr. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh , simply because I contributed to the library a book dealing with a vital phase of American history . The book was John Kenneth Turner 's remarkable and most accurate study of America 's part in the late war , " Shall It Be Again ? " The director refused to place this book on the shelves for general circulation . He told me by letters and by a personal interview that this book was anti-American ? insidiously anti-American  --  and that no true American would desire to see it circulated . The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh is controlled by a ruthless czar ; he is the director , who is appointed by a board of trustees , among them Andrew Mellon , foremost Pittsburgh citizen ( on the income-tax returns ) and Secretary of the United States Treasury . The director has the final word on all books , magazines , and newspapers that are to enter the library . After experimenting thus far , I decided to go further . I sent the library three more books , which , I wrote the director , I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves for general circulation . These books were Scott Nearing 's " The American Empire , " Upton Sinclair 's " The Goose-Step , " and ex-Senator Pettigrew 's " Imperial Washington . " A few days later I received an acknowledgment and thanks for my contribution , but do you think they were ever placed on the shelves for general circulation ? No ! Pittsburgh , October 26 BENJAMIN P. CRASS TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I appreciate your courtesy in allowing me to see the article criticizing the policy of the Carnegie Library . As typical of many points in which the article falls short of the truth , let me say that the opening conversation , in order correctly to represent the facts , should be prefaced by statements of your correspondent to the effect : America is all wrong . Her government is altogether corrupt and her public men are all crooks and grafters . It was only then that as a matter of curiosity I asked the question " Were you born in this country ? " and obtained the answer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fair , the article should state explicitly that thebooks were accepted for reference use , which would make them always available for all readers of maturity . Yes , there is a distinct difference of opinion between your correspondent and the writer as to the policy which should be pursued by a public library . We do contend that a public library is not only justified in limiting the circulation of certain material to people of maturity of judgment and with sufficient knowledge of the facts in question to enable them to discriminate between true and just charges and unfair and malicious slander , but is obligated to adopt such a policy . While we would not and do not debar from our shelves any material representing the viewpoint of any individual or group of individuals , we do believe that we should not circulate indiscriminately among young and immature minds unproved or false assertions and accusations calculated to defame character and to subvert government and good order . We believe that public funds should not be devoted to such a purpose . May I call your attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses discretionary power as to the material he shall circulate and , in that sense , exercises the same right ( censorship ? ) as that claimed for the library ? To say that the library shall circulate without question anything that finds its way into print simply makes the publisher the judge rather than the public library . Pittsburgh , November 24 JOHN H. LEETE , Director , Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Adrienne Toner , Saint To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I have received a copy of The Nation containing an exceedingly interesting and brilliant review of my novel " The Little French Girl . " It would ill become a writer to enter into any controversy as to an interpretation of her work , yet may I be allowed  --  in regard to an earlier novel  --  one protest ? " Adrienne Toner " is in no sense the story of " the grooming of an American girl into ladyhood . " I see Adrienne as no more , or less , of a lady at the end than at the beginning of the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is as a saint that I see her ending , and her story is the story of a saint . ANNE DOUGLAS SEDGWICK Far End , Kingham , Oxon , England , October 31 Savinkov and Masaryk To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The reprint of Savinkov 's story , appearing in the International Relations Section of your publication for October 22 , finally gives an opportunity to subject Savinkov 's assertions as regards President Masaryk to a closer scrutiny . Briefly , Savinkov asserts that in the year 1918 he received money from one Klepando in the name of President Masaryk for the purpose of conducting a campaign of assassination against the Bolshevik leaders . President Masaryk left Moscow on the 9th of March on his way to America by way of Siberia and Japan . While in Tokio he advised the Allied governments not to antagonize the Soviet leaders and so to handle the Russian situation as to prevent these men from becoming German tools , consciously or unconsciously . Whether we agree with Masaryk 's Russian policy or not , this fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so far as it involves Dr. Masaryk , who , in his memorandum from Tokio , holds that a Soviet downfall is not to be expected in the near future . President Masaryk arrived in Vancouver on April 29 , 1918 . I know , because I met him there in response to his cabled request from Tokio . From that time until November 19 of the same year I was with him daily , first as his secretary , then as delegate of the Czecho-Slovak National Council , and still later as commissioner of the Czecho-Slovak Republic to the United States . I know every move that was made , I saw virtually every document that was issued , including cablegrams to the troops in Siberia , and through this all Masaryk 's insistence is upon strict neutrality of the Czechs in Russian matters and their departure for the western front in France . The clash with the Soviets came as a development following Masaryk 's departure from Russia , and was not welcomed by the President , still less instigated or ordered by him . It was inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of the Czechs in their desire to reach France . Savinkov speaks of a Klepando who made him the alleged payment . There was no Klepando in the Czech movement in Russia . Probably Savinkov refers to George Klecanda , secretary of the Russian branch of the Czecho-Slovak National Council . But if so , more than reasonable doubt is thrown upon his story by the mere fact that Klecanda died on April 28 , 1918 , on a railroad train between Petropavlovsk and Omsk , and was buried in the Omsk cemetery . At all these times Savinkov appears to have been in Russia proper . He claims that he was ordered by the French ambassador to begin a revolt in Jaroslav or Rybinsk at the beginning of July , 1918 . At that time Masaryk was in America and Klecanda had been dead for two months . Washington , D. C. , October 21 CHARLES PERGLER Schoolbooks and Propaganda To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In your magazine for September 17 appears an article which refers , among other things , to a textbook of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing various sorts of propaganda , consciously or unconsciously , in favor of rich men and corporations , with the effect of prejudicing the minds of children who read the book in favor of these same " malefactors of great wealth . " Especially , the writers Messrs . Herskovits and Willey are alarmed by the fact that I used some illustrations which came from the United States Steel Corporation or some of their subsidiaries . Please allow me to state that after a considerable number of years ' experience in the classroom I never once knew a member of the class to make any reference whatever to the source of an illustration which was printed in fine type beneath it . Nobody except a college professor looking for trouble would read into a mere credit line anything in the nature of propaganda . Furthermore , the criticisms in the article are too often based on paragraphs or sentences or illustrations taken out of their context and made to seem to suggest something that the ordinary reader would never think of , as long as they remained in their proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious , when I put myself into the mental state required of a textbook writer , in favor of or against corporations , labor unions , or any other of the numerous economic elements that actually do exist . I will not allow myself to refuse to give corporations or rich men credit for occasionally doing something right . But I know that the discussions and questions and illustrations in the book will create no prejudice one way or the other , if considered by any teacher or class in the spirit in which they were prepared . An author can not help it if a teacher or critic reads into a text something which is not there . But he does object to having his work advertised as unfair when there is no cause for any such assertion . Pittsburgh , October 24 R. 0 . HUGHES Mr. Hughes selects John D. Rockefeller 's church for illustration as an example of a " community church . " Public-health work is illustrated by a tooth-brush drill by " courtesy of Tennessee Coal , Iron , and Railroad Co . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a church ; the wreckage of the supply-house at Herrin ; and a crowd listening to a strike speaker . Beneath the first of these is the caption : " Strikers or their sympathizers overturned and wrecked these cars in Denver , Colorado . The public was seriously inconvenienced . Are such conditions necessary or excusable ? " After careful study of the book we can not accept Mr. Hughes 's contention that Messrs . Herskovits and Wiley distorted his meaning by quoting sentences apart from their context . His section on Those Who Would Overturn Things , from which they quoted liberally , is grotesque . Mr. Hughes 's own book makes plain his earnest desire to be fair and to state both sides ; most of it is excellent , but the chapter on Industrial Relations reveals his own , perhaps unconscious , distrust of labor unions and sympathy with industrial paternalism. ? EDITOR THE NATION . E. D. Morel 's Work To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The announcement of E. D. Morel 's death will be accepted by friends of the liberal movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rare leader . His combination of intellectual rectitude and moral courage is almost without parallel in our times . How little we know , or perhaps are still intended to know , of such champions of truth is made clear by the scant notice of his death , as it had been by the superficial recognition of his great achievements during his life . His election at Dundee over Churchill by a majority of ten thousand at the time of MacDonald 's triumph was hardly recorded in this country . Today we have to search English papers to find that in the late conservative landslide he was again elected from the same district by an increased majority . These triumphs at the polls are the more significant when we remember that his was a life 's challenge to falsehood and hypocrisy in a period of lying propaganda at its worst . The man who wrote " Red Rubber , " and fought for many years to expose the crime of the Belgian Congo and succeeded , could hardly expect official or even popular favor . The author of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophet of the Great War 's origin , purpose , and tragedy to invite recognition in his own lifetime . The British citizen who throughout the war refused to bend the knee before official misstate-. ment , and finally to curb him was sent to prison on a technical charge , must have been prepared to be lost in obscurity . But he was a man of action . He not only survived ; he triumphed . His publication Foreign Affairs has maintained his crusade for truth . In its columns he has confirmed the correctness of every charge he ever uttered against the myth of sole guilt for the war and against the hideous crimes committed since the war in the name of humanity and democracy and world peace . Friends of democracy may derive consolation and courage from the fact that so unyielding a champion of truth won the confidence of his constituency in two elections . They may have to concede that the British foreign system is too well in-trenched to have made it possible to admit so uncompromising a champion of open diplomacy into the cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of the inspiration of a life of service so completely unselfish , courageous , and noble . St. Louis , November 24 CHARLES NAGEL To Morel To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I am sending you the following few lines in appreciation of a great man who has just died : Dauntless he walked breast forward , pressing to his goal ; Scorned Courts where subterfuge helped diplomats betray , Held Truth his oriflamme , nor feared the scourging way Which immemorial time has made the true man 's dole .
