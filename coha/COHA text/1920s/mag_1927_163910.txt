Last week Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and talked for two and a half hours from a prepared memorandum . Mexico is fomenting the Liberal revolution in Nicaragua which is trying to overthrow the U. S. 's protg , President Diaz ; and behind Mexico are the Bolshevists of Russia , said Mr. Kellogg . He produced documents : 1 ) a resolution of the Red International of Trade Unions in Moscow , appealing to " the toilers of Latin America " ; 2 ) a speech by an unnamed representative of the American Communist Party , urging his fellows to become " the defenders of the oppressed peoples of Latin America " ; 3 ) instructions and theses of the Executive Committee of the Communist International in Moscow on the same subject ; 4 ) reports on the activities of Chicago Communists among their comrades in Mexico ; and other Reds ' emanations . Mr. Kellogg had nothing to prove that the Mexican government took any part in the Red plot . His obiter dicta gave the press an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some frenzied speeches in Congress . <P> Reading the newspapers next day , Mr. Kellogg must have realized that his stern and vigorous efforts had caused trouble . Walter Lippmann , able chief editorial writer of the New York World , who had recently talked with President Coolidge , said : " What can be the mentality of a Secretary of State who will sponsor such balderdash as this memorandum ? Here we are in the midst of the most delicate international crisis that has arisen since the War , and we find the Secretary of State engaged in slanderous insinuation against a friendly government . Could anything be meaner ? . . . This is a crime against the peace of the world . This is a crime against the honor of the United States . " <P> For the rest of the week , Mr. Kellogg said nothing more on the subject of Bolshevism . Really , Mr. Kellogg does not want any war with Mexico- nor does President Coolidge-nor do nine-tenths of the U. S. Hence , the artificial war scare prepared to die . <P> On U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stern statement : " From the beginning of the trouble a year ago , the United States has offered its good offices and exerted its influence to compose the difficulty . The same attitude has existed ever since Diaz was elected president , nor is any change contemplated . " <P> Meanwhile , President Diaz of Nicaragua , who , with the aid of U. S. marines , saw a victory over the Liberals looming , outlined a peace plan for his citizens . ( See p. 13. )
