Half forgotten now except by well-informed tourists , the townsfolk of Rothenburg , Bavaria , were mildly astonished one morning in 1631 when an invader rode up the hill from the Tauber River and announced his intention of burning their old city . The burgomaster begged him not to do so ; Tilly , the invader , listened patiently to these speeches and announced , according to the likely legend , that he would spare Rothenburg if its mayor would drink , at one sitting , a hogshead of its famous beer . The burgomaster , with relish rather than resolution , did so immediately . Rothenburg , since that happy day , has been threatened by no soldiery . Having defied Tilly , the town has defeated time , lazily also , drinking beer and singing songs . The streets and houses stand now exactly as they stood in the middle ages . <P> In the U. S. , there is no town that resembles Rothenburg . Enforced by the harsh government of time , the blind statutes of growth or of decay are everywhere obeyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rebellious , which refuse to acknowledge all of time 's taxations . One such is Williamsburg , Va. , the Colonial Capital of Virginia , and the seat of the College of William and Mary . Sleepy and beautiful , darkened by huge trees , the town is full of old houses , old names . Here and there impertinent reminders of the present-high schools , garages , drugstores - have crept in to confuse its calm antiquity ; last week John D. Rockefeller Jr . announced that he would provide the money ( up to $5,000,000 ) necessary for removing all such incongruous landmarks and for replacing them with the houses that had originally occupied their sites . The agent who secured this magnanimous donation , without the aid of a beer barrel , was Dr. William A. R. Goodwin , professor of Philosophy of Religion at William and Mary , director of Williamsburg restoration work . <P> The Town . The capital of the crown colony of Virginia was moved from Jamestown to Williamsburg in 1699 . The College of William and Mary had been founded in 1693 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gloucester Street , by the time the governing body of the cavalier colony arrived , the House of Burgesses had been set up . <P> There began then , for the green metropolis , the busiest years of its never bustling history . The great gentlemen of the colony lived in houses along Duke of Gloucester Street or in their manors , surrounded by wide and fallow fields , outside it . The Raleigh Tavern became a nourishing hostelry , in whose stables Negroes lolled or fought with each other and in whose tap room Henry Wetherburn brewed his " arrack punch , " a stronger potion than the beer of Rothenburg . The tap room of the Raleigh was the lobby of the lazy capital ; for a hundred years , almost nothing happened in Williamsburg that could not be traced to that cheerful room where the Jeffersons , the Washingtons , the Randolphs drank .
