txt A few hours after the French capital had been stirred by rumors that the new Finance Minister intended to make shifts in the higher personnel of the Bank of France , Joseph Caillaux issued his first communique announcing the displacement of Governor Robineau by M. Moreau , Director General of the State Bank of Algeria . The reasons advanced by the Finance Minister for this step were that Governor P-obineau " had frequently expressed his desire to retire since last year , both to M. Caillaux and to his successors . In recognition of his long and eminent services M. Robineau is appointed an Honorary Governor of the Bank of France . " In the next paragraph the Finance Minister meets any fears that the Bank of France is to become a mere ? instrument in the hands of the Government by declaring : " M. Moreau , who was Chief Assistant to M. Rouvier ( Finance Minister In 1887 , from 1889 to 1892 and from 1902 to 1906 ) has been brought Up in the school of the great financiers of State . In accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our great bank of issue , the credit of which must remain distinct from that of the State . He has received the Government 's mission and he will be the faithful interpreter , of its intentions . " M. Picard , the present ' Vice Governor of the Bank of France , has been appointed Director General of the Bank of Algeria in the place of M.

No decision was taken regarding the Berenger-Mellon debt settlement at the first Ministerial Council this morning , but it is understood that representation is being made immediately to Washington of the difficulties in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment are not undertaken . The text of the agreement was laid before the Chamber by the last Cabinet and is now under consideration by the Finance Commission . If Washington will not permit any retouching then the Government will have to ask the Commission to make its report and lay the agreement before Parliament as it exists . That will provoke a very difficult Situation . As the Premier of the Cabinet which authorized the signature of the agreement , M. Briand will be almost compelled to make the vote one of confidence , though the present Ministry is far from approving the accord as it stands and the Chamber has a large majority insisting on a safeguard clause . The position is of such difficulty that it was decided that consideration of the attitude of the Government must eventually be postponed until a further meeting of the Cabinet , before which it is hoped that through the usual diplomatic channels some indication may be received of Washington 's opinion on the possibility of relaming negotiations . Beyond the admission that a discussion of the situation in regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Briand nor M. Caillaux is willing to reveal what the Government 's attitude is likely to be .

Robineau. who was ousted as Governor of the Bank of France this evening by AL Caillaux , earlier in the day hit back at the report of his probable dismissal with an emphaticdenial that he had any intention of resigning . When asked after the Council meeting what the Government 's intention was in regard to the Governor of the bank , M. Briand replied somewhat enigmatically , adding to his statement that he could not deny all the press reports . " The problem is sufficiently grave to demand preliminary and most , attentive examination , " he said .
