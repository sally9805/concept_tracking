txt For Curb on Motor Drivers . To the Editor of The New York Times : With 231 automobile fatalities in a single month in New York State alone , it is high time that drastic action was taken in the interests of public safety . Every motorist has , or should have , a license , either as owner or driver . If every time he appeared in court he were required to produce this license-in order that any conviction could be endorsed thereon , it would be easy to check up his record for the license period . Then if when renewing his license a different colored card were given those on whom penalties for serious offenses have been enforced during the previous year . the record would , be continuous . In every serious case of Ides of life or injury the license should be suspended or canceled entirely . Failure to produce license In court should automatically involve double penalty , and driving without any license at all should also be seriously penalized . AUSTEN BOLAM . Brewster . N. Y ..
