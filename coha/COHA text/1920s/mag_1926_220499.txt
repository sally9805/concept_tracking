The drama of business does not always go unrecorded . Sometimes it yields good ore to a professional playmaker . John Galsworthy , for instance , devised a play called " Old English " ( which had a successful run in New York and London last year ) from a meditation which must have taken shape some- what like this : <P> " Old English-he 's got to stand for something . A deep-hearted old jingo , tough as an acorn . Hearts of oak-was n't that an old song ? The acorn-heart of England . Ships , of course , and exports ; that will be his business . An oak can stand for three hundred years , but this man is old . Have to get a big scene to bring out his fibre . Well , say he 's in trouble with his stockholders ; they do n't like the way he 's running the company , want him to resign , but he thinks he can diddle them again . He gets up to speak at a general meeting of shareholders . Catcalls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . . . ' Take a Vacation ! ' . . He stands at the foot of the table , brown as wood . ' Gentlemen . . . . ' His voice is so faint that they can hardly hear . ' Louder , louder ! ' And then he does it , makes his last bid and gets across . . . . Splendid stuff for the second act . . . . " <P> Thus that eminent propagandist , Mr. Galsworthy , must have planned his play . Does life plagiarize literature ? Only last week , in a noisy director 's room in London , the scene was enacted exactly as Mr. Galsworthy planned it . Sir Thomas Lipton was the oaken figure at the foot of the table . The tea business , a shareholder hinted , had far outgrown the ability of its founder . It needed , perhaps , a younger man - Sir John Ferguson , director of finance . Another share holder pointed out that the company 's overdraft at the bank was 10,000 in March . He would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully , Sir Thomas began to speak . He did not utter exactly the words that Mr. Galsworthy wrote for his " Old English , " but the emotion , the gnarled will standing like a beam in the tides , were the same . <P> " . . . sound at the core , I tell you . My life work . . . . I am prepared to sacrifice all ideas of rest and recreation to help the business regain its wonted position . . . . " <P> The report and accounts were finally adopted by a majority vote .
