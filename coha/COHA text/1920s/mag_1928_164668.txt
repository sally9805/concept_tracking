EVA 'S APPLES - William Gerhardi - Duffield ( $2.50 ) . <P> Thinly disguised under the synonym Ottercove , Lord Newspaper-Magnate Beaverbrook appears in Gerhardi 's new book , avowedly " pure and unmixed , except for the obvious extravaganza . " But Beaver-brook 's life has been so rich in extravaganza that the fictitious is not always obvious . Ottercove rides in a Winged Chariot , a comfortable limousine that darts down London streets or rises quietly into the air far above traffic and turmoil . He promises Proteg Dickon ( Gerhardi himself in disguise ) his greatest evening paper as wedding present , but reneges . He begets a son of Eva , whom he marries to get the better of her other lovers . Eva who inherits her Russian mother 's charming promiscuity was accustomed to arrive penniless at some unfortunate town , take up her abode at the workhouse , but carouse nightly at cafe and dance hall . Eva once traveled from Ireland with nine Catholic priests ; all went to the same London hotel ; all went to the cinema ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the middle ? " - " No , at one end . Father Michael and I holding hands , and all the other eight too in a chain . Very intriguing . " <P> So far , so maudlin good . But out of necessity perhaps to H. G. Wells to whom the book is dedicated , Author Gerhardi winds up his loose strands with a tiresome world destruction . Ottercove flies with Vernon Sprott ( Arnold Bennett ) toward the patch of earth that survives the end of the world , but disintegrates on the way . As Castor &; Pollux the two men are immortalized by the glowing ends of their cigars . Ottercove 's unborn son and Eva and some of her lovers are chief survivors of the extravaganza.
