It was difficult to prophesy election results in Philadelphia . The effect of Philadelphia 's bootleg investigation had to be considered ( TIME , Sept. 17 et seq . ) . In that citadel of Vare Republicanism the Volstead act carried all its ghostly , malevolent outriders . Flagrant police corruption had been exposed . Suspects in higher positions has ceased to wink , begun to blink . The Vare regime was receiving unwelcome , unpleasant publicity . <P> It was District Attorney John Monaghan who directed the Special Grand Jury 's investigation . During the eleven weeks before Election Day he arrested more than 40 policemen and racketeers . <P> He examined innumerable others . He jailed &; fined two police captains and three district detectives on charges of extortion , bribery , conspiracy . He kept on gunning for culprits . <P> It was Matthew J. Patterson , portly Vareman , State Legislator , boss of the 19th ward , who found himself jailed for five years , fined $7,500 . " Extortion , bribery &; conspiracy " rang dismally in his ears . <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , who scorned the idea that municipal extortionists could exist among the police or elsewhere . But at length he ordered a wholesale transfer of the police force . He compared the reports of new and old incumbents of the precincts . On the basis of later Grand Jury reports he suspended from office almost one half of the executive police officers-three out of five inspectors , 18 out of 43 captains . These men had been found " unfit to hold any position in the municipal government . " Their bank accounts revealed " unexplained wealth " amounting to $798,000 . <P> It was Judge Edwin O. Lewis who started the investigation , who was its consistent supporter . He referred to the Grand Jury reports as " an amazingly sordid recital . " <P> It was Max " Boo Boo " Hoff who had been characterized as the bootleg tsar , Borgian in intrigue , monstrously and illicitly wealthy . But he declared himself bankrupt . And his lawyer suggested lavish Hoff philanthropy . Students of the situation wondered whether the term " philanthropy " included the hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boo " in recent years . <P> It was Edward S. Goldberg whose Military Sales Company sold machine guns &; bullet-proof vests to " Boo Boo " and others . <P> It was Joel D. Kerper who peddled drinkables to prominent Philadelphia clubmen &; tycoons . Many of these flawlessly tailored citizens appeared to testify . ' Legger Kerper went to jail for 15 months , paid a fine of $20,000 . <P> Gin mills , racketeers , grafters were not all . Bordellos , roulette wheels &; lottery dens also figured in the testimony . From time to time Philadelphians were treated to the graphic evidence of a gang murder , racketeer ructions in the purlieus of the city . Never before had Pennsylvanians read of such corruption in city government . It was enough to give any voter pause . Varedom was in jeopardy .
