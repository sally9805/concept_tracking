The French Royalist news organ , L ' Action Franaise gravely carried in its " Court Circular , " last week , the news that " King Jean III of France " + was sending his only son , the " Dauphin Henri of France " on a State Visit to British King-Emperor George V. Ignorant French republicans sniggered , supposing that a chill British reception , if any , awaited Dauphin Henri . <P> On the contrary , the State Visit was taken with utmost seriousness at Buckingham Palace . A banquet of thoroughgoing sumptuousness was got ready . His Majesty George V welcomed and even embraced the Dauphin of France , latest of the Bourbons . Her Majesty Queen-Empress Mary was ashimmer with diadems usually reserved for great occasions . <P> With the Dauphin arrived his sister , Princess Anne of France , who became the Duchessa delle Puglie of Italy , last year , when she married a cousin of Vittorio Emanuele , King of the Italians . To complete the roster of soi-disant royal guests came , last week , Her Majesty the Dowager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose Realm is now a most turbulent and Dictator-ridden soi-disant Republic ( TIME , Feb. 21 , 1927 ) . <P> For a peculiar reason the Buckingham banquet was especially merry . Reason : the British Royal House of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha , which changed its name to the House of Windsor during the War , became slightly estranged from the French House of Bourbon , when a most scurrilous cartoon of British Queen Victoria was openly guffawed at by " King Louis Philippe III of France , " the cousin and predecessor of the present " King Jean III . " Since the Royal Guffawer is now dead and the cartoon forgotten , it was easy , last week , for their Britannic Majesties to bestow gracious hospitality upon Dauphin Henri , a handsome youth of 20 , who is now an undergraduate at the famed Belgian University of Louvain . <P> Royalists recalled that a Pretender to the Throne of France and all his sons are automatically and forever banished from the soil of the Republic . None the less the French Republican Government is not an enemy country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later allowed to do Red Cross work among " his people . " With all to gain and nothing to lose , except his life , he was often in the front line trenches but escaped unscathed . <P> +Fashionably known by his lesser title , the " Due de Guise .
