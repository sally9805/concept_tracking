Cut a long , inch-wide strip of hide from a freshly killed rhinoceros . Let the strip age a little and toughen . Then have one of your black boys taper the kiboko , or sjamboke , down , smooth and polish it with a bit of broken glass . Grinning ingratiatingly , he will hand you a tawny whip . Just right for use on a blackamoor , in the opinion of most South African white men . The callous manner in which White Rancher Jaerl Nafte recently violated every rule and canon of kiboko etiquette was really the cause of his undoing . <P> Some years ago the Union of South Africa forbade laying on of the kiboko by private individuals ; but this law , like U. S. Prohibition statutes , has suffered practical modification . Just as home brew may be brewed in comparative security throughout the U. S. , so a white South Africander may kiboko his refractory blacks providing the kibokee is first stretched on the ground and covered with a blanket to protect him from embarrassing welts and cuts with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a blanket , rash Rancher Jaerl Nafte and his foreman proceeded to kiboko a black named Sixpence Temba who , they said , had insulted a white woman . Spreadeagling the horrified blackamoor on a wagon wheel , they lashed him until their arms were tired . Later they suspended him by one toe from a tree and went on with the kibokoing though he screamed that they were killing him . When tired again , they left him and went off to a picnic . Sixpence , as he had prophesied , died . <P> Last week all the southern gentlemen in South Africa were incensed when Jaerl Nafte was convicted of manslaughtering Sixpence and sentenced not only to seven years ' imprisonment but to receive ten lashes at the whipping post . Never before had a white man been sentenced to be kibokoed in South Africa for kibokoing a blackamoor . Irate Protestant editors called Catholic Judge Saul Solomon , K. C , who imposed the sentence , " negrophilist . " <P> In handing down his decision Judge Solomon said : " Due to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him head downward and beating him to death , he likewise should suffer pain . " <P> An appeal by counsel for the defendant to South African Prime Minister , General the Hon. James Barry Munnik Hertzog brought a curt reply , " The sentence of flogging must be carried out .
