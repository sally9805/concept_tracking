Modern efficiency has given substantial blackboards , trim cabinets with brass locks , skylights and shrewd ventilating systems to the classrooms of U. S. public schools . But the " art objects " on the walls have changed little since the days of slates and coal stoves . Pupils are still schooled among lithographs of George Washington crossing the Delaware , paintings of cows and baskets of fruit , cheap etchings of Longfellow and Lincoln , etc . <P> The artistic sensibilities of Joseph Esposito , 14-year-old Italian of the Dore Elementary School in Chicago , were upset in his classroom by a chromo of George Washington . So he saved $85 by selling ice cream , privately commissioned an artist to copy the Stuart portrait of Washington which he had seen in the Chicago Art Institute . Last week he presented the oil painting to his school . He is behind in his studies , but he has given boards of education , throughout the land , something on which to ponder .               @ @ @ @ @ @
