Irving Berlin THE Forhan hour , Station WEAF , a few weeks ago was devoted to a musical summary of the achievement of Irving Berlin . Tuning in , without foreknowledge , I caught a stray word which gave me the appalling impression that I had lost a friend and America a composer , for the announcer spoke with the gravity and sentiment generally reserved on the air for Victor Herbert alone . Presently I recovered . Mr. Berlin is alive , thriving , and is launching two new songs . I can hardly remember the time when I was n't singing something by Berlin ; a whole generation of adults in America has grown up on his songs . It is something like a dozen years since I began to write about these songs without , I am rather glad to say , any effect on the composer or on the popular appreciation of his work . Berlin succumbs to influences : from his own life and from the surroundings of his professions ( he has several ) ; but apparently not from critics . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements represented by " Alexander " and " When I Lost You " and you have the germs of nearly everything he has done since . He has developed ; but as a composer he has not been blown of his course . The record of his work coming through the air was more than delightful ; it was impressive . First came his youthful group carefully selected so that each number suggested the half-dozen others in the same vein written in the same period . I missed ( or the broadcasters did not offer ) " Alexander " and " I Want to Be in Dixie " ; but I heard " Everybody 's Doing It " and " The Ragtime Violin " and ( I think ) " The International Rag " in fragments ? the Bermuda Naval Station has a powerful and irritating set of dots and dashes which blankets all other sending . For variety a recent song , " Roses of Yesterday , " was then sung ; and then came a series of numbers from Berlin 's productions including " Everybody Step " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next group , which was meant to give a resume of his present activities : " Say It with Music , " " Always , " " What 'll I Do ? " " All Alone , " " Russian Lullaby , " " Blue Skies , " and " The Song is Ended . " The notable thing about this group is that , with the exception of the first-named , they arc all in the sentimental vein , and that Mr. Berlin omitted ( perhaps the composition of the Foshan broadcasters dictated and limited the choice somewhat ) all the masterpieces of jazz he has written , the fast and hot numbers like " I Love a Piano " and " Pack up Your Sins . " I have a passion for these numbers and consider them Berlin 's best work ; but my feeling as one after another of these extraordinarily popular songs was reeled off was wonder that one man could have done so much . " What 'll I Do ? " " Always , " " All Alone , " and " Blue Skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? two of them , I remember , in a single season ; and they represented only a tiny portion of his output , the rest of which added variety to the tone , for these four are more or less in a single mode . The two new songs were " How about Me ? " ( the title may be " It 's Over " ? I report names and words by ' radio only ) and " Marie , " the latter being the theme song of a movie called " The Awakening , " featuring Vilma Bantry and scheduled for showing presently in New York . Like " Roses of Yesterday , " " Russian Lullaby , " and dozens of others , they are extremely sentimental , which is not a novelty in Berlin ; like them they fail in melodic interest , which is new . Line after line is sung to a repeated tune , not distinguished in itself , and it is only when he approaches his climax , which is , in these songs , his ending , that Berlin gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in " and if you are ? all alone , too . " ) Subject to radio correction , the words of one song included : Maybe A baby Will climb upon your knee , And put his arms about you But how about me ? and of the other : Marie , the dawn is breaking , Marie , you 'll soon be waking , To find your heart is aching . Tears will fall As you recall The moon in all his splendor , A Kiss so very tender , The world will you surrender To me . . . Marie ! These are terrible lyrics and more terrible because they lack any particular adaptability to music , because they are full of padding ( " a kiss so very tender , " for instance , and the awkward inversion of " the world will you surrender " ) ; they want the musical wit which Berlin put even into sentimental songs ( " Some Sunny Day " and the end of " Always , " for examples ) . The musical line is as heavy as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its extreme of sentimentality . In my now abandoned dealings with popular arts I have often been told that criticism from the outside , from intellectuals , would corrupt and spoil the native talent . I // submit that criticism is exactly what would have prevented Mr. Berlin from writing such songs . And now I want to hazard a guess as to why he wrote them . First of all to say that he wanted to write them , that the outside pressure is not great , and that in all probability he thinks they are as good as anything he has written . I said that Mr. Berlin has several professions . He is a song writer , he is also a publisher of songs ; he is a composer of musical shows and also a producer of musical shows . On the surface , there seems to be no opposition between these occupations ; actually they are in perpetual warfare and the compromise made by Berlin is responsible for his present output . I came upon this in connection with the line in " What 'll I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With nothing but a photograph , To tell my troubles to " ? the word photograph , occurring at the musical climax of the song , let me down , and I considered it a lapse of taste . Unlike his biographer , Berlin agreed with me . He told me that he had written an alternative line there ; but that the boys in the office ( of his publishing house ) were sure that the photograph line would " wow them . " Berlin not only trusts the boys ; he likes them . He wants to make them happy by giving them a wow of a song . So he accepted their judgment . The publisher triumphed over the composer . The composer then turned and triumphed over the producer . In the composition of a musical show some twenty numbers have to be written , and more than half of these are either so intimately woven into the text of the show or are so specifically written for intricate dances , that they have no chance of becoming great popular successes . Two or three songs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , over the radio , to the peak of popularity . From his two " Music Box Revues , " Berlin chose five pieces which were successful to any degree ; yet the other numbers are just as hard to write , and the results do not compare with the returns from a single fugitive piece which may , without the investment of a show , run into a million copies in sheets and proportionate returns in its other forms . I do not think that Berlin overvalues popularity , and he is safe from starvation now ; it is natural , since his entire career has been built on the response of the great public , that he should use this as a criterion . ( He once told me how much he would like to have written " Yes , We Have No Bananas , " admitting that he had no respect for it as a composition . ) This feeling , which in all probability he has never analyzed , leads him to write those excellent popular songs which no one can touch in their instinctive feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uninteresting songs of sentiment ; and ? much more important ? leads him away from the work he himself most wants ( or at least wanted ) to do . The Music Box was the beginning of a new thing in his career ; ultimately it was not to house revues , but a sort of American operetta , similar in scope and structure to " The Beggar 's Opera . " Berlin wanted to sum up in his work the musical feelings of America ? not symphonically , not to express America in music exactly , but to weld together the various , changing , always interesting fragments of popular expression in music . He was entranced with " The Beggar 's Opera " because Gay had done just that ; the musical numbers were all song and all popular . Gershwin might go symphonic ; Berlin knew that it was too late for him to impose a foreign structure on his talent . The Music Box now rarely hears music within its walls . It is a piece of real estate , not the culmination of a purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in it ; in any case , renting out a theater to a successful show is easier than putting a show into it , and the owner gets about 50 percent of the gross . The theater owner has dislodged the theatrical producer . Berlin 's fertility is still great ; two months from now he may fling into the air a succession of songs as touching , as personal , as witty , as well made as " Blue Skies " and " What 'll I Do ? " and the rest . I am not deploring what he has chosen to do merely because a couple of songs displease me . Even in these it is possible to recognize Berlin 's hand ; and he is one of very few whose songs are marked with a personality : Gershwin , Kern , and Donaldson are the others who came instantly to mind , and there may be two or three others . *What I dislike is the obvious abdication of Berlin 's own position . He has needed criticism not to make him do what others wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself wanted to do was Preeminently worth doing .
