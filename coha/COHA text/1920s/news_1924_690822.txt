txt PITTSBURGH . Nov. ** University of Pittsburgh has completed plans for the erection next year of a fifty-two story " cathedral of learning . " to house virtually all of the university activities . The structure will be 680 feet high , a height exceeded only by the Woolworth Building and the Metropolitan Life tower in New York City . Announcement of the project was made tonight at a dinner in the University Club . attended by the University Trustees and . Faculty and by a citizens ' committee of 120 proininent Pittsburgh business men . The plans for the building are the outcome of three years ' study . The towering structure is to be located on the fourteen-acre univerilty quadrangle facing the entrance to Schenley Park . The plans call for an outlay of about $10.000,000 . The new building will accommodate 12.000 students . In addition to forming the nucleus of the future university the structure will " express Pittsburgh 's spirit of achievement , " said the announcement . The designs call for construction on the Gothic style . The building will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators will serve it . Charles Z. Klauder of Philadelphia is the architect and the engineering problems of the unique building were figured out by Stone &; Webster of Boston . Comparing in height with the Woolworth Building , which rises 792 feet and 1 inch . and the Metropolitan , which has 700 feet and 3 inches , the proposed educational skyscraper will have one story more than the Woolworth and two more than the Metropolitan tower . It will rise 120 feet higher than the Municipal Building in Manhattan . Expressing Pittsburgh 's Spirit . " Pittsburgh is known as a centre of Itrealth and of industry , " said John G. Bowman , Chancellor of the ' University . " It is known for the making of steel , glass and machinery . The idea of vast tonnage production in the minds of millions of people is associated with the city . But all of this 1.3 only one phase of the real Pittsburgh . There is a way of thinking . a way of doing . a spirit here out of which has come the wealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little known . It was brought here by the pioneers . It is a spirit of courage , of daring , of speed . of action and of honor . Let us call it a spirit of achievement . This spirit to a large extent is unrevealed to the world outside . " The new building is to express this spirit of achievement with such force and with such grasp of its sublimity that the whole world will understand . It is to be the greatest structure ever erected by any community to tell its own living will . The building is to be high , not for the sake of being high , but for the power of inspiration and for the sublimity which great height , together with right proportions , maw , lines , carvings , friezes and pointed Gothic arches can give . Why Great Height was Chosen . In discussing why the university had reached out for height , Chancellor Bowman said three years of thought had dictated that form as best suited . " Charm , Intimacy , restfulness , dignity and coziness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to five stories high . Moss and ivy seem to help such architecture to tell its story . The buildings of Harvard ? Princeton , Oxford and the University of Chicago are of this type . But the feeling of these structures is not indigenous to Pittsburgh . The cost of construction per cubic foot in a high building is somewhat above the corresponding cost in a low building . This greater cost , however , is largely offset by a greater percentage of effective area obtainable in the high building . High construction offers , obviously , better ventilation , better light , less noise , less dust . The cost of heat , upkeep and of janitorial service favors high construction . " The foundation of the high building would require about one and threequarters acres , taken near the centre of the quadrangle . This would leave more than twelve out of the fourteen acres for other buildings in the future . If the space needed by the university were created in four-story buildings , these buildings would quite cover the fourteen acres . The saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about $2.011 ( 000 . " The splitting of knowledge lute ariltidal bits has come about to a large extent from the student 's studying physics in one building , economics in another , and biology in another . He gets the idea that these subjects are separate things and unrelated , just as the buildings are . The high building would give unity to the entire university . " The Lincoln Memorial in Washington tells of the patience , justice and humanity of Lincoln . But the structure is a national expression , not local . The Washington Monu:nent means courage , and the leadership of the first President . But this again is national . The Bunker Hill Monument is a memorial to the spirit of independence . It expresses , I however , a sentiment not only of Boston but of the original thirteen States . In London , Westminster Abbey and St. Paul 's Cathedral record for England what England is unwilling to forget They preserve the tradition of service to the nation . They also are'monuments of the British Empire , and not merely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paris have erected national - memorials , but never one that expresses a city 's individuality and that alone .
