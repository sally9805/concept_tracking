txt A.MERICA 'S DUTY the struggle , but for the present nothing more . Blood , race , tradition , trade and a host of other influences , capped by ambition to go on , to lead , to expand , will always produce strife . We can not escape this conclusion if we take as our guide the evidence of things done and being done , rather than follow the dictates of fancy or desire . The struggle for peace is centuries old , and efforts to end war and establish undisturbed peace have filled the minds of men and taxed the resources of nations . The great combinations of power to prevent war , were , after all , but combinations of forces to restrain the exercise of force , and have more often than not ended in a great struggle for readjustment of the balance of power . The theories and policies of addled // minds and shallow intelligences , products of the applause of the lecture platform , or of minds upset by the flattery incident to sudden wealth , have had their share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they indicate only a failure to understand that war generally has its roots running deep below the surface that is swept by the gaze of such observers . The authors of these theories never have studied seriously the causes of war . They assign as causes the little incidents which serve to touch oft ' the mass of explosive which other forces have been accumulating and piling up for a generation or perhaps a century . War , whether it be for evil or good , is among men , and our clear duty is to recognize this fact , instead of denying the evidence of our senses simply because it is disagreeable and brutal , // something that we would get rid of . Our duty is to protect ourselves as best we can against war and build our protection on so secure a foundation and maintain its efficiency so systematically that our own institutions , ideals and interests may be secure and that we may be able to hand down to our children all the benefits we have received from our fathers . God has given us eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory to glean and carry from the lessons of the past something of wisdom to guide us in meeting the issues of the present . If we fail to make the best use of those faculties which have been given us , we must pay the penalty . We must continue to strive for world peace , for the betterment of human conditions ; we must do what we can to promote arbitration , love of justice ; but // we have no right to forget that none of these will serve to protect us against an unjust aggressor . Let us do all these good things , but at the same time take those measures of wise precaution which the experience of time and of all people teaches , that we may be prepared to defend with force those things which justice , honesty and fair dealing are inadequate of themselves to defend ? As Cromwell said : " Trust in God ? but keep your powder dry . " In other words , do right , but do not trust to that alone . The highwayman is not especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covets , nor is the great nation struggling for trade and expansion disposed to give especial consideration to the morals of the people standing in her way . Every nation does , however , give serious and prompt heed to // the strength and ability of another to hold and protect what she has . After going over the evidence of past results ' and present conditions , we must realize that arbitration to-day can not as a rule be depended upon for protection or even as a means of delaying a resort to force , except in such cases as are not of vital importance to either of the disputants . Questions of citizenship , cases arising under the Monroe Doctrine ? in which we are particularly interested ? are among those which can not well be turned over to arbitration . Our interests in them are vital . Preparedness to resist injustice or attack with force tends to amplify the possibilities of successful arbitration , as the cost and danger of the struggle and the uncertainty of the outcome are evident . Preparedness lends weight to just // claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-guarded house in which the robber sees the danger and realizes the cost . It does not mean that the people of the house are less just because they have had the good sense to recognize conditions and take the wise measure of protection . All arbitration has a much better chance of success when each party realizes that the other has the ability to make ake strong opposition to unjust claims . country unable to defend her rights on land and sea is not the country to determine whether arbitration or force is to be resorted to . It is the strong , well-prepared nation which will determine whether a dispute is to be settled by arms or arbitration , not the weak and unprepared one . Washington 's words still hold good : // " To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace . " The assertion so often made that preparedness increases the probability of war , is unsound from every standpoint , unless those who make the assertion assume that we should not engage in war in any case but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The resort to aggressive force will always be governed to a certain extent by the question of cost ? cost in men and treasure . If no serious resistance is possible on the part of one party to a dispute , the temptation of the stronger and better prepared to use force is great ; if the reverse is the case , consideration and a disposition to arbitrate may be counted on . Every dictate of common sense , the teaching of history and the lessons of // the moment , suggest strongly and unmistakably the urgent necessity of the organization of the might of the nation , in order that we may be ready to meet force with force , if other means fail . Reliance on peace treaties is not a safe policy . Experience shows they often mean little in the face of a great crisis threatening the life and interests of a nation . Preparedness does not mean militarism or an aggressive military spirit ; it means simply the application to the military questions of the day of something of the experience and lessons of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man armed against thieves is not prone to become a thief unless he is one at heart . A nation can be strong without being immoral or a bully . Militarism , as indicated by the existence of a military class // demanding and receiving special con consideration and precedence and exercis ing an undue influence in the internal affairs of the nation or upon its inter-national relations , is to be avoided beyond peradventure . But effective prepared ness can be had without a trace of this condition , as illustrated by Switzerland and France  --  taking only representative forms of government as examples . The entire trend of our sentiment , past and present , disproves the possi bility of such a condition of affairs . No class of the population is more opposed to the establishment of a condition of militarism than the army itself . The army is absolutely democratic , repre senting , as it does , all classes of the people . The great danger which con-fronts our people is that which arises from an ignorance of the organization 48 , i nd capacity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of u l l the great nations except China and n ourselves . While talking peace and arbi t ration we are , through wealth , commer cial aggressiveness and heedlessness as to preparation to defend our rights and properties , one of the great menaces to peace . Lack of intelligent preparedness can not promote peace ; it can and does prejudice its continuance and will cer tainly serve to prolong and make more deadly the effects of war . It is an insult to us as a people to assume that we can not be strong and prepared to fight for the right without becoming likely to use our power for wrong . This is the cant of weaklings who have no strong convictions of right for which they are willing to die , if need be . Let us drop cant and hypoc- // AMERICA 'S DUTY risy and be sure that we can be both strong enough to protect our own rights and interests , and just and self-restrained enough , even though strong , to respect those of others . There is no real basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to become aggressors . We have no right to jeopardize all we have and hold most dear by failing to organize and prepare our strength because of the fear that if strong , organ-ized and ready , our nation may become an international highwayman . Rubbish and cant of the faint-hearted ! Lacking the spirit which places principles and honor above fear and wounds ! Peace treaties ? international law ? they should be observed , but they are not always .

The great Peace Palace stands empty in the land of a prosperous , industrious people at pres-rut , under arms to protect their own neutrality .

As Washington said : " The best way to make a good peace is to have a good army , " ? using the word " army " in the sense of military force , which includes the navy ; and he might have said that the best way to preserve peace is to be prepared against war . We should favor preparedness not only on the grounds of safety , but on the grounds of human- // ity , for it is a brutal waste of life to send an undisciplined and untrained people into war , and war will come , from time to time , do what we may to try to avoid it . No nation does more to tempt others to war than one which , possessing much of the trade and more than her proportion of the wealth of the world , fails to make adequate preparations to guard what she has . // PAST NATIONAL POLICY " A government is the murderer of its citizens which sends them to the field uninformed and untaught , where they are to meet men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplined for battle . " ? General Richard Henry Lee . We are a warlike , but not a military people ; that is to say , we are quick to resent injury and ready to meet force with force , but we are not organized to employ force effectively . We are commercially aggressive ; we are exceedingly rich . We never have submitted and are still indisposed to submit ourselves to discipline or preparation . WTe spend human life like water and pay // with blood and treasure for the lack of ordinary intelligent preparation . We are not so much unready to resort to war for the right if need be as we are unprepared to wage it . We hate mili-tarism , object to large standing armies , and properly , and we can continue so to do and still make full preparation on lines not at variance with our ideals or the principles laid down by the founders . In our country peace societies are not a new idea . The New York Peace Society was founded in 1815 , and as long ago as 1827 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effort has passed through many stages ; the pacifists of to-day must not flatter them-selves that they have discovered that war is brutal . Cicero emphasized it in his day . Seneca characterized war as 54 PAST NATIONAL POLICY plain insanity . " If it could be stopped by pointing out that it is brutal and gives pain , it would have been stopped lung ago . We must realize that there are two types of peace . There is the peace of Home under Augustus , which was a real peace , and Rome and Roman citi-zees were respected by their neighbors ; and there is the other type , the peace of I I onorius , in whose time pacifists prated as they do at present . Nonresistance was the theory . Emperor Honorius raised poultry and the barbarians over-ran the empire . In the first instance there was peace with honor and dignity ; in the second instance the empire was overrun , a civilization almost destroyed through failure to listen to the teach-ings of history and make reasonable , rational preparation . It was the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the kind of peace which marks the decadence of a nation . It goes hand in hand with the policy advocated by the peace-at-any-price people of to-day . Our early presidents were most of them truly great men , lovers of peace ; some of them had participated in war , and all of them had lived through periods of war . They were just and upright in character . What was their advice to our people ? Washington says , in his first annual address : " To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace . A free people ought not only to be armed , but disciplined ; to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite ; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactures as tend to render 56 // them independent of others for essential , particularly . military , supplies . " I n his third annual message , speaking ( ) l ' the militia , which under the provisions of the organic law included men from eighteen to forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , t i der divine protection , ought to rest ( ) II the basis of systematic and solid arrangements , exposed as little as possible to the hazards of fortuitous cireltrnstances. ? In his fifth annual message he made this statement : " I can not recommend to your notice i ? casures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of extracting from them // the fulfillment of their duties towards us . The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion that , contrary to the order of human events , they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds . There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld , if not absolutely lost , by the reputation of weakness . I f we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it ; if we desire to secure peace , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known that we are at all times ready for war . " In Washington 's eighth annual address , speaking of the country 's inability to protect its commerce , he said : " Will it not then be advisable to begin without delay to provide and lay // up materials for the building and equipping of ships of war and to proceed in the work by degrees in proportion as our resources shall render it practicable without inconvenience , so that a future war in Europe may not find our cornnierce in the same unprotected state in which it was found during the present ? " John Adams , in a special message , stated : " With a view and as a measure which even in time of universal peace ought not to be neglected , I recommend to your consideration a revision of the laws for organizing , arming and disciplining the militia , to render that natural and safe defense of the country efficacious . " In his second annual message , which dealt with our relations with France , President Adams declared : " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear war in the necessary protection of our rights and honor , we should give no room to infer that we abandon the desire of peace . An efficient preparation for war can alone secure peace . We ought , without loss of time , to lay the foundations for that increase of our navy to a size sufficient to guard our coasts and protect our trade . " Thomas Jefferson , in his fifth annual message , advocated : " The organization of 300,000 able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 26 , for defense at any time or at any place where they may be wanted . " In a letter to James Monroe , from Monticello , dated June 19 , 1813 , Jefferson wrote : " It proves more forcibly the necessity of obliging every citizen to be a // soldier . This was the case with the Greeks and Romans , and must be that of every free state . Where there is no oppression there will be no pauper hirelings . We must train and classify the whole of our male citizens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can never be safe till this is done . " This letter was written fourteen months before the fiasco at Bladensburg and the burning of Washington . Again he says : " If war be forced upon us in spite of our long and vain appeals to the justice of nations , rapid and vigorous movement at the outset will go far toward securing us in its course and issue , and toward throwing its burdens on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force . // " Considering the conditions of the times in which we live , our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country . For a people who are free and who mean to remain so , a well-organized and armed militia is their best security . " One might continue almost indefinitely to quote from the messages and state papers of our presidents , concerning this great matter of defense , organization and readiness . General Henry Knox , when Secretary of War , sent to President Washington , on January 18 , 1790 , a plan which provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from eighteen to sixty years of age . General Knox refers to the fact that this plan had been previously presented to Washington , had been modified some- // what , and as now finally presented had Washington 's approval . Among other things he states in his letter of trans-mission : " It had been my anxious desire to devise a national system of defense adeduate to the probable exigencies of the I Tnited States , whether arising from internal or external causes ; and at the same time to erect a standard of republican magnanimity , independent of , and superior to , the powerful influence of wealth . " Both Washington and Knox had had unifortunate experiences with the untrained militia during the Revolution , and the plan they now proposed was not one which contemplated the use of militia as it was used during the Revolution , but it was , in effect , the forerunner of the idea voiced by Jefferson in 1813 , // namely , the organizing , classifying and training of the male population . General Knox precedes his plan by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Washington . Among other statements therein made , worthy of note are the following : " But it is at the same time acknowledged that , unless a republic prepares itself by proper arrangements to meet those exigencies to which all states are in a degree liable , its peace and existence are more precarious than the forms of government in which the will of one directs the conduct of the whole , for the defense of the nation . " It . is the intention of the present attempt to suggest the most efficient system of defense which may be compatible with the interests of a free people ? a system which will not only pro- // duce the expected effect , but which , in its operations , shall also produce those habits and manners which will impart strength and durability to the whole government . " All discussions on the subject of a powerful militia will result in one or other of the following principles : " First : Either efficient institutions must be established for the military education of the youth , and that the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of rotation ; or , " Secondly : That the militia must be formed of substitutes , after the manner of the militia of Great Britain . " If the United States possesses the vigor of mind to establish the first institution , it may be reasonably expected to produce the most unequivocal advan- // tages . A glorious national spirit will be introduced , with its extensive train of political consequences . The youth will imbibe a love of their country ; reverence and obedience to its laws ; courage and elevation of mind ; openness and liberality of character , accompanied by a just spirit of honor ; in addition to which their bodies will acquire robustness , greatly conducive to their personal happiness , as well as the defense of their country , while habit , with its silent but efficacious operations , will cement the system . " h ; very intelligent mind would rejoice in the establislunent of an institution , under whose auspices the youth and vigor of the constitution would be renewed with each successive generation , and which would appear to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and events . " // General Knox then concludes his letter with the following summary : " First : That it is the indispensable duty of every nation to establish all necessary institutions for its own perfection and defense . " Secondly : That it is a capital security to a free state for the great body of the people to possess a competent knowledge of the military art . " Thirdly : That this knowledge can not be attained , in the present state of society , but by establishing adequate institutions for the military education of the youth ; and that the knowledge acquired therein should be diffused throughout the community by the principles of rotation . " Fourthly : That every man of the proper age and ability of body , is firmly bound , by the special compact , to per- // form personally his proportion of military duty for the defense of the state . " Fifthly : That all men of the legal military age should be armed , enrolled and held responsible for different degrees of military service . " And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States are to provide for arming , organizing and disciplining the militia , and for governing such a part of it as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states , respectively , the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress . " This plan , briefly stated , consisted of the grouping of ' physically and mentally fit men , between the ages of eighteen and sixty years of age , into three corps. // The young men between eighteen and twenty-one years of age formed the Advance Corps , and the men between twenty-one and forty-five formed the Main Corps . There was a third , or Reserve Corps , which consisted of men from forty-five to sixty years of age . The plan further provided that these first and second groups should be organized into various military units ; that the young men of eighteen and nineteen years of age should receive thirty days ' training in camp each year ; the men of twenty , ten days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forty-five , four days of training each year . This was a federal force and it was to be equipped , armed and subsisted at the expense of the United States ; its members were required to take an oath // of allegiance to the state and to the United States . Herein was an element of weakness . A force of this kind , or any kind of national force , should be purely a federal force . Its officers should be apointed by the president on the federal authority and it should be available for service within or without the United States . The plan was a great advance over anything hitherto proposed , inasmuch as it recognized the necessity for general military training . The training of these troops was to be prescribed by the United States . The early plan was a tremendous improvement over the militia idea finally adopted . It would have resulted in the general military training of our people and the dissemination of a knowledge of our military policy . It represented an appreciation of the necessity for mili- // tary training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1812 would probably never have occurred . Or , if it had occurred , we should have been quickly successful in obtaining our objective . Both Washington and Knox recognized the economic efficiency which would be gained by this training , and they also realized that a tremendous improvement in citizenship would result . They did not expect the men from forty-five to sixty to serve in the first line , but they saw that they would be a valuable asset on the lines of communication , depots , and other important fields of activity where the highest degree of physical excellence is not required . This proposed act , if it had been passed and put into effect , would have saved many tens of thousands of lives and many hundreds of millions of money . // If the advice of our early presidents was sound at the time it was given , when the ocean was a real barrier instead of , as at the present time , the readiest means of approach , once sea control is lost ; when troops were moved over sea by sailing ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations contained large , highly organized and equipped armies prepared for prompt movement in any direction ; when the arms of war were simple and easy of manufacture and easy to acquire familiarity with ; when we had little in the way of commerce or wealth to tempt aggression ; how much more sound is it now , when all great nations have highly organized armies , large reserves of men and material , adequate equipment of all kinds ? Since then steam has divided time // and distance by ten ; the arms of war are most intricate and require a long time to manufacture , and it takes a still longer time to teach men to use them effectively ; our wealth has enormously increased ; our commerce spreads over the earth and we hold great areas far beyond our continental limits ; our people are unskilled in the use of arms , and our population as a whole has little appreciation of its military obligation . There is no question but that the advice of our early presidents is entitled to much more attention to-day than when given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nation of the first class prepared for war . We have absolutely no conception of what modern war means when conducted by a nation organized and ready in men and material . It is to be hoped that we may // never have this experience , certainly not until we have learned something from the experience of others , something from the lessons of the past as well as those of the present . We have no markedly superior military virtues ; as a people , the blood of all peoples runs in our veins . We live under a form of government which tends to develop individuality and self-confidence , good qualities if coordinated and harmonized by discipline . But there is nothing which indicates peculiar or superior military excellence , and there is nothing in our military history upon which we can found such an assumption . We have splendid material for soldiers , if trained , but without training that material is relatively of little value . There seems to be a general impression that , having blundered through our // past wars with a hideously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall continue to blunder on successfully , regardless of lack of preparation on our part or of thorough organization and preparation on the part of our possible antagonist . Such an opinion is entirely unwarranted . Thorough preparation is absolutely indispensable . General Harry Lee ? popularly known as " Light-Horse Harry " ? stated at the end of the Revolution that the nation was the murderer of its men which sent them untrained and undisciplined to meet equally good men , mechanized and disciplined by training . These words were true when they were uttered and they are true to-day , and they apply with peculiar force to our own people . It is not enough to be willing ? we must be // prepared . One would not think of putting into a lifeboat men who could neither row nor swim ; and yet we assume to send them into battle undisciplined and untrained , unfamiliar with the use of arms , where they are to meet men trained to the minute . It is murder ? nothing else . If a lot of men physically of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams of a university and said they were willing to go into athletics , but would not train , they would receive scant courtesy at the hands of their college mates . Experience in athletics has taught that success is absolutely dependent upon thorough preparation ; and the would-be athlete who assumed that he could meet , with any hope of success , an equally good man , physically fit and trained in all the // details of the game , would be looked upon as little better than a fool . So it is with professional soldiers , who have devoted their lives to their work : they see the folly of the idle declarations of the Fourth of July orator , or the equally fatuous and misleading statements of the men who say that we , by virtue of peculiar qualities , are superior to equally good men , trained and ready . Such vain boasts are more than foolish ? they are dangerous . They strike at the very life of the nation . If we heed them longer we shall repent in sackcloth and ashes . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best type ? not the machine-cut-and-dried type , but the soldiers with learning and imagination ? have always recognized that campaigns are won in the preparations 77 // for them , our people have never appreciated this great truth , nor do they realize that thorough organization of the nation 's resources in men , material and money is necessary to a success which shall be characterized by the minimum loss of blood and treasure . Battles are won as well as lost in the national legislature , in the offices of the administration , in departments , as well as in the field . Failure to provide means for conducting the war , neglect properly to organize , undue interference by nontechnical persons in the direction of that highly specialized and technical business , war , the direction of operations to meet political demands of the hour , all contribute , with fateful force , to the outcome of the armed struggle . Under our procedure in the past , the soldier too often has had little to say // in the great question of preparation in its varied forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often has found himself like a sailor put on board a ship in a gale of wind ? a ship built not by professional shipbuilders ? a ship of whose equipment and personnel he is largely ignorant . All he can do is to make the best of a bad situation , reorganize and re-equip in the face of a storm . So it has been only too often with our soldiers , called to lead badly organized , uninstructed , halfarmed bodies of troops without previous training . This describes , in a general way , the situation which has existed at the beginning of our wars in the past . These conditions should not be possible in future wars ; but they will be unless we study thoroughly the question in all its aspects , and take wise measures of // precaution and make such preparation as the experience of the past and the best information of the present indicate . When our people offer their bodies and their lives to the nation for service in war in the nation 's defense , they have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must be ? under conditions which minimize the probability of disaster from lack of preparation , instruction , arms , equipment or organization , both on the fighting line and behind it . Preparation will tend to make the struggle as brief as possible , and reduce the cost in life and treasure to the lowest possible limit . Our people have never entered into war with any of these assurances . They have gone into it blindly , uninformed as to the necessity of the hundred and one things which make for // preparation and which are the sure foundations of success . National defense begins with the people , and must find its main support among their representatives , for , as John Adams said , " National defense is one of the cardinal duties of a statesman ; the soldier can only endorse when asked ; the statesman must advocate , and the legislative body enact . " Only too often do we find men who should know better , speaking of our great military resources , forgetting that unless developed and organized they will be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , initiated by a prepared nation , than would an undeveloped gold mine in Alaska be in a crisis in Wall Street . The fact that a nation has resources does not help if those resources are undeveloped and unavailable . If // modern war emphasizes any one thing above another , it is that resources of all kinds must be promptly available and organized . Mere numbers , untrained , unorganized and unequipped , mean littie ; no wolf was ever frightened by the size of a flock of sheep . As one considers the conduct of our various wars from the standpoint of military efficiency and economy in life and treasure , there is but one conclusion possible , and that is that our lack of system has been not only unduly expensive from every standpoint but that it has led to great prolongation of war , unnecessary loss of life and treasure , and consequent interference with the development of the country . In some instances that lack of organization has resulted in failure to attain the object sought . In the Revolutionary War , Washing- // ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the more one studies the conduct of that war the more he is impressed by the debt we owe to Washington . His sound judgment , able military leadership , and , above all , his patience and persistence , coupled with infinite tact , made it possible for him to retain the confidence of Congress and the people to an unusual extent and to hold together the poorly equipped and hastily assembled raw levies which formed the bulk of the Revolutionary armies . // LESSONS OF THE REVOLUTION " Against stupidity the very gods themselves contend in vain . " ? Schiller . The causes leading to the Revolution had produced such effect that , as early as 1774 , several of the Colonies began preparations for war with England , and a Provisional Congress was convened in Massachusetts , with John Hancock as president . This Congress appointed officers and adopted organization for the militia and made certain arrangements for the collections of supplies , equipment and provisions . The royal governor of the colony attempted to prevent the // assembly of this Congress , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appointed a Committee of Safety , with authority to raise and support a military force to resist the Acts of Paarliament . Under this authority a considerable force of militia was raised , part of it called Minute Men , or troops bound to hold themselves in readiness for instant service . This was the condition of affairs when the conflicts occurred at Lexington and Concord . A few days later , April 22nd , steps were taken formally to organize for defense against Great Britain . The Congress decided to raise an army of 30,000 men , and immediately to enroll 13,600 men within the limits of Massachusetts , trusting that the balance might be supplied by New Hampshire , Rhode // Island and Connecticut . Troops were raised by giving to anyone who succeeded in enrolling fifty-nine men , a captain 's commission , and a colonel 's commission to any man who could secure ten such companies . In other words , qualifications for command rested solely on the ability to enroll men . It is not difficult to foresee the results which must necessarily follow under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officers and their qualifications for command meant little . Of course we must not forget that the situation was an extremely difficult one . The troops had to be raised , there were relatively few trained officers in the colony , and many who had had previous military experience remained constant in their allegiance to Great Britain . Still there is no doubt that a larger proportion of // trained officers could have been secured had the matter of organization been more systematically undertaken . The men were courageous , and when led by officers of experience and capacity , fighting in a defensive position , and not required to maneuver in the face of an enemy , rendered brave and good service , as at Bunker Hill . The Continental Army , when Washington assumed command , consisted of a mass of raw levies , generally speaking , under incompetent officers ? levies composed of men who had no idea of remaining throughout the war and undergoing thorough training . There were many things outside the condition of the army itself which led to great embarrassment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Second Continental Congress , and compelled that // body to assume immediately the functions of civil government , but as it had no authority to levy taxes or provide a revenue , it could only issue Bills of Credit . The power to create and support armies was crippled by a financial system which was based wholly upon the faith of the people in ultimate success . If the Congress had had the power to levy taxes and raise a revenue , the war would have been much shorter and its conduct more vigorous . Moreover , the Congress was vested with both executive and legislative power and there was consequently a lack of the balance and adjustment which exists where these functions are distinct and separate . The country was dependent for its military legislation upon the decisions of a group of citizens wholly without instruction in military matters , and influenced by gen- // eral fear of a standing army . Washington 's correspondence indicates very clearly the embarrassments and the difficulties of the situation . The strength of the army at the time of Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them under short enlistment . Much had to be accomplished . It was absolutely essential to organize a force which would owe its allegiance to the United Colonies , and in June , with this end in view , Congress authorized the raising of ten companies of riflemen in Pennsylvania , Maryland and Virginia , with a term of enlistment of one year . This was the nucleus of the army which finally achieved American independence . During the year both infantry and artillery were added . The enlistments were still for a short period , and did not extend beyond the end of // the following year . The terms of enlistment of the troops thereby enrolled mostly expired at or near the end of 1775 . As it was necessary promptly to raise troops to replace them and to add to those already enrolled , Congress decided to raise twenty-six regiments : sixteen in Massachusetts , five in Connecticut , two in Rhode Island , and three in New Hampshire . Washington was authorized to appoint the officers . This resulted in a condition to which Washington refers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes as follows : " The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is really inconceivable . Many of the officers sent in their names to serve in expectation of promotion ; others stood aloof to see what advantage they could make for themselves , while a // number , who have declined , have again sent in their names to serve . So great has the confusion arising from these and many other perplexing circumstances been that I found it absolutely impossible to fix this very interesting business exactly on the plan resolved on in the conference , though I have kept up to the spirit of it as near as the nature and necessity of the case would permit . " The difficulty with the soldiers is as great , indeed , more so , if possible , than with the officers . They will not enlist until they know their colonel , lieutenant-colonel , major , and captain , so that it was necessary to fix the officers the first thing , which is , at last , in some manner done , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continues : " The number enlisted since my last // is two thousand five hundred and forty men . I am sorry to be necessitated to mention to you the egregious want of public spirit which reigns here . Instead of pressing to be engaged in the cause of their country , which I vainly flattered myself would be the case , I find we are likely to be deserted in a most critical time . Those that have enlisted must have a furlough , which I have been obliged to grant to fifty at a time , from each regiment . The Connecticut troops , upon whom I reckoned , are as backward , indeed , if possible , more so than the people of this colony . Our situation is truly alarming , and of this General Howe is well apprised , it being the common topic of conversation when the people left Boston last Friday . No doubt when he is reinforced he will avail himself of the information . " // And in a private letter a little later , he describes conditions in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such want of virtue , such stock-jobbing and fertility in all the low arts to obtain advantages of one kind or another in this great change of military arrangement I never saw before , and pray God 's mercy that I may never be witness to again . What will be the end of these maneuvers is beyond my scan . I tremble at the prospect . We have been till this time enlisting about three thousand five hundred men . To engage these I have been obliged to allow furloughs as far as fifty men to a regiment , and the officers , I am persuaded , indulge as many more . The Connecticut troops will not be prevailed upon to stay longer than their term , saving those who have enlisted // for the next campaign , and are mostly on furlough ; and such a mercenary spirit pervades the whole that I should not be at all surprised at any disaster that may happen . In short , after the last of this month our lines will be so weakened that the Minute Men and militia must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no kind of government themselves , will destroy the little subordination I have been laboring to establish , and run me into one evil while I am endeavoring to avoid another ; but the lesser must be chosen . " These letters point out very plainly the conditions which existed . Another important thing to remember is that these occurrences took place during a period when our forefathers were struggling for independence , when , as we were taught in school , a spirit of patriotism // and self-sacrifice stirred the country . The foregoing extracts from Washington 's letters show the real situation . It was extremely difficult to secure troops for the armed forces . Men came only for short periods of time , and insisted upon the election of their officers . Discipline was poor , and such as there was , was difficult of enforcement . In fact , the situation was more or less one of military chaos , and it was only Washington 's remarkable personality that made it possible to hold together these discordant elements in the form of a fighting force . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but gradually increased . In 1778 freedom was offered by Rhode Island to negroes if they would enlist . The difficulty in increasing the Continental forces augmented instead of dimin- // ished from year to year . Washington was twice empowered with dictatorial powers . The colonial assemblies singly and collectively made special efforts to secure troops but there seems to have been lacking a sense of individual responsibility for soldier service and the result was that our greatest force was in 1776 , when we had 89,000 troops , 47,000 Continentals , 42,000 militia . The Continentals were really short service troops . From this year on the strength of the American force steadily decreased until , in 1781 , the force was only a trifle over 29,400 men . At no time during the war did Washington have an effective force of 20,000 men in line , notwithstanding the fact that nearly 400,000 men were enrolled during the war . One of the principal causes of difficulty during the war was that control // of military matters rested with the Continental Congress , and that body was jealous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was inclined to make economies which resulted in vast expenditures through extending the war and rendering unavailing such expenditures as had previously been made . Washington did everything a man could do in his position , and he accomplished miracles . We were fortunate in this war in receiving at a critical time the invaluable assistance of France , and from the further fact that the contention of the Colonies was supported by a strong party in England . The difficulties which Washington encountered can best be appreciated by soldiers who realize what it means to make new armies practically every year . Large forces of militia were called in from time to time but they // were almost useless . Washington 's opinion of men raised in this manner without training and without discipline , was expressed as follows : " To place any dependence upon militia is assuredly resting upon a broken staff . Men just dragged from the tender scenes of domestic life , unaccustomed to the din of arms , totally unacquainted with every kind of military skill ( which is followed by want of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and appointed , superior in knowledge and superior in arms ) are timid and ready to fly from their own shadows . " Relaxed and unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army , the militia ( these properly so called , for of these we have two sorts , the six-months men and those sent // in as a temporary aid ) do not think themselves subject to them , and therefore take liberties which the soldier is punished for . This creates jealousy , jealousy begets dissatisfaction , and this by degrees ripens into mutiny , keeping the whole army in a confused and disordered state , rendering the time of those who wish to see regularity and good order prevail more unhappy than , ' words can describe . Besides this , such repeated changes take place that all arrangement is set at naught and the constant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fast as it is adopted . " Those , sir , Congress may be assured , are but a small part of the inconveniences which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that merits particular attention , and that is the expense . Certain I am that it // would be cheaper to keep 50,000 or 100,000 in constant pay than to depend upon half the number and supply the other half occasionally by militia . The time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp , assembling and marching , the waste of ammunition , the consumption of stores , which in spite of every resolution or requisition of Congress , they must be furnished with or sent home , added to other incidental expenses consequent upon their coming and conduct in camp , surpass all idea and destroy every kind of regularity and economy which you could establish among fixed and settled troops , and will , in my opinion prove , if the scheme is adhered to , the ruin of our cause . " During the war various reorganizations took place ; the conditions were somewhat improved through the gradual // acquirement of a small nucleus of trained officers ; but the old vicious conditions concerning the method of raising men , short terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounties , desertions , continued . Bounties grew from small sums to sums which , in those days , were small fortunes and the foundation was laid for a procedure which was most vicious and tended to corrupt the patriotism of the nation : namely , the bounty system , or the buying of men to discharge their military obligations to the nation . Washington 's opinion of our military policy is found in a letter to the president of Congress , August 20 , 1780 : " Had we formed a permanent army in the beginning , which , by the continuance of the same men in service , had been capable of discipline , we never // should have had to retreat with a handful of men across the Delaware in 1776 , trembling for the fate of America , which nothing but the infatuation of the enemy could have saved ; we should not have remained all the succeeding winter at their mercy , with sometimes scarcely a sufficient body of men to mount the ordinary guards , liable at every moment to be dissipated , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not have been under the necessity of fighting Brandywine , with an unequal number of raw troops , and afterwards of seeing Philadelphia fall a prey to a victorious army ; we should not have been at Valley Forge with less than half the force of the enemy , destitute of everything , in a situation neither to resist nor to retire ; we should not have seen New York left with a handful of men , // yet an overmatch for the main army of these States , while the principal part of their force was detached for the reduction of two of them ; we should not have found ourselves this spring so weak as to be insulted by 5,000 men , unable to protect our baggage and magazines , their security depending on a good countenance and a want of enterprise in the enemy ; we should not have been the greatest part of the war inferior to the enemy , indebted for our safety to their inactivity , enduring frequently the mortification of seeing inviting opportunities to ruin them pass unimproved for want of a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing the country ravaged , our towns burnt , the inhabitants plundered , abused , murdered , with impunity from the same cause . // " Nor have the ill effects been confined to the military line . A great part of the embarrassments in the civil departments flow from the same source . The derangement of our finances is essentially to be ascribed to it . The expenses of the war and the paper emissions have been greatly multiplied by it . We have had a great part of the time two sets of men to feed and pay the discharged men going home and the levies coming in . This was more remarkably the case in 1775 and 1776 . The difficulty and cost of engaging men have increased at every successive attempt , till among the present lines we find there are some who have received $150 in specie for five months ' service , while our officers are reduced to the disagreeable necessity of performing the duties of drill sergeants to them , with this mortifying // reflection annexed to the business , that by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier 's duty their services will have expired and the work recommenced with a new set . The consumption of provisions , arms , accouterments , and stores of every kind has been doubled in spite of every precaution I could use , not only from the cause , just mentioned , but from the carelessness and licentiousness incident to militia and irregular troops . Our discipline also has been much hurt , if not ruined , by such constant changes . The frequent calls upon the militia have interrupted the cultivation of the land , and of course have lessened the quantity of its produce , occasioned a scarcity , and enhanced the prices . In an army so unstable as ours order and economy have been impracticable . No person who has been a close // observer of the progress of our affairs can doubt that our currency has depreciated without comparison more rapidly from the system of short enlistments than it would have done otherwise . " There is every reason to believe that the war has been protracted on this account . Our opposition being less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluctuation of the army kept alive their hopes , and at every period of the dissolution of a considerable part of it they have flattered themselves with some decisive advantages . Had we kept a permanent army on foot the enemy could have had nothing to hope for , and would in all probability have listened to terms long since . " There is no reason to believe that the Washington opinions , as expressed , underwent any essential change . War // drew its weary length along , with constantly changing personnel and small and ineffective commands . The year of 1781 was marked by a mutiny of troops of the Pennsylvania line . Our regular officers had become skilled and able and were making the best possible use of the inferior troops furnished them . Following the junction of the French and American troops came the operations against Yorktown and the capture of Cornwallis . This was the last battle of the Revolution . The United States had employed during the war 395,858 troops . Their forces were strongest in 1776 . The British forces at the outbreak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to 42,075 . The military events which had a strong bearing upon the expulsion of the British were , first , the capture of Burgoyne , and , sec- // ondly , that of Cornwallis , an event which was made possible only by the strong cooperation of the French forces on sea and land . The prosecution of the war by the British had not been at any time especially vigorous . The lack of centralized power was felt throughout the Revolution , and we have the curious picture of an alliance of states engaged in war viewing with suspicion a standing army , and yet on two occasions forced to give to the cominander of these forces dictatorial power . inbarrassing complications occurred from the tendency to the exercise of power by the states . They assumed at critical moments a quasi-independent attitude , as illustrated by the action of Governor Thomas Jefferson in detaining the Virginia militia for home defense when it was urgently required by General // Greene ; and by the action of the people of Boston in fitting out ( without consulting the commander-in-chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maine . In April , 1812 , the governor of Massachusetts denied the right of Congress or the president to determine when conditions justified the calling out of the militia , and claimed that this right is vested in the commanders-in-chief of militia of the various states ? in other words , in the governors . At the same time Connecticut made substantially the same claim . A little later in the same year , Vermont declared that the military strength and resources of the state must be reserved for its own defense and protection exclusively , and in the following year the same state refused to permit the mili- // tia to go to General Macomb 's support . In fact , the whole structure was loosely jointed and could not have resisted a strong and well-organized attack . Taking it as a whole , however , and considering the lack of centralized power , ignorance of the legislative and executive body in all matters military , the depreciation of currency , and that consciousness which must have existed among the troops of a lack of strong government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutiny ? although causes for it in the way of shortage of pay and clothing often existed ? seldom occurred . The record of the Continental troops , one might say " the regular troops , " was remarkably good . We had the material for both officers and men , but we lacked a strong government , organization and system . In other // words , there was a weak military policy 2ind no appreciation of the military needs of the country , if the war was to have been conducted vigorously and with the minimum loss of life and expenditure of treasure . During the revolutionary war the states formed a very loose confederacy , lacking most of the elements of strength which come from national resources properly mobilized and directed by a central authority . The Continental Congress exercised only a limited measure of control and toward the end of the war it was , to a large extent , advisory . Congress lacked the power to utilize and make available the country 's military resources . The result was that at no time during the revolution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not only was there lack of // a strong coordinating authority , but the whole military system was fatally defective . It represented the folly of depending upon troops enlisted for short periods , untrained , poorly organized , with a constantly changing enlisted personnel . The unnecessary sacrifice of life and expenditure of treasure incident to this system and adherence to it , has followed through all our wars , as the table on the following page indicates . As a result of this pernicious system of frequent and short enlistments , followed naturally a pension system involving tremendous expense , only a small portion of which would have been necessary had we had a sound military policy . The policy of short enlistments , of enrolling men hastily , not only cost us unnecessarily in life and treasure , but // at times exercised a dangerous influence upon military operations . Arnold was forced to deliver an assault upon Quebec because of the approaching expiration of the enlistments of a large portion of his troops . Montgomery was killed , Arnold wounded , and a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Washington repeatedly refers to the loss of troops and constant change of personnel incident to this system of short enlistments . Briefly , these are the lessons of the war : That a confederation of states , without a strong central government under the direction of citizens without experience in military matters and under conditions which permit each state to raise , arm and equip troops , is an exceedingly weak form of government for the // l ) roseeution of war ; that the war resources of a nation can only be employed to the greatest advantage when used as a national force under national control and direction ; that undisciplined and raw levies can not meet disciplined troops with any hope of success ; that voluntary enlistments based on patriotism and the bounty can not be relied upon to supply men for the army during a prolonged war , but that men should be enlisted for the period of the war ; and , finally , that we should turn to the policy of general military training with a fixed period of obligation for all able-bodied men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able quickly , smoothly and effectually to mobilize our forces for war . Great changes have occurred in the organization , equipment and preparedness of our possible antagonists , // and whatever system we have must be one which permits prompt mobilization of trained men . It must be one which enables us to know with certainty and exactness what our resources in men are , just . when they will be available , and what their qualifications are . This is not possible under either a volunteer system or under a system of draft , initiated after war has commenced . // SEVENTY YEARS OF INEFFICIENCY " It is better to be ready for war and not have it than to have war and not be ready for it . " ? L. W. The close of the Revolutionary War found the young nation confronted with nlany grave questions , among them the ( question of a proper military establishment . This was an object of special solicitation on the part of Washington , and he recommended in strong language the thorough training of the militia , their ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia which includes all men from eighteen to forty-five years of age . The Continental Army was l i sbanded , excepting one battery of artil- // levy known as the Alexander Hamilton Battery , a battery which still exists in our service . Although the finances of the nation were exhausted , an attempt was made to establish a small regular establishment , a mixed regiment of infantry and artillery , ridiculously inade-quate , of course . Later that regiment was expanded a little into a Legionary Corps consisting of some 2,040 non-commissioned officers and privates . Feeble , half-hearted measures in the direction of an organization of a small military force followed during the next few years . In 1789 the War Depart-ment was organized . In 1790 there was another reorganization of the army . This organization fixed the standard at 1,216 noncommissioned officers and privates ? not a formidable force . Various Indian campaigns indicated the necessity of a 118 - YEARS OF INEFFICIENCY stronger military establishment , and in 1.791 there was a further reorganization which resulted in the addition of another regiment . Two general officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a still further increase in mili-tary establishment , as well as the inad-visability of depending upon untrained militia . This reorganization resulted in the filling up of the then existing mili-tary establishment to full strength and the addition of three regiments of infan-try and certain minor additions in field and staff officers . About this time the legionary idea , which originated with Baron von Steuben , was applied to the organization of the regular army , and was proposed for the militia . The Legion was really a small , complete army in itself , a complete fighting unit , com- // posed of the different arms . General Knox , then secretary of war , strongly approved the idea for the army , and recommended its extension to include all physically and mentally fit men from eighteen to sixty years of age , with the idea of building up a trained citizen soldiery . The legionary organization for the regular establishment was adopted , although unfortunately the general plan proposed by General Knox , to divide and classify the entire male population between eighteen and sixty , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made necessary by increasing calls for troops in connection with Indian disturbances and the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania in August , 1794 . In 1798 the president was authorized to organize a provisional army in case of the exist- // ence of war or an invasion of our territory , or imminent danger . This Provincial Army was to consist of 10,000 noncommissioned officers and men , to be enlisted for a period of three years . The force was to be officered by the president . Washington was appointed commander-in-chief , with the rank of lieutenant-general . This army was never called into being . Further reorganization in 1802 resulted in a further reduction in the strength of the army . In the same year a real step forward was taken through the establishment of the Military Academy at West Point . Alexander Hamilton was the moving force behind the establishment of this splendid institution . Washington strongly approved , and three days before his death he wrote as follows to Hamilton : " The establishment of an institution // of this kind on a respectable and extensive basis has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country , and while I was in the chair of government I omitted no proper opportunity of recommending it in my public speeches and otherwise to the attention of the Legislature . " McHenry , the Secretary of War , urged the establishment of the Academy in the following words : " It can not be forgotten that in our Revolutionary War it was not till after several years ' practice in arms , and the extension of the periods for which our soldiers were at first enlisted , that we found them at all qualified to meet on the field of battle those to whom they were opposed . The occasional brilliant and justly celebrated acts of some of our militia during that eventful period detract // nothing from this dear-bought truth . " The great man who conducted the war of our Revolution was continually compelled to conform his conduct to the circumstances growing out of the experimental lessons just mentioned . What was the secret of his conduct ? Must it be told ? It may , and without exciting a blush or an uneasy sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an army of men , but he had few officers or soldiers in that army . " The Academy provided for a force of only twenty officers and cadets , and its purpose was to provide a corps of engineers . Since the day of its foundation it has been the strong prop of our military establishment . There were further sporadic changes in the composition of the army , and in 1808 it was increased by some five regi- // ments of infantry , a regiment of riflemen , a regiment of light artillery , and one regiment of light dragoons , enlisted for a period of five years . This was the result , principally , of the increasing probability of war with Great Britain . In March , 1812 , an attempt was made to organize a Quartermaster 's Department , Commissary Department , Ordnance Department , and during this year an increase was authorized in the number of cadets at the Military Academy . Under this act , the maximum number of cadets was fixed at 250 . On June 18 , 1812 , war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly increased immediately preceding the outbreak of the war , and now consisted of some 36,700 men on paper . This number was rapidly increased , from time to time , by calling // in volunteers for militia . We had apparently learned very little from the lessons of the Revolution . The war , taken as a whole , was a series of disasters and reverses on land , many of them highly discreditable in character . Our record on sea was much better , and we gained many notable successes . The men of the fleet and on the individual ships of war were better trained and better disciplined than those of the land forces . The gallant action at Lundy 's Lane , where there was a strong nucleus of regulars , and minor successes on the Thames , formed the bulk of our creditable actions on land during the period of the war . It should be remembered , in commenting upon the relative efficiency of the army and navy , that Congress has never delegated to the states the power to raise and maintain a navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength of the regular army by twenty regiments , enlisted for a year , and some increases in the staff . There was still a general failure to appreciate the necessity of providing an adequate , wellorganized military establishment . We put some 527,000 men into the war . The British regular force in this country at no time exceeded 16,800 . Generally speaking , our campaigns against Canada were hopelessly ineffective . In 1814 Commodore McDonough 's brilliant victory on Lake Champlain terminated an advance which , had it not been for the naval successes , might have reached New York and cut off New England from the rest of the country . During this war , as in the Revolution , the power of a state government to interfere with military operations was illus- // trated by the action of the governor of Vermont in refusing to send militia when General Macomb called for aid . This war was signalized by the abandonment of our capital to a force about sixty per cent that of the defenders . It is true that most of the defenders were without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of 3,500 were engaged . Our troops abandoned the capital with a loss of eight killed and eleven wounded . The battle of New Orleans was one of the most remarkable victories recorded in our military history . It was fought two weeks after peace had been signed at Ghent . Our success was not without the element of good fortune . The British attack was a frontal attack without cover , in the face of men highly trained in the use of the rifle . While our troops // are entitled to a high degree of credit , the reports do not bring out the fact , however , that our success was largely influenced by the delay of Colonel Thornton 's highly successful attack on the Americans on the west bank . Had his assault been delivered a little earlier , the American line on the other side of the river would have been untenable , and the result far different . While the battle had no influence in determining peace , it served as somewhat of a consolation for a long series of disasters on land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did all that a small force could have done . It aided in the victory of the Thames , saved the army from destruction at Plattsburg , and at Norfolk , Bladensburg , Baltimore and New Orleans rendered splendid service ; but // at the end of the war Great Britain controlled the sea . The entire War of 1812 was but another illustration of the tuiwisdom of our general policy . No well-thoughtout organization in time of peace ? no sound policy in the way of preparation ? failure to do in time of peace those things which can not be done in time of war . Taking the war as a whole , it was disastrous and highly discreditable to us on land . The blunders were those of the Revolution in even a more aggravated form and with less excuse , because under the C institution the government did have the authority to bring into play the entire financial and military resources of the nation . As Upton states : " Five thousand men ( British ) for the period of two years brought war and devastation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven millions of people . " Shortly after the conclusion of the war , the army was again reduced and we returned with more or less promptness to the old haphazard policy . In 1821 another plan of reorganization was presented . This plan contemplated the reduction of the army to 6,000 enlisted men and its maintenance as a group of skeletonized organizations . It is interesting to note , in this connection , that Mr. Calhoun , in presenting his plan , made the following statements : " To give such an organization , the leading principles in its formation ought to be , that at the commencement of hostilities there should be nothing either to new model or to create . The only difference , consequently , between the peace and the war formation of the army ought // to be in the increased magnitude of the latter , and the only change in passing from the former to the latter should consist in giving to it the augmentation which will then be necessary . " It is thus , and thus only , the dangerous transition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the weakness and danger which otherwise would be inevitable , be avoided . Two consequences result from this principle : First , the organization of the staff in a peace establishment ought to be such that every branch of it should be completely formed , with such extension as the number of troops and posts occupied may render necessary ; and , secondly , that the organization of the line ought as far as practicable , to be such that in passing from the peace to the war formation , the force may be suffi- // eiently augmented without adding new regiments or battalions , thus raising the army , on the basis of the peace establishment , instead of creating a new army to be added to the old , as at the commencement of the late war . " Fortunate , indeed , would we have been had this policy been adopted , provided we had a reserve of trained men to bring the organization to war strength . But it was not . At that time the possibility of sudden invasion was remote . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no possibility of such concentration against us as during recent years . The proposed organization related wholly to the regular army , and did not provide for the organization of that great bulk of our force which must always come from the people themselves , who , within certain age limita- // tions , must be trained , organized and equipped in time of peace if they are to be effective in war . Following the War of 1812 came a series of Indian wars , some of them of considerable magnitude . The Seminole War , the Black Hawk War , the Florida War , were conducted with various modifications of the military establishment , but , generally speaking , the old policy was followed . Raw troops were raised to meet each emergency , with resulting tremendous expenditures of money , great loss of life and a high degree of inefficiency . On the heels of the Florida War came the Creek campaign . Relatively large numbers of troops were engaged in these campaigns . In the Creek campaign , for instance , nearly 12,000 troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , the Creek , and the Cherokee // War ? we called into service the militia to the number of 48,152 . To these should be added 12,539 regulars , making our total force 60,691 engaged in these little campaigns . In 1837 there was a slight increase in the regular army , and some increase in the staff corps , but there was no legislation looking to the training , disciplining and equipping under federal direction of the great body of our men known as the militia . In 1842 , immediately after the cessation of hostilities incident to the Florida campaign , the army was reduced from 12,500 to 8,500 . The lessons taught by these Indian wars were the lessons of the Revolution and the War of 1812. namely , that organization and preparation for war must be made in time of peace , and that undisciplined and untrained troops , poorly organized , are the // most expensive weapons a nation can employ in war . There was needless sacrifice of life , undue prolongation of the war , tremendous and unnecessary expense . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this war are : " First : That its expense was tripled , if not quadrupled , by that feature of the law of 1821 which gave the president , in times of emergency , no discretion to increase the enlisted men of the army . " Second : That , as in every previous war , after successfully employing for short periods of service , militia and volunteers , and exhausting their enthusiasm , Congress found it more humane and economical to continue hostilities with regular troops , enlisted for the period of five years . " Third : That for want of a welldefined peace organization , a nation of 17,000,000 of people contended for seven // years with 1,200 warriors , and finally closed the struggle without accomplishing the forcible emigration of the Indians , which was the original and sole cause of the war . " Without dwelling on the needless sacrifice of life , these hard lessons would have been cheaply learned , could Congress , at the end of the conflict , have appreciated the value of expansive organization . By withholding from the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it committed the same great error as in 1821 . We shall see that this error more than doubled the cost and length of another war , which despite the mistakes of military legislation , was soon to add to the luster of our arms . " The Mexican War furnished the next opportunity to illustrate what the United States had learned from the conduct of // previous wars . A close study of this campaign discloses the fact that so far as the methods and system are concerned , little or nothing had been learned ; and although the government had ample warning of the probabilities of war , little or no preparation had been made for it . We were opposed by an enemy inferior both in organization and resources ; we had a small but good nucleus of regular troops . The war was sufficiently remote from centres of influence to give our officers a better opportunity than usual to train and discipline the new levies which were sent them . Moreover , we were singularly fortunate in having as commanders and subordinates an unusually able group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Civil War . The foregoing and other circumstances resulted in the conduct of // the war being effective , one might almost say , brilliant . Palo Alto , Resaca de la Palma , Monterey , Buena Vista , on one line of operations , and Vera Cruz , Cerro Gordo , Contreras , Churubusco and El Molino del Rey , on the other , tell the story of the war . It was , taken as a whole , our most successful and best conducted war ; but in remembering this success , we must not forget that the system employed was as defective as in previous wars , and that the success that we had was not due to the system , but was attained in spite of it . The regular army had been reduced to an insignificant force in numbers ? a mere nucleus ? and large numbers of volunteers had to be called , resulting in huge increase in annual expenditures ( luring the war . There was one hopeful // change , however , and that was the reduction in the proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past , but principally because the militia was not available for service outside the United States . In the War of 1812 the force of volunteers serving for twelve or more months was only twelve per cent of the total number of troops employed . In the Mexican War it was approximately eighty-eight per cent . In the War of 1812 a large force of militia and untrained volunteers was practically baffled by a force of 5,000 of the enemy 's regulars . In the Mexican War a force of well-disciplined volunteers with a nucleus of regulars overthrew an army several times their number . In other words , in the Mexican War we had a good nucleus of regular troops and we had time to develop our volunteers into // trained and reasonably well-disciplined soldiers , and we used small numbers of militia . What we did was not due so much to any idea of abandoning the old system with its free use of militia , as it was to the fact that we had to conduct a war where the militia could not be used because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . In this war the system of short enlistments jeopardized the success of military operations . Many of Scott 's troops were enlisted under conditions which gave them the option of continuing in service or taking their discharge at the end of the year . On reaching Pueblo , he discovered that seven of his eleven regiments had decided to terminate their services at the conclusion of the year . Consequently he was stripped of a large portion of his // effective troops ; had the Mexican forces been capable of further activities disaster would certainly have resulted . We employed in the Mexican War approximately 104,000 troops of all arms , of whom only 12,000 were militia ? twelve per cent of militia against approximately eighty-eight per cent in the War of 1812 . At the close of the Mexican War the army was reduced from 30,890 to 10,320 . There were some minor modifications in the organization of our regiments , but , generally speaking , little change was effected by the Mexican War . Discretion was given to the president to increase the strength of organizations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah and along the Texas border , the president was authorized to accept into service of the United States // a regiment of Texas volunteers and to raise two regiments of mounted infantry if required . There was no very important change in policy with reference to , making arrangements for possible war . In other words , little had been learned from the preceding wars , or if learned , had not been put into practical application . // THE PRICE OF UNPREPAREDNESS IN THE SIXTIES " To lead an uninstructed people into war , is to throw them away . " Con f ucius , 479 B. C. According to Upton , at the end of 1860 , with a population of 31,000,000 , we had in our regular army 16,367 . That army was scattered along the western frontier and over the vast areas west of the Mississippi , along the Atlantic seacoast and the northern border , and , roughly , provided two soldiers per mile for guarding the frontier ; for the area west of the Mississippi , one soldier for every 120 square miles ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union , one soldier for every 1,300 square miles . There was almost no wellorganized , equipped and trained militia . This was the general condition when , , South Carolina passed the ordinance of secession . That nothing had been learned from previous wars and that no plan of operations had been thought out or adequate stores prepared for sudden emergency , was indicated by the confusion and difficulties which followed the attempt to organize an army . The enlisted personnel of the regular army was scattered over the entire area of the country . Practically all of the enlisted men remained staunch in their adherence to the cause of the national government , but confusion and disorganization resulted in those commands which were outside the Union lines and filtered back piecemeal . The great majority of the officers // retained their commissions in the national service , but many of great ability tendered their resignations and reported for duty with the forces of their states . The conduct of the governors throughout the country largely followed party lines . In the south there was a general refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along the border states there was a general opposition to furnishing any of these troops for national service . In Delaware a new situation arose , as illustrated by the proclamation of the government of that state in response to the call for one regiment of militia : " Therefore I , William Burton , governor of the said State of Delaware , recommend the formation of volunteer companies for the protection of the lives and property of the people of this state // against violence of any sort to which they may be exposed . For these purposes such companies , when formed , will be under the control of the state authorities , though not sub j ect to be ordered by the executive into the United States service , the law not vesting in him such authority . They will , however , have the option of offering their services to the general government for the defense of its capital and the support of the Constitution and laws of the country . " As a general rule , the governors of the states which refused militia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter to the state legislature . Six states to which an appeal was made for the service of militia and refused by the governors , afterwards furnished 252,000 men to the Union cause . This illustrates how completely , under the militia sys- // tern , a governor can paralyze the military resources of his own state , the people of which in large part may be desirous of meeting the national demand . The story of the militia as a whole illustrates the utter folly of depending upon any system which leaves the control of any portion of the military establishment upon which the nation must depend in war , in the hands of the governor of a state , or of anyone else other than the federal authority . The entire military force upon which the nation is to depend in war must be under the control of the federal government absolutely and completely , and be trained , disciplined and organized by it , if war is to be waged efficiently . In the turmoil and confusion of the moment , President Lincoln was compelled , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was // indeed fortunate for the nation that we had at that time a man as president who was willing to assume this responsibility . In order to meet the emergency in part , at least , President Lincoln , by proclamation , increased the strength of the regular army approximately 23,000 men , and the navy 18,000 men . This action was subsequently confirmed by Congress . In addition to the natural inevitable results of an entire lack of military policy was the condition of rebellion , which had disrupted to a certain extent the small standing army and rendered unavailable the military resources of the nation in the way of supplies . Many of the northern arsenals had been largely stripped of supplies . There was a condition of veritable military chaos . Fortunately for the safety of the country and the outcome of the war , the South was unpre- // pared and had available no well organized force to take advantage promptly of the helplessness of the national government . An attempt was made by the federal authorities to organize a force of regulars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three battalions , two at the front and one as a depot battalion . It was also proposed to treat volunteers as a purely federal force , the officers to be commissioned by the president . The commission , composed of regular officers whose report embodied these suggestions , acted on sound lines , but their views and recommendations were rejected , and the volunteers were , to a certain extent , state troops ; to the governors was left the appointing of off . - cers . This , coupled with the employment of untrained , poorly organized and offi- // eered militia , was another of the serious blunders in the early stages of the war , If the proposition of the board of regular officers had been approved , we should have entered the war on a com-paratively sound basis and undoubtedly terminated it in much less time than was eventually necessary , and with much less loss of life and expenditure of money ; but under the policy adopted , governors of states soon showed a distinct tendency to create new regiments instead of filling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appoint new ofpi-cers  --  in other words , local politics was exerting a strong influence in the build-ing up of the military establishment . Had the appointment of officers rested with the president and the policy been adopted of keeping the old regiments full , we should have very soon had a 150 IN THE SIXTIES highly effective and efficient force . The handful of regular officers and men was the nucleus around which the whole vol- unteer military establishment rallied . No attempt will be made to follow in detail the conduct of the war . All that it is desired to point out is that the militia feature of the system was a failure and that the volunteer system , as such , failed both in the Northern and Southern army . The spirit of the volunteers was splendid , but the system was unsound and could not be depended upon . It failed as it had always failed and will always fail . The Confederacy was forced to resort to the draft in April , 1862 ; the national government published its first draft order in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following , year . Deser- tion was rampant . Such great numbers deserted that efficiency was greatly // impaired . Great numbers of officers were dismissed , and still greater numbers were got rid of as unfit for the service . The bounty ? that evil child of the Revolution ? soon came into being and was in this , as in other wars , one of the strongest influences in debauching the patriotism of our people and lowering the standards of the individual appreciation of the obligation for the national service . With it went a still greater evil , namely , the purchase of substitutes . It is difficult to conceive anything more at variance with the principles of representative government and individual obligation for national service in war , than the practice of buyiiig substitutes , a practice which made it possible for the rich to avoid service and escape the dangers and hardships of a campaign by paying other men to render their service for them . // The effect of both the bounty and the purchase of substitutes was seen directly in the lowering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vastly increased number of deser-tions . In fact , those two procedures , the bounty and the purchase of substitutes , have done more than anything else to degrade and debauch that sense of individual obligation in time of war which should animate a people . They have struck at the very foundation on which the republic rests : an appreciation and acceptance of the principle that with manhood suffrage goes manhood obliga-tion for service . At the end of two years the armies on both sides began to reach a state of real efficiency , but it had been gained at a great and unnecessary cost in life and // treasure . Each side was laboring under somewhat the same difficulties , although the South , as far as the conduct of the war was concerned , was far better organized , in that it waged war more as a nation than the North , which greatly weakened itself in the conduct of the war through surrendering to the governors of the states too much of the federal power in matters pertaining to the raising and officering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ; the Union as a confederacy . By so doing , the Confederacy added at least fifty per cent to its efficiency . New regiments were not created to the extent that they were in the North . The government was sufficiently centralized to conduct the war with a much greater degree of efficiency than was the Union government . Volunteering , as could have been expected , and // doubtless was expected by all who had any knowledge of our military history , diminished after the first excitement was over , and the draft was in general application , both in the North and the South . At the end of the Civil War we were for the first and only time in our history prepared for war with a first-class power . We had an admirable navy and army , experienced , well organized , well equipped . Our condition of preparedness was recognized by foreign governments , as indicated by the prompt evacuation of Mexico by Napoleon upon the request of this government . Once the Mexican difficulty was settled , the strength of the regular army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . In 1898 it amounted to 28,747 . At the close of the Civil War , until the outbreak of the // war with Spain , the army was principally engaged in Indian operations in the West , work which was largely of a police character . Men were kept in the service as long as practical ; knowledge of the language , of the country and the habits of the Indian , made the re-enlisted man valuable . It was really a military police force and not an army in the proper sense of the word . The organizations were skeletonized and kept at reduced strength . This period was , from the standpoint of military progress , a period of dry rot , interrupted occasionally by sporadic activities incident to Indian outbreaks . The organizations were full of old soldiers . The work of the army was valuable in the highest sense as an aid in the development of the Great West , and this portion of its work is one of the most // interesting from the standpoint of local history ; but it was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow ; officers reached command grade when they were too old to exercise it . The militia was , generally speaking , inefficient and of little or no military value . Our regular army equipment was years behind that of the great military powers of Europe ; we showed all the effects of our peaceful slumber , so far as military development went . Interest in military matters was reduced to a. minimum ; people were principally concerned in the development of the natural resources of the country , opening up lines of communication , building railroads , turning natural wealth into money . For a long time after the war we had available for service from a million and a half to two million men who had served // through the Civil war , and many thousands of able officers ; in other words , we had an unorganaized though trained reserve . In the thirty-three years which had elapsed between the Civil War and the war with Spain , which now began to loom up , nearly all this personnel had ceased to be valuable through age , physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in arms and equipment . When the war with Spain began , it was at once apparent that nothing of importance whatever had been taken to heart from the lessons of the Civil War , and that we were wholly unprepared from every standpoint . We were without reserves of men , officers or material . We were using an obsolete rifle , antiquated artillery , black powder . In fact , we were a military " Rip Van // Winkle . " Fortunately , our navy was stronger than the navy of our enemy , and our coasts were free from molestation . Our condition at that time was one of disorganization and unpreparedness . On every side was lack of well-thought-out preparation . A clumsy , bureaucratic system of administration crumbled under the first pressure which was put upon it ; the sanitary administration of our camps showed in many instances lack of elementary knowledge and reasonable prudence , and an entire want of discipline . There were some marked exception , but generally speaking , sanitary incompetency , together with administrative failure , served to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bullets . // THE VALUE OF PREPAREDNESS " The safety of the United States , under divine protection , ought to rest on the basis of systematic and solid arrangements exposed as little as possible to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances . " ? George Washington , Third Annual Address . The safety of our country and its institutions , the opportunity to enjoy life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness under the American flag , will be jeopardized unless there is well-thought-out , well-organized preparedness ? a preparedness based upon the principle that with equality in the opportunities and privileges of citizenship goes hand in hand equality of obligation for service to the nation in peace or war . // Citizenship means a great deal or it means nothing . . To the savage without a country it is a meaningless word . To the Roman it meant everything , Our nation must be prepared if our government is to give us that type of citizenship which carries with it the privilege and the honors which the word implies when applied to the citizens of a great country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the centurion to those who were about to scourge Saint Paul without trial , " Take heed what thou doest for this rnan is a Roman . " While just and tolerant we must be prepared and strong enough on land and sea so that those contemplating injury to one of our citizens may hear the warning voice " Take heed what thou doest for this man is an American . " The people whom preparedness most // concerns , both from their number and in the unfortunate result of the absence of preparedness , are the wives and the families of the men who in war constitute the rank and file of our armies . The great mass of our population , they feel more severely than any other class the results of a disastrous war ? the loss of men , the loss of protectors and supporters . We desire for them a better destiny . Avoidance of war will be rendered far more probable and peace far more secure by such well-ordered measures in the way of preparedness as will protect us against unjust aggression , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fill them with a sense of justice and fair dealing . Whether or not the time will come when war will be controlled by a league of nations , and a discussion of difficulties // insisted upon before a resort to force , is a question which time alone can answer . We hope it may be so . In the meantime , work for this as we may and as we should , we must not forget the situation which confronts us , the conditions which surround us . As we look back over the long . and needlessly costly wars of the past , we realize how much was due to the lack of preparedness . The practical and vital questions that now concern us are : Have we learned anything from these hideously costly and wasteful wars ? Are we prepared to take steps necessary to establish a rational degree of preparedness , which will not only serve as an insurance for peace but will , if we are forced into war , make it short and limit the expenditure of life to the minimum . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization and without preparation , depending upon the unexpected , some happy chance , some dreamed-of invention , which will make good our lack of preparation , or tend to insure our protection ? Men work their own miracles in matters of defense . The only war we have to fear is war with a highly organized and thoroughly prepared power of the first class . Nothing will protect us against defeat or destruction in such a war , except the most thorough organization and careful preparation made in time of peace . We must remember the world-old slogan , than which truer words were never uttered , " In time of peace prepare for war . " We might vary it by saying , " In time of peace make such preparation against war as will make it improbable , " but however we state it , it means prep- // ar.ation ? careful , thorough and well thought out . In considering this great question , it must constantly be borne in mind that we have never yet in all our history engaged single-handed in war with a first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us unless our history is to be different from that of all other peoples , an assumption which is wholly unwarranted . We may see no concrete danger at the present , but in these times , although at peace , we are like a ship in the cyclone area with messages constantly coming in over the wireless , bearing tales of storm and disaster all about us . We are poor sailors and unworthy of the trust and responsibility placed upon us if we do not take heed of the warnings . Our wars have been hideously wasteful // of life because we have sent the youth of our country into war untrained and undisciplined ? even worse , we have sent them unprepared either to take care of themselves or to render efficient service as soldiers . We have required of them the sacrifice but we have not given them the opportunity to make it reasonably effective . We have sent them untrained , willing , but unprepared ; we have sent them under officers ignorant of their elementary duties . We have thrown away their lives with reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , our enemies have either been inferior in strength and resources , or , like ourselves , have been unprepared and have had to learn the art of war while engaged in war . This would be impossible in case of war with a strong , well-organized nation , // a nation whose effort is founded upon well-thought-out preparation ? a nation which has not left all the burden of war for the moment of war , but has prepared in advance , her organization , including reserves of men , her equipment and adequate supplies to make good the consumption and losses of war . A policy which permits a people to drift on willing but unprepared , in spite of all the lessons of the past , ignorantly proposing to place the burdens of war wholly upon the period of war , is a policy which spells destruction for this or any other people foolish enough to adopt and follow it . It is a policy which must meet the strong condemnation of every patriotic man who has an interest either in the lives of his people or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name , either from the standpoint of informa- // tion or that of patriotic impulse , could for a moment advocate such a policy unless bowing to political opportunism rather than seeking the welfare and safety of his country . The experience and lessons of the past are especially valuable if we will but heed them , for the lessons taught by mistakes are ofttimes , to honest , open-minded men , as valuable as success . Our system has been most undemocratic . We have induced our people by bounty , by gifts of land and other means , to discharge their plain military obligations . We have encouraged a system which has enabled the rich to escape the blood tax ? the service in war ? through their ability to buy others to take their places in the ranks . I refer to the unspeakably contemptible , unpatriotic and , for the future , I hope , impossible // practice of buying substitutes . Further resort to these vicious practices should not be permitted . They have no place in a true democracy . Every good American honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how any man who is familiar with our country 's history can advocate the continuance of the volunteer system , with its uncertainties , unpreparedness and lack of equality of service . We have been warned repeatedly by the experience of others of the folly of depending upon the volunteer system . The lack of training , the uncertainty in the way of returns , the cost , the confusion , have all served to demonstrate the danger of the procedure ; the danger to us has been greatly increased by the thoroughness of modern organization and the rapidity with which armies can be transported // over land or sea to deliver attacks in force . Washington 's letters are full of advice against trusting to uncertain returns and insisting upon organaization and preparation . The best and bravest have always rushed to the colors first . They are willing but unprepared , and prove an almost unavailing sacrifice . After the excitement wears off , men no longer come , as was seen during the Revolution and during the Civil War . Then comes the use of the bounty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draft , and this always in the crisis of a struggle . What system could be more dangerous in these days of organized preparedness ? Service to the nation and for the nation in war is a service which every man , rich and poor , must give , if required , subject only to the limitations // of age and health . When this vital principle is generally recognized and the rich and the poor stand shoulder to shoulder in the nation 's service , there will be much less of class distinction and much more solidarity and a better national spirit . Individuals with more intelligence than courage admit the general proposition that manhood suffrage goes hand in hand with manhood service , and still state that the country is not yet ready for it . If it is not ready it is because they and others of their kind lack the courage to state and urge their convictions . If there was ever a time in the history of this country when it is apparent that this great principle should be urged as the only just and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely rely ? it is to-day , with the lessons of the greatest of all wars before our eyes . // That struggle shows conclusively , as have our past wars , that a volunteer system can not be depended upon and that dependence upon such a system means hastily-raised and untrained armies , officered by willing but uninstructed officers . It means campaigns accompanied by losses unnecessarily great and attended by results far short of what could have been obtained . We must continue our efforts for World Peace , encourage arbitration , do all we can to extend its application , but while doing this we must not forget the fact  --  if we do we shall aid in accomplishing the destruction of our own nation ? that the era of World Peace has not yet arrived , and that arbitration is riot yet of general application . We must not only be just , tolerant and upright in all our dealings with other // people , but we must also be ready to meet the strength of evil with the force of right . Our , people must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to uphold the institutions they believe in , defend the right , and if need be , aid the oppressed . It is unfortunate that we can not depend upon our own fair dealing and sense of justice to protect us , but nevertheless it is a fact that we can not . In seeking the ideal we must not forget the actual ; we must not let our hopes for the future regulate entirely our conduct at the present . A people may dream of peace and work for it , but they should not lose sight of the fact that it is not yet among us . We are struggling for the elimination of dreaded diseases , but , realizing that we have not thus far been // successful , we take every possible precaution against them . So it is with war . It is a pathetic sight to see a great people , despite all the teachings of history , follow counsels which must lead not only to unnecessary sacrifice of life , but even perhaps to the loss of national freedom . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past , to bring before the people frankly the lessons taught by the past results of lack of organization and preparation . The professional pacifist , the advocate of unpreparedness and nonresistance , is the most dangerous of our citizens . He is generally eminently respectable . He is like the well-dressed and well-groomed typhoid carrier , as he goes about , poisoning the very life of the people . He advocates a policy which if adopted will // surely end in great and unnecessary loss of life , if not in the final loss of our national liberty .. In him lie the possibilities of future disaster . Assuming that our cause is just , nonresistance and unpreparedness mean the establishment of a condition which prevents our effectively defending the right . It assures the subordination of good to evil . It is the most brutal of all policies , as well as the most cowardly and sinister ; brutal in that it insures the unnecessaray loss of thousands upon thousands of our people in a struggle that is fruitless because it is unprepared and unorganized . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admission that there is nothing worth fighting for ? that there are no great principles which are worth the sacrifice of life . It is a policy which marks the decadence of a people , // and if followed by the bulk of a nation means that its end is at hand . Preparedness is based upon organization . National preparedness means far more than the mere organization of the army and navy . It means , first of all , the moral organization of the people , an organization which creates in the heart of every citizen a sense of his obligation for service to the nation in time of war or other difficulty . This is the greatest part of organization , and if once accomplished all the rest follows easily and naturally . The organization of the industrial resources of the country would place the government in possession of full knowledge concerning the capacity of each industrial plant ? just what it can do , how much , and when ? and at the same time would place in the possession of the various industrial organizations an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see to it that they are properly equipped to discharge their obligations promptly when called upon . An organization which takes into consideration transportation , communications and supply ; the organization of the sanitary service , and of the various special groups of highly-trained men ; an organization of the financial system of the country so that it may have the elasticity and expansibility to meet the demands of war ; the organization of the economical resources of the country ; the careful study of ways and means to mare good shortages ; organization of our chemical resources ; provision as far as possible of substitutes for things which are not found within our own limits , so that we may be supplied in case of loss of sea power ? all these things come under organization and // require much time for their consideration . This can not be accomplished in the haste and confusion of war . A wise nation , realizing that its safety depends upon preparation , and that preparation depends upon organization , gives careful heed to all these questions . It is a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , the land and sea forces , might be compared to the edge of an extremely heavy knife . The mass of steel behind the edge represents trained reserves of men , reserves of munitions , organization , transportation , communication , sanitaray units , special service groups ? in brief , all that great mass of organization which measures the might of the nation , which serves to renew the cutting edge and to give it the rigidity and weight necessary to force it home . It is the type of organization which makes // it possible to apply promptly the might of the nation , and to maintain it for the maximum period of time ; it is organization which leaves nothing to chance . It is a recognition of the fact that efficiency can be secured only through preparation , and that preparation rests upon organization . This sort of preparation makes for national unity , consequently for national strength . It involves having all the men of a certain age doing something in common for the nation at the same time . It makes for national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It tends to build up a truer national spirit , to fuse the various elements into a homogeneous mass which , with us , would be one of real Americanism . It tends to the establishment of a condition which will obliterate the sharp distinctions between the rich and 179
