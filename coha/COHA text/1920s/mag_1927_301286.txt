Few honors are greater , more feverishly sought than the privilege of sitting as a member of the French Academy . Yet M. Georges Eugene Adrien Clemenceau , although elected to the Academy in 1918 , has never taken his seat . Why ? He explained testily to a correspondent last week at Paris : <P> " My reasons for not presenting myself to the Academy ? They concern me alone . Look here . Here are my books , my Demosthenes , my garden . I have lived my life and I can confide to you what now is my one principle : one must never tell what one feels , knows or sees . That is why I am not going to talk under the cupola of the Academy . That is why I shall continue to commune with myself in silence . In my day the journalists did the talking for the public . These days the public talks for the journalists . "
