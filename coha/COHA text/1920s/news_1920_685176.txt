txt ALASKA 'S DANGER Not the Disappearance of Big Game , but of the Yukon Salmon By HUDSON STUCK Arehdeacon of the Yukon New York March 20 , 1920 . My attention has been called to an article in your issue of the 14th inst. about Alaskan game , in which you refer to e the diverse views prevailing as to the need of further protection for the moose and caribou . 7 am loath to intrude the observations of a mere missionary , however wide they may have been , into a discussion between sportsmen and game wardens , because I know that in some unintelligent but by no means uninfluential quarters mere missionary testimony is heavily discounted ? if , indeed , it be not unceremoniously brushed aside , as is commonly the case in Government departments and bureaus . Yet for what it is worth with the more intelligent 1 would express my judgment that in the interior of . Alaska the big game is increasing . The diminution of the white population of that region with the decay of gold mining has doubtless : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any considerable return Of the white man to the interior would involve a reduction in the game . I ant sore that for the last few years both Moose and caribou have considerably increased in many districts . and that is the judgment of the Indians also . So that it would appear that there is not , just now , any need for further restrictive measures . Mr. Wenrich 's view that wolves kill more caribou than all the hunters put together I think is probably well founded . I have more than once traveled in the path of a large caribou herd and found dead and mutilated caribou strewn all along the way ; some slain for the mere lust of killing , for their throats had been cut by the fangs of full-fed animals who had not stopped to eat at all . But the same gentleman 's statement that the wolves sometimes run in bands of a hundred or more is not true of the interior of Alaska , so far as my observation has gone . I have never seen the tracks of more than four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of packs of ? el ? es in Siberia in my mind  --  you ' remember how the man in the sleigh cuts loose one horse after another that the ravening wolves may stop to fight over its body , and finally reaches home as his one remaining horse falls exhausted -- I had expected to find such packs in Alaska . Now I begin to doubt whether they exist anywhere out of the story book . Mr. Nelson 's testimony , as to the extermination of the caribou along the arctic coast was within his own personal experience . for it fell largely Atming the term of his early residence at at . Michael . But I think it was due as much to the depreciations of the whalers. as to the love of slaughter of the Eskimos , newly provided as y then were , by those same whalers , with firearms . There are yet caribou on the north coast , or , rather , in i ! s mountainous hinterland. but the herds of the west coast are gone . There was a little caribou meat at Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been brought . but i saw mid heard nothing of caribou on the whole stretch of the west coast two Winters ago : You will recall that it was Dr. Sheldon Jackson 's realization of the imminence of the extermination of the caribou that spurred him to that most beneficent measure , the introduction of the reindeer . the domesticated caribou . in those parts : it is astonishing how promptly Dr. Sheldon . Jackson 's observations were validated , how his warnings became weighty . so soon as he ceased to be a mere missionary and became a . Government official . Would that ' there had been many Alaskan Government officials of his foresight and vigor ! If there were one Such today lie would be crying oat net about the danger and the destruction of the big game . - but about a far greater danger that threatens all the inhabitants of the interior of Alaska , : the destruction of the Yukon salmon . It is : I sappose. our misfortune in the interior that the Yukon salmon does not rise to a fly ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sportsmen . But so far as the main subsistence of a whole country concerns all kindly disposed people , this matter of the Yukon salmon may lay claim to general interest . To a degree that is not understood by most people the whole economy of the Yukon country is built upon dried salmon . The Nile is not more basic to the economy of Egypt , flowing through the midst of the land and bringing fertility with It . than the Yukon is to the interior of Alaska , flowing through the amidst of it and bringing this noble fish . All the other resources of the country are more or less dependent upon dried salmon . Aside from its large use for direct human consumption , it is not possible to hunt the big game , it is not possible to trap furs , it is not possible to prospect for gold . without a dog team ; and there is no other food comparable in compact . transportable nutriment to dried salmon ; no other food  --  although a dog will eat anything  --  upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The salmon is the harvest of the rivers , the one generally dependable resource which May with any justice be compared with the harvest of the soil in more favored lands . It has its fluctuations , as the yield of the earth has  --  its fat and lean years ; but there was never anything approaching a complete failure of the fishing in the fifteen Summers that have spent upon the Yukon  --  until last Summer , when , for the first time , a salmon cannery was in operation during the whole season at the mouth of the river . And Ibis is the menace to the inhabitants of interior Alaska today . The question of the Yukon salmon is only part of a larger question that must be dealt with very presently and drastically if there are to be any Pacific Coast salmon left . The greed of the packers has pushed their highly lucrative fishing nearer and nearer to the mouths - of the spawning streams , until last Summer the catch showed an alarming falling off . . But the streams thus depleted of fish on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain torrents , without inhabitants along their banks . What is to my point is that the same greed of packing has at last brought the cannery to the mouth of the great ' river bmptying into Bering Sea , the Yukon , with its thousands of inhabitants along its course , almost all of whom are more or less dependent for their subsistence upon their salmon catch . Despite the " restrictions " imposed by the Fish Commission Upon the cannery operations on the Yukon , the fishing is virtually unrestricted . The restrictions are delusive. - For when the 30.000 cases and the 30.000 barrels and tierces which the regulations of the cannery permit in the river itself are taken , the cannery moves its barges and scows fit is a floating concern ) just outside the mouth of the river into Bering Sea , and takes all it wants , the commission having , it seems . no marine jurisdiction . Now . the fish taken in Bering Sea at the mouth of the Yukon are all of them about to enter the river . And it makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish are caught actually in the river or just before they enter the river . Recognizing this fact , recognizing . tardily. that distress was caused among the Indians all along the Yukon this Winter by the failure of the previous Summer 's fishing . the commission proe posed to Fecore an executive order forbidding cannery fishing in Bering- Sea . where it is under no restriction , and confining the company to the limits imposed by the commission 's regulations .. Such a draft executive order was drawn tip , and a conference was held last month in Washietton between the heads of departments concerned . I had pinned my hope for remedy and relief upon the result of that conference , but it decided not to proceed with the mate ter , and the only practical result of the conference was a promise by the Department of Commerce that If it appeared in the season of 3920 that the Indians were unable to secure sufficient fish , owing to the operations of the cannery , the department would make good the shortage . Such a promise is utterly unsatisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried salmon if there be no salmon to make it good with . It can only mean the beginning of a system of doles of flour and bacon , the beginning of the pauperizing of the native people of the Yukon . who have always been self-supporting hitherto . And I , for one , would rather see them dead and buried and done with than see this self-supporting people reduced to subsistence upon Government doles . There is now no recourse , therefore , save the Passage of a bill by Congress forbidding commercial fishing in the Yukon and adjacent waters . Such a measure I am seeking now to have introduced , and for it I shall ask the general support of the kindly and righteously disposed . I am certain that If a vote were taken among residents along the Yukon and its tributaries , white and native alike , all except persons directly or indirectly interested in the cannery , and the henchmen of the closely-allied transportation and trading companies , would vote for the prohibition of commercial fishing . A few days ago the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Alaska was about to form a Soviet government of its own , a telegram so silly that I was surprised it was published . But it may in all calm reason be asked whether it is wise policy to permit the impoverishment and exasperation of white men , thus expropriated of their natural rights , the pauperizing and degradation of Indians , by allowing an outside commercial company to sit down at the mount of the Yukon and confiscate ths fish that front time immemorial has been the chief dependence and support of all the people in the interior . Is not that calculated to arouse and keep alive irritation and discontent ? HUDSON STUCK , Archdeacon of the Yukon . ARMY OF IDLE YOUTH . Magistrate 's Warning and the Teacher Question . Chief City Magistrate William says , as quoted in Tug Tistas . March 20 , that ( lie greatest evil in New York City today is the " menacing and dangerous " army of young Merl between the ages of 16 and ' 26 who refuse to make an honest living by working . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools , free evening schools , playgrounds . community centres , &c.?that; he supports with his taxes must wonder how it is that such things can - ba . A " menacing army " of young loafers ! How is that ? The angrier is that all these institutions above named are undermanned . The word is not used in its generic sense , It should be printed undermanned . The schools and all their correlated activities are being over-feminized , not because the ** wish it au , but ba ? a.use economic pressure under low salaries is driving out the men . NViien the prospective recruit for this " army of loafers " first quits echo &; ostensibly to go to work , curious as it may scent , he uses the school as headquarte ? s tor as touch loafing as he dare do in the face of repeated suggestions to look for a job . He dons long trousers and attends , the community dances and other activities of the evening at his school . Viciousness has not yet weaned him away . During the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst he has done so far is to " shoot craps " in the shadow of his Alma . Mater . In the words of a wellknown advertisement . " there is still time to save " hint . A few vigorous menteachers , interested and content in their work . would Stave saved him  --  perhaps . It would be worth the municipality 's while to try it anyway . Of course , sonic are hopeless from the start . But it can not be that an " army " of them are , or it would . be better to send them at birth to the farm the Chief Magistrate suggests and scrap the public schools through which they now pass . With all respect to the fine quality of women teaching boys of the 12 to 16 age there still remains the need to them of inspiration front their own sex during the formative years . Shall we deprive the boys of New York of that inspiration ? Somewhere , during these years . an " army " of them are acquiring inhibitions against honest work . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too plastic minds into forms filled with honest ambitions . Perhaps . Shall we overlook any possible antidote to the menace of the youthful army of loafers ? Aside from the question of the lack of men teachers there remains as another possible reason the shattered morale of the survivors of the - teaching force , both men and women . It may not be the one panacea for all these ills . but the immediate remedy , the one to bolster up courage of the remnant of both sexes and to bring the men hack to the schools . is a substantial raise of teachers ' salaries . The teachers do not ask that their salaries be restored to pre-war purchasing power . They merely ask as salaries . which for most of the men and many of the women have stood about stationary while prices and wages of industry bn ve soared , a 11 inereaee of 40 ' per cent . for the lowest paid and 10 per cent . for the highest paid .
