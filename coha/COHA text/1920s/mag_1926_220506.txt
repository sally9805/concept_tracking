Heat , dust , fever , mosquitoes , mud towns , mangy camels , the hot ever-blowing harmattan , absinthe , loneliness , monotony , forced marches through the desert sand , Africa , loneliness , loneliness , is the dirge of the legionnaire . " J'ai le cafard , " announces the soldat and he is amok with a little beetle running round and round in his brains . Sometimes he slices off his sergeant 's head , sometimes he wets his jowls with his own red blood , oftener he deserts . <P> Word came , early in June , that one Bennet J. Doty of Memphis , Tenn. , legionnaire , had left the French lines in southern Syria where the Foreign Legion is campaigning against the Druse tribesmen . He had deserted his post before armed rebels . Last week Damascus courts martial eyed the facts that M. Doty 's attitude was defiant , that his offense was so grave that its penalty is death , that desertions were becoming all too frequent in the Legion , that " home-sickness " is an insipid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Tennessee . M. Doty 's father had persuaded Senators Tyson and McKellar of that state to intervene at the State Department in Washington . The Department had instructed Ambassador Herrick , friend of the French , to intercede with Premier Briand . The Premier had negotiated with War Minister Painlev . The Minister had telegraphed to Damascus . Iron must give a little under pressure . Of course M. Doty had on occasion been brave , had received the Croix de Guerre . So , although he had sacrificed his citizenship and the U. S. Government had no recourse against any decision it might render , and though the law of the Legion is unremitting , the courts martial considered it advisable to sentence defiant Deserter Doty to but eight years at hard labor . " His record of bravery . . . . " <P> Why should a youth volunteer to die in the burning heat of the desert , fighting for five centimes a day in a corps which has left the bones of its soldiers strewn in every quarter of the globe from Indo-China to Mexico ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legionnaire , but it is not insignificant that while fighting for the far-flung Tri-color of France these romantic , scarred gentlemen rankers are protected by that banner from all extraditions . Glamorous traditions , adventure , protection ? <P> During the War the Legion achieved its greatest glory , but in the muzzle-loading cycle of years before lies its romance , its incredible reputation for hardiness and courage : in Mexico under Maximilian 60 men were surrounded by 2,000 Mexicanos . All day the battle surged , five times Mexicans called on the legionnaires to surrender , five times the answer was a defiant hoot . When the relieving party arrived not a legionnaire remained . For ten hours 60 had held 2,000 while the convoy they were escorting had gone on to safety . In Indo-China a force of 390 had beaten off an entire Chinese army 7 times during a 32-day battle . General de Negrier once remarked : " Some soldiers can fight-the legionnaires can die . "                    @
