txt Use of the double tariff taximeters , which have caused much complaint and annoyance , was doomed yesterday when the General Welfare Committee of the Board of Aldermen approved an amendment to the ordinance dealing with maximum taxicab rates . The amendment will establish a uniform rate of 40 cents for the first mile and 30 cents for each succeeding mile for five passengers or less . It will be submitted to the Board of Aldermen next Tuesday . and will require the board 's approval and Mayor Hylan 's signature to make it law . Approval by the board and the Mayor is believed certain . The Board of Aldermen has the power to regulate the maximum fares for taxicabs , permitting the taxi men to operate at any price below it if they wish . Under the existing maximum , the charge for three or more passengers , under the double tariff meter . which will be abolished by the new ordinance , is TO cents for the first mile and 60 cents for each succeeding mile , while the rate for two passengers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents for each succeeding mile . The committee voted favorably yesterday on two other taxicab reform ordinances . One calls for the illumination of the meter , so that the dial can be read by passengers in the rear seat . The other provides for an increase in the penalties for taxicab men who tamper with their meters from a fine of $50 to $1130 , and from a jail sentence of ten days to one of thirty This action was taken at an executive session of the committee , at which Alderman Francis D. , Democrat , of Brooklyn , presided . Chief City Magistrate issued a statement yesterday advocating further reforms in the taxicab service : He said : " The public should not be misled as to why we magistrates are imposing light fines in certain cases . The police are now making a drive against a large number of unlicensed drivers of taxicabs . These drivers are outlaws , who have no license or anything which accompanies it . Some of them are those whose licenses we magistrates have revoked . " If a driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might go for a long time undetected , because the outward evidences of licenses are obscure and of little or no value . He is given two badges , one by the State and one by the city . The State badge is a little square copper button , about an mch square . He is given a very wide latitude as to where he shall wear it . The law says ' a conspicuous place on : iis clothing . ' Does that mean the tail of his coat or the top of his hat ? " The taxicab driver is given a city ' , edge of white metal , about two inches . , quare . The figures are uncolored . He ? an wear it , to quote the ordinance , outside of the driver 's coat , ' which is . , very wide range . " In my opinion and that of other Magtrates , these badges should be much larger . They ought to be in a conspicuous color . Tice driver should wear at least two of them , one on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these little pieces of metal on a taxicab driver , especially when the car is under way ? As a matter of fact he never does , unless the driver breaks some law . " Last Winter , in order to stop stealing of cars , the owner of a car or cars had to have a registration certificate for each one . This certificate must be in the possession of the driver . It is not on stiff paper and it is carried in a book or in the pocket . Most drivers brought in by the police work for owners who have a great number of cars . Frequently as many as three drivers take out one car during a day . " The law has been in force only a few months . Many drivers do not return the certificate , lose it . and some of them steal the car and the certificate with it . The driver looks to the owner to give him the certificate when he takes out the car . We have been fining these drivers who are not so much at fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any car until they get the certificate . This , however , in my opinion , does not go to the root of the matter " The card should be thick cardboard and framed in a metal frame the same as the license card which is now placed inside the car . That means it should be prominently attached to the ca and for its absence the owner should be heavily fined . " Of course the police are doing the best they can and bring in these regist ration c. rtificate cases in their search fir ? outlaw drivers . This is the main obj ? .. t of the crusade . I regret to say those foxes have taken to cover , because the proportion of the real outlaw drivers so far brought in is very small in - omparison with the number of cases . " The outlaw drivers are there and the whole system will continue until we strike at the root of the evil and transfer this whole licensing business to the police , - where it belongs . " O'RYAN ON SUBWAY HERDING Says Public Can Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there overcrowding and inconvenience , but standards of decency are being lowered by present transit conditions , according- to Major General John F. O'ftyan of the Transit Commission . who spoke last night at the Mount Neboli Temple . " You ca n't take splendid young men end send them through the horrors of a modern battlefield and have them come back the same young men they tarted. " he said : " in the same way au ? a n't hc ? rd people together like tattle and expect their standards to tmchanged . " " The transit problem is due to three vauses. " . he continued . " First there arc more than a thousand franchises , all of them containing different provisions . Secomi , teere are more than forty ? poi -- siting companies which precludes all coordination . Third there is the interest of the public which demands safe . decent and convenient service , and the companies ' interest which is to make the lines paying propositions . These two can not be made to coincide your problem . It concerns you principally . and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get as good service or as had service as you want to . But you can only get it by clear thinking , That is the important thing . "
