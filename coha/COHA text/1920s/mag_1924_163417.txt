Drug stores do many things . Besides selling medicines , many of them will sell you refreshments , fountain pens , cigars , phonographs , toys , watches , books . They are , in fact , almost omnivendorous . <P> As the drug store has grown , so grows the press . First employed to propagate information , its functions have been successively enlarged . It becomes a gatherer of information , a purveyor of amusement , a persuader of public opinion . Is this only a beginning ? Ever and anon a paper branches into some new activity , startling in its ambition . Last week Collier 's , a weekly of this and that , decided to attempt an experiment in Government . It had a plan for municipal government . It not only explained and advocated its plan , it also offered to lend the active assistance of a number of its staff members to any small city which would volunteer to submit to experimentation . <P> The object of the plan is to destroy party lines and political rings . It was invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oswego , N. Y. By it the qualified voters of a city would be divided into regional groups of 700 . From each of these groups , 70 voters would be chosen by lot to meet and , in a sort of town meeting , to select an alderman . The elected aldermen choose a mayor and city officials . Everybody serves until he is recalled , which happens when petitions are presented for calling new meetings of the " 70 's . " <P> Collier 's promised that from all cities which applied for treatment it would select one , and " put all we 've got into it . " Except for advertising purposes , the founding of city government hardly has the appearance of being " publishing " in the ordinary sense . But Collier 's may be leading the way to " the New Press . " Perhaps the press , like the drug store , will become an omnivendor.
