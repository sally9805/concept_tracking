Since Alfred Emanuel Smith became the Democracy 's sheet anchor , many a Dry Democrat has " swallowed the anchor " with many a different kind of grin and grimace . Charles Wayland Bryan , brother and manager of the late William Jennings ( " grape juice " ) Bryan whose opposition to a Smith nomination in 1924 was second only to the McAdoo bitterness , is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Nebraska this year . His method of anchor-swallowing last week , was to announce that he would support the Democratic ticket from the president down , for the following reason : " The Prohibition issue which I have objected to having injected into national campaigns was brought to the fore by the Republican party , in order to befuddle the public and lead them away from the real issue of the campaign , an economic issue . . . specifically , farm relief .
