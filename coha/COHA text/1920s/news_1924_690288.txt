txt In addressing the National Association of Real Estate Boards at Washington , President Coompae was talking to the beneficiaries of one of the most remarkable " booms " the country has ever known . Realtors are loath to admit that it has reached the peak . Say to them that next year lots will be quoted lower and houses ' will sell for less , and they warn you to anticipate higher prices by buying now . Nevertheless , it is not so easy as it was to sell a new house at 100 per cent , advance over the values of 1914 , except in favored localities . No longer is the head of a family admonished that he must acquire title , because there are no houses to let . Lately speculators have built houses to sell at boom prices , and either taken less or rented them . In the rush for shelter four years ago nearly any house in suburban New York , old nr new , could be sold for a price that seemed almost fabulous . Within commuting distance the hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price asked . The realtors reveled in commissions . So the President faced a company of prosperous gentlemen , and they agreed with him that " the ownership " of a home , the feeling of indepen " dente that comes with possession of bit of earth , are among the most " powerful incentives to high civic " interest and usefulness . " Mr. CooL1IDGE gave them some good advice : " , The deal in which one side gets the best of it is not good business . " And again : " The transaction wherein the " sole motive is the brokerage fee , " whether or dot it is earned by gen " uinelY benefiting the principals , is " not commendable . " The President hailed his bearers as " purveyors of " cheer , confidence and soundly based " optimism . " Who ever knew a pessimistic realtor ? Mr. COOLIDGE struck a note that vibrated in the ' bosoms of his , audience when he said : " You are " in a very literal sense the sellers of " America . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as " the best buy in the . ' world . " That was the vernacular they understood . They will think that he might have been a successful operator himself if he had taken to real estate In his early days in Northampton . In a town suburban .65 New York there is a realtor who advertises himself with the handle to his name " Happy Homes . " The happy home was in Mr. Commas 's thought when he said : You men represent one of the strong practical forces working to make ours a nation of home-owning families . You are entitled to be applauded for all you have done and are planning to do in this direction . Multitudes hold the realtors in esteem for herding them into homes ? so much- down and a first and a second mortgage arranged ? in the post-war scramble ? when landlords took the market on the high swing . Renters became investors and proprietors , and therefore citizdns with a stake in the community , as quickly as a deed could be drawn .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
