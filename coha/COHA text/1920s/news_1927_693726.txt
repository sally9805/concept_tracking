txt The Neighborhood Playhouse , started twelve years ago in the heart of the east side , win close its doors at the end of the present season . The project is not to be permanently abandoned ; but will probably be resumed at some ' future date in a larger and more centrally located playhouse . In announcing the decision to close the present theatre , the Misses Irene and Alice Lewisohn , who have sponsored the enterprise from the beginning , said that it was a . Step dictated not by the failure of the theatre , but by its success- and the necessity for expansion . Problems of " location , size and endowment , " they declare , had caused them to realize that their playhouse " had come to the end of its present method . " It was estimated last night by those connected with the playhouse that the Misses Lewisohn had provided an annual endowment fund of $45,000 . This would bring the endowment for the twelve years of operation to about $540,000 , which , it was said , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Announcement of the decision to suspend activity was made to the company and staff of the theatre by Miss Alice Lewisohn after the performance on Saturday night . Miss Lewisohn said : " After very deep consideration of present conditions we have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to bring the activities of the Neighborhood Playhouse to a close at the end of this season . " We feel that all of you , colleagues and associates . realize that we have come to a critical point in our experience , one that requires searching thought and consideration . We stand in the position of being forced by the pressure of economic needs and the hazards of competition either to adopt methods of expedience or to step aside for a time and find a new adjustment . We have chosen to pause , as problems so vital can not be solved during the stress of production or the hectic demands of a repertoire season . To Consider Further Development . " It may seem a paradox that now that individual growth and ensemble sensitiveness have been so distinctly demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lyric bill , as well as through the repertoire of the past two seasons , that we chose to close ; and yet we can only repeat that our own growth demands that we now pause to consider further development . " Our contact with a discriminating theatre audience has been a stimulating influence , and . its growth the last year has , if anything , increased a sense of responsibility and strengthened a belief that an uncompromising standard alone will eventually evolve an art of the theatre , " Deeply as we deplore this step , we are forced to realize that economically and from the working angle , and in view of our geography and the psychology of an audience , our present system is not conducive to the further development of creative expression . " The announcement of the closing . in expanding upon the reasons for the step , continues as follows : " The factors which brought about this decision are , many of them , inherent in the history and growth of the theatre , and result indirectly from the theatre 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a small insurgent theatre , with amateur actors , its location , its size , its endowment , and the kind and number of plays at its disposal were all adequate . As the theatre grew and its standards of work became more exacting , certain of these features were discarded and others proved serious handicaps , which became more insistent as the appeal of its productions reached larger and larger audiences . For instance , in 1920 , five years after its organization , when the Neighborhood Playhouse presented Galsworthy 's play , ' The Mob , ' it felt the need of , and engaged , professional players . The success of this production indicated very clearly the handicaps of the theatre 's size and location , for ' The Mob ' drew its audiences from all parts of the city , and the financial returns could have been far greater had the capacity been larger or the theatre more centrally situated .

" Even then the endowment was still sufficient to meet the needs of the annual productions ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments in unusual forms of lyric drama , it added the experiment of maintaining and training a permanent company , and more recently decided to become a repertory theatre . Then the handicaps of location and capacity loomed larger and larger . The steady march of residential New York to regions further and further north each year made the task of reaching the Neighborhood Playhouse more difficult and time-consuming ; while the size of the theatre prevented even such a success as ' The Dybbuk. ' which played to capacity throughout its long run , from adequately supplementing the endowment ' These three problems of location . size and endowment could all be met by building a larger theatre in a more central location and by enlisting aid from outside sources . There remains , however , the impossibility of forming and executing plans to this lepst while continuing- Andel : ? the . stress of making new productions and maintaining anarge organization , which : in the case of the Neighborhood Playhouse , includes not only the activities common to all theatres but also those of workshops where the costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its younger players in singing , dancing and the art of the theatre , as well as classes for children . " Its Great Success " The Dubbuk . " The Neighborhood Playhouse , which is located at 466 Grand Street , outgrew its neighborhood almost in a single season and has since drawn the major portion of its audiences from uptown . The theatre 's outstanding success in the twelve years of its operation was " The Dybbuk , " produced two season : : ago . It was , however , the first theatre in America to open its doors , to the plays of Lord . Dunsany and has also made many other memorable productions , chief among them " The Little Clay Cart . " The current program at the Neighborhood , a mixed bill of music and dancing , will continue through Sunday , May 1 . The final production at the theatre will be " The Grand Street Follies , " scheduled to open on bk3A- Os ?                 @ @ @ @
