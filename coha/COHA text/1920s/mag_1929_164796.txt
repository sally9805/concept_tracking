LA FAYETTE-Brand Whitlock-Apple-ton ( two vols. - $10 ) . <P> All that Biographer Whitlock has written has been written before-and often . That no living figure emerges from 927 pages is due , not alone to a gullible reliance on the smooth , hard surface of La Fayette 's memoirs , but to the Whitlock intentions and method : " I have tried to look through his eyes at the men he knew and events . ... I have not made up any conversations or rearranged any events with an eye to dramatic effect . " Biographer Whitlock 's eclectic synthesis , whatever it may do to the real La Fayette , emphasizes the not very astonishing fact that his guiding principle was liberty-love . Only in the dullest of classrooms will the Whitlock style of biography not seem to produce a tedious ache .
