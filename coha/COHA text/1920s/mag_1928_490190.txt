ONE qualification of a doorman is that he be unbending . A deviation of more than two inches from the perpendicular injures a doorman in a physical way , long uprightness having made him brittle . But when snow comes to the city , it falls softly on the heads of doormen , the same as on other folk ; and it also falls at the feet of doormen , and accu-mulates there . During a recent snow-fall we saw a handsome fellow , all gold braid and sparkle , shovelling the sidewalk . It was duty , and he was duty bound  --  to shovel and to bend . Pain was written in every line of his face . And as he shovelled he perspired . And as we passed , we laughed ? a low , tinkling laugh , like the sound of sleighhells on frosty night air . OUR Mayor has infinitely more humor than is the birthright of a politician  --  and why is n't that a good thing ? When Jimmy was in Washington last week , he walked down the corridors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the City Hall  --  nobody working . " Well , that was a fairly . good wisecrack , better than most visiting mayors could or would perpetrate while on sombre business in the national capital . Mr. Walker always gets his laugh . We saw him in action the other evening at the K. of C. games in the Garden . When the big race of the evening Caine along the announcer grew thoroughly Barnum-like in his spirited introductions : " Ladeez and genulmen , introducing the grea-at German champeeon , holder of the wurr-rld 's record for the half mile , Dr. Otto-n-o Peltzer . " At this , Peltzer jogged up and down the wooden track , to applause . Again the announcer 's voice : " Introducing that grea-at American champeeon , Lloyd Hahn . " Hahn did his little jog . More of the same . The announcer : " And now it is my grea-at pleasure to introduce the starter of this race , our grea-at Mayor of New York , Jimmee-ee Walker . " And did our Mayor how and raise the hat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mark , started , and jogged off a neat little jog , just like the athlete he is . He got the biggest hand . THE erection of a thirty-nine-story hotel to be called the New Yorker has n't got our sanction . There have been , at various times , a night club , a chewing gum , and a race horse named after us  --  none of which has been a conspicuous success . When the hotel goes up , our clipping service will be more garbled than ever , and we will receive , daily , clippings relating that " Mrs. Reginald Pertwig entertained last night in the writing-room of the New Yorker . " Furthermore , when this publication goes on sale in the lobby of the New Yorker hotel , there will be a certain percentage of the guests just silly enough to think it is a house organ . Our plan is to let the builders go ahead and put the hotel up ; and then , just as they get the roof on , get an injunction and make them take the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dreams , gave its for extra measure , during a night of profound pondering on the commonweal , what seems to us the almost perfect solution of the seven-cent fare problem . Why not , our dream was , make the two-cent increase a sort of extra fare , after the manner of limited railroad trains , returnable in case one can not get off on account of the car being too crowded or the doors not opening ? The other day three doors in a row jammed on us on the Sixth Avenue " L " and we were carried to Fiftieth Street , a place we have always seduously avoided . Our extra fare plan would , it is our idea , provoke the company to have a man look at the doors some day and see what is wrong . A Fourth at Bridge ARESIDENT of this city  --  he tells the story himself among his friends  --  was pleasantly accosted in the lobby of a Boston hotel a few weeks ago by a gentleman who asked him if a luncheon . There she casually mentioned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of short stories , " The Trembling of a Leaf , " by Somerset Maugham and would like Mr. Hays ' permission to film them , beginning with one called " Miss Thompson . " Mr. Hays did not recognize that the story was the basis of the play he had forbidden and informally agreed . " Will you make the permission official in the morning ? " asked Miss Swanson . " Nonsense , " Mr. Hays is quoted as responding , ? " it is official now . " Several people , incidentally , heard this . Work was started on the production . Finally , of course , the news got around that " Rain " was being filmed and Mr. Flays is said to have interposed an objection . His permission to go ahead with it was then recalled to him , and , after some turmoil , it held good , certain changes being made in the movie version of the story by way of compromise . Response SINCE her apartment is on the top floor of one of those old brownstone fronts a young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bell rang quite early one morning and , certain it could not be guests at that hour , she pushed the button and then leaned over the banister . A messenger boy , on his way up , seemed confused about where to go . " What is it ? " called the lady . His shouted answer came promptly : " It looks like candy . " he played bridge . The New Yorker said he did , sometimes . The suggestion that a third and a fourth be found and a game started was agreeable to him and the players were recruited by the other man quite easily , almost too easily one would have thought . The four repaired to a room and played until midnight . It need not be explained perhaps that the three Boston gentlemen were ingeniously leagued together . Perhaps they were sharpers , perhaps they were merely excellent players who usually won . However that may be , when the game was over , the quiet man from New York was one hundred and sixty-five dollars ahead . He bade them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later the man who had invited him into the game casually approached the clerk . " Who , " he asked , " was the gentleman who just got his key ? " The clerk looked on the room list . " That was  --  ah-141r. that it thereforc must not be made into a movie . Yet Miss Gloria Swanson is appearing in a picture based on that plot . There is , it seems , a story behind all of it . A Mr. Maurice Revnes , a film executive , knowing that Miss Swanson had set her heart on doing such a picture , is said to have asked her if she would n't care to have a try at getting around the ban , She would . Mr. Revnes thereupon arranged to buy for seventy-five thousand dollars the rights to the Maugham short story " Miss Thompson , " upon which " Rain " was based . Then he acquired the rights to the play itself . As things go these did not cost much . The producers had been quoting a price in six figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pronunciamemo they were willing to sell out cheap . The next step was to have Mr. Hays seated next to Miss Swanson at Kossuth PROPORTIONATELY at least . 1 a greater fuss was made over Louis Kossuth , whose statue was unveiled on Riverside Drive this week , than over any other guest this town has ever had , we are told by a gentleman twice our age whose hobby is New York history . We had only about four hundred thousand when Kossuth came here seventy-seven years ago and full half of these jammed Battery Place to see him ride to City Hall , a trip which , because of the crowds , took two hours . There had been nothing like it before , not even for Lafayette in 1824 . Kossuth was the great patriot of his day , republics were not commonplace then , and New York went wild over him . He got along fine throughout seventeen days of banquets and receptions because he had devoted his spare time during three years in prison to learning English . The ladies wore the colors of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty business in the " Kossuth , " a low-crowned , wide-brimmed hat affected by the hero . That was in 1851 . Many months before , his young republic had been downed by the Hapsburgs , who called in Russia to help them . Hundreds of Hungarian leaders had been executed and thousands jailed , but Kossuth escaped to Turkey . When the Hapsburgs tried to extradite him the world cried " Shame ! " and the United States Senate voted to send a frigate to bring him here . It took more than a year and a half to get him to New York and even then he arrived two days earlier than the officials of that day had counted on . They avoided embarrassment by having him wait on Staten Island as the guest of the people there until they were ready . While Kossuth tarried here , having a grand time , Washington grew restless . That city had , after all , sent the invitation and the ship . ( Perhaps this explains why the capital so grimly insisted on receiving Lindbergh first . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its invitation , an honor previously conferred only on Lafayette . Later he toured the country and cities cheered him and named streets after him . One of these is Kossuth Place in Brooklyn . Until the statue was unveiled , however , the most warmly received guest the city has ever had was honored only by a plaque on the walls of the Aquarium and by the survivors of some three score babies , burn during his visit here and named after him . One of these was the late E. K. Villox of Cleveland , whose initials stood for Eljen Kossuth which , translated , meant " Long Live Kossuth . " Serenade THE report of a lady from Detroit concerns a taxi driver who answered her beck in Forty-second Street . She directed him to the Pennsylvania station and , as he started off , he began to whistle Drigo 's " Serenade . " Pleased , she told him as they bumped down Sixth Avenue that she liked it . " Ai n't it pretty ? " he said over his shoulder . At the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " is on me . It 's a pleasure to meet anyone who appreciates music . " Rooster in Urbe AGENTLEMAN farmer of Westchester has a niece who recently married a young architect . The couple set up housekeeping modestly in the West Twenties . The other evening they were delighted when the uncle called and left a fine fat young rooster . After the donor departed , though , they became depressed . The fowl was on the foot , that is to say , alive . He sat blinking suspiciously , in fact , on the edge of the kitchen table . The couple decided to have him for dinner the next day , but they were sketchy as to how to go about it . Their colored maid had gone home and would not return until the next day . Meanwhile , the wife thought , the bird should be killed . There was nowhere for him to sleep that night anyway . The husband said he did n't believe he would get very far trying to wring the rooster 's neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any form . In the end they decided on chloroform . This was obtained after some difficulty , but upon attempting to apply it the husband found it made him sick . He retired from the scene , but the little wife pluckily stuck with the problem . After a brilliant struggle she got the rooster down and dabbed a saturated napkin over his face . He lay over on one side and was gone . Then came a quick dousing in water and a plucking of feathers after which , it being late , they placed the nude bird in a dishpan in the kitchen . Dawn came and , also , a brave and lusty crowing . The young people sat up and gazed at one another in fright . Investigating , they found that Mr. Rooster , although pretty cold and in an ugly mood , had n't really been dispatched at all . They finally called the Humane Society and , expressing surprise as to how such a funny bird had ever got into their apartment , turned him over to these proper authorities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season 's debutantes deka/ voted an afternoon to the dog show at Madison Square Garden and came away filled with enthusiasm . " It was lovely , " she announced at dinner that evening . " just too interesting for words . " " Was n't that fine , " said the gentleman on her right , " and who won ? " By this time , however , the young lady 's active mind seemed to have got somewhere else . " Oh , " she said vaguely , " various dogs . " Picture Takers THE Martin johnsons , who took the animal picture " Simba , " have gone into the jungles of Uganda after the white rhinoceros and the okapi . They stayed here just long enough to go to a few plays and to have several dinners of chop suet ' and chili con carne . That seems to constitute the chief lure of metropolitan life for them . Friends of the couple urged them to hunt something with a greater general appeal than the okapi , which , so far as danger is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't listen . They resent , in fact , suggestions that they should keep the box office more in mind . When Johnson edited " Simba " in the dark room he persistently refused to overdramatize or fake any of his photographic adventures and he has even been known to advertise it around that the perils of the wild are not so terrible after all . His new adventure book , " Safari , " was first written in his name by a professional writer and was pretty well colored with excitement . Johnson , his friends say , got mad , tore up the manuscript and wrote the book himself ? and he writes slowly , using only one finger of each hand on a typewriter . Johnson 's father owned a jewelry and novelty shop in Independence , Kansas , but the son declined to show any interest in becoming an expert watchmaker , his father 's ambition for him . Instead , at fourteen , he stowed away on a ship for distant parts . Wandering about , he read of Jack London 's projected voyage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter applying for the job of cook . He got it , went along and ended with the cruise on the Solomon Islands . From there he drifted to Morea in the Society group , took a grass house on the beach and a few months later they were married . Shortly , the two set out for the South Seas , were captured by cannibals on Malekula and survived to present a picture about it . This started them toward their present success . The last time Johnson went to the South Seas he looked up the Malekula cannibal chief , a Mr. Nagipate , and entertained hint and his tribe with a newsreel of the Armistice Day demonstration on Fifth Avenue . Nagipate and his people were not amused , and demanded to be paid in tobacco for the time spent watching the film . The johnsons have a " town home " in Nairobi , capital of British East Africa , which closely resembles a Southampton villa . After a hard spell in the wilds , they return here , where they frequently don evening dress , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their first picture cost about eight hundred dollars and their last nearly two hundred thousand . opportunity Knocks AHONG the proud people of the Bronx are a number who have recently become associated in business with Mr. Cecil B. DeMille . They did this simply by purchasing shares of stock in " The King of Kings " for one hundred dollars each . One of these new movie magnates , however , got to thinking about it and called the offices of the motion picture concern for enlightenment . He had , he found , been swindled , and he was one of dozens . What made him suspicious , it turned out , was that the salesman who sold him the stock made a return call offering to let him in on the ground floor of another good thing , a companion picture to be called " The Queen of Queens . " Ascension THE memory of old Madison Square Garden still haunts the Square , but a very tangible and very beautiful building has arisen on the spot to dispel it . One of the stirring adventures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Life Insurance Building across the park , with the blue sky of morning for a backdrop . At first the tower , still a dark web of steel , seems predominant , with the supporting structure gleaming white , rising tier by tier , majestically . Then as you get nearer , the tower becomes lost to view behind the vast ramparts , which swim dizzily forward out of white clouds , and put you in your place . A mighty climber ourself , we got permission to make the ascent the other morning , and after wandering through ' tomblike depths peopled by a race of white and restless immortals who dwelt in a gloomy rain of plaster from above , we were inducted into an elevator made of a packing box , and hoisted twenty-three stories . The rest of the distance to the spidery tower was covered afoot , up dark stairs through interminable garrets that should have been full of old trunks and bats . To emerge , at last , on the hurricane deck , five hundred feet above reality , with no railing between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limestone pendulous about our head , with a whole new city of workmen trundling harrows of mortar , chipping stone , cutting tin , with blueprints aloft , with the canvas guards of the scaffolding bellying like sails in the breeze  --  this was a dream and a delight . " What time is it , buddy ? " asked a red-headed bricklayer . " Ten altitude left us , and we discovered ourself peering inquisitively over the edge and poking around boldly on precipitous ledges . Workmen were nursing the great stone blocks into place , each ? dangling stone tended by T1 group of three men , while winch drivers sounded their rope signals and filled the air with bell-notes of progress . As the stones were eased down into seats of mortar and were levelled by eager-eyed constructionists , the whole thing grew , a perceptible upward thrust into the sky . It was magic of the most ethereal sort . From the stone will rise a tall sloping tower of lead-coated copper , sparkling tourelles , and at the vein peak ( which an earthy little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than six hundred feet high ) a bronze lantern . It struck us , as we watched , that the workmen aloft there should find a mordant glee in rearing such a grand pile for the use of clerks who 'll write policies for groundlings  --  to whom life , to be sweet , must be insured . THIS story about John Galsworthy 's recent visit here is just bemake talks before them , but always refused . He crossed the country and then on his way back home stopped again in New York . " I have changed my mind about speaking , " he said , " I should like very much to make a talk over the radio . " His publishers leaped at it . What great problem had he discovered in America which . had caused him to change his mind : possibly , they thought , a terrific threatened struggle between capital and labor . They asked him what his subject would he and he showed them a manuscript already prepared . It was called " America and Animals . " It proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild animals ; he had seen , it seems , buffalo penned in small parks , even a sturdy eagle in a cage . The burning subject was put on the air and Mr. Gals-worthy , his mind cleared , his tortured soul freed , sailed for home .
