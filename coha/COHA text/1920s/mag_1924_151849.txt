A treaty of peace has been signed ; the orchestral war at Philadelphia ( TIME , April 21 , May 12 ) is over . Honor and pocketbooks-both are satisfied . Independent announcements of the settlement were issued by Arthur Judson , general manager of the orchestra , and Thomas M. Rivel , president of the local union of the American Federation of Musicians . <P> It was understood that the players would not get so large an increase in the minimum salary as they demanded ( $75 per week ) , but that they had achieved a greater measure of control over the doings of the organization . <P> Conductor Leopold Stokowski is happy . His band finally saved , his job secure , his men merrily signing their new contracts , he will go to Paris for the Summer . And in October his great jubilee season ( the orchestra 's 25th ) will open as planned .
