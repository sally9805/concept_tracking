Time : Four o'clock , an afternoon in June in the year 1830 . Place : The little living-room in the house of Dennis O'Malley in a small town in Ireland . At Curtain : The room is empty . A small fire smoulders in the huge fireplace and the afternoon sun streams in at the low , wide window . After a moment , a small urchin whose face can scarcely be seen for the dirt and the shaggy hair falling over it , nor the lines of whose body can be distinguished because of the largeness and raggedness of his clothes , cautiously pokes his head in from the L. side of the open door at back  --  and looking about , gradually comes into sight in the doorway and , beckoning to some one to follow , sneaks over the doorsill and into the room , carefully watching the inner doors . After a moment an old woman hobbles slowly into the doorway . She is bent over a heavy crooked stick with the aid of which she manages to move . Her hob-nailed shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head are sadly worn and soiled . She stops in the doorway , peering into the room out of her watery eyes , her toothless old mouth working and one gnarled hand feeling the door casing . GRANNY Whist ! MICHAEL ( Whispering back to her as he sneaks about the room ) There be no one about . p. 3 GRANNY ( Mumbling ) The lawyer man . Tell him it be a good six mile I 'm after trampin ' to see him . MICHAEL There be nobody here at all at all . GRANNY My cow it is I want . Tell him that . It 's filched she is . Tell him that . MICHAEL There be nobody here , I 'm tellin ' you . GRANNY My cow it is I 'm wantin ' . My cow . MICHAEL ( Raising his voice ) You deaf old  --  O'RILEY ( Coming in from the door at R. ) Get out of here  --  you sneakin ' , thievin ' vermin ! Out with you ! ( Raising her broom at Michael . ) ( Bridget O'Reilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid of all work and she-dragon of the house of Dennis O'Malley . Her iron-gray hair and her heavy working clothes are rough and untidy . She carries an old broom and a soiled dust cloth of faded checked gingham  --  plainly the remains of a shirt . ) MICHAEL ( Springing away from the broom ) Granny 's lost her cow . The lawyer man it is she 's after wantin ' to see . p. 4 O'RILEY ( Turning to Granny , who is still mumbling ) Cow , is it ? What have we to do with the likes of you an ' your cow ? Get out ! Get out ! GRANNY Six mile it is I come . Faith , my cow is after being taken from me entirely . O'RILEY Off with you  --  you and your faith . MICHAEL It 's not a word she 's hearin ' . O'RILEY Then I 'll beat it into yees if you do n't be off . MICHAEL Ai n't this the house of the lawyer man that do get everything back ? O'RILEY Back , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Take your dirt out of here , you filthy  --  you highway gander 's gob ! ( She drives them to the door . ) And do n't you darken this door again or I 'll set the constable on you . I will that . Go on ! Go on ! Let me see you out on the road . ( She watches in the doorway a moment , and then tramps heavily to the hearth , which she sweeps in vigorous jerks . ) ( Miss Margaret Flinn , a tall , thin spinster of uncertain age , showing by the neat dignity of her dress and manner that she holds herself to be a lady of worth and importance , comes with an air of certainty into the doorway. ) p. 5 FLINN , MISS Have they come , Bridget ? O'RILEY ( With only scant and grudging politeness ) They have not . FLINN , MISS Did Mr. O'Malley go to Dublin after her ? O'RILEY That he did not . He to be spendin ' money like that would be worse than brainless . FLINN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet her , then ? O'RILEY Here at the train in his own town . Where would he be goin ' ? Ai n't she a woman grown and able to step off a train when it stops ? FLINN , MISS You 're raising a dreadful dust , Bridget . It 's settling all over the room . O'RILEY Do n't I know that ? An ' ai n't I goin ' to be wipin ' it up , then ? FLINN , MISS But if you 'd only dampen your broom , it would n't  --  O'RILEY ( Whisking the rag over the table ) Sure , Miss Margaret Flinn , every one knows it to be no lie that you 're after bein ' the best housekeeper in the town for many a year  --  but that ai n't no reason at all why my way of takin ' care of the house of Dennis O'Malley should be changed  --  and me to be doin ' it ever since he come back from Dublin this twenty years . p. 6 FLINN , MISS Fifteen . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'RILEY And ai n't it forty I was here with his mother , and him a boy , before he went away at all ? They never raised no complaint about the dust nor any other thing in the house that be my way of doing it . You have no call to be always faulting me . Mr. Dennis O'Malley is always satisfied entirely and it 's his house , it is . FLINN , MISS Mr. O'Malley is a man and does n't know . Mona wo n't either , for that matter . I doubt very much if she 's learned anything practical at school in Dublin . She was a foolish , dreaming child when she left and two years wo n't make her a wise woman . O'RILEY She to have all the learnin ' in the world will make no difference to me . ' T is Mr. O'Malley I 'm workin ' for . FLINN , MISS You 'll see it will make a difference  --  with Mona in the house . She 's older now and with some city airs , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the door in this house . FLINN , MISS They 'll be wanting their tea , I suppose , as soon as they come . Will you have it ready for them ? O'RILEY He 's never asked fer anything yet that I did n't have ready fer him . It would be a funny thing  --  me to be failin ' in the tea . p. 7 CAIRN ( Speaking outside ) Oh , Paddy Whack , how pretty the garden is ! FLINN , MISS They 're here . ( Margaret and Bridget watch the outer door , and Mona Cairn , a fresh , pretty girl of twenty-two , simply and becomingly dressed in spring traveling clothes , comes in quickly . ) CAIRN Oh , Miss Margaret  --  how nice to find you here ! ( Kissing Margaret 's cheek . ) And Bridget  --  I 'm so glad to see you ! ( Crossing L. to shake hands with Bridget , who gives her hand without speaking . ) FLINN , MISS Welcome home , Mona . Did you have a comfortable journey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you . It was such fun travelling alone . Oh , but it 's nice to be here . I saw Uncle Dennis on the platform before the train stopped and I almost jumped through the door . FLINN , MISS Oh , that would have been frightful . CAIRN Why does n't he come in ? He 's helping the old man lift my box down , I suppose . That would be Paddy Whack . Is he awfully well , Bridget ? Have you taken good care of him ? p. 8 O'RILEY It would be a pity me to be sayin ' how good it is . Is it sick at all he 's lookin ' to you ? CAIRN Oh , no ! Oh , no ! FLINN , MISS He works far too hard  --  far  --  giving his time for nothing to Tom , Dick and Harry and often not enough rest and proper food . CAIRN Oh ! O'RILEY I would n't doubt him to be doin ' always too much with the big heart in him  --  but him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh  --  O'RILEY I wonder at some people to be speakin ' what does n't concern them at all . CAIRN Why does n't Uncle Dennis come in , I wonder ? ( She goes to the door . ) Uncle Dennis . Come in . We 're waiting for you . O'MALLEY ( Calling from outside ) Coming  --  coming ! CAIRN Hurry ! Oh , do n't lift that all alone , you 'll break your back ! O'MALLEY ( Outside ) It 's not much of a back that would break with this . Sure it must be only feathers and laces you have in it . p. 9 CAIRN Oh , how strong he is ! Come along , now . ( Mona steps back and Dennis comes into the door . ) ( Dennis O'Malley is a handsome man with something of an old world courtesy in his manner and a certain idealism in his nature which has kept him poor  --  preferring to come back to his little native town in Ireland , for sheer love of it , rather than enter into the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is often assumed for the humor of it . ) O'MALLEY The top o ' the morning to you , Margaret . And what do you think of our town girl and her town clothes ? Is she too fine for us now , do you think ? CAIRN Oh , Uncle Dennis  --  do n't say that . FLINN , MISS I see nothing more than what any lady should wear . I always feel that my own clothes are quite as good as any I could get in town . O'MALLEY Contentment is a great thing . Bridget , give me a hand in with the box , will you ? And you 'll stay and have a cup of tea with us , Margaret ? CAIRN Oh , do , Miss Margaret . O'RILEY ( Coming up to outer door ) It 's willin ' I am to be makin ' the tea , but it wo n't be grand enough for some people . ( She goes out at outer door. ) p. 10 O'MALLEY Is it hurted she is ? CAIRN Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you let her boss you and rule this house . O'MALLEY Faith , a man and his house must be always ruled by a woman . Who else would do it in my case  --  if not Bridget ? ( He follows Bridget out . ) FLINN , MISS Poor man  --  poor man ! The pity of it ! If she were even clean and neat , one might be willing to bear with her tongue  --  but this house is a disgrace . Look at that . ( Running her finger along the table and showing Mona the dust . ) CAIRN Oh , dear ! How dreadful ! Why does n't Uncle Dennis tell her she must keep it clean ? FLINN , MISS Tell her ! He 'd as leave think of telling a wild bull to be gentle and quiet as to hint to Bridget to be any way but just as she is . CAIRN I shall tell her . I wo n't have Uncle Denny imposed upon , I wo n't . FLINN , MISS My dear Mona , do nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do n't meddle . You 'll only make things worse . I hope to rouse Dennis himself to an understanding of what he ought to do . Of course I have to be very patient and tactful in spite of our long friendship and our  --  our  --  his confidence in me . I have to influence him without letting him know it . He 's a man , you know . p. 11 CAIRN Yes , but  --  FLINN , MISS I caution you to do nothing  --  say nothing and let  --  O'MALLEY ( Coming in from outdoors , holding one end of the trunk ) This is the only trunk that has been in and out of this door for many a year , is n't it , Bridget ? O'RILEY ( Following , holding the other end ) Your own , it was , was the last when you came from Dublin to stay . O'MALLEY ( Going up the stairs ) Where will you have it , Mona  --  in your own room ? CAIRN Yes , please . O'RILEY Where else is it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only place at all . FLINN , MISS She could unpack it better in the passageway , and then it could be lifted into the loft . O'RILEY That it could not . ( Dennis begins to sing cheerfully to stop the discussion and sings as he and Bridget go up the stairs . He stops on the landing to finish the charming Irish song and then disappears with the trunk. ) p. 12 FLINN , MISS You see ? If you had n't spoken about the trunk , I could have got it down . CAIRN But I want it in my room . FLINN , MISS There it is  --  just what I was saying  --  you have no experience . Housekeeping is an art and it takes the greatest judgment and knowledge . If you are n't willing to listen to me , I ca n't help you , and I want to help you , Mona dear  --  for you 're going to be in a trying position now that you 've come back to stay . CAIRN Trying ? Why ? What do you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people accepted the situation and took it as a matter of course that you should live here just as though Dennis really were your own uncle  --  CAIRN Of course . Why not ? I should like to know . FLINN , MISS It got harder for him as you grew older , and finally he was forced to send you away to school to get rid of you . CAIRN What ? FLINN , MISS But now that you 're back it will be worse than ever . I must help Dennis , of course  --  he depends upon me . He has no one else  --  and I want to be your friend . Rely upon me and come to me with all your troubles . p. 13 CAIRN I do n't intend to have any troubles . I do n't know what you 're talking about . Paddy Whack is  --  FLINN , MISS That 's another thing , Mona dear . Do n't you think it 's time you stopped calling him Paddy Whack ? It is n't really dignified , you know . CAIRN Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than any other . I can see him now so plainly when I was little  --  how he used to hold up his finger to me and say  --  " I 'll give you a Paddy Whack . " I really do n't see why you asked me to  --  ( Margaret stops her with a glance as Dennis comes down the steps . ) O'MALLEY It 's good to see your room inhabited once more , Mona  --  by your trunk . It sort of seems to fill the house already and to smile and talk back at us as we put it in the corner . We compromised on the corner . FLINN , MISS Compromised ? You mean Bridget said corner , and into the corner it went . ( Dennis smiles and winks at Mona . As he reaches the last step but one , Michael reappears in the doorway and , seeing Dennis , beckons quickly to Granny outside . ) MICHAEL ( Pulling a pet lock by way of respectful greeting to Dennis ) Your Honor , Granny wants to see you . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? Who are you ? MICHAEL Michael , I am . Granny 's comin ' . ( Granny hobbles into the doorway . ) She ca n't hear what you say to her at all  --  but she wants her cow back . GRANNY ( Mumbling and bobbing ) Six miles it is I come to see ye , Your Honor . God bless you . I 'm a poor old woman , Your Honor . I 'm gone 96 and it 's filched my cow they did  --  ( She goes on talking . ) O'MALLEY ( To Michael ) Where do you live ? MICHAEL ( Hitting Granny 's arm  --  not too gently ) Keep still , Granny . His Honor is talking . Over the north hill other side of the castle , Your Honor . O'MALLEY Who took your cow ? ( Granny still talks . ) MICHAEL Shut up , I say , Granny . Sure we do n't know who took ' er  --  at all . O'RILEY ( Coming down the stairs ) Did n't I drive you out once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . ( Waving a hand to Bridget , as she stands above him on the stairs ) When was the cow taken ? p. 15 GRANNY God bless Your Honor . MICHAEL Shut up , Granny  --  GRANNY I 'm a poor old woman  --  O'RILEY A blind man can see that . GRANNY Heaven will reward ye , Your Honor . Me to be left without a cow . ( She goes on . ) MICHAEL Sure the cow was in the house when we went to bed . I heard her breathin ' and this morning she was gone . O'MALLEY Do you suspect anyone ? MICHAEL What , Your Honor ? O'MALLEY Have you your eye on any one in particular you think might have taken her ? MICHAEL Faith , there 's many as might  --  but which one it is I could n't say . You could , Your Honor . O'RILEY And it 's witchcraft they do be expectin ' of you . FLINN , MISS Why do you waste your valuable time like this , Dennis ? O'MALLEY ( Throwing a penny to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a notice in the square and see what we can do . What does she look like , I am wishful to ask ? p. 16 MICHAEL Stop your noise , Gran . Black and white , Your Honor . Four white feet and two black eyes , Your Honor . O'MALLEY How many tails ? MICHAEL Two , Your Honor . And her name be Bess . Sure she 'll come if you call her , Your Honor . O'MALLEY I 'll stand in the Square and call till she comes . MICHAEL Thank you , Your Honor , thank you , Your Honor . Go on , Granny . GRANNY Has he got the cow ? God bless him . God rest your soul . It 's prayin ' I 'll be every  --  O'RILEY Nobody wants your prayers , you old hag . Why would you be encouraging them to come back , Mr. O'Malley ? O'MALLEY ( Going on down the stairs as Michael hurries Granny out ) Somebody 's got to get her cow back . We 'll all be old ourselves some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look very serious . Is it longing for Dublin you are already ? ( Bridget comes down and goes out R. ) CAIRN No , I 'm not . I 'm thinking what a lot of old women there are in Ireland . Where do they all come from ? p. 17 O'MALLEY They were all as young and as rosy as you , once , Mona  --  but the sorrows of Ireland are on their backs . They 've tramped in the rain and wind  --  herding on the hills  --  living on crusts  --  with no hope of anything else in their hearts . Poverty and oppression do n't make soft and silver old age . CAIRN Oh , it 's so sad  --  so sad . O'MALLEY Do n't let it sadden you . Give Ireland as much of your own happiness as you can , and some of your mind and heart . CAIRN She has my heart , Uncle Dennis . O'MALLEY Good . CAIRN ( Going to Dennis ) You do n't know  --  you do n't know how glad I am to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his arm  --  he looks down at it ) It 's the dearest place in the world and you 're the dearest person in the world . I 'll be back in a minute as soon as I 've taken some dust off . ( She kisses his cheek and taking her coat , runs lightly up the stairs . Dennis stands without moving . ) FLINN , MISS ( Lowering her voice ) You see  --  it 's just as I told you it would be , Dennis . She does n't realize she 's a day older , and she expects you to treat her just as you always have . p. 18 O'MALLEY In heaven 's name , Margaret , why should n't I ? She is my daughter and has been for fifteen years . Why should I begin to treat her differently now ? When I promised her father to take her , it was forever . Forever , mind you . I 'm not going back on my word because she 's grown up . Her father was as dear to me as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred trust . FLINN , MISS You must get her married as soon as you can . O'MALLEY Eh ? FLINN , MISS Do n't you intend to ? O'MALLEY Faith , she 's just come in at the door  --  I wo n't push her out the window before she 's had time to look about . FLINN , MISS You are n't capable of directing her and controlling her . It 's an absurd situation . O'MALLEY Is it now ? Do n't put an old woman 's fears in my head , Margaret . Sure , we 've always been very happy . Why ca n't we go on the same ? As to directing and controlling , she has a look in her eye that warns me not to attempt that . It 's she that will be doing that to me now . FLINN , MISS There 's no doubt about that . Are you never going to tell her that she has n't a penny  --  that the money you pretend her father left her all comes from you and your hard work ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd spoil the greatest fun I ever had in my life  --  working for her and seeing her spend it like a princess ? FLINN , MISS It 's ridiculous . You ought to tell her how you scrimped and saved to send her to school for two years , and that she ought to turn that schooling to some account now and take care of herself . O'MALLEY Tut , Margaret . Why would you spill the child 's little cup of happiness ? What else in God 's world have I got to do but to work for her  --  and why should I cut the tail of her kite just as she 's beginning to fly ? Sure I want her to think herself as independent as any in the land  --  so she 'll walk with her head high and her heart light . FLINN , MISS But it 's all so foolish , so wrong . O'MALLEY It 's very comfortable it is , being a fool , Margaret . You ought to try it  --  for it 's a great deal you miss  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your back thinking of your own wisdom . FLINN , MISS Are you sure you feel quite so paternal towards her as you try to make out , Dennis ? Are you sure you have n't another feeling back of it all ? O'MALLEY I have nothing at all but the wish for her to be happy . p. 20 FLINN , MISS And you want her to marry ? O'MALLEY ( After a pause ) That I have never thought of . She seems a child to me . I suppose it must come in time  --  yes . FLINN , MISS Do n't try to deceive me , Dennis . And be careful you do n't spoil her chances and drive off other men . O'MALLEY Is it as selfish as that you think me ? FLINN , MISS I 'm only saying  --  be careful . ( Bridget enters from the kitchen at R. , carrying a large tray with a shabby old tea service  --  a loaf of bread and a plate of butter . ) O'RILEY ( Taking it to table C. , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Some people would be expectin ' cups of gold and silver , but them as do n't like our kind need n't be drinkin ' out of ' em . O'MALLEY ( Laughing ) Sure yours is the finest tea in the land , Bridget . CAIRN ( Coming down the stairs ) Oh , I 'm so hungry . Will you pour the tea , Margaret , or shall I ? p. 21 FLINN , MISS ( Rising ) You 're not accustomed to it . ( She sits at the table to serve the tea . ) CAIRN Oh , yes , I am . There 's a great point made at school of how we serve tea  --  with flowing conversation . O'RILEY Sure , if it 's only flowing conversation you want , some people excel in that an ' nothin ' else . ( With a telling look at Margaret , she marches out R. ) FLINN , MISS ( Sitting to serve the tea ) She 's insufferable , Dennis . I sometimes think I can never set foot inside your house again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife out  --  but her heart is as soft as the Blessed Virgin 's when you 're down and ailing . FLINN , MISS But her impertinence ! I ca n't respect myself and endure it . O'MALLEY Sure , you have more wit and wisdom in the tip of your little finger , Margaret , than Bridget has in the whole of her body . Why do n't you win her over ? FLINN , MISS I would n't stoop to . O'MALLEY Faith , stooping is good for us . It keeps us nimble in the joints . p. 22 CAIRN Bridget need n't think she can boss me , Uncle Dennis . Thank you . Just one sugar . I 'll cut the bread myself . I like it very thin . FLINN , MISS It does n't spread well too thin . CAIRN Oh , yes , it does , if it 's well cut . FLINN , MISS Dennis does n't like it thin . CAIRN He will when he sees how nice it is . Just you wait . We girls used to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a wafer . There  --  look at that . Is n't that nice , Paddy Whack ? It will melt in your mouth . Eat that and I 'll give you more . ( Putting a slice on a plate and giving it to Dennis ) Shall I do some for you , Miss Margaret ? FLINN , MISS No , thank you . CAIRN You do n't know what you 're missing . How do you like it , Paddy ? O'MALLEY Sure , it 's like the comb of the honey , it 's that delicate . What else did you learn at school ? FLINN , MISS Something more practical than that , I hope . ( Taking her own tea , having served the others . ) O'MALLEY It 's easy enough to be practical . I hope the schooling has opened your eyes to the beauty in the world and taught you how to see it . There 's a rose in the garden now , Mona , as fine as any lady 's garden could wish . p. 23 FLINN , MISS You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is that yours , Margaret ? I suspect it is . Well , you did us a good turn when you did that . Everybody stops to look at it over the wall . CAIRN Uncle Dennis , we need a new carpet in this room . This one must be a thousand years old . Let 's get it right away . Sha' n't we ? O'MALLEY Well  --  we might make this one last out the year , do n't you think ? CAIRN Why should we ? I 'll write and order one from Dublin to-morrow . I 'll buy it , you know . I do n't want you to . ( Margaret looks significantly at Dennis . ) O'MALLEY ( Rising ) No  --  I ca n't let you do that . We 'll see  --  we 'll see . Do n't you want to walk along with Margaret when she goes and get a bit of air ? ' Twill do you good after your journey . I 'm expecting the Squire soon now on a bit of business . FLINN , MISS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd love to . I 'm dying to walk over the whole town and see how everything looks . There 's not a new house in the place , is there ? p. 24 O'MALLEY No  --  oh , no . Do n't be looking for anything new . It 's hard enough it is keeping up the old ones . Do n't think me inhospitable , Margaret , hurrying you off  --  and thank you for coming . I 'm a lucky dog to have two ladies at tea . You and Mona will be such friends I 'll be deserted , I suppose . Good-bye . ( Squire , humming , comes into the doorway  --  knocking on the casement with his heavy , gold-headed cane . He is a tall , heavy man of sixty  --  well dressed and comfortable , with good health and his own important position in the county . ) SQUIRE Well  --  what 's all this ? A tea party ? O'MALLEY How are you , Squire ? Your name was just on my tongue . Here 's Mona . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mona , I would n't have known you . Why , you 're a woman  --  and a damned good-lookin ' one at that . How are you ? CAIRN ( Going to take his hand ) How do you do , Squire Linnering ? I 'm very glad to see you . SQUIRE The same here . ( Holding her hand and looking her over ) How are you to-day , Miss Flinn ? FLINN , MISS Very well , indeed , thank you . Are you coming , Mona ? p. 25 SQUIRE Am I drivin ' the ladies away ? CAIRN Oh , no  --  we were just starting . Good-bye . SQUIRE I trust we 'll be seeing you at the Grange soon . CAIRN Thank you . SQUIRE My boy Lawrie 's home now , too  --  for the summer vacation . Young loafer  --  wastin ' his time with racin ' over the country . He 's after bringin ' me in town with his new pair . May like you 'll see him in the square . FLINN , MISS We do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squire . Good-bye , Dennis . I 'll be sending you a loaf of my bread to-morrow . O'MALLEY Thank you , Margaret . CAIRN Good-bye , Squire . I wo n't be long , Paddy Whack . ( She follows Margaret out  --  after blowing a kiss to Dennis . ) SQUIRE My God , Dennis , you 've got a beauty on your hands . What are you going to do with her ? O'MALLEY What I 've always done . ( Bridget comes in from R. and , courtseying to the Squire , goes to take the tea tray. ) p. 26 O'RILEY Beggin ' your pardon . SQUIRE A fine specimen you are to be takin ' care of the likes of that . Sure , it 's after gettin ' you a wife you 'll have to be  --  to take care of her for you . What 's the matter with Margaret Flinn , and the town waiting these ten years for you to take her ? ( Bridget looks as disgusted as she dares , and goes out noisily with the tray . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret would not be averse . O'MALLEY ( Pushing a chair out to R.C. for the Squire ) Do n't waste good time with your jokes , but come to business . SQUIRE ( Sitting heavily ) Sure , it 's no joke at all , but the plain truth I 'm tellin ' you . Well , now , this is what I 'm wantin ' of you . There 's a piece of land next to my place that runs by me some four miles and over into the next county  --  to Lady Duveen 's place . O'MALLEY Oh , yes  --  the land you 've always quarreled about . SQUIRE The Duveens it is have done the quarreling . The land belongs to me  --  come down from my family as straight and as sure as I 'm sittin ' in this chair . A damned hard chair it is , too . ( Rising and walking about. ) p. 27 O'MALLEY The Duveens say the same thing  --  that it 's been in the family these hundreds of years . SQUIRE Sure , it 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but she has nothing to prove it at all . O'MALLEY What have you got ? SQUIRE What I want you to do is this . To get on the case and look up the old county records  --  and land titles . I want it cleared . I 'm tired of the nonsense . It 's mine and I have use for it . Go to her , to Lady Duveen , and find out if she can put up anything more than talk for her claim . There 's a hundred pounds in this for you , Dennis  --  if you clear it up . You 're the man to do it  --  better than a Dublin man who do n't know the country here . Will you get at it now , quick ? O'MALLEY ( Rising ) I 'll see Lady Duveen to-morrow , if she 'll let me  --  and see what claim she has . SQUIRE That 's the boy . Do it thorough . And I want it pushed along . The sooner you 're done with it , the sooner you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrie Linnering comes into the outer door  --  a tall , good-looking young fellow , with rather a swagger in his town clothes  --  but a very likeable way with him. ) p. 28 LAWRIE Ready , Dad ? How are you , Mr. O'Malley ? O'MALLEY ( Shaking hands ) . How are you , Lawrie ? When did you come down ? LAWRIE Oh , last week , I believe  --  seems a year . SQUIRE That 's what you get for spoilin ' ' em . Raisin ' ' em like pets , sendin ' ' em to town to read law , instead of keepin ' ' em at home to work for you in your old age . Good-for-nothin ' young spendthrift , you ! ( Giving Lawrie a poke with his cane . Lawrie laughs and pushes the cane away . ) O'MALLEY You may get enough of town and come back here to settle down . LAWRIE Not much . That 's a pretty little fairy tale  --  but it does n't go . O'MALLEY Oh , yes , it does  --  sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . You may find you can be more alive in a town of this size  --  standing on your own feet  --  than swallowed up in the crowd in Dublin , with everybody steppin ' on your heels and waitin ' the chance to kick you in the shin . One thing it is you 'll soon be after learning  --  that you ca n't pick and choose your clients in the city , but have got to take what comes . p. 29 LAWRIE Well , why not take what comes ? O'MALLEY Some men like to stand for the honest thing  --  even in law . LAWRIE Oh , bosh ! Law 's all technicality  --  it has no moral side . O'MALLEY That 's up to the man  --  whether he goes in for law or justice . LAWRIE You 've gone in for justice , I suppose ? O'MALLEY I have . LAWRIE ( Glancing about the room ) And  --  have you made much  --  money ? O'MALLEY The wolf gets a little further from the door each year  --  and he 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting things right for my fellow-citizens as far as my little power goes . That 's the thing that keeps the heart in you , boy  --  not the piling up of pounds . And to know you 're doing something for Ireland and pushing your own home town a little way along in civilization and progress and right thinking . Does that mean nothing to you all  --  at all ? LAWRIE By Jove  --  I do n't see what there is in it . Come on , Dad  --  we 've got to get home . I 've got a tennis game on at five , and it 's  --  ( He turns to go as Mona comes in  --  her hands full of roses . They stop , staring at each other. ) p. 30 O'MALLEY Mona , this is Lawrie Linnering . Do n't you remember him ? CAIRN Oh  --  why  --  no  --  yes . I think I do . LAWRIE ( Shaking hands with her ) By Jove  --  you have grown up , have n't you ? CAIRN So have you . LAWRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin  --  all winter  --  CAIRN Oh , so have I  --  two winters . LAWRIE Really ? How ripping . Like it ? CAIRN Rather . LAWRIE Have any fun ? CAIRN Rather ! LAWRIE Awful to be back in this hole , is n't it ? CAIRN Oh , no . I love it . That 's the best part of going away , the coming home . LAWRIE I say ! Do you play tennis ? CAIRN Of course . How do I play , Uncle Dennis ? O'MALLEY She plays the way Diana would have played if they 'd had the noble game in her day . p. 31 LAWRIE I say ! Let me take you out to the Grange now . There are people there for tennis and tea . CAIRN Oh , no , thank you . LAWRIE I 'll bring you back whenever you want to come . CAIRN Oh  --  O'MALLEY You 'd better go , Mona . You 'll like it . CAIRN But I do n't want to . I 've just come home . I want to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many days , till you 're tired of the sight of me , child . LAWRIE Please come . SQUIRE Come and see the young people . Sure , that 's what you ought to do . Not be moping here with this old bachelor . CAIRN Thank you very much . Some other time  --  but I have n't seen Uncle Dennis at all yet . LAWRIE Will you come to-morrow if I come for you ? CAIRN Oh  --  I  --  do n't know . O'MALLEY She will , yes . SQUIRE ( To Lawrie ) In the meantime , you seem to have forgotten entirely that you have a very pressing engagement . p. 32 LAWRIE Four o'clock , then , to-morrow . Good-bye . Awfully jolly that you 're home . We must have a lot of tennis . CAIRN Good-bye . ( There are general good-byes  --  the Squire and Lawrie go . After a moment , standing in the door  --  Dennis watching her ) He 's got to be an awfully good-looking chap , has n't he ? And he used to be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad he dropped in . You must go out there to-morrow , Mona . ' Twill be a good start for you to meet the young people . There 'll be some you know and some you do n't , I suppose . CAIRN Will you come , too ? O'MALLEY Young people  --  young people they 'll be . The young swells and gentry of the county . CAIRN I hope you do n't call yourself old . O'MALLEY I do n't need to call it  --  it 's coming fast enough . CAIRN Oh , Paddy , do n't you say that . I do n't like it . I wo n't go to-morrow without you , that 's all . O'MALLEY Are you going to begin by disobeying me ? CAIRN Yes . p. 33 O'MALLEY Then it 's a big paddy whack you 'll have to have . I want you to have a gay and happy time , dear child , and take your place among the best of them . Your mother was one of the finest ladies in Ireland , Mona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's one thing you 've never told me . Was she disgraced when she ran away and married my father ? Was she ? O'MALLEY That 's too strong a word . She lost something in the eyes of the world , of course , in social caste  --  but not in reality  --  and she never regretted it a minute . That I know . She was happy . Your handsome young father worshipped her and he made her happy their short life together . CAIRN I should think Father must have hated me because she gave her life for me . O'MALLEY You know better than that . You know he loved you like the last precious thing left on earth . CAIRN What if he had n't known you ? What if there had n't been you to leave me with ? Would n't it have been awful ? What would have become of me ? It makes me shiver to think of it . O'MALLEY Do n't waste time shivering over what has n't happened . There 'll be plenty of reality later on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know what  --  but everybody gets his share . Sure , we 'd be no good at all  --  without a few knocks and bumps to bring out the strength in us . CAIRN I wonder if Lawrie Linnering has any strength of character . O'MALLEY You can soon find out . It 's that you 'd like in a man , is n't it , Mona ? Rather than good looks . CAIRN Oh , of course  --  but I do n't see why a man ca n't have both . O'MALLEY Sure , it 's all he can do to get the one  --  do n't be looking for too much . Blessed are they who expect nothing , for they shall not be disappointed . CAIRN But you have both . O'MALLEY Go on with your blarney , now . CAIRN I mean it . You are a very good-looking man , Uncle Dennis . I 'd forgotten how awfully good looking you were . Really  --  better than any I saw in Dublin . O'MALLEY The best men in Dublin were probably not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish all the girls could see you . Some of them had awfully queer-looking fathers coming to see them . I do n't think I could have loved my own father as much as I love you . p. 35 O'MALLEY Sure , it 's turning my head you are , entirely . Did you  --  were you  --  did you take a fancy to young Linnering , then ? CAIRN Yes , I did . I like him awfully . Do n't you ? O'MALLEY Well  --  I can live without him . But if you like him , that 's all that 's necessary , I suppose . Was it all the way home with Margaret you went ? CAIRN Yes . Oh ! The roses . I forgot them . O'MALLEY Is it withered they are ? ( Lifting them from the table ) Poor things  --  poor things . Hanging their heads on one side and blushing to see themselves so neglected by a blooming young lady . What would Margaret say to that ? CAIRN ( Taking the flowers ) She 'd probably say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me instructions how to  --  Oh !  --  oh !  --  a sticker . Make it well . ( Holding her finger up to be kissed ) Have you forgotten how ? O'MALLEY ( Hesitating , then kissing her finger ) You 're so independent now , I thought you 'd be after giving up your baby ways . p. 36 CAIRN I do n't believe you 're half as glad to have me back as I am to be here . You have n't really kissed me at all yet . O'MALLEY To be sure I have . CAIRN But not a nice one . ( Lifting her face to him . ) O'MALLEY I 'm more glad to have you back than you can ever know , my child . ( He kisses her forehead gently . ) CAIRN Oh , not that way . ( She throws her arms about his neck ) I love you  --  love you , love you , Paddy Whack . ( She kisses his lips . Dennis takes her arms down quickly and moves away . ) What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got to tell me . O'MALLEY Nothing dear . Nothing . O'RILEY ( Coming in from R. ) Mr. and Mrs. O'Dowd is in the kitchen wanting to see you that bad . O'MALLEY Why did n't they come around the other way ? O'RILEY It 's hopes of a drop o ' tea brings ' em in through the kitchen . Will I leave ' em in here , now ? p. 37 O'MALLEY ( Going to his desk ) Yes  --  yes . CAIRN I want something to put these flowers in , Bridget . Something high . O'RILEY High , is it ? I 'm thinking you 'll have to be after takin ' what you can get . ( Bridget goes out R. Mona turns to look at Dennis , who sits at his desk , his head in his hands . She hesitates , then goes out R. ) O'RILEY ( Outside ) You can be goin ' in now  --  and mind , do n't be staying too long . It 's tired to death he is with the likes o ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mrs. O'Dowd . They are both like two round , red , hardy winter apples , exactly alike in height and width , short , round , and very red in the face . Mrs. O'Dowd wears a red shawl over her shoulders and Mr. O'Dowd a red scarf around his neck . Their clothes show them to be removed from the pinch of poverty  --  especially Mrs. O'Dowd 's bonnet , which asserts itself as having once been very much in the fashion . ) O'DOWD , MR . ( Taking off his hat and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand ) Your Honor . p. 38 O'MALLEY ( Half turning ) Yes  --  what is it , O'Dowd ? O'DOWD , MRS . The saints preserve you , Your Honor . O'MALLEY What can I do for you ? MR . AND MRS . O'DOWD ( Together ) It 's the McGinnisses that be causing the trouble  --  O'MALLEY ( Turning fully ' round in his chair ) One at a time , please . I ca n't understand you in concert . ( They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tongue , Mother . Did n't you hear His Honor saying he wanted myself to speak entirely ? O'DOWD , MRS . I did not that . One at a time , he 's after sayin ' , and ai n't it myself that can talk the straightest  --  you after havin ' a drop as we come along ? O'MALLEY Well , suppose we make it place o'dame  --  ladies first  --  O'Dowd , for a starter . O'DOWD , MR . I 'm a plain man , Your Honor . I have no leniency with a woman speaking in public . O'MALLEY Your husband is a conservative , I see , p. 39 O'DOWD , MRS . Suppose you be seated and let him begin ? O'DOWD , MRS . ( Sitting at left on the edge of a chair ) Sure , it 's always beginnin ' everything he is , and me ending it  --  from hoeing the potatoes to  --  O'DOWD , MR . ( Standing C. , preparing to speak ) That will do , now . Ca n't you see His Honor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's waitin ' for yourself you are . Go on  --  go on . O'DOWD , MR . ( Turning back to Dennis ) The Mcginnisses it is  --  is makin ' the trouble entirely . These ten days gone now it is  --  O'DOWD , MRS . Two weeks it is . O'DOWD , MR . I 'm speakin ' . O'DOWD , MRS . Speak the truth , then , will ye ? Though the Holy Father knows it ai n't in ye . O'DOWD , MR . How can I be speakin ' and you cacklin ' and interruptin ' the chain of me thoughts ? O'DOWD , MRS . You 'd be all night if I did n't give you a poke . O'MALLEY Well  --  well  --  the McGinnisses , you say . What have they been doing ? p. 40 O'DOWD , MR . It 's after sellin ' ' em a horse I am  --  and divil a cent of the money have I seen yet , and him promisin ' it the next day come noon . O'MALLEY How long is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , all right . Why did you let him have the horse , O'Dowd , before you got your money ? O'DOWD , MR . Ai n't I tellin ' you  --  O'DOWD , MRS . ( Rising ) Bless you for them words , Your Honor . Ai n't I after saying them very words to O'Dowd over and over till my  --  ( The O'Dowds forget Dennis and begin a lusty argument . ) O'MALLEY ( Rising ) Order in the court . That will do , now . I understand the case . I 'll get hold of McGinnis and either make him pay at once , or give back the horse . O'DOWD , MR . It 's the money I 'm wantin '  --  not the horse . I do n't want the horse back . O'MALLEY What 's the matter with the horse ? O'DOWD , MR . Nothing at all , Your Honor . O'DOWD , MRS . Sure , it 's as fine a horse as Your Honor ever seen . Lord save us , you do n't think O'Dowd would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ? O'Dowd do be honest . With all his faults , I will say that for him , Your Honor  --  he 's the honestest man ever I seen . You to be doubting that would break my heart entirely . p. 41 O'MALLEY Of course , of course . I 'll see what McGinnis has to say . Drop in again in a day or two . ( Mona comes in from the R. , carrying an old blue pitcher with the roses in it . She stands watching the O'Dowds . ) Go out that way and let Bridget give you a cup of tea . O'DOWD , MRS . Oh , thank you , Your Honor , we could n't do that . Nothing was further from our thoughts . O'MALLEY Of course  --  of course . I understand . O'DOWD , MRS . Since you insist , Your Honor . It 's that grateful we are . Ourselves it is that loves Your Honor . ( Bobbing to Mona ) God love you . A good husband to you , Miss . Thank you , Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out R. ) O'DOWD , MR . ( Following and bowing to Mona ) Good-day , Miss . Good-day , Your Honor . It 's much obliged I am . Sure , a good thing for the town it 'll be if you make McGinnis come to the law . Good-day . Good-day . ( He goes out . Bridget closes the door . ) O'MALLEY ( Looking at the pitcher ) You found something , I see . p. 42 CAIRN Yes . Its nose is broken , but it 's a lovely old thing . Bridget says it 's over three hundred years old . O'MALLEY ( Laughing ) There 's none alive to dispute it . CAIRN ( Putting the pitcher on the table ) Uncle Dennis , why do people come here to see you on business ? Why do n't they go to your office ? O'MALLEY Well  --  I  --  I 've given up my office since  --  you 've been away . CAIRN Why ? O'MALLEY Well  --  I  --  you were n't here , you see  --  and this was n't needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient not to have to go out in the bad weather  --  so I just gave up the office and hung my shingle out here . Good idea , do n't you think ? CAIRN I do n't know whether I do or not . Somehow it does n't seem quite so dignified as having your office down in the square . O'MALLEY I 'll take it back again in the fall . CAIRN Why not right away ? O'MALLEY Well  --  I  --  I think some one else is in it  --  till then . p. 43 CAIRN Then we 'll look for another one  --  right away . You ca n't be here . It 's too womanish . And I 've got some sweet ideas about this room . Let 's take the carpet up and paint the floor and have rugs . Then everything must be taken out-doors and beaten and rubbed and scrubbed till it shines , and then we 'll have pretty chintz covers made for everything , and curtains of the same , with simple little white muslin ones under them  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tennis court of our own . There 's a splendid spot for it down in the southwest corner of the garden . Come  --  look  --  ( He follows her to the door ) Let 's do it right away . Do n't you see ? Lots of room  --  and seats under the trees , this side . O'MALLEY I 'll go down and have a look at it . ( It has grown gradually darker in the room  --  a soft evening light outside . ) CAIRN I 'll go with you . O'MALLEY ( Going out ) No , do n't . You must be tired , and it 's getting damp out here . CAIRN Oh , well , if you do n't want me  --  ( Calling to him ) Pace it off and see if there is n't plenty of room . ( Bridget comes in from R. , and going to table at C , lights the lamp there and one on desk at L. ) p. 44 CAIRN ( Still in the doorway ) Bridget  --  why did Uncle Dennis give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fool can tell that . CAIRN Why ? What ? O'RILEY It 's to be savin ' the money . Why else in God 's world would he be doing it ? Him that likes his own man 's place , to be huddled up here like an old woman  --  a shame it is . CAIRN ( Coming back into the room ) Oh !  --  are you sure ? O'RILEY Sure am I ? Is it a fool I am entirely ? Do n't I know him ? Him to be scrimpin ' and denyin ' himself , saving every cent and takin ' on work that keeps him up half the night and bothering with the poor for nothing , with the big heart inside of him . Am I sure ? I wisht I was half as sure of saving my soul as I am of that . CAIRN But I thought Uncle Dennis was quite comfortably off . O'RILEY Did you now ? Well , it 's poor thinkin ' you done . CAIRN He has n't lost any money lately , has he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose ? p. 45 CAIRN I wish I 'd never spent a cent of my money  --  going away to school . ( Bridget sniffs . ) He could have used that and not given up his office . I 'll make him take his office back again right away . O'RILEY You will  --  will you ? CAIRN I will . O'RILEY It is likely a man of iron like him to be givin ' up to the notion of a chit of a girl like you ? CAIRN If I advise him to do it and wish it very much  --  of course , he 'll do it . O'RILEY We 'll see . CAIRN Yes , we will see . O'RILEY Him and his house is too solid on their legs to be after turnin ' ' round for a girl 's notions . ( Bridget goes out R. , slamming the door . Mona slips into a chair at R. of table , puzzled and thoughtful . After a moment , Dennis comes quietly in  --  standing above her at table . ) O'MALLEY Does the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAIRN ( Turning to look up at him  --  her elbows on the table ) No  --  no  --  no  --  it does n't  --  not a bit . Not a bit . I love this old house  --  but it has such great possibilities , I just thought I 'd like to do a very few simple things . But , of course , Uncle Dennis , everything I suggest I mean to do with my own money . That 's understood . Is n't it ? Is n't it ? p. 46 O'MALLEY That 's absurd . CAIRN Now  --  O'MALLEY Absolutely absurd and impossible . Your money is to be spent on your education and travel , and  --  and that sort of thing . If I ca n't make the house tidy and liveable for you , then I am a duffer . CAIRN Oh , I 'm sorry I said anything about the house . It 's lovely just this way . We wo n't touch it for a while , anyway . O'MALLEY Oh , yes , we will  --  and you 're right about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for it down there . Patrick and I will get at it early in the morning , and I 'll  --  CAIRN You ? O'MALLEY Me . It will be a grand excuse for digging , and digging is the finest exercise in the world for a man who sits in the house all day . CAIRN Yes , I suppose it is . And then you 'll have to play tennis with me a lot . O'MALLEY We need the court . ' Twill draw the young people . Not that they 'll need any attracting , now  --  more than flies to the honey  --  but you should have it . That 's sure . CAIRN But not if it  --  p. 47 O'MALLEY And , Mona , I 've been  --  I do n't want you to think you 're here and settled down now forever . There 's a precious little here to interest a girl . I want you to know you 're free to stay or to go  --  free as the air you breathe . CAIRN Why do you say that to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 've always said that nothing on earth could make you give me up . O'MALLEY Sure , that 's God 's truth , but that do n't mean you 're tied down here in this quiet little spot in Ireland , with all the rest of the big world callin ' to you . You 'll be wanting a husband soon now , and marrying men are scarce as hen 's teeth here . CAIRN Do n't be silly . You talk like a match-making mother . O'MALLEY It 's that I am  --  a match-makin ' father  --  and it 's looking out for you I mean to be . CAIRN ( Rising and laughing ) This is the funniest thing I ever heard . And what if I refuse to leave you ? What if I decide to be an old maid and stay here forever and keep house for you , and boss you so you ca n't call your soul your own ? O'MALLEY The saints preserve me . CAIRN ( Going to the stairs ) I 'm going to make myself nice for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seized with a terror for fear I will go some day . That 's what you deserve . ( She starts up the stairs and Dennis goes to his desk ) Paddy Whack  --  p. 48 O'MALLEY Yes ? ( She stops half-way up the stairs , leaning on the balustrade . Dennis , sitting below at his desk , turns sideways  --  looking up at her . ) CAIRN What did Margaret Flinn mean when she said you had to send me away to school to get rid of me ? O'MALLEY ( After a pause ) Margaret did n't say that . CAIRN Oh , yes , she did . To me  --  just now  --  here . O'MALLEY Margaret 's a truthful , sensible woman . You misunderstood her . CAIRN No , I  --  O'MALLEY Women express themselves so peculiarly sometimes , it takes a lawyer to make out what they mean . CAIRN Those plain words could n't mean anything else  --  and she said them . O'MALLEY She was dreaming , then . CAIRN Was she dreaming when she said you were her closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is . CAIRN Closest  --  she said . p. 49 O'MALLEY Did she , now ? CAIRN ( Leaning as far as she can over the rail ) Look at me , Paddy Whack . Do you like her better than you do me ? O'MALLEY Tush , child . Sure , it 's a different kind of liking entirely . Everybody has his own place . Let every herring hang by its own tail ! CAIRN ( Slowly ) I do n't  --  like Margaret Flinn . O'MALLEY ( Rising and going to the railing ) Of course you do . You 'll appreciate her more when you 're older . She 'll be a good friend to you . I want the two of you to be friends . CAIRN Why ? O'MALLEY Because you need just such a woman near you . CAIRN I do n't need anybody near me but you . Is anybody in the world nearer to you than I am ? O'MALLEY Of course not . Of course not  --  I 'm your father . CAIRN Um  --  father 's kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care much for it . Just how do you feel towards me , Uncle Dennis ? O'MALLEY ( Leaning back on the railing , his face turned away from Mona ) I feel that I want you to know all joy and happiness , to suffer enough to know what great joy means . I want you to love much and to have the love of a good man  --  that children may lie in your arms . I want you to live so that Ireland will be the better for your living  --  and I want to be such a father  --  such a friend to you that you will know my love is satisfied in your happiness . Do you understand ? p. 50 CAIRN Perhaps . ( She goes on slowly up the stairs , and Dennis goes back to his desk as the CURTAIN FALLS. ) @x Time : Two months later . An afternoon in August . Place : A corner in Dennis O'Malley 's garden . At Curtain : Mona and Lawrie come in from the trees at left . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racquets down , they sit on the old bench at L. ) LAWRIE That 's the best set we 've had this summer . You are a corker , Mona , and you look so ripping when you play . What 's the matter , got something in your eye ? Let me take it out . CAIRN No  --  it 's all right now  --  thanks . LAWRIE ( Throwing an arm about her shoulder ) Let me see . CAIRN ( Moving away from him ) No  --  no ! It 's all right , I say . Do n't , Lawrie , please  --  I do n't like it . LAWRIE You never let me touch you . CAIRN Why should I ? LAWRIE Why should n't you ? CAIRN I do n't like it . LAWRIE Well , you need n't be quite so stand-offish . You 've got to promise me now that you will come for the week-end . Oh , Mona , do  --  please say you 'll come . p. 52 CAIRN You 're awfully good , Lawrie , but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two years . I should think you  --  CAIRN That 's just why I do n't want to go away any  --  LAWRIE But you 've been home two months now . You 're not going to spend the rest of your life staying at home with Uncle Dennis  --  are you ? CAIRN ( With a brogue ) I am that . LAWRIE I think you might come , for my sake . I go back to town next month and you have n't ever stayed with us even a whole day . Dad and mother both dote on you . Why wo n't you come , Mona ? CAIRN I 've told you , Lawrie . LAWRIE That 's not the reason . It 's because you do n't want to be with me so much . Do you get tired of me ? CAIRN Do n't be silly . LAWRIE Well , do you ? Answer me ! CAIRN No , I do n't . Would I see you every day if I did ? You 've made my summer awfully jolly , Lawrie  --  perfectly splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 53 LAWRIE ( Seizing her arm and kissing her wrist ) I 'll die without you . Sometimes I think I 'll chuck the law and stay here looking after the farms for dad . Would you like that , Mona  --  if I did ? CAIRN No , I would n't . I do n't like a man who chucks anything he 's undertaken . Look at Paddy Whack  --  what he 's done . LAWRIE But would you like me to  --  to  --  be  --  here  --  near you ? Would you like that ? CAIRN No , I would n't if you were neglecting something . LAWRIE Hang it , Mona  --  I mean , do you care anything for me ? I 'm mad about you . You know that . CAIRN Oh , Lawrie , do n't . LAWRIE You do care a little bit , do n't you ? I 'll do anything on earth to get you . You 've got to marry me , Mona . ( She has risen and gone to center . He follows , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't . What are you saying ? LAWRIE Marry me next Spring , Mona . Wo n't you ? You do like me  --  do n't you ? CAIRN I wo n't if you keep on like this . ( She backs away from him. ) p. 54 LAWRIE I 've got to tell you . Why should n't I ? CAIRN Lawrie , I 've only known you two months . LAWRIE What of that ? CAIRN And we 're only friends . LAWRIE I was daffy about you the minute I saw you . CAIRN Oh , no , you were n't . You like me , and I like you . I like you a lot . LAWRIE Then  --  CAIRN No , do n't ! I like you well enough to want you to get over this so we can be good friends . LAWRIE Slush ! You talk like a book . CAIRN Promise me you 'll drop it and we 'll be the best pals in the world . LAWRIE Kiss me and I wo n't say anything for a week . CAIRN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . CAIRN You may just kiss my hand and that will be a bargain . LAWRIE ( Snatching her hand ) That will be a bargain for two days . ( He kisses her hand , then catching her quickly , kisses her lips. ) p. 55 CAIRN ( Freeing herself ) How could you ! I hate you ! ( She sees Dennis , who has come on from the trees at the R. , and , hesitating a moment , rushes by him and off at R. ) O'MALLEY ( Having watched her off and looking closely at Lawrie ) What does this mean ? LAWRIE It was perfectly all right . O'MALLEY She did n't seem to think so . LAWRIE Oh , it was all right . O'MALLEY I do n't agree with you . Answer me . What does it mean ? LAWRIE You need n't speak to me like that . O'MALLEY I 'll speak a little stronger in a minute . What have you to say ? LAWRIE I  --  do n't see why I should n't kiss her . I 've asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she does n't seem to have given you the right to kiss her . LAWRIE Oh , all girls act that way at first . O'MALLEY Do they ? You 've had great experience , then . p. 56 LAWRIE No , I have n't . I never asked a girl to marry me before . Never ! I mean it . I 'm in earnest . I said I 'd like to marry her , and I meant it . O'MALLEY I see no reason on earth why you should n't mean it , and be on your knees with gratitude to God that she even let you ask her  --  whether she takes you or not . LAWRIE Well , that 's putting it pretty strongly , but as I say , I mean it  --  every word . She 's a girl I 'll be proud to marry without a penny . O'MALLEY Indeed ! And what about the young lady ? Would she be proud to marry you without a penny ? LAWRIE What do you mean ? O'MALLEY Aside from the fortune which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of her yourself , and insure her protection and comfort by your own ability ? Can you give her a love so great that you 'd give up the whole world for her  --  if necessary ? LAWRIE I do n't see why that should ever be necessary , but I 'm in love with her , and I think she is with me . O'MALLEY You think she is . LAWRIE Yes . O'MALLEY But you do n't know it ? p. 57 LAWRIE Well , of course , she  --  she 's rather  --  I think she will be . O'MALLEY I see . Then it seems to me our conversation is a little one-sided . You 've got something more to do than merely asking her to marry you . LAWRIE Oh , I  --  O'MALLEY You take it very lightly  --  asking a woman to put her life in your hands  --  to trust you  --  give the greatest things in the world to you . When you know more , you 'll be more afraid of it , and you 'll wonder how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good to her . O'MALLEY Faith , that 's easily said  --  and as easy to forget . ( Going to Lawrie ) I 'd rather strike you down dead now than to think you 'd ever give her a day 's sorrow . Her heart is a tender , beautiful thing that does n't know itself yet . Do n't go after it as though you had a right to it because you 've the luck to be young and good-looking and rich  --  but win her with unselfishness and understanding , till you 're both sure there is that between you that does n't depend on youth and money and beauty , but can live a long life without it . Go at it that way and you have my good will . ( Dennis puts out his hand and Lawrie takes it , as Margaret walks along the street at back , and comes down the steps into the garden. ) p. 58 FLINN , MISS Good afternoon  --  both of you . O'MALLEY Hello , Margaret . How are you to-day ? LAWRIE How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper he has brought out with him ) Sit down in all your glory . You 're looking very grand to-day , Margaret . FLINN , MISS Thank you . ( Sitting carefully in the broken chair ) Is this safe ? O'MALLEY Treat it gently , Margaret . It has upheld us well with its broken legs  --  these many years . FLINN , MISS Where 's Mona ? O'MALLEY She 's somewhere about . FLINN , MISS ( Smiling at Lawrie ) Not far off when Lawrie 's near , eh ? O'RILEY ( Coming on from L. ) Is it out here you do be wanting your tea ? O'MALLEY Yes , please , Bridget , if it is n't too much trouble . O'RILEY Sure , ai n't it destroying myself I am , taking trouble to please you and me making no complaint ? p. 59 O'MALLEY Sure , and it 's that grateful I am , Bridgy . Tell Miss Mona Miss Flinn is here . LAWRIE I 'll fetch her . ( He goes out L. ) O'RILEY I do n't know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? O'RILEY Just now it is I seen her flying up the steps with red cheeks and snapping eyes , like she 'd hit anybody that got in her way . I do n't know if he has the power in his tongue to get her down . ( She goes off L. ) FLINN , MISS What 's up ? I saw you talking very seriously to Lawrie as I came along . Are things coming to a crisis ? O'MALLEY ( Strolling restlessly about ) Faith , what things ? FLINN , MISS Dennis , you amuse me . Why do you pretend to ignore what 's as plain as the nose on your face ? The whole county 's talking about it  --  why should n't you ? O'MALLEY It does n't take much to make the whole county talk . FLINN , MISS They 've had quite enough to make anybody talk . Has n't the boy been here every day since Mona came ? You ca n't expect anybody as important as Lawrie Linnering to do that and not attract attention . Even you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 60 O'MALLEY And what do they say ? FLINN , MISS Why , naturally , they say that if it comes to a match , it will be the most wonderful thing that could happen to Mona . O'MALLEY Do they ? FLINN , MISS They do . O'MALLEY And what do they say about the wonderfulness of it for the boy ? FLINN , MISS Oh , well  --  you ca n't expect people to look at it as you do , Dennis . But they 're very nice , I must say  --  very gracious towards Mona . Every one says she 's a sweet , pretty girl , and will do very well for him . O'MALLEY ( With sudden anger ) He is n't fit to touch the grass her feet walk over . FLINN , MISS Oh , Dennis  --  O'MALLEY It 's God 's truth . What has he done to deserve her ? Mona Cairn 's got far better blood in her veins than ever ran through a Linnering . FLINN , MISS That 's all very well , Dennis . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see that side of it . He has everything to offer her , and for this to have come so quickly out of a clear sky is  --  well , it 's too good to be true  --  that 's all . I 'm so glad for you , I do n't know how to say it . p. 61 O'MALLEY For the love of heaven , why are you glad for me ? FLINN , MISS It settles the whole difficult question so marvelously . It 's the greatest luck that little Mona , without a background of any kind , should fall into a thing like this . O'MALLEY ( Jealously ) That 's what you think , is it ? Let me tell you , she has n't jumped at his offer so quickly as the rest of you seem to have done . FLINN , MISS He has made an offer , then ? How splendid ! O'MALLEY There 's nothing splendid about it . He 'll have to work to get her . She wo n't fall into his arms for the asking . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'll have to eat very humble pie before he gets back in her good graces . FLINN , MISS For goodness ' sake , Dennis ! You 're not going to be mad enough to take this attitude and encourage her in spunk and highhandedness till she ruins the whole thing ? O'MALLEY We have no right to be even talking about it . It 's Mona 's affair , you know . She 'll do as she pleases with it . FLINN , MISS Surely you can talk to me about it , Dennis . p. 62 O'MALLEY ( Going to her ) Forgive me , Margaret . You  --  you know what it would mean to me to have Mona marry the wrong man . I ca n't take this seriously , yet . FLINN , MISS ( Putting her hand on his arm ) But , Dennis , you would n't do anything in the world to stop it  --  would you ?  --  A wonderful chance like this for her ? O'MALLEY Wonderful ! Wonderful ! I do n't know that it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , you know it . And you 're proud of it down in your heart , only you wo n't admit it . O'MALLEY Proud , the devil ! What do I care for what he 's got to give her , if he is n't worth her love ? FLINN , MISS ( Very quietly ) Dennis  --  do n't be selfish in this . O'MALLEY Do you think I am ? FLINN , MISS It would be a horrible thing for you to keep Mona from  --  marrying someone else  --  because you  --  did n't want to give her up yourself . O'MALLEY Do n't . FLINN , MISS I know you 're not capable of it . You 're too fine , too  --  p. 63 O'MALLEY I 'm not fine . I 'm a selfish beast . You know it as well as I ! I ca n't deceive myself any longer . I sent her away , trying to fool myself into thinking it would be  --  different when she got back  --  but it 's harder than ever . I love her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the only thing in the world for me  --  it shuts out everything else and it 's got me . It 's got me  --  in spite of my fight . As she grew from a child to a girl , I tried to make myself believe it would always be a father 's love . When she grew from a girl to a woman , I still tried  --  believe me , Margaret , I have fought it with all my strength  --  but I 'm beaten . Do n't think I 'll ever let so much as a selfish thought come between me and her happiness . ( He controls himself and turns away . ) I know this is a fine marriage for her  --  if she loves him . Do n't think for a minute I 'm a blind fool about myself  --  my years and my poverty . FLINN , MISS Your poverty  --  that 's the point , Dennis . What are you going to do about the money you pretend is Mona 's ? The Squire will be wanting a settlement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Squire 's always looking out for the money . He 's hard pressed enough , dear knows  --  with the idle fox-hunting life he leads . p. 64 O'MALLEY Do you  --  do you  --  think he 'll demand a settlement , then ? FLINN , MISS Of course he will . Any man would . What are you going to do about it ? O'MALLEY God knows . FLINN , MISS You 're caught in the net you 've been weaving for yourself all these years . Did n't you know this would come some time ? O'MALLEY I  --  I  --  I always thought I 'd have time to save some money before Mona was old enough to marry . FLINN , MISS A nice mess you 've let yourself in for  --  letting it be understood that the girl has an independent little fortune . Why on earth did you ever do it , Dennis ? O'MALLEY Sure , I drifted into it . I never meant to lie about it . When she began to grow up and ask for this and that , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ' t was her own money she was spending . It made her more comfortable , and I liked her pride . FLINN , MISS Liked her pride ! You wo n't like it much when she finds out you 've deceived her and she has n't a cent to her name . O'MALLEY She  --  she must never find it out . p. 65 FLINN , MISS How are you going to prevent it  --  I 'd like to know ? The Squire will ask what she has  --  the very first thing . O'MALLEY ( Helplessly ) Do you think he will , now ? FLINN , MISS To be sure he will . What will you do if he refuses to let Lawrie marry Mona when he knows she has no money ? O'MALLEY Good Lord ! Do you suppose he 'd do a low thing like that ? FLINN , MISS ' T would be a natural thing . Just because you put no value on money is no reason why other people should n't . O'MALLEY ( More and more wretched ) ' T would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it would  --  any girl . Now what are you going to do ? O'MALLEY I  --  I  --  she  --  she may not take him , you know . FLINN , MISS Do n't hope for that . It 's your duty to do everything in the world you can to encourage it  --  to bring it about . O'MALLEY See here . I 'm on a case now for the Squire for a good fee . That will do for a first payment down and I 'll make the Squire understand that Mona 's money is invested so she ca n't touch it  --  but gets so much a year interest . I can make enough to pay that yearly  --  and , of course , she gets this place and all I have , in the end  --  and I 'll be laying up all I can in the meantime . p. 66 FLINN , MISS And living like a beggar yourself . And what if the Squire demands to know what her property is , and where the money comes from ? You have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work , which will mean no more than promising the air to the Squire . O'MALLEY Sure , Margaret , you take a very bad view of it , you do . FLINN , MISS I 'm only talking common sense , and you 're up in the clouds . O'MALLEY Faith , it 's the clouds I wish we could live in  --  with no rent to pay . I never thought to get into a corner like this . Poor little Mona  --  poor child ! FLINN , MISS Poor Mona ! Fiddlesticks ! Poor you ! I do n't really see what you 're going to do , Dennis . I really do n't . O'MALLEY ( Standing C. , looking out over the wall ) ' T is a devil of a hole I 'm in . I can see that plain enough  --  but how to get out I do n't seem to see at all . ( After a moment , Michael comes along the street from the L. , leading a goose by a string . ) MICHAEL ( Coming to the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a fine goose this day ? p. 67 O'MALLEY Does she lay golden eggs ? MICHAEL She do that  --  six a day . O'MALLEY I wonder you to be willing to part with her . MICHAEL ( Sitting on the wall , his legs hanging over into the garden side ) Sure , that I never would , but this day do be Granny 's birthday  --  and it 's food and presents I 'd be after giving her . O'MALLEY How old is Granny ? MICHAEL A hundred an ' ten she be this day . O'MALLEY She be doing well . Last time I saw her she was 96 . Bridget , would you like to buy the goose that lays the golden eggs ? ( As Bridget comes from the L. with the tea-tray . ) O'RILEY Not from the likes o ' that . Sure , I 'd know a poor goose it would be  --  with a deadly disease . ( Lawrie and Mona follow , one carrying a plate of cakes ,  --  one bread . ) FLINN , MISS How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new pattern of lace . Such a pretty one . ( Opening her small silk bag. ) p. 68 CAIRN ( Who is disposed to be aloof ) That 's nice . FLINN , MISS Shall I pour the tea for you ? CAIRN No , thank you . I 'll do it myself . ( Lawrie pulls a chair above the table for Mona ) Uncle Dennis , you promised you 'd come home for some tennis , and you never did it . O'MALLEY I 'm only just this few minutes through work . CAIRN That 's what you always say . Do you know what you have to do for your broken promise ? O'MALLEY What , then ? CAIRN Get up at five o'clock to-morrow morning and play a set with me . We 'll have coffee out here first . It will be sweet here that time in the morning . O'RILEY Sure , ' twill be a sweet time to be dragging a hard-working man out of his bed . FLINN , MISS Do n't think of such a thing , Dennis . CAIRN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not ? O'MALLEY I will that . ( Michael has thrown himself on his back by the wall , and kicking his heels in the air has been whistling an old Irish love song . Dennis nods his head towards Michael for the others to listen ) That 's what I went to sleep on in my cradle . ( Dennis begins to whistle , then to sing softly  --  Michael whistling the accompaniment . There is a pause as the song dies away. ) p. 69 GRANNY ( Coming in sight on the street at left ) Michael ! Michael ! Do n't you be hearing me ? Where are you at all ? Devil take you , and me trampin ' the road for you . ( Coming upon Michael , she raises her stick to him , taking the goose string away from him . Michael rolls off the wall into the garden . ) O'RILEY Look at that , now . Get out of this . GRANNY I 'll beat the head off you when it 's home you are . ( Seeing Dennis ) God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . O'MALLEY How are you , Granny ? GRANNY The holy virgin 's blessin ' on you  --  and you after gettin ' my cow back . Sure , it 's good luck I had since my eye rested on you that day . ( Crossing herself ) Is it a few pennies you 'd be givin ' me for more prayers for your soul ? Sure , ' t is a long prayer I 'll be after makin ' , and me a hundred years old this day . FLINN , MISS Why do you encourage her to talk , Dennis ? O'MALLEY That 's the one thing in life she does n't seem to need  --  encouragement to talk . p. 70 CAIRN Do you think it really is her birthday ? MICHAEL Sure it is . O'MALLEY Why not ? One day is as good as another for her birthday . Take her in , Bridget , and give her a drop of tea , and we 'll buy the goose . O'RILEY That I will not with the filth of her , and you giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael . ( Michael climbs the wall quickly . ) GRANNY ( Threatening him with her stick ) ' T is the curse of my life you are , you brat , you ! I 'll break the back off you , I will . O'RILEY Let them be going on now . CAIRN Oh , no . GRANNY ( To Michael ) Is it no money at all you 're after getting and me destroying myself working the day and the night to keep you ? MICHAEL ( Shouting in her ear ) Tea . Is it tea you want ? It 's tea they 're after giving you . Come down . GRANNY The holy saints be praised . It 's a good man you are , Your Honor . ( Bobbing to Dennis. ) p. 71 O'MALLEY Bring her down , Michael . MICHAEL ( Shouting again ) Quit your bobbing and come down , he says . FLINN , MISS What a brawl ! The whole town can hear it . ( Michael brings Granny down the steps , picking the goose up under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is not the first time they do be hearing and seeing an old woman in Ireland . FLINN , MISS Dennis , you only encourage begging and tramping this way . You ought to send them about their business . O'RILEY Sure , ' t is a poor old woman she is . Mind she do n't fall . Ca n't you give her a hand at all , you young goat ? ( Michael gets Granny down the steps . ) Come along now , and do n't be all day movin ' with her . ( Bridget goes off L. with the goose . ) GRANNY ( Insisting on talking to Dennis as Michael drags her about ) May you marry the woman you love and never know want . May there always be the light of love in her eye for you , and may your two hands have the power to light the hearth and keep bread on the board for her and her children . Sure , it 's old I am and destroyed entirely with the work and the starvin ' , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and know a man 's love  --  and the face of a child in my heart . ( She goes off , still talking  --  Michael following , turning a hand-spring. ) p. 72 O'MALLEY ( After a pause ) Who knows what there is in that old heart ? CAIRN ( Who has already given Margaret her tea ) This is for you , Paddy . O'MALLEY Lawrie has n't any . CAIRN But this is yours . ( Dennis goes to get the tea . ) FLINN , MISS On the principle of age first , I suppose , Dennis . O'MALLEY I suppose so . LAWRIE On the principle of wanting Mr. O'Malley to be first in everything  --  rather . CAIRN Exactly . FLINN , MISS That 's only Mona 's pose for your benefit , Lawrie . CAIRN What ? LAWRIE Oh , I do n't flatter myself to that extent . CAIRN Pose is a very funny word to use . You must all know by this time that I think Uncle Dennis is the most wonderful man in the world  --  the best-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MISS Of course you do . A girl always feels that way towards her father . p. 73 CAIRN Oh , father your granny ! He is n't my father , and I 'd feel just as I do even if he did n't belong to me at all and I 'd just met him . FLINN , MISS That 's impossible , dear child . CAIRN ( With quick anger ) Why is it impossible ? And why do you always call me a child ? I 'm not , you know . I 'm a woman , and I know what I think and feel and want , and I  --  O'MALLEY ( Going to the table with his cup ) Sure , that 's more than many a woman knows , and many a man , for that . If you know what you want , Mona , get it  --  take it , and do n't let anybody persuade you to take anything else . CAIRN I do n't mean to . O'MALLEY It 's another cup of tea Margaret 's wanting . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hope to please a woman . LAWRIE You 're modest , Mr. O'Malley . My dad was saying the other day that a certain lady in this town has been waiting years for you to ask her . A lady with plenty of money , which you  --  O'MALLEY ( Dropping his cup and saucer with a crash on the table ) Look at that , now . Your news has put me all of a tremble , Lawrie . Sure , ' t is the first time I 've heard of the mysterious lady . Is it another cup you can give me , Mona , after my awkwardness ? Who 's this but the Squire himself ? p. 74 LAWRIE I did n't know dad was in town this afternoon . Hello , Dad . What you doing in town ? SQUIRE ( Coming from the L. along the street ) It 's yourself , O'Malley , I want to see . I went to your new office , but the door was locked . What have you got it for if you do n't intend to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come down . Come down and have tea . SQUIRE ( Coming heavily and carefully down the steps ) I 've had my tea , thank you , but I 'd like a few minutes with you . Good afternoon , ladies . How are you ? Mona , we 're expecting you tomorrow for the week-end without fail . You 'll let her come , Dennis ? O'MALLEY Of course , of course . CAIRN ( Rising to shake hands with the Squire ) You 're awfully good , but I  --  SQUIRE No buts , young lady . We wo n't take no for an answer . Come along , Dennis . It 's late . I 've no time to be wasting here with the fair sex , though God knows nothing would suit me better . When are you going home , Lawrie ? You ca n't be here all the time . Give her eyes a rest from you . Come along , Dennis . ( The Squire goes off L. ) p. 75 O'MALLEY You 'd better say you 'll go , Mona . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right you should . Do n't you think you 'd better , now ? ( Dennis follows the Squire . ) LAWRIE Well , I 'm off . I 'm coming in for you to-morrow morning , and if you do n't come mother and dad will be everlastingly offended . Bye-bye . FLINN , MISS Good-bye . CAIRN Bye . ( Lawrie runs up the steps and off L. ) FLINN , MISS You will go , of course , dear , wo n't you ? CAIRN No , I do n't think I will . FLINN , MISS ( Going on with her crocheting ) Do n't you want this pattern ? Come and look at it . CAIRN ( Going listlessly to Margaret , and dragging a chair with her ) I 'm sick of lace . FLINN , MISS Do n't say that . This is just the time for you to make it . This is for you  --  I shall make twenty yards . CAIRN For me ? FLINN , MISS For you , dear . p. 76 CAIRN Oh , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must let me give you this for your trousseau . CAIRN For my what ? FLINN , MISS ( Putting a hand over Mona 's ) I congratulate you , dear girl , with all my heart . I 'm very , very glad for you . CAIRN ( Drawing her hand away ) I do n't know what you mean . FLINN , MISS Oh , pardon me . I 'm extremely sorry if you think I have presumed . I thought I was a near enough friend to wish you joy . CAIRN But I do n't know what you 're talking about . FLINN , MISS That seems rather strange when Dennis has just told me . CAIRN Told you what ? FLINN , MISS That Lawrie has made you an offer , of course . CAIRN Did Uncle Dennis tell you that ? FLINN , MISS He did . CAIRN I do n't see how he could . FLINN , MISS Well , naturally , he would tell me . I 'm sorry that you feel that I am so far away from you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't that . I mean  --  what did Uncle Dennis say ? FLINN , MISS ( Going on with her work ) Oh , he says it 's your affair entirely  --  he wants you to be happy , and he realizes it 's a wonderful match for you . CAIRN Did he say that ? FLINN , MISS I do n't remember his exact words . Naturally , we 're all very pleased and proud that little Mona should make such a brilliant marriage  --  and so quickly , too  --  without dragging on here for years . CAIRN Dragging on here ? Why should n't I stay here ? FLINN , MISS Well  --  dear  --  I only mean that Dennis will never be able to do very much for you , and this is a happy , beautiful solution of the matter for both you and him . It seems like a special dispensation from heaven . You 're a very lucky girl , Mona . Of course , you realize that . CAIRN I 'm not lucky , and it 's not a special dispensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like being discussed and having my affairs arranged for me , and I 'll never forgive Uncle Dennis for telling you . As for dragging on here , I 'll live here forever if I choose , and you need n't be always inferring that I 'm a burden to Uncle Dennis , and that he ca n't do much for me , and all that sort of thing . I 'm not a burden  --  and you know it . I have my own money , and you know it . It 's not much , but it makes me independent . You try to make me miserable  --  you 're trying to get rid of me  --  because you  --  you do n't want any one else near Uncle Dennis  --  you 're jealous , and I  --  p. 78 FLINN , MISS ( Rising ) How dare you say that to me ! How dare you ! CAIRN I 'm not a burden to him . Why should you keep on telling me that ? You 're only trying to get rid of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you know what 's good for you , you 'll get engaged to this boy in a hurry , and marry him as soon as you can . That 's the only thing in the world for you to do to make things right for yourself and every one concerned . ( Margaret , trembling with anger and outraged dignity , sweeps past Mona and up the garden steps , and off the R. Mona stares after her . ) SQUIRE ( Off L. ) Lady Duveen knows herself I 'm right . Sure , it 's no case at all she has . ( Mona runs off lower L. as the Squire and Dennis come on above the trees . ) O'MALLEY How does it come you did n't take this up during Lord Duveen 's lifetime ? He was a fighter . You never could have won it with him alive . That 's the answer  --  eh ? SQUIRE Not at all  --  not at all . We were good friends . It drifted along . I want the land for Lawrie . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife before I know it . Do you know if there 's anything serious between him and Mona ? p. 79 O'MALLEY I  --  I  --  I do n't think so . SQUIRE You do n't ? Well , faith , I hope there is . I 'd sooner he took Mona than any girl I know . O'MALLEY They  --  they 're very  --  young yet , do n't you think  --  to be thinking of marrying ? SQUIRE Not at all . Let ' em grow up together . They get over the first years of hell easier when they 're young and do n't know any better . I 'll set Lawrie up  --  and it 's some money she has of her own , of course . O'MALLEY She  --  she  --  she  --  it 's not a large fortune . SQUIRE It 's money in hand Lawrie needs . It 's land poor we are . I 'm willing he should take her  --  if he wants her . O'MALLEY If she wants him  --  you mean . SQUIRE Eh ? You 're as testy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like . When are you going to close this case and bring it to the boil ? O'MALLEY What you tell me to-day puts a different light on it . I do n't like the looks of it . SQUIRE And I do n't give a tinker 's damn whether you do or not . That 's not the point . Will you get on with the case , I say ? What do you mean quibbling and backing and filling like this ? Sure , it 's myself that 's paying you . Not the other side . Do n't forget that . p. 80 O'MALLEY The best thing we can do , Squire , is to call it off . SQUIRE What ? You young upstart , you ! What do you  --  Now , Dennis , my boy , do n't be touchy because I 'm pushing you on a bit . Sure , I 'm old enough to be your father  --  ca n't I speak my own mind about my own affairs ? O'MALLEY Certainly you can , and I 'll do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop good friends . SQUIRE Do n't be a damned young fool standing on false pride that never made a dollar for any man . See here . I 'll double the fee . O'MALLEY No  --  no , thank you . I withdraw . Get someone else to go on with it . SQUIRE You ca n't do that . I wo n't have your impertinence . You forget who it is you 're dealing with . O'MALLEY Oh , no , I do n't , and that 's just why I want to stop here . I ca n't go on with it . SQUIRE Sure , ' t is as straight and clean a case as ever was brought into court , and even if it was n't , what business is it of yours to be quarreling with your bread and butter ?

I like you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Listen . I 'll put another  --  I 'll  --  a thousand pounds I 'll make it if you go on with it , and two thousand if you win . O'MALLEY No . SQUIRE Two thousand pounds , I 'm telling you . Do you hear ? My hand on it . O'MALLEY No . SQUIRE And why not , you blaggard ? You ca n't do a thing like that . How can you refuse to take an honest case ? O'MALLEY It 's not honest , Squire . ( The Squire raises his stick . Dennis puts his hand on it and slowly lowers it . ) Not as I see it . That 's all . Let 's not say things we 'll be sorry for . SQUIRE I 'll drive you out of the county . I 'll brand you as a sneak . Is it going over to the other side you are ? That 's it . She 's paying you more , is she ? O'MALLEY That will do . If this thing was n't crooked , you would n't be trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing as I 've ever been asked to do , and I wash my hands of it . I would n't touch it for all the money you could pile up . p. 82 SQUIRE You do n't need money , then ? You 've no use for it at all ? O'MALLEY Faith , I need it more than I ever needed it in my life . SQUIRE Then for the love of heaven , why do n't you take it ? O'MALLEY I 've told you . SQUIRE No wonder you stay poor , you white-livered  --  O'MALLEY Do n't take her land , Squire . Do n't disgrace Ireland with it . It 's Duveen land as sure as you 're standing there . Do n't take it . Do n't do it . You 'll be glad some day you have less money in the bank and more peace in your soul . SQUIRE What do you think I am  --  to be listening to you ? You 've done for yourself this day , O'Malley  --  in this county . That 's sure . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps as Mr. and Mrs. McGinnis come along the street from the L. The Squire brushes them aside with his stick as he strides off . Mr. McGinnis is extremely tall , and thin , and stooped . His clothes hang limply on him , and he drags himself along with a shambling gate , smoking a briar pipe . Mrs. McGinniss is very short , and thin , and wiry , with the jerky spryness of a cricket . She trots after McGinnis , chirping cheerfully. ) p. 83 MCGINNIS , MRS . Here 's himself in his garden now , McGinnis , and us after going to the town . Sure , ' t is good luck we have finding you it is  --  and not to have to be keepin ' this money all night in the house . Do n't be going down them steps , McGinnis , and you with one eye and that one crooked . Sure , ' t is over the wall ye can be handin ' the money to his honor . Good evening , Your Honor , and a finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inside pocket it is , McGinnis . McGinnis carries the money , he do , Your Honor . It 's himself that 's the head of the house , it is . Let me be after helping you . ( Going to McGinnis , who has stopped at the top of the steps . She unbuttons his coat and gets out the money  --  counting it carefully out of the old stocking ) And it 's the last payment , it is , Your Honor  --  on the horse . If ever the O'Dowds ask for another penny , may they be struck dead in their sin . ( She leans over the wall and gives the money to Dennis . ) Sure , it was a sad day for us that ever we had dealin 's with the like of them  --  putting the law on us . But I must say for you , Mr. O'Malley , I must say you 're a gentleman  --  if you are a lawyer , and you 've been no more disagreeable than your trade demanded . O'MALLEY Thank you , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been paid me. p. 84 MCGINNIS , MRS . Do you now ? Do you hear that , McGinnis ? Do you hear that ? MCGINNIS , MR . I ai n't deaf , am I ? MCGINNIS , MRS . Sometimes I think you are  --  you 're that dumb  --  and these the only words he 's after speaking this day , Mr. O'Malley . MCGINNIS , MR . Why should I be wastin ' breath talkin ' , Your Honor , and herself always takin ' the words out of my mouth ? O'MALLEY For no reason at all that I can see , McGinnis . MCGINNIS , MRS . Sure , if I did n't take ' em out , they 'd never come out with the silence on you . Come along now , it 's a long walk we 've got before us . O'MALLEY I 'll deliver your money , and I congratulate you both at being so soon out of debt . MCGINNIS , MRS . Thank you , Your Honor  --  thank you . O'MALLEY A fine sunset you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact  --  that is a fact . Did you see it , McGinnis  --  the fine sunset his honor sees ? MCGINNIS , MR . Sure , I can see as well as his honor . p. 85 MCGINNIS , MRS . Maybe so . Maybe so . But it 's bad manners it is to be saying it . Good evening , Your Honor . Good evening . O'MALLEY Good evening , Mrs. McGinnis . Good evening , McGinnis . MCGINNIS , MRS . ( As she goes off L. ) Ca n't you be sayin ' good evening to his honor ? MCGINNIS , MR . ( Shambling after her ) Ai n't it twice yourself said it ? ( Dennis goes down for the newspaper as Granny comes on from the L. , followed by Michael , who is playing his pipe softly . ) GRANNY It 's keepin ' the goose she is , and you 're to be payin ' for it , she says . O'MALLEY How much is it ? GRANNY You 're to do it , she says . O'MALLEY ( Shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'MALLEY ( To Michael ) Can you make her hear ? MICHAEL ( Going to shout in her ear ) How much do you want for it  --  he says . p. 86 GRANNY What will you give , Your Honor ? O'MALLEY That 's no way to sell a goose . What 's her price ? MICHAEL ( Shouting to Granny ) What 's your price ? GRANNY It 's a poor old woman I am , and that 's the finest goose I ever had . I 'm parting with it for your sake . There 's not another man in Ireland I 'd be after sellin ' it to . MICHAEL It 's never stoppin ' she 'll be . O'MALLEY ' T is a sharp bargain you 're driving , Granny  --  and me helpless before your charms . Take this and be off . ( Giving her some money . ) GRANNY ( Counting and curtseying ) God love you . ' T is a decent man you are , Your Honor . A gentleman . May you live to be rolling in gold and ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Michael , pushing Granny by the shoulders , starts her up the steps . She protesting as she goes . Michael drops his pipe on the grass when he takes hold of her , and as Granny reaches the road and starts to the L. , he goes back for his pipe. ) p. 87 GRANNY Good night , Your Honor , ' t is a thousand times obliged to you I am for what you done this day . Good night . God rest your soul . A lucky love to you . Sure , there 's nothing alive in the world but love . ( She goes off , mumbling . ) O'MALLEY ( As Michael picks up his pipe ) You 're sure I 'll get the golden eggs , Michael ? MICHAEL As big as that . ( Making a large ring with his fingers ) I seen ' em . But you must wish every day or you wo n't . O'MALLEY What must I do when I wish ? MICHAEL You must spit first and stand on your head and count ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the egg at your feet . O'MALLEY Wonderful , I call that . MICHAEL ( Halfway up the steps ) Sure , you can get anything if you wish like that . O'MALLEY Does it always come true ? MICHAEL Of course . O'MALLEY What do you sometimes wish ? MICHAEL My best wish is going to the moon . p. 88 O'MALLEY How do you go ? MICHAEL I shut my eyes and play my pipe and a little white cloud comes and lifts me up , and I sail and sail till I come to the moon . O'MALLEY And what is it like when you get there ? MICHAEL It 's like what you want it to be . O'MALLEY Oh ! Is the lady in the moon very beautiful ? MICHAEL She do be the most beautifulest that ever was in the land . O'MALLEY And what is she like ? MICHAEL She do be like what you want her to be . O'MALLEY What is yours like ? MICHAEL It 's guns and swords and horses and knives she has , and she do give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . She 's afraid , and I cut his head off and throw it away . I throw it way over into England , and it falls on a soldier and kills him , and more soldiers run out and I shoot ' em all , way down in England , while I 'm standing on the moon and the lady claps her hands . O'MALLEY What does your lady look like ? MICHAEL Oh , she 's little and scared . She 's terrible scared till I get there . p. 89 O'MALLEY Show me how to find my lady in the moon . Show me how to make dreams come true . MICHAEL Shut your eyes and wish . Are they tight shut ? O'MALLEY Tight . MICHAEL Ca n't you see my fingers ? O'MALLEY Nary a finger . MICHAEL Spit and count ten and listen . Now what does your lady look like ? O'MALLEY ( With his eyes shut and his head thrown back ) She is fair and sweet and tender , with hair as soft as the down of the thistle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluest pool . Her voice is like heavenly music . ( Michael plays a strain . ) MICHAEL She 's speaking to you . O'MALLEY What does she say ? MICHAEL She do be saying  --  what is it you want to say to her ? O'MALLEY I want you to be happy , dear . That 's the only thing in the world that matters . MICHAEL She hears you . ( He plays a strain. ) p. 90 O'MALLEY ( Singing softly to the same strain ) My lady of the moon  --  you 're the lady of my dreams  --  I shall love you always  --  true  --  with a prayer in my soul for you . MICHAEL She hears you . I seen ' er . Keep on wishin ' and she 'll come to you . ( He plays the strain in answer , and strolls slowly off L. along the road , as Mona comes on from the L. into the garden . ) O'MALLEY Oh !  --  is it coming again you are ? CAIRN Did you tell Margaret that Lawrie had asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I did . CAIRN How did you know he had ? O'MALLEY Faith , he told me so . CAIRN Did you  --  talk to him about it ? O'MALLEY Of course I did . Who else would talk to him  --  if not myself ? CAIRN You  --  what did you say to him ? O'MALLEY I told him he had my good will  --  if you  --  loved him . p. 91 CAIRN Oh  --  you did  --  and you  --  think it 's a great  --  marriage for me  --  and you told Margaret before you ever mentioned it to me ? O'MALLEY Why , Mona , dear child  --  it  --  it just happened to come  --  the talk with Lawrie brought it about . CAIRN How could you ! How could you tell Margaret before you spoke to me ? O'MALLEY Mona , dearest  --  she  --  Margaret is interested in your welfare . She was very glad . She thinks it will be a fine thing for you . CAIRN And do you ? Do you want me to marry him ? O'MALLEY If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to marry him  --  do you ? O'MALLEY Faith , there 's no ought about it . I 'm not  --  I 'm not as wise in the affairs of the world as Margaret . She thinks it 's a great match for you  --  and I suppose it is . Of course it is . I  --  I  --  I suppose I could n't wish for anything more ,  --  though Heaven knows I want the best in the land for you . CAIRN You want me to make a good marriage , do you ? Is that what you 've counted on ? p. 92 O'MALLEY I 've counted on nothing but your own happiness . That 's all there is to be considered entirely . CAIRN But  --  but  --  would n't you miss me  --  a little , Paddy Whack ? O'MALLEY ( Trying to be brave ) Oh  --  I  --  I  --  faith , I 've learned how to get on without you  --  these two years . CAIRN But it would be  --  forever . O'MALLEY Oh , no  --  you  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seeing you often . CAIRN But who 'd keep house for you ? O'MALLEY Bridget 's good for many a year yet . CAIRN But she ca n't do it as I can . O'MALLEY Faith , a man alone do n't need the daintiness that you require . I would n't expect it . Bridget makes me very comfortable . CAIRN But  --  but  --  if you  --  want me  --  just  --  a little bit  --  I  --  I 'll stay . O'MALLEY Is it the selfish old bachelor you think me  --  wanting you to give up your young life to me here  --  with love and hope and the end of the rainbow waiting for you out there ? A beast I 'd be to be shutting you in with this old garden wall . p. 93 CAIRN Has n't it meant anything to you  --  at all  --  to have me with you , Paddy ? O'MALLEY Meant anything ? Has n't it meant life itself ? Has n't it made living worth while ? Has n't it made the skies bluer and the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be living on the joy you 've given me these years I 've had you . CAIRN Then why do you want me to go ? O'MALLEY It 's yourself I 'm thinking of . Life is before you . You 've got to take it , Mona , in both your hands and make it . I would n't hold you back so much as with a thread . CAIRN And will  --  you  --  be living alone  --  forever  --  with just Bridget ? O'MALLEY Eh ? CAIRN Wo n't you  --  ever marry , yourself ? O'MALLEY Well  --  now  --  why not ? A good idea that  --  is n't it ? CAIRN Have you ever  --  thought of it ? O'MALLEY ( Turning away from her ) When I 'm foolish enought to  --  let myself think  --  I sometimes have dreamed of what it  --  might be . All men build foolish castles in the air , Mona , dear  --  but we live on the earth . p. 94 CAIRN Oh , then  --  you have been in love . Are you  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . CAIRN If you wish me to  --  I 'll marry Lawrie in the Spring  --  and you 'll be free . ( He turns to her , but she is gone . Michael 's pipe is heard playing the same strain and he is seen strolling along the road at back behind the second hedge . The sunset deepens . Dennis stands alone . ) CURTAIN @x Time : Two days later . Sunday afternoon . Scene : Same as Act I. The furniture is covered with charming bright chintz slip covers and the windows hung with the same over fresh , white muslin curtains . A large pot of ferns is in the fireplace and a bowl of wild flowers on the table , another on the desk . The furniture somewhat differently placed in the room . At Curtain : Mona , in a very fetching muslin frock , is sitting by the window trying to read , but is evidently bored and restless . After a moment , Bridget comes down the stairs . She has made some attempt at a Sunday toilet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reaches the last step ) Why would you be moping in the house of a Sunday afternoon ? CAIRN I hate Sunday afternoon . O'RILEY Sure , that 's a black sin , it is . CAIRN Everything in the world that 's wrong seems ten times more so Sunday afternoons . O'RILEY ' T is your own fault , sittin ' here alone . Why would n't you be goin ' out to the Grange yesterday for to stay and them wild for to have you ? CAIRN I did n't want to . p. 96 O'RILEY Do n't be cursin ' the day then for your own contrariness . ( Bridget crosses to door R. ) CAIRN Bridgy . O'RILEY What is it , then ? CAIRN ( Lowering her voice ) Do you think Uncle Dennis will marry Margaret Flinn ? O'RILEY Sure he will . CAIRN What makes you sure ? O'RILEY Ai n't she a woman and her hook baited fer him these ten years ? He 's naught but a poor , squirming fish of a man  --  of course she 'll get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis is too strong a man to let a woman catch him unless he loved her . O'RILEY Faith , I 'm not sayin ' he do n't love her . CAIRN Oh  --  do you think he does ? O'RILEY Why would n't he ? Love her  --  and she with a tidy little fortune , and no one in God 's world to spend it on but herself ? CAIRN He would n't marry for money . p. 97 O'RILEY I 'm not saying that either  --  but the money 's handy thrown in . Sure , she 's a comely-lookin ' woman enough , and that genteel ' t would give you a stitch in your back . She would n't be my choice , but  --  CAIRN Who would be your choice , Bridget ? O'RILEY She would n't be my choice for myself , I mean . But for himself  --  yes , I 'd pick her . CAIRN I do n't see why he should marry anybody . O'RILEY What else is he to do ? He ca n't live alone when he do be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely he 's going to do . CAIRN What do you know about it ? O'RILEY Sure , ai n't I got eyes in my head and ears on the side of it ? And the whole town knowin ' it . CAIRN The whole town knows nothing about it and you can just tell that to everybody you see . I may marry him  --  but they did n't know it at all . O'RILEY It 's a good piece of business then you 're doing , if that 's what you 're goin ' to do . CAIRN Why is it so good ? O'RILEY ' T is a good thing to be gettin ' into a home of your own and not be mussin ' up other people 's houses with fal-di-lals like these . ( Indicating the chintz and curtains. ) p. 98 CAIRN Oh , I mean to have a great many more new things . O'RILEY ( Off guard in her anger ) And where is the money to come from ? That 's what I want to know . Sure , it 's ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with my own money , of course . ( Bridget manages to hold her tongue with difficulty . ) That 's a small matter . I sha n't let Uncle Dennis spend a cent . O'RILEY Faith , the spendin ' will soon have to stop . CAIRN I 'm going to do a great deal more , and change a great many other things . O'RILEY And if you do , you 'll do it alone . You wo n't have me lookin ' fer dirt that 's never there and turning things wrong side out that 's never been disturbed before . Airing beds that 's aired enough for the Queen to sleep on till it 's nearly crazy with it I am . You 'll not have me doin ' it . CAIRN Just as you like . There are plenty more for the place , Bridget . I shall manage my own house in my own way , and it 's going to be done right . So if you do n't want to do it , someone else will . O'RILEY It ai n't my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , it is . O'RILEY No one on God 's earth could take care of Mr. O'Malley but myself . CAIRN I 'm taking care of him . I only want a strong servant to carry out my instructions  --  nothing else . O'RILEY Holy Father , you wo n't be here long . Mr. O'Malley and me must put up with it a little while . CAIRN ( Fighting back her tears ) I 'll be here a very long time , perhaps . We wo n't discuss that . Whether it 's two days or a thousand years , I shall have things as I see fit . Not another word , Bridget . It 's not your place to speak to me as you 've been doing . I suppose you do n't know any better . You 've never been trained , but if you want to stay in my service , you must be respectful . That 's one of the first things I require . That 's all now . You may go . ( Bridget , almost struck dumb with amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may go , I say . ( After a pause of wonder , Bridget turns and goes out R. , not knowing what else to do . Mona sits again trying to read , wiping the tears away . Finally she pitches the book towards the stairs just as Dennis comes in C. , the book striking him. ) p. 100 CAIRN I beg your pardon , my book slipped . O'MALLEY ( Picking up the book and giving it to Mona , looking at the title as he does so ) I see ! " Love Letters of a Beautiful Woman "  --  that 's a very slippery book . ( Mona opens the book without answering . Dennis goes to his desk , putting more letters on it ) It 's a lonely afternoon you have . CAIRN Oh , no  --  not at all . I like a quiet Sunday afternoon . I have so few of them . O'MALLEY I 'm afraid they 're bitterly disappointed at the Grange that you did n't go . CAIRN ( Turning a page ) I dare say . O'MALLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the kitchen . I sent her out of this room . ( Dennis looks at her in quiet surprise . ) The little while I am here she must obey me . O'MALLEY Quite right . Though the effort may kill Bridgey . CAIRN I shall probably be married in the spring . O'MALLEY I see . p. 101 CAIRN ( With an elaborate sigh ) It will be a long winter . O'MALLEY ( After a pause ) Would you like to go back to Dublin for the winter ? That would n't be so dull for you . CAIRN Where  --  where could I stay ? I 've finished school . O'MALLEY Oh , we 'd find a proper place for you  --  with a chaperon  --  so that you could see Lawrie . If you see a great deal of him , you 'll be still more sure by spring that you want to marry him . CAIRN Oh , I 'm sure now , but Dublin would be very nice . I would go to the theatre and hear music and give parties . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . I could afford that , of course , on my income , could n't I ? O'MALLEY Eh ? Oh  --  yes  --  oh , yes  --  I  --  I think you could . CAIRN Of course , you 'll never let me overdraw or spend too much  --  will you ? O'MALLEY No  --  oh  --  no . I would n't do that . No , I would n't do that . CAIRN Your friend , Margaret Flinn , and your servant , Bridget Riley , are always implying that I 'm extravagant and spend too much . p. 102 O'MALLEY Are they now ? CAIRN I ca n't see that that 's anybody 's business but my own  --  is it  --  how much I spend  --  so long as you do n't let me overdraw . I wo n't spend a cent of your money , Uncle Dennis . You know that , do n't you ? O'MALLEY Oh , yes  --  oh , yes  --  certainly . I know that . CAIRN Do you want me to go to Dublin ? O'MALLEY I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAIRN When would you like me to go ? O'MALLEY It 's all in your hands . CAIRN I 'll go any time you say . ( She goes to put the book on the table . ) O'MALLEY Are you  --  quite happy , Mona ? CAIRN Very  --  of course . Why do you say that ? O'MALLEY Somehow you have n't seemed quite yourself yesterday and to-day . There 's a shadow in your eyes . Have I done anything to displease you ? CAIRN Oh , no . O'MALLEY You 're sure , now ? I 'm a clumsy , awkward fellow . How can I tell what a girl wants any more than  --  than the wind that blows ? p. 103 CAIRN Why should n't I be happy ? O'MALLEY I see no reason at all why you should n't . This ought to be the golden time of your whole life , Mona . A great love only comes once , and you must live in the glory of it and be glad for every minute of it . CAIRN Have  --  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? O'MALLEY Only  --  once . CAIRN And  --  is it  --  a great love ? O'MALLEY Very great . CAIRN Why have n't you ever told me about it ? O'MALLEY I  --  you  --  it  --  sure , ' t is not the kind of thing I can talk about . CAIRN ( Going close to him ) Not even  --  to me ? O'MALLEY Not  --  even  --  to you . CAIRN How much do you love her  --  just tell me that ? O'MALLEY So much that if cutting my heart out would make her happy , ' t would be done . So much that when she smiles the world is bright for me , and when she 's sad I 'm the most miserable man alive . p. 104 CAIRN That does n't seem like you at all , and I think it 's very silly to love anyone that way . She must be a nasty , selfish pig to let you be unhappy . O'MALLEY Oh , no  --  oh , no . She 's an angel . CAIRN She is not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the open outer door , followed by Lawrie . ) SQUIRE Take Mona into the garden , Lawrie . I want to speak to Mr. O'Malley . LAWRIE Will you come ? CAIRN ( Shrugging one shoulder ) I will . ( She goes out C. , Lawrie following . ) SQUIRE The boy tells me he 's already asked the girl to marry him . O'MALLEY I believe so . SQUIRE That stopped me yesterday in the move I was about to make against you . Before the affair goes any further between them , I want to know about her property ! O'MALLEY Eh ? SQUIRE What has she got ? O'MALLEY What is that ? p. 105 SQUIRE I 'm asking you what it is . O'MALLEY Yes  --  oh , yes  --  to be sure . SQUIRE What 's the matter with you ? Do n't you understand what I 'm saying to you ? How is her money invested , and what has she at all ? O'MALLEY Wo n't you sit down , Squire ? SQUIRE It 's a small matter whether I sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better it is to sit when we talk . A man is more  --  is  --  sure  --  ' t is better he can think it is . SQUIRE ( Sitting ) It do n't need much thinking , does it  --  to state a plain fact like that . What is her money in ? O'MALLEY What is it in ? Sure , ' t is in  --  ' t is in  --  SQUIRE You stammer and hesitate like you did n't think I had a right to ask you . Is that it ? O'MALLEY Oh  --  no  --  oh , no  --  no . SQUIRE Then why do n't you tell it ? ' T is only natural that I should come to you now . O'MALLEY Only natural  --  yes . Yes  --  that is a fact . It 's perfectly natural that you should come . How did you come in to-day , Squire ? p. 106 SQUIRE How did I come in ? Behind my horses , of course . Is it daft you are ? Stick to the point . How much money has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's this way . Now this is the way it is . As I was saying , you see , Squire , the fact is  --  how much did you think she had ? SQUIRE Think ? What do I know about it ? Nothing at all . I 'm here to find out . Sure , it 's queer you 're acting . O'MALLEY Not at all . I 'm going to explain . Now , of course , if it 's a very large fortune you 're expecting , I 'll have to disappoint you . SQUIRE I 've said nothing about the size of it . What is it , is what I want to know . O'MALLEY Yes  --  yes  --  exactly . I understand you , Squire . SQUIRE Begorrah , then you do n't act like it . Look here , what 's the matter with her fortune ? Where is it , I say ? O'MALLEY Well , Squire  --  I  --  it needs a little explaining . I ca n't exactly lay my hands on it just now . Not just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Well  --  ' t is invested . p. 107 SQUIRE And how ? That 's what I 'm after asking you . Damn you  --  how ? O'MALLEY I  --  you see . How  --  you say ? SQUIRE ( Rising ) Do n't be playing cat and mouse with me . Once more I ask you , how much money has she , and where is it ? O'MALLEY You  --  you 'll  --  I do n't like talking business on Sunday . To-morrow when you come in town  --  to-morrow I 'll explain it all to you . SQUIRE What do you take me for ? A spring gosling ? Have you spent her fortune ? Is that it ? O'MALLEY Spent it ? Well  --  yes  --  she has  --  I let her spend it . SQUIRE She ? What has she been doing with it ? Living here like a mouse and two short years at a young lady 's seminary . Have you made way with it yourself that you ca n't account for it ? Is it a thief you are ? O'MALLEY Squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? It 's every chance I 'm giving you , and you not able to answer me . ' T was high words you were using to me about crookedness and honesty a short time ago . High words . Sure , I can turn them back to you . You ca n't account for her money . Where is it ? What have you done with it ? How will you get yourself out of this ? How will you prove your boasted honesty now , my man ? p. 108 O'MALLEY Listen , Squire . ' T is a very unusual case , it is . You could n't doubt my word of honor when I tell you that  --  that when I tell you she  --  sure , a few days I 'll put it all clear to you . I can make a first payment if you like . The rest you 'll have to be satisfied to get in annual interest . SQUIRE Interest ? And where does the interest come from ? O'MALLEY From  --  from  --  her investments . SQUIRE And what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after tellin ' you in a day or so . SQUIRE Look here , Dennis . ' T is in a bad way you are . There 's something wrong . Listen to me . You go on with my case , and win it for me , and we 'll say nothing at all about Mona 's money . I 'll set it aside , I will . If you keep quiet about the Duveen land  --  I 'll overlook this . Is it a bargain ? O'MALLEY It is not . SQUIRE Be careful , now . I 'm giving you the chance to square yourself . O'MALLEY I do n't want your chance . SQUIRE You need it . You 're caught . I 've got you just where I want you . I 'll give you twentyfour hours to think it over . p. 109 O'MALLEY No , you wo n't . I wo n't touch your case nor your money . SQUIRE Right in my hand I 've got you . You win for me and I can afford to forget the fortune . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAIRN ( Coming in from the garden , followed by Lawrie ) I 'm going out to the Grange for tea , Uncle Dennis . Lawrie will bring me back early . ( She runs quickly up the stairs . ) SQUIRE Well  --  does she say she 'll have you ? LAWRIE I  --  I think she will . I  --  I think we 'll be married in the spring . SQUIRE It only depends on one thing whether you will or not . LAWRIE What do you mean ? You told me  --  SQUIRE It only depends on Mr. O'Malley here . I give my consent and blessing ; I 'd be as willing to see you marry Mona as any girl in Ireland . LAWRIE ( Going to Dennis ) You told me I had your good will if Mona loved me . She  --  she was different to-day . I believe she will care for me . I think she will marry me . What 's to hinder ? What 's the matter ? p. 110 O'MALLEY You  --  SQUIRE Sure , there 's nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her break her heart for you . He 'll give his consent all right . ' T is a good talk we 've had . We 'll have our final settlement to-morrow . LAWRIE ( To Dennis ) You 're not going to raise any objection , I hope , Mr. O'Malley ? O'MALLEY Your father is interested in the money end of it . Would it  --  would it make any difference to you  --  if  --  if Mona had no money ? SQUIRE That 's a silly question to put to a bridegroom  --  and not a fair one . Of course , it would make a difference . O'MALLEY ( To Lawrie ) I asked you . LAWRIE Well  --  I  --  what do you expect me to say ? What Mona has will be welcome , of course . O'MALLEY If she had none  --  I said . LAWRIE But why suppose that  --  when she has ? We ca n't live on just love , you know . It 's lucky she has it  --  that 's all . O'MALLEY You mean she must have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SQUIRE But I do  --  and what I say is the answer . Come along ( He goes out . ) LAWRIE Good-bye , Mr. O'Malley  --  oh  --  wo n't you come , too ? O'MALLEY No , thank you . LAWRIE Wish you would . O'MALLEY I have work to do here . CAIRN Bye-bye  --  I wo n't be long . ( Going back to him ) If  --  if  --  you 'll be  --  the least bit lonely  --  and would like me to stay at home for tea  --  with you  --  I will  --  Paddy . O'MALLEY No  --  no  --  no . I would n't have you do that for the world . ' T is too busy I 'll be for tea , anyway . ( She turns slowly and goes to the door . ) CAIRN Come on , Lawrie . ( She goes out without looking at Dennis . ) LAWRIE ( He follows Mona out ) Good-bye . O'RILEY ( Throwing open the kitchen door ) It 's myself has been insulted . p. 112 O'MALLEY What 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  never to set foot in it again . O'MALLEY What 's the matter with you ? O'RILEY Me to be here forty years and to be told now I do n't know my place and that anybody else at all will do as well as me . Do you think it 's one hour I 'd be staying in the house  --  after that ? And me a self-respecting woman ? It 's going I am . Nothing  --  nothing you could say can stop me . O'MALLEY I wo n't stop you , Bridget . But think it over . Take a little walk and think it over . If you come back of the same mind in half an hour  --  we must part , I suppose . O'RILEY ( Going up the stairs ) I 've no need to think it over . Half an hour will pack my duds , it will . Not another day will I stay where I 'm not wanted  --  and a young upstart trying to teach me what I 've known all my life and she 'll never know herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bridget Riley  --  every rib of my hair is rising  --  ( She goes through the door on the landing  --  slamming it after her . ) ( Dennis stands alone a moment  --  then , with a heavy sigh , starts to his desk as O'Dowd looks in at the outer door. ) p. 113 O'DOWD , MR . Could we come in , Your Honor ? O'DOWD , MRS . ( Pushing O'Dowd in before her ) Good day , Your Honor . Sure , ' t is too important it is entirely to be waiting till Monday morning it is to see you . Do you mind this bein ' the holy Sabbath ? O'MALLEY What 's the trouble ? I gave you the last of the McGinnis ' money for the horse yesterday . What 's wrong now ? O'DOWD , MRS . It 's this way , Your Honor . O'DOWD , MR . Can you stop makin ' the blather long enough fer a man to state the case , Mother ? O'DOWD , MRS . State it then , till I see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MR . It 's this way , Your Honor . O'DOWD , MRS . Sure , I said that . O'DOWD , MR . ( Raising his voice to ignore Mrs. O'Dowd ) It 's this way , I say . O'MALLEY Yes  --  I understand you so far . O'DOWD , MRS . Sure , it 's laughing at you his honor is , O'Dowd . Get on with it  --  get on . p. 114 O'DOWD , MR . I ask you , Your Honor , ai n't the tongue of a woman the greatest curse ever put on man ? O'MALLEY Well  --  as you were saying . O'DOWD , MR . It 's this way . O'DOWD , MRS . For the love of heaven ! O'DOWD , MR . The money you did get for us  --  there 's no denying that , Your Honor . The money you have got out o ' them by the force of the law  --  but that 's not the end of the trouble yet . There 's more to follow . O'DOWD , MRS . Come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on needles and pins I am . O'DOWD , MR . ' T would be an excellent good thing it would if you swallowed them and died . O'DOWD , MRS . And his honor would never be after knowin ' what it is you 're tryin ' to tell at all . O'MALLEY Will you tell it , Mrs. O'Dowd ? O'DOWD , MRS . It 's this way , it is . O'DOWD , MR . Hold your tongue . The McGinnisses between ' em have killt the horse . O'MALLEY What ? O'DOWD , MR . This morning it was they came a-runnin ' fer to get the money back . The ignorant fools  --  not to know that a horse once sold is sold . p. 115 O'MALLEY The horse died , you say ! When ? O'DOWD , MR . This morning it was . But they do be saying ' t was yesterday before they paid the last , and they wanted the money back . O'DOWD , MRS . ' T was this morning it died . I swear I seen it going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the matter with it ? O'DOWD , MRS . Sure , why would n't it die and them never givin ' it a decent bite to eat or water to drink ? What way is that to make a horse live ? O'MALLEY The horse was in good condition when you sold it ? MR . AND MRS . O'DOWD ( Together ) Sure , ' t was the finest horse in Ireland . O'DOWD , MRS . I wonder at you to be askin ' that , Your Honor  --  and O'Dowd the honestest man in the town . O'DOWD , MR . What way is that to be comin ' to me for the money back and they after killin ' the horse ? MCGINNIS , MRS . ( Hopping in from the C. door ) Sure , Your Honor , the horse is after dyin ' on us . After dyin ' on us it is , what way is that to sell a horse and us decent God-fearing people ? Ai n't it a sin , Your Honor ? p. 116 MCGINNIS , MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes on their necks this day . I hope that 's what you 'll do , Your Honor . MCGINNIS , MRS . Sure , nothin ' else is fit for them and the horse dyin ' on me yesterday , while we was comin ' to you to pay the last money . MCGINNIS , MR . Dead he was when we got home . I 'm after askin ' the money back from O'Dowd , I am . It 's no intention I have of buyin ' dead horses . Ai n't that right , Your Honor ? O'MALLEY How was the horse when you bought it , McGinnis ? MCGINNIS , MRS . Sure , ' t was no horse at all , Your Honor . O'MALLEY Why did you buy it , then ? MCGINNIS , MR . ( To Mrs. McGinnis ) Mind what you 're saying . ( To Dennis ) Sure , Your Honor , it was a fine-looking horse enough or I would n't be after buyin ' him  --  but ' t was O'Dowd that lied to me like hell . O'DOWD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tell . ' T was the finest horse in Ireland , it was . MCGINNIS , MRS . Something mysterious there was in the inside of it and we after askin ' all sensible questions about him and they after lying to us. p. 117 MCGINNIS , MR . Sure ' t is the money back I have to have . Ai n't that right , Your Honor , and the beast dyin ' before the last cent was paid ? Sure , do n't that look like foul play ? ( The O'Dowds start again . ) Sure , you ai n't goin ' to be after turning the law again ' me ? O'MALLEY Wait . Wait . Vigilantibus  --  non dormetibus  --  jura submittent . The laws assist those who are vigilant , not those who sleep over their rights . Had you any suspicions about the horse when you bought him , McGinnis ? MCGINNIS , MR . That I had . O'MALLEY Then why did you buy it ? Caveat emptor . Let a purchaser beware . MCGINNIS , MR . What I mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a faint misgiving . MCGINNIS , MRS . Sure , a suspicion is one and the same as a misgivin ' , ca n't you see that , McGinnis ? He do n't mean that at all , Your Honor . What he means to say is this : every kind of a doubt he was having of the horse , but O'Dowd up and lied to him till  --  O'DOWD , MRS . Do n't be believin ' it , Your Honor . Sure , I know you know how honest O'Dowd is . MCGINNIS , MRS . ( To Mrs. O'Dowd ) If ever he has an ounce of the honesty in him before you married him , ' t was you that soon took it out of him . p. 118 O'MALLEY Ladies  --  ladies  --  let 's stick to the point . The situation seems to me to be this  --  ( Opening a book ) By the civil law as observed by S. E. Coke . ( Reading ) " Every man is bound to warrant the thing that he sells or conveys  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law binds him not ; unless there be a warranty  --  either in deed or in law  --  for caveat emptor , qui ignovare non debuit quod jus alienam emi . Let a purchaser who ought not to be ignorant of the amount and nature of the interests which he is about to buy , exercise proper caution . " Caveat emptor  --  I say . O'DOWD , MR . ( Scratching his head ) That may be , Your Honor . O'MALLEY Caveat emptor . And such being the case  --  this is the point in hand to be considered . Whether there has been such a degree of fraud or misrepresentation , such solus dans locum contractier , as will nullify the contract into which the allottee has been induced to enter . Now , McGinnis bought a horse as to the health of which there seems to have been some question  --  likewise the time of its death . O'DOWD , MRS . How could he have health after he went to the McGinnisses and they never giving him a drop of food or drink ? p. 119 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land he had . O'MALLEY Order in the court . ( Getting another book and reading ) " Ex dolo malo non oritur actic . " A right of action can not arise out of fraud . MCGINNIS , MR . Right you are , Your Honor . There 's no denying that . O'MALLEY I , therefore , decide and declare that the only fitting action is this : Since the loss now falls entirely on the one party of the second part , that it be shared by the party of the first part . MCGINNIS , MR . How 's that , Your Honor ? O'MALLEY That it be shared by the party of the first part . O'DOWD , MR . That , Your Honor  --  depends entirely upon which one of us is the party of the first part . O'MALLEY You are , of course . O'DOWD , MR . And how do you make that out , Your Honor ? O'MALLEY You being the owner of the horse , did agree for a certain sum of money to part with said horse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'DOWD , MRS . I do n't see that at all . Why could n't McGinnis be the party of the first part as well as O'Dowd ? Faith , now that I come to think of it , McGinnis himself it was first come to O'Dowd about the horse . To that I can swear . He 's the first part . p. 120 MCGINNIS , MRS . ' T is lying she is entirely . ' T was O'Dowd first come to McGinnis . That makes him the first part . O'MALLEY Your arguments are good , but those terms are differently applied , ladies . You must let it rest that according to law O'Dowd is the party of the first part , and McGinnis the second . No man can dispute that . I , therefore , decide and declare that in order that justice may prevail , that Mr. McGinnis give back the last payment on the horse . ( Mr. and Mrs. McGinnis protest . ) It will be well worth it to your good name , O'Dowd . If you 're known as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you ? If you in all justice and generosity return the last payment to McGinnis in compensation for the accident of the horse 's death , the health of said horse having been in question  --  likewise the time of dying  --  if you return this , I say , Mr. McGinnis , being a fair-minded man , will protect your name from the stigma of fraudulent misrepresentation . O'DOWD , MR . From what , Your Honor ? O'MALLEY From the stigma of fraudulent misrepresentation . Is n't that so , McGinnis ? MCGINNIS , MR . ( Much flattered ) I agree with Your Honor . ( Mr. and Mrs. O'Dowd protest. ) p. 121 O'MALLEY ' T is the only way I see out of what might otherwise cause a very disagreeable odor to be attached to your name , O'Dowd . O'DOWD , MR . What 's that you say would be attached to my name , Your Honor ? O'DOWD , MRS . A dirty smell . The hardest thing in the united kingdom to get rid of once it 's fastened on to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt about that . I understand , Your Honor , ' t is very plain you 're after making it . O'MALLEY You 're old friends and respected citizens . Why not shake hands on it and call it square with a fourth of the money returned . ( The four begin to talk again . Dennis rising ) Remember this : Nihil taun conveniene est naturali equitati quam unum guodque dessolvi eo ligaumme que ligatum est . ( This brings the four to their feet . They stand solemnly  --  looking as wise as possible . ) O'DOWD , MR . ( Scratching his head again ) I guess that 's so , Your Honor . Sure , ' t is a wonderful man you are with the law . O'DOWD , MRS . ( To O'Dowd ) And it 's still a good price you do be gettin ' for a dead horse . p. 122 MCGINNIS , MRS . ( To McGinnis ) And it 's still a powerful sight of work the horse has done for you the while you did be having him . MCGINNIS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . That 's a very becomin ' bonnet you 're wearin ' , Mrs. McGinnis . Is it new it is ? MCGINNIS , MRS . It 's my girl 's after makin ' it entirely  --  plattin ' the straw herself . O'DOWD , MRS . Ai n't that wonderful , now . Sure , ' t is a smart girl like that I wish I had . Do you see it , McGinnis ? O'MALLEY That 's understood , then . A fourth back . Do you happen to have it with you , O'Dowd ? ( O'Dowd hesitates . ) Let 's have done with it before it gets out . ( Dennis goes to desk ) If you 'll just sign these papers the both of you . It 's all over  --  forever . ( McGinnis goes to desk and while he laboriously signs his name , Mrs. O'Dowd persuades O'Dowd to get out the money , which he very grudgingly does . ) O'DOWD , MRS . ( To Mrs. McGinnis when O'Dowd goes to sign ) I seen you at early mass this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you now ? And I seen you , too . It was n't speakin ' I was fer the fear McGinnis would n't like it . Men is that childish in their ways . O'DOWD , MRS . Sure , ' t is the same way myself was feelin ' . O'Dowd do be that touchy . MCGINNIS , MRS . Will you be walkin ' along ? O'DOWD , MRS . Faith , I will that . ( They start to the door . ) MCGINNIS , MRS . Did you hear Father Ignatius is after bein ' bad sick ? O'DOWD , MRS . You do n't say ? Sure , ' t was him I confessed to yesterday . MCGINNIS , MRS . Was it now ? Very badly took , he is . O'DOWD , MRS . Is that a fact ? A holy man he is . MCGINNIS , MRS . He is that . O'DOWD , MRS . That he is . Is it like to die he is ? MCGINNIS , MRS . Oh , I think so . It must be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MRS . It is that . O'DOWD , MRS . Did you hear that , O'Dowd ? The news Mrs. McGinnis is after tellin ' me ? p. 124 O'DOWD , MR . ( Still grouchy ) I did not . O'DOWD , MRS . Come along and it 's after tellin ' you she 'll be . O'DOWD , MR . Sure , it 's myself can get along without her news . It 's stale and dead it 's sure to be . MCGINNIS , MR . Not so dead as a dead horse . O'MALLEY Sure , you must bury your dead horses with the past . You 've no time to be thinking backwards . MCGINNIS , MRS . Right you are , Your Honor . Right you are . Good day and thank you . It 's much obliged we are . O'DOWD , MRS . It 's a good deed you done this holy day , Your Honor . It 's much obliged we are . MCGINNIS , MRS . Speak up , McGinnis , and tell his honor it 's much obliged we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakin ' and leave mine be . O'MALLEY Good day . ( Shaking hands with the men ) Good day . I think we 'll have a shower by night . What do you think ? O'DOWD , MR . Maybe we will and maybe we wo n't . MRS . O'DOWD . AND MRS . MCGINNIS ( As they go out together ) Good day , Your Honor . God bless you . p. 125 O'DOWD , MR . The weather is like the women , undependable entirely . Good day , Your Honor . ( He goes out . ) MCGINNIS , MR . Good day , Your Honor . ( He shambles out after O'Dowd . ) O'RILEY ( Appearing on the landing at the head of the stairs ) Is it alone , you are , Mr. O'Malley ? O'MALLEY I seem to be . O'RILEY Sure , it 's peaceful the house is when you 're that way . O'MALLEY Yes , peaceful as the tomb . Bridgey , do you know anyone who would buy this house ? I want to sell it . O'RILEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell it and sell quick . Can you think of anyone who would be a likely buyer ? O'RILEY ( Coming down ) Is it sick you are ? Sure , you 've worked till it 's out of your head you are , and the foolishness on you . Get into bed and put a cold compress on your head . O'MALLEY Cold compress be damned . Do n't be talking nonsense , Bridget . I 'm going to sell this house , I tell you . p. 126 O'RILEY What 's happened to you at all ? O'MALLEY I need money . O'RILEY Did n't I know it ? Did n't I know this girl would ruin you ? She to be spendin ' your money like water and you saying never a word to stop it . O'MALLEY It is n't that at all . The little she spends has nothing to do with this matter . ' T is a different thing entirely . Bridget , have you ever let fall a word that would make her think she was spending too much ? O'RILEY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a word . Sure , what do you think I am to do the like o ' that ? O'MALLEY Never you hint to her , mind you , that she is n't perfectly independent . O'RILEY Certainly , certainly . Ai n't it as hard as iron I been holdin ' my tongue all these years ? But , holy mother , ai n't I always been afraid of this ? Is it ruined you are entirely ? O'MALLEY I want a certain sum in twenty-four hours . I do n't know just how to get it . O'RILEY There 's only one way  --  and that 's an easy way  --  ready to drop into your hands . O'MALLEY What are you saying ? p. 127 O'RILEY It 's yours for the asking . O'MALLEY What do you mean at all ? O'RILEY Sure , it 's only Miss Margaret Flinn you have to ask for any sum , and it 's yours . O'MALLEY In heaven 's name , what do you mean ? O'RILEY Faith , it 's plain as the nose on your face what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wo n't it all be yours some day ? Why not have some of it now if you do be sore needin ' it ? O'MALLEY Is it ravin ' crazy you are ? Never let me hear you say such a thing again . How on earth did you get such an idea in your head ? Nothing could be wilder nor more impossible . You do great wrong to the lady to think such a thing . O'RILEY Great wrong , is it ? Great honor it is I call it , to think you 'd take her . O'MALLEY Take her ! Take her ! I have no thought of taking her nor she of having me . Stop this talk . It 's wrong and ridiculous , it is . I 'm astonished at you , Bridget  --  you a woman of solid common sense . O'RILEY It 's astonished I am entirely  --  fur as sure as I 'm standing here on this spot before you , I always thought it would come to be that you 'd marry Margaret Flinn . p. 128 O'MALLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  never in this world have I ever dreamed of such a thing . Nor the lady , I 'm sure . There 's no thought of love between us , and never has been , and never will be . O'RILEY ' T is very convincin ' you speak for yourself  --  but as to the lady  --  um . O'MALLEY Stop . That will do , Bridget . You forget yourself . O'RILEY It 's beggin ' your pardon I am  --  but it ca n't be intending to live here alone forever you are . Sure , it ai n't natural at all . With Miss Mona going off and the house like a tomb as you say . She with her noise and her airs and her notions have brightened the old place till you ca n't stand it at all , you ca n't , when she do be gone . ( Dennis sits with his head in his hands . ) She with her fine spirit tellin ' me what it 's to do I am . Sure , with her voice gone , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's got that way with her that makes you fight , and all the time she 's gettin ' into your heart so the thought of her going is like a knife in it . O'MALLEY ( Rising quickly ) Do n't ! Do n't ! Do n't talk any more , Bridget . O'RILEY Is it for her now maybe you 'd be sellin ' the house it is ? p. 129 O'MALLEY Not at all . Not at all . O'RILEY Sacrificing yourself entirely . Is it worth it at all , are you sure ? You must think of yourself sometimes and not always of her . She 's young  --  and selfish  --  she 'll take all you give her as her right , and think nothin ' at all of your loneliness and your need . O'MALLEY ( Turning on Bridget with sudden fire ) That 's not so . If she knew  --  she would n't accept a penny . She 's as proud as a queen  --  as honest as the sunlight , and as generous as  --  Have you lived all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that ? The sweetness of her  --  the look of her is more than anything you 've ever seen or known or ever will again . Do n't be talking about sacrificing for her . If I could lay down my life for her , ' t would be only a little of what she deserved . Do n't be saying idle words about one who is too fine for you to appreciate . ( He snatches his hat and strides out into the garden , leaving Bridget speechless and amazed . ) O'RILEY ( After a moment , taking off her bonnet and carefully folding the strings ) Oh , ho ! Oh , ho ! It 's that way it is . Ai n't I the blind fool ! ( She starts up the stairs ) p. 130 CAIRN ( Coming in from the kitchen , listlessly , taking her hat off ) Take that upstairs , please , Bridget . O'RILEY ( Meekly and respectfully ) Certainly , miss . Sure , ai n't you back before you started ? CAIRN I made them bring me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sensible it was . Faith , it 's not much life in you you seem to have . Is it anything I can get you ? CAIRN ( Throwing herself into a chair ) No , thank you . Where 's Uncle Dennis ? O'RILEY Did n't you see him in the garden ? It 's gone for a turn I think he is  --  to cool off his temper . CAIRN His temper ? O'RILEY Sure , ' t is a man of a very violent temper he is  --  and him raving the while . CAIRN Uncle Dennis ? Why , he has the gentlest nature in the  --  you must have irritated him beyond endurance , Bridget . What did you do ? O'RILEY ' T was not me at all . A great piece of news he 's just after tellin ' me. p. 131 CAIRN News ? O'RILEY About himself and Miss Margaret Flinn ! CAIRN ( Rising  --  tensely ) Is he  --  is he going to marry her ? Is that what he told you ? O'RILEY That would have been no news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry her he is . CAIRN What ? O'RILEY Not at all , he says  --  and never had any intentions of such a thing , with never such a thought in his head , says he , flashing at me as if I do be crazy to think it . CAIRN Are you  --  are you sure ? O'RILEY Ai n't I just after hearing his strong language ? Not if she was the last woman on earth , says he could never look at her , with such a thought . CAIRN Bridget , you 're an old darling ! ( Throwing her arms about Bridget 's neck , Mona gives way to happy , hysterical tears . ) O'RILEY I do n't wonder you to be weepin ' , with the thought of him livin ' his life out here alone , and you to be flyin ' off marrying a gay young man . Is it so much in love with young Linnering you are that you must leave your Uncle Dennis alone ? p. 132 CAIRN I 'll never leave him . Never  --  never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Oh , Bridget , I 'm so happy . ( Kissing Bridget 's cheek , she dances across the room like a child , then stops suddenly , and goes back to her ) But , Bridget  --  he loves  --  somebody  --  he told me so . O'RILEY Did he now ? And was n't he after sayin ' who it was ? CAIRN I took it for granted it was Margaret . Who is it , then ? Who could it be ? He does n't know anyone else . Oh  --  she does n't live here , I suppose . O'RILEY Maybe so now . Do you think it could be for her he needs money and must sell the house ? CAIRN Sell the house ? O'RILEY That 's what he 's tryin ' to do . Mind you , it 's as secret as the grave you must be . He wo n't want you to know it . CAIRN Why not ? O'RILEY ' T is very sensitive he is , not to let you be knowin ' he needs money . CAIRN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have every penny of mine . I 'll make him take it . O'RILEY God love your soul , it 's not a penny you have in the world but what he gives you . p. 133 CAIRN What ? O'RILEY Not a penny . CAIRN Not a penny ? O'RILEY Not a red cent . CAIRN I do n't know what you mean . O'RILEY ' T is plain enough it is . He took you from your father and brought you up as his own , letting you think ' t was a comfortable enough little sum you got from your father  --  to make you independent , and not feelin ' a weight or a trouble you could be to himself . It 's like him . CAIRN I ca n't believe it . I ca n't  --  the Squire has just said to me that he and Uncle Dennis had had a talk about my money . O'RILEY Oh , ho ! So that 's it ! That 's why he do be suffering the agony and wantin ' to sell his house to raise money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  well  --  well  --  ai n't that like him ? It is . CAIRN Oh  --  oh  --  oh ! For me ! Is n't it wonderful ! Is n't it like him ! Bridget , do n't you think he must love me very much  --  to do that ? O'RILEY It do look that way . He loves you like his own child . CAIRN Child ? ( Pause ) Who could the other woman be ? p. 134 O'RILEY Maybe she is dead . Have you thought of that now ? ( Starting up the stairs ) It was only just here he was after saying to me that you do be the finest , sweetest one in the world . CAIRN What ? O'RILEY Is it likely now a man could be feelin ' that way towards two women at the one time ? CAIRN What did he say about me ? O'RILEY What was it now ? That if he could lay down his life for you , ' t would be no more than you deserve . CAIRN Did he ? Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What else ? O'RILEY Ai n't that enough now ? I disremember any more . CAIRN Think . Tell me every word . How did he happen to say it ? O'RILEY Happen ? It just happened , that 's all . CAIRN How did he look ? What did he do when he was saying it ? O'RILEY Sure , he was standing on his two feet like a man . CAIRN But his face ? How did he look ? O'RILEY He looked like himself . How would he be lookin ' ? p. 135 CAIRN Oh , Bridget , you know what I mean . I think you might tell me everything . O'RILEY It 's this I 'll be tellin ' you  --  he spoke the first angry words to me that ever he spoke in all these years I do be seeing him live day by day  --  the first angry words to me because he thought I did n't appreciate you . I do n't think it 's eatin ' his heart out it is for the other woman . ( Bridget disappears up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dashes into the merriest of Irish tunes  --  throwing back her head  --  her face radiant  --  gradually changing to a quiet melody . After a few moments Dennis comes in from the garden , and , taking off his hat , leans on the casement , listening . ) CAIRN ( Calling ) Do you see Uncle Dennis in the garden , Bridget ? O'RILEY ( Calling back after a moment ) I do not . CAIRN I wonder where he could have gone ? O'MALLEY It 's here I am . CAIRN Oh ! You frightened me . Come and sing this , Uncle Dennis  --  please . O'MALLEY It 's a frog I got in my throat in the garden . I could n't sing now . p. 136 CAIRN Please  --  please . It 's the one I like best . O'MALLEY Do n't ask me this evening , darling . I could n't sing . CAIRN Why not ? Are n't you happy because I 'm happy ? O'MALLEY Oh  --  very  --  very . CAIRN Then come and do it . You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . Ca n't you do this  --  just this little thing for me ? Please  --  please . ( She begins to play again and Dennis , going down to her , begins the sad little love song . On the last verse his voice breaks and he turns away to the window . Mona follows him quickly . ) Oh  --  what is it , dear ? What made that little sob ? O'MALLEY Sure , ' t is a cold I 'm after getting from takin ' my hat off in the garden . I 'm too old for that . CAIRN Do n't be silly . You 're the strongest man I know . ( She stands beside him  --  both looking out the window ) The summer 's almost gone . Are n't you sorry ? What will you do all winter  --  when I 'm gone ? O'MALLEY Faith , there are never hours enough in the day for the things there are to do . p. 137 CAIRN And the winter after  --  what will you do ? And after that  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life through ? Why do n't you marry this wonderful woman ? O'MALLEY What wonderful woman ? CAIRN The one you just told me about  --  that you love so much . O'MALLEY Oh  --  oh  --  yes  --  faith , she  --  she 's  --  mar-married already . CAIRN Oh  --  Paddy ! Shocking ! O'MALLEY Or  --  nearly so . ' T is the same thing . CAIRN Why do n't you take her away from the other man ? O'MALLEY She would n't come . CAIRN Have you tried ? O'MALLEY This is no way at all for you to be talking , child . See the leaves on that old tree ? They 'll be soon turning . ( He sighs . ) CAIRN ( With a still heavier sigh ) Oh , yes  --  turning and falling . Life is sad  --  very sad . ( She puts her arm through his and they stand without speaking . Bridget comes carefully down the stairs , tiptoeing heavily into the kitchen and closes the door. ) p. 138 O'MALLEY Bridget thinks we did n't hear her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've hidden lots of things from people  --  do n't we ? When we are n't at all . O'MALLEY ( Turning to look at her ) What 's that you 're saying ? It 's very wise and very mysterious , you sound . CAIRN I am wise . Come and sit down . I must have a very serious talk with you . O'MALLEY What is it then you must talk seriously about ? CAIRN About my money . O'MALLEY ( Rising suddenly as he was about to sit ) I  --  I 'm very busy just now . Could you postpone it a little ? CAIRN Not possibly . O'MALLEY A very important letter I have to get off . CAIRN No  --  sit down , please . This is more important than anything in the world . Now sit still . The Squire told me just now that he had had a talk with you about my dower . O'MALLEY What ? Ca n't he hold his old tongue in his mouth a minute ? CAIRN Why ? p. 139 O'MALLEY Very bad taste it was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , no , I do n't think so at all . He merely said you had had a talk and would have a final settlement to-morrow . O'MALLEY ' T is in very much of a hurry he is with his final settlements . CAIRN Yes , that 's what I think . O'MALLEY Eh ? CAIRN That 's what I want to tell you . I 'm not going to marry Lawrie after all . O'MALLEY What ? CAIRN No . O'MALLEY See here , Mona . The Squire has said something to make you uncomfortable about  --  about your money . Now  --  CAIRN Oh , no , he did n't . O'MALLEY I wo n't have it . You 'll marry Lawrie and your money will be  --  will be  --  will be forthcoming . CAIRN Oh , of course , I know that . I 'm not worrying about my money . I know from what you 've always inferred that I have a good deal . O'MALLEY ( Squirming ) Well , dear  --  I  --  I would n't say that exactly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child  --  but you 're not a pauper by any means  --  and if the Squire has annoyed you  --  p. 140 CAIRN No  --  no  --  he has n't . O'MALLEY I wo n't have it . I wo n't have it . CAIRN But Uncle Dennis , do n't get so excited . That is n't it at all . Listen  --  I 'm not going to marry Lawrie  --  because  --  because I do n't want to . O'MALLEY Were n't you after telling him you would half an hour ago in the garden ? CAIRN Yes . O'MALLEY You ca n't change your mind like that . CAIRN I have n't changed my mind at all . I never really wanted to do it , and now I know I 'm not going to . O'MALLEY I do n't follow your reasoning at all . CAIRN It 's plain enough . I 'm not going to marry him because I do n't want to . That 's positive and that 's settled . Now , are you glad or sorry ? O'MALLEY ( With a great sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you  --  if you 've decided it , I  --  I wo n't force you to do it . If you 've made up your mind  --  why , I suppose I must stand it . I must bear it the best way I can . ( Trying to hide his happiness. ) p. 141 CAIRN Yes , you must . But do n't worry about me . I 'm giving up Lawrie because I want to marry someone else . O'MALLEY What ? CAIRN Yes ! O'MALLEY Who  --  who is it this time ? You ca n't be bobbing about from one to the other like that . CAIRN I 've never bobbed at all . I 've always known which one I wanted . O'MALLEY Then in the name of heaven , why did n't you take him first ? CAIRN He never asked me . O'MALLEY He did n't ! The fool  --  to let another one get you . Why did n't he ask you then , himself ? CAIRN Because he 's poor  --  and proud  --  and too  --  too unselfish and big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way if I could marry a rich man . O'MALLEY But if he knew you wanted him  --  a blithering idiot he was not to wade through fire and water to get you . I 'm afraid he 's a poor , weak thing , Mona . How can it be you have fastened your heart on him ? Sure , it 's too young you are to know your own mind . Who is he ? Who is this other one ? CAIRN He 's someone I 've known a long time . p. 142 O'MALLEY Who  --  who ? CAIRN You  --  you 've seen him  --  at times , but you do n't really know him at all . O'MALLEY In Dublin was it you knew him ? CAIRN I knew him while I was in Dublin , yes  --  but now , Uncle Dennis  --  before I tell him that I will marry him I must be able to tell him just how much money I have . He 's a poor man . O'MALLEY ( With a groan ) Oh  --  could n't you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor indeed , I 'm afraid you ca n't marry him , Mona . CAIRN Why not ? O'MALLEY ' T is  --  ' t is not such a large fortune you have as I 'm afraid you 're thinking . CAIRN But how large ? Just how much is it ? Tell me . I want to know all about it . O'MALLEY You do n't understand business at all , Mona ,  --  but it 's some money you 'll be getting every year . CAIRN Of course , I can understand if you 'll explain it to me . O'MALLEY ( Going to his desk ) It  --  it would take too long . Sure , it 's this whole desk full of papers I 'd have to be reading and expounding to you to make you see just  --  just how it is . Ca n't you be satisfied to know that I can produce you so much a year ? p. 143 CAIRN No  --  I wo n't respect myself unless I know all about my own affairs . I 've put it off too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What papers ? O'MALLEY ( Opening the drawer mechanically ) No woman can read a deed or know any  --  CAIRN Make me understand , then . Come on . Now just how much have I , Uncle Dennis ? O'MALLEY Sometimes you have more and sometimes less . You must send the man to me . Let me see what kind he is before I talk business . CAIRN Oh , no . I must know what I 'm worth before I let him come to you . Now , here  --  what are these ? Securities ? ( Putting her hand in the drawer ) Why , this is nothing but an old receipt . O'MALLEY ( Taking her hands away and shutting the drawer ) Of course . Of course . Of course . A receipt is a very valuable thing . CAIRN But my fortune is n't all in receipts , is it ? O'MALLEY A good part of it is  --  yes . CAIRN How 's that ? O'MALLEY Did n't I tell you it was n't possible for a girl to comprehend at all ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'll explain it all to him  --  all . I want to find out if he 's marrying you for your money it is . If not  --  if he wants you for yourself alone , and is worth you  --  you  --  you 'll have enough to  --  to help him out . p. 144 CAIRN Oh  --  I  --  I begin to believe I have very little . I 'm afraid I 've spent too much  --  going to Dublin and all that . O'MALLEY Oh  --  no  --  oh , no . There 'll be more coming  --  every year . Do n't you be afraid . CAIRN But I am afraid . If I 'm going to marry a poor man , I must begin to economize . I must stay at home this winter and be very careful  --  and make every penny count , and make my own clothes , and learn to be a helpful , prudent wife instead of a thoughtless , extravagant girl . O'MALLEY No  --  I wo n't have you making yourself uncomfortable with fear . CAIRN But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  for him  --  because I love him . Uncle Dennis  --  you would n't be afraid of me , would you ? Would you think I was too silly and spoiled to marry , if  --  if you were the man ? O'MALLEY I 'd think you were an angel from heaven if I were the man . CAIRN But angels from heaven would make very silly wives . Would you believe that I could help him  --  could make a home  --  could be a friend and companion  --  could be strong in trouble and  --  and make him happy ? Could you think that ? p. 145 O'MALLEY That 's only a very little of what I could think . CAIRN Then what will you say to him when he comes to you ? O'MALLEY Faith , I 'll say that if he marries you , ' t is no other blessing he 'll need in his whole life . I 'll tell him he ought to say to you , whether you have money or whether you have not , I 'm the proudest man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart and my hands will be busy and thankful for the joy of taking care of you . CAIRN ( Crying ) I 'll never leave you , Paddy Whack . I 'll never leave you . O'MALLEY It 's sorry for me you are . You 'd be giving up your own happiness rather than leave me alone . Now , mind  --  I wo n't have it . I do n't want you here . I wo n't have it . CAIRN ( Turning away in tears ) Then where shall I go ? Where shall I go if you do n't want me ? O'MALLEY You shall go to the man you love . CAIRN ( Going to Dennis ) I 'm coming . You 're the man I love . O'MALLEY Dear God in heaven , it ca n't be true . It 's only pity you have for me . Mona , look at me . My little Mona  --  grown to a woman . Can it be that I am the man you have chosen for yourself ? Could heaven be as good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't want me . O'MALLEY Listen ! ' T is no money at all you have . I 've deceived you all these years . Can you forgive that ? CAIRN Never ! Never ! Never ! O'MALLEY Then it 's lost you I have after seeing the door of heaven open . Is it a rogue and a rascal you think I am ? CAIRN You 've deceived me . O'MALLEY Was n't I the fool  --  thinking that was the best way to be good to you . Is there anything in the world or the sea or the sky I could do to atone for it , Mona ? Tell me , is there ? CAIRN Nothing but to marry me . O'MALLEY Ah , faith , Mona  --  Mona . I ca n't believe that I hear your words . Say them again , please . CAIRN No  --  you must say it yourself . I 've done it all . O'MALLEY Then it will take the rest of my life to say it in . Each day I 'll be adding one more thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life itself . Sure , there 'll never be words enough in the languages to say it all . And the words will never be beautiful enough to tell you what you are to me . I ca n't make love to you , Mona . You 'll have to guess it . p. 147 CAIRN You 're doing very well . O'MALLEY I 'm too dazed with the wonder of it . Poor Lawrie ! Do you think he 'll fight a duel ? CAIRN Would n't that be lovely ? And you must just scratch his arm a little to show him what a good shot you are , and to show that you 've won me . O'MALLEY And how if while I 'm getting ready to scratch his arm he puts a bullet through my heart ? CAIRN ( Hiding her face on his shoulder ) Do n't ! Do n't ever say that again . O'MALLEY How can I be sure it 's not a terrible mistake you 've made  --  to give up a handsome young thing like that for a sober old one like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking now at all . Go back to where you left off when you were nice . O'MALLEY And what was I saying ? Sure , you must teach me , Mona . How can I please you ? What can I ever do that will be worth the marvelous creature you are ? CAIRN There 's just one thing I 'd like you to do . O'MALLEY Tell it , quick . CAIRN You 'll think it 's silly . p. 148 O'MALLEY Never . CAIRN Yes , you will . You may not want to do it . O'MALLEY Is it cutting my head off ? Only say the word . CAIRN It 's something you may think much harder than that . O'MALLEY Do n't keep me in suspense , but let me be doing it . CAIRN It 's something I  --  I 've always wanted  --  since  --  oh , since I was eighteen . And this will be my last chance . Oh , I 'm afraid you wo n't . O'MALLEY Do n't torture me . What is it ? CAIRN It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask me to marry you . O'MALLEY ( Kneeling ) Faith , it 's on my knees before you I 've always been . I 'm never any other way than this . ( Holding both her hands ) I thought you were going to ask me to fly up the chimney or something hard . Mona , dearest  --  my sweetheart  --  my life  --  will you marry me ? CAIRN Oh , say a little more . Suppose I would n't  --  what would you do ? O'MALLEY It 's right here at your feet I 'd die then . p. 149 CAIRN Oh , you 're splendid ! You 're a perfectly beautiful lover , Uncle Dennis . Oh , I 'm not going to call you Uncle any more . Wait  --  listen  --  ( Taking a deep breath ) Dennis ! Does n't that sound nice ? O'MALLEY ' T is the sweetest sound that ever fell from mortal lips . ( He kisses both her hands as Bridget comes from the kitchen . ) O'RILEY God save us ! O'MALLEY Bridget  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give us your blessing ? O'RILEY I will that . May the blessed Virgin preserve you  --  forever . O'MALLEY Thank you . CAIRN We 'll have tea now , Bridget . O'RILEY Certainly , ma'am . CAIRN With the best china  --  and toast , Bridget . Nice and hot and crispy and brown on both sides . O'RILEY Certainly  --  certainly . Is there anything else you would like ? Sure , the occasion is worth the gooseberry jam . CAIRN Yum  --  yum ! p. 150 O'MALLEY And do n't you think it 's worth a bottle of wine , Bridgey ? O'RILEY That 's for you to say , sir . CAIRN What , ho ! Bring on the wine , Bridget . O'RILEY ( Going out ) Certainly , ma'am . O'MALLEY What have you done to Bridgey ? Is it a miracle that 's happened ? CAIRN Yes . The day 's been full of miracles . Sit here  --  ( Putting him beside the table ) I 've poured your tea for you so often sitting here  --  but this time will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too marvelous to see you there . It 's as though I 'd never seen you there before . O'MALLEY Do I have to stay here ? Could n't I come a little closer ? ( Moving his chair ) And would n't that make it still more marvelous ? CAIRN Just a little . There , we must be dignified . O'MALLEY Do n't make me be that . Sure , it 's after spending my life I am being dignified . Let me forget , Mona  --  let me forget everything but the glory of you sitting here  --  my wife . p. 151 CAIRN Say it again . O'MALLEY My wife . My wife . ' T is a poor way of wooing you I have  --  but oh , Mona . I love you enough to make up for that . ( He kisses her hand again . ) CAIRN Whist ! Here comes Bridget . ( They both sit stiffly erect as Bridget opens the door , and THE CURTAIN FALLS ( END OF PLAY. )           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
