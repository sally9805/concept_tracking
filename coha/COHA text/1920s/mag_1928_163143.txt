Backed by many a rich man , the Anti-Saloon League fostered Prohibition . Backed by a few libertarians , the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment was founded to alter Prohibition . Last winter the A. A. P. A. announced that it would expand and grow potent under the leadership of a new chief , Major Henry Hastings Curran of Manhattan ( TIME , Jan. 23 ) . <P> Major Curran was selected for the administrative talent he had shown as Borough President of Manhattan ( 1920-21 ) and U. S. Commissioner of Immigration at Ellis Island ( 1923-26 ) . Another recommendation was Major Curran 's standing and acquaintance among tycoons of finance &; industry . The frank object was to enlist for anti-Prohibition a roster of wealth and respectability comparable to what was recruited to " put over " Prohibition .
