 | THE title of this article is a statement of opinion , not a claim to omniscience . What mortal can appraise a living creature ? Which of the 18,000 or more existing kinds of birds that gladden every land and sea can be called most valuable , and upon what criteria ? Excluding from the reckoning domestic poultry of all sorts , as well as the stork , which , wherever European tradition holds sway , is saddled with the responsibility for our very existence , we may cast about almost at random and might consider , for example , the swallows , which spend their clays in ridding the air of insects that in one way or another are detrimental to the growth of vegetation . With less satisfaction but equal justice , we might turn to vultures and other scavengers which , throughout the Tropics and large portions of the Temperate Zones , clear away carrion which results from the common fate of all animals . We should have to take account also of many important game birds , sources of sport and food to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the jays , which directly or indirectly plant forests ; of the humming birds , which , aside from being incomparably beautiful feathered creations , fertilize in the American Tropics the loveliest of all plant forms , the orchids . Nor may we omit to think of the egrets and birds of paradise , victims of an immeasurably large traffic , which pay with their blood for the value man sets upon them . MANY BIRDS HAVE ENDEARED THEMSELVES TO MANKIND And yet few would admit that the qualifications of the birds mentioned weigh heavily in the balance against those of more familiar kinds , which in all parts of the populated earth have from time immemorial endeared themselves by their never-failing seasonal presence , their boldness , their beauty of voice or color , their exemplary parenthood , or even by the seeming possession of such foibles as mischievous or irritable temperaments , with which man can sympathize because he so well understands them . Therefore , lest our standard of worth be obliged to compete with the inspiration which Shelley and Keats derived respectively from skylark and nightingale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters , drew from certain flightless and extraordinarily manlike seaf owl , it should be stated that we are here taking no account of esthetic or traditional values . Figuring in dollars and cents , and with reference to effect upon human life and human geography , we beg to present our candidate for the post of king among avian benefactors ? the Peruvian cormorant or guanay , known to science by the ponderous name of Phalacrocorax bougainvillei . Readers of the NATIONAL , GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE will recall that they have already made the acquaintance of the guanay through an illuminating description of " Peru 's Wealth-Producing Birds , " by Dr. Robert E. Coker , which was published in the issue of June , 1920 . Dr. Coker 's remarks on this cormorant were included in a general account of the ornithology and life conditions of+the Peruvian coast , and were based , moreover , upon investigations made ( luring the years 1906 and 1907 . Recently the writer has had the enviable opportunity of working in the same field , with Dr. Coker 's manuscript notes in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly during the intervening years , partly as a result of one of the most effective steps toward conservation that has ever been put into force , this classic sea bird is well worthy of more extended commemoration . For an adequate description of the  | geographic and climatic environment in which the guanay exists in countless millions , the reader is referred to Dr. Coker 's paper . Suffice it to say that the range of the species is restricted to coastwise waters along the arid , western shores of South America between Point Parina , just south of the Gulf of Guayaquil , and the vicinity of Corral , Chile . A CREATURE OP THE HUMBOLDT CURRENT This stretch of shore line , some 2,400 sea miles in length , is bathed by a relatively narrow , northward-flowing oceanic stream , the Humboldt Current , the water of which is notably cooler than that of the outlying tropical Pacific . Chiefly because of its low temperature , the current is peopled by a probably unequaled profusion of marine organisms , including anchovies and other small fishes which are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vast numbers , make possible a correlated abundance of the birds . The guanayes are strictly creatures of the Humboldt Current ; their huge flocks move up and down the coast as the birds forage among migrating schools of fish ; they breed , likewise in vast numbers , upon the many islands lying from one to a score of miles from the coast ; but they do not stray outside the field of the current , to the northward , the southward , or offshore . The islets of the Humboldt Current , which are most thickly distributed along the northerly two thirds of Peru , partake he author 's sketch of the same desert character of the opposite continental mainland . This climatic fact is the secret of the guanay 's economic importance , for the guano or excrement of sea birds is preserved on the nesting grounds without loss of fertilizing efficacy such as would be caused by moisture . From prehistoric times guano from these islands has been used in the agriculture of the native peoples of Peru , * but the importance and money value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are greater to-day than at any time in the past . DENSE MASSES OF BIRDS PRESS ALONG THE SEA Picture to yourselves the shining , rainless coast of Peru , washed by ocean waters to which storms are unknown , where the swells surge northward from month to month and year to year before winds that blow regularly from a southerly quarter . On such an ocean dark flocks of guanayes form rafts which can be spied miles away . Slowly the dense masses of birds press along the sea , gobbling up fish in their path , the hinder margins of the rafts continually rising into the air and pouring over the van in some such manner as the great flocks of passenger pigeons are said to have once rolled through open North American forests in which oak or beech mast lay thick upon the leafy floor . At other times , when the guanayes are moving toward distant feeding grounds , they travel not in broad flocks , but rather as a solid river of birds which streams in a sharply marked , unbroken column , close above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a single formation takes four or five hours to pass a given point . Equally impressive are the homeward flights of these cormorants after a day of gorging upon anchovies , when in late afternoon slender ribbons , wedges , and whiplashes of guanayes in single file twist and flutter , high in air , toward the rounded plateaus of white islands , which gradually turn black as the packed areas of birds swell out from clustered nuclei toward the borders of the available standing room ( see pages 296 and 298 ) . Whence came this astounding sea bird , which has made the Peruvian coast its own ? The evolutionary history of present-day animals is in most cases impossible to decipher unless we have a clear fossil record such as , for example , that of the camel , which is known to have originated during the early part of the Age  | of Mammals in the western United States , where it no longer occurs , and to have spread thence by diverse routes to Asia and to South America , where highly modified descendants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such clue to the primeval home of the guanay 's ancestors , but fortunately we can read the history of the species in other pages of Nature 's text-book . For the guanay belongs to a well-defined antarctic branch of the cormorant family , all the members of which are characterized by certain anatomical peculiarities , as well as by external marks , such as white breasts and " warts " above the bill . The other species of this branch inhabit high southern latitudes . The guanay 's nearest relatives , in fact , are cormorants of the Strait of Magellan , New Zealand , various subantarctic islands , and the shores of the Antarctic Continent all around the pole , while its relationship with other cormorants of South America , or with those of any part of the Northern Hemisphere , is relatively remote . ANTARCTIC BIRD MAKES ITS HOME NEAR EQUATOR In the northward extension of this representative of an antarctic group to a point within six degrees of the Equator , we recognize one of the profound effects of the Humboldt Current . The cool stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heated surface waters of the open South Pacific on the other , forms , as it were , a tongue of littoral ocean in which the environment , and consequently the marine flora and fauna , is such as ordinarily holds for the subantarctic zone rather than for equatorial or even temperate seas . This condition is more or less common to all western continental coasts , but nowhere are its results , as expressed in the distribution and abundance of life , so marked as in the Humboldt Current . Given , therefore , a belt of cool ocean waters replete with small organisms of more or less polar type , together with nesting sites upon islands which for climatic reasons could never become encumbered with vegetation , and the geographic stage was set for the northward emigration of the ancestors of the guanay . Furthermore , because of the normal superabundance of food , conditions seem to have been prearranged for the increase of the birds to numbers limited only by competition with other animals and by the amount of safe , insular space for reproduction . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Humboldt Current is still out of all proportion to the area of the breeding places . This doubtless explains the excessively colonial nesting habit of the guanay , in which it surpasses all other birds , even the penguins , for in the middle of a bounteous sea there would be a constant tendency for the cormorant population to become more and more congested upon the islets . The doctrine of Malthus applies to birds as well as to men . THE GUANAY FISHES BY SIGHT These facts suggest that the geographic background does not tell the whole story . Evolution is , at least in part , the result of interaction between a living being and its surroundings . The guanay itself has had to undergo considerable modification in order to fit into a new environment , especially as regards the particular character of its food in the Humboldt Current . Several such adaptive changes are apparent , changes which have progressed so far that they now strongly differentiate the Peruvian species from its antarctic cousins and from every other kind of cormorant in the world . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hawks " its food ? that is , it hunts exclusively by sight and from the air , locating the fishes which it seeks before descending to the water to catch them . Most cormorants search for their prey individually , swimming alone or in loose groups at the surface , then plunging in what seem to be favorable places and conducting the hunt as well as the capture while they are submerged . For the most part , moreover , they subsist upon bottomliving species of fish , often diving down many fathoms in pursuit of single victims . But the guanay feeds altogether upon surface-swimming fishes , such as anchovies , young herrings , and the toothsome silversides which the Peruvians call  | pejerreyes ( kingfish ) . Such forms travel in tremendous schools , which are assailed en masse by proportionately large flocks of birds . SCOUT BIRDS SENT OUT TO LOCATE SCHOOLS OF FISH The correlation between the numbers of the fishes and the extreme gregariousness of the cormorants results among the latter in a system of efficient co-operation which almost suggests certain customs of ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which spend their nights upon the islands do not start hunting in a body when morning breaks . On the contrary , the birds first sally forth only in small scouting parties , which can be seen flying erratically above the ocean , usually keeping well in air , and frequently " back-pedaling " or hovering when they see the silvery glint of schooling fish or the ruffled appearance of the sea , which indicates the presence of fish below . The dropping of the scouts to the surface and the shallow dives which mark the beginning of an orgy are the signals that cause the approach of such rivers of birds as have been described ( p.283 ) . The cohort of guanayes then spreads out like a great fan over the unfortunate anchovies , which are likely to be no less harried from beneath by bonitos and sea lions .  | wonder that the Peruvian fishermen who are familiar with such sights , believe that the guanayes and the seals have a working understanding ! However this may be , the gorging proceeds until both sea lions and birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit them for another meal . From the crop and gullet of a dead guanay the remains of no less then seventy-six anchovies , four or five inches in length , have been taken . Sometimes the guanayes pursue the fishes to the very beaches , so that a rare view of a one-sided fray may be enjoyed by a landsman . One morning during the writer 's sojourn at Independencia Bay , Peru , shoals of silversides were packed in deep , glittering ranks close to the quiet shore , when a raft of guanayes , accompanied by a few pelicans and a horde of screaming gulls , drove the fishes before them against the shelving sand . Soon the water gleamed like flashing quicksilver , and in wild rioting the birds jammed and crowded each other until hundreds of them were pushed clear beyond the tide-line by the scrambling mob behind . THE GUANAY WALKS ERECT LIKE A PENGUIN The guanay stands and walks erect , somewhat after the manner of a penguin . Its height is in the neighborhood of 20 inches and the weight of a full-grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has a glossy green and blue-black neck and back , a white throat-patch , which is a conspicuous mark in flight , a white under surface , and pinkish feet . During the courtship season a crest of plunges develops at the back of the head . The guanay 's iris is brown , but an area of green , naked skin surrounding the orbit makes it look at close range like a veritable personification of envy . A second ring of turgid red skin outside the staring " green eye " heightens its extraordinary expression . Since the fame of the guanay proceeds chiefly from sheer numbers , it is not unnatural that observers have made extremely high estimates or guesses concerning the population of its colonies . The birds breed upon the plateaus and windward hillsides of the Peruvian islands in concentrated communities , the nests averaging three to each square yard of ground ( see p. 299 ) . Dr. Coker 's measurements show that no fewer than a million adult birds dwelt within the limits of a s i n g 1 e homogeneous colony on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalist has written that these cormorants " congregate to the number of ten millions . " BREEDING SEASON IS CONTINUOUS The breeding season , like that of most tropical ocean birds , is practically continuous , but it reaches a climax during the southern summer months of December and January . In its adaptation to an all-the-year nestEsCADORES ISLAND ing habit , the species has , of course , diverged widely from the ways of its antarctic relatives , the reproductive season of the latter being rigidly fixed by the climatic cycle . Individual pairs of guanayes are believed commonly to rear two broods during a single year . The flight of the last families of the young of one season , in May or June , is , at any rate , followed hard by the courting and love-making of adults in preparation for the breeding season of the second spring . In early October , 1919 , when the writer arrived at the far-famed Chincha Islands , off Pisco , Peru , the resident guanayes were in the early stages of mating . From this place and date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive manifestations of the birds '  | life history were revealed , until at Lobos de Tierra , in January , 1920 , full-fledged young were observed taking to the ocean , quite independent of parental care . At South Chincha Island in mid-October the breeding grounds were covered with just one year 's accumulation of s u nbaked guano , and the cormorants were getting ready to nest again . They stood in compact bodies , each comprising thousands of birds , and , when a human being approached , all those on the nearer side began to stir ? not en bloc nor yet individually , but in groups of a few hundred , each of which for the time constituted a unit . One group would move rapidly away , the birds carrying themselves bolt upright . Another group would advance toward the observer , so that this section of the army would gleam with white breasts instead of shiny , dark backs . Still another unit would rush to the right or to the left , so that both the dark backs and the white breasts showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warts became conspicuous . Such closely huddled companies soon collided with others moving in different directions , producing much confusion about the margins . A few of the birds showed no fear at all , stolidly permitting a man to approach within a few feet . The greater proportion , however , frantically took to flight , rushing helter-skelter down a slope and raising a cloud of dust with their whistling wings . The air became bewilderingly thick with birds as they circled overhead , but within a few moments the number returning to earth once more exceeded the number taking wing . THE HUM OF COUNTLESS WINGS When an observer makes his way slowly and very quietly into the heart of a colony in which nesting has definitely begun , the guanayes gradually retreat , and one may sit down in a clear circle which is at first 5o or more feet in diameter . But almost imperceptibly the birds will edge in again , until the bare circle narrows to but three or four paces . From such a point of view it seems as if the ground were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is room @# @#  | for , and yet new arrivals plump down by scores or hundreds every minute . Over the ocean , moreover , to the north , south , east , and west , one may commonly see endless black files still pouring in toward the island ( see pp. 296 , 297 , 298 ) . The hum of wings is like the effect of an overdose of quinine upon the ears , and the combined voices seem like mutterings of the twelve tribes of Israel . It reminds one of all sorts of strange , oppressive roarings , such as the noise of railroad trains in river tunnels . The near-by voices , which can be distinguished individually , are merely sonorous bass grunts and " screepy " calls . It is the multiplication of such sounds by numbers almost too large to imagine that makes the outlandish and never-to-beforgotten babel . Toward evening of such October days most of the guanayes would be courting , after strenuous hours at sea , during which all their energies had doubtless been devoted to winning the sustenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fitness , and while six or seven birds occupy each square yard of ground , the love-making antics are often in full progress . These are in general not unlike the courtship habits of the closely related antarctic cormorants. * Two guanayes stand side by side , or breast to breast , and ludicrously wave their heads back and forth or gently caress each other 's necks . The crests upon their crowns are frequently erected , and the feathers of the nape puff out so that the velvety necks appear twice their normal thickness . Cheeks and chin-pouches continually tremble , and chattering bills are held wide open . RUNNING THE GANTLET Now and again one will bend its body forward and at the same time extend the head upside down along the spine and toward the tail , holding this curious , paralyzed attitude for several seconds . Sometimes the birds of a pair snap so much at one another that it is hard to judge whether they are making love or quarreling . Indubitable quarrels between birds of different pairs also go on without cessation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , for example , some unfortunate guanay , which seems to be the butt of all bystanders , will go dashing through the throng , holding its head as high as possible in order to avoid the jabs and bites which all others direct at it . If the victim would but stop fleeing , perhaps the blows would cease , but it keeps more and more desperately running the gantlet , flapping its wings , bumping into innumerable neighbors , until eventually it bursts from the vicious crowd into a clear space , shakes itself with an abused air , and opens and shuts its mouth many times with an expression of having just swallowed an unpleasant dose . FIVE SUITORS SEEK ONE BIRD 'S FAVOR In the early stages of courtship it often happens that several cocks select the same female for their addresses . In one instance , five assiduous suitors , all with necks expanded , were observed bowing around a single hen , which crouched in their midst . But by no means all the birds are engaged in love-making at every moment , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coverts of the tail and thrusting the bill toward the oil gland . Then , after combing their heads and necks thoroughly with their claws ? a real feat in balancing ? they promenade in small troupes along the outer edge of the colony . Visible actions , rather than unusual sounds , alarm the courting birds . A quick motion of the hand will start sudden pandemonium . Even when an observer rises to leave them as slowly , silently , and unostentatiously as possible , a small panic inevitably results , many of the nearer birds beginning to scamper about or to take flight . On the other hand , the firing of a gun straight into the air produces scarcely a stir , provided the weapon is not brandished . The effect of human conversation is , however , most amusing . Whenever the writer , sitting perfectly still , has begun to talk to the guanayes in a loud voice , a silence has fallen over all the audience within hearing . Their mumbles  | and grunts die away , and they listen for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours ' resting on any island the birds get much befouled with fresh guano , which hardens upon their plumage . They periodically rid themselves of this by flying some distance off the lee side of the island , where they plunge and violently beat the water with their wings . Sometimes most of the inhabitants of a colony will make their toilet in this way at one time , producing a thunderous roar , which can be heard from afar . It is often audible during morning fogs , when the flocks are invisible , and as a boat draws near such a gathering it is easy to mistake the sound for the dreaded crashing of waves upon unseen rocky shores . HOMEWARD FLIGHT A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE Inhabitants of the Peruvian coast are agreed that the guanayes never spend the night upon the ocean , as the native pelicans often do , but that they return to their island roosting places even when the journey involves a flight which must continue long after dark . The writer has sometimes watched from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until nightfall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeward . A few white gannets ( Sula variegata ) often accompany them , as if filling honorary positions in the line , but fully 999 in every thousand birds are guanayes . The grandest sight of the day , when the homeward flight is at its maximum , usually comes during the hour before sunset . From some point far away the birds make a bee line for the center of their island , but , as they near their destination , they invariably skirt the shores so as to come down across the wind . The instinct of following a leader is evidently strong ; if , for any reason , a file  | is broken , and the rear birds turn toward the left coast instead of the right , those behind will obey the signal and all swing into the new course . Close over gulches and ridges of their home island the oncoming streams of birds flow , the separate " rivulets " cutting across each other like the blades of scissors . At the same time these files also rise and fall in beautiful undulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill above them . Sometimes three or more such lines will flow along for a while lo or 15 yards apart , but sooner or later one of them will make leeway until two files interweave . Then the soft , humming swish of wings is interjected with sharp clicks as the quills of two guanayes strike together in air . When one beholds the endless mingling , the crossing and recrossing and tangling of the lines , it seems incredible that more birds do not clash ( see illustrations , pages 297 and 298 ) . THE ENEMIES OE THE GUANAYES It goes without saying that such gregarious creatures as the guanayes must have natural enemies to prey upon their abundance . The sea lions of the coast have been accused of devouring the fledglings when they first take to water , but , so far as the writer 's observations go , there is little evidence to support the charge . The naked , black-skinned , and very ugly chicks , which hatch from rather small greenish eggs , are apt to be thickly infested with feather-eating lice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet , so long as the sensitive nestlings are shielded from the hot sun , they seem to suffer no ill effects from these parasites . Other birds , in fact , appear to be their only serious enemies . When the writer landed upon Asia Island , off central Peru , on December 4 , 1919 , great destruction of guanay eggs had been wrought by gulls , turkey vultures , and condors . Although a colony containing countless eggs and young still covered about half of the western slope , extending from the summit almost to the water and filling a deep ravine as well as the rounded hillside , the other half had become a waste of empty nests and  | broken eggshells and had been deserted for the season by the parent birds . Early in the morning of this day , guanayes were leaving their breeding ground to pour out over the Pacific in an unbroken column , which was following a school of fish in a tremendous sigmoid curve toward the north . The colony was , however , still densely peopled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had remained to cover the eggs or the newly hatched , squeaking chicks ( see page 300 ) . The nests were luxuriantly feathered with molted quills , which , by the way , the brooding birds were forever stealing from one another 's foundations . Many walked about carrying bunches of feathers , or flew elsewhere with a bill full . In the heart of the colony stood a condor , with a small circle of abandoned and rifled nests roundabout . When this pilferer had been shot and picked up by the feet , the albumen and mostly unbroken yolks of a round dozen fresh eggs slid out of its gullet . Scarcely any pieces of shell were visible in this rich meal , the supposition being that condors must suck the contents of the eggs through their trough-shaped tongues . Later in the month of December the guanayes were observed in more advanced stages of the nesting period at the Pescadores and Huaura Islands , to the northward of Callao . Here their robberenemies were less in evidence , perhaps because the government guardians had been using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs were noted . Although a certain proportion of the adults were incubating new sets , the latter probably represented second broods , for the nests were exceedingly large , and the quills which had once formed a lining were now buried deeply under the craters of guano which constituted the rim of each nest chamber . Moreover , nearly full-grown young , in pepper-and-salt plumage , were abundant everywhere ( see illustration , page 287 ) . These chicks were inclined to be indiscreet in wandering away from their own headquarters ; whereupon they would presently be chastised by old birds and would have to scurry ignominiously back to their respective home sites . YOUNG GUANAYES TEASE PARENT BIRDS Among the larger chicks the approved method of obtaining food was to shiver and plead before their elders until the latter acted as though they were frantic from the teasing . As long , indeed , as the adults were at the nesLs , the youngsters never let up trying to rain their heads down the parental throats , and it was nothing unusual to see two or even three dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season the sound coming from a colony bore some resemblance to an April frog-chorus , for the high-pitched voices of the chicks tended to drown out the mumbling of the old birds . Still older fledglings had gone down in droves to the quiet rock pools around the shores , where they flapped their wings and dived until they had become proficient in the ways of maturity . Late every afternoon thousands of these apprentices could be seen scrambling up the steep hillsides from their training grounds , striving to get back with the crowd before dark . Such was their strange indifference to the presence of man that they made no  | protest when we picked them up by their pinions and helped them on their way . FLEDGLINGS INDIFFERENT TO PRESENCE ON MAN This lack of fear is not necessarily innate . It may be due rather to the familiarity of the birds with guardians who never harm them , an idea suggested during a later visit to an isolated colony of guanayes on the large island of Lobos de Tierra , where both old and young were unwontedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk left their nests pell-mell at the approach of a human being . At Mazorca Island , of the Huaura group , a splendid colony of guanayes occupied practically all of the southern or windward slope , from the very brink of low precipices , over which the spray flew , to the crest of the island . Breeding gannets mingled to a certain extent with the cormorants along the lower border of the nesting ground . A few birds of both kinds had established themselves also on the northern slope , out of the wind , but here their enemies had been active and had succeeded in devouring many eggs . It seems to be characteristic of the vultures and gulls to attack at the edges rather than in the midst of a colony , and thus they tend to annihilate projecting portions and small outlying groups . Perhaps this is one of the evolutionary factors which have caused the guanayes to breed in such compact hordes . NO GUANAY MISTAKES ITS NEST The birds at Mazorca were most tenacious in clinging to their nests , even when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broods were covered by both parents , which were so huddled together that they looked like single birds with two heads . One usually had a wing , for instance , over the back of its mate . When approached , they bristled all over until their plumage resembled that of Japanese bronze eagles . They would then wave their heads threateningly and hiss with widely opened bills . In the forenoon the colony usually appeared thin and gray when viewed from the lofty balcony of the lighthouse ; but  | by 3 o'clock in the afternoon it would be black , owing to the return of tens of thousands of additional birds . Before alighting , most of the homecomers soared back and forth considerably in the fresh breeze . Whenever one came to earth in the wrong place , it would immediately disclose its mistake by what can only be called a " lost " expression . Other guanayes in the vicinity would grasp the situation at once and would then assault the newcomer , forcing it to take wing again at much sacrifice of dignity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not welcome , for they seldom got off without being thoroughly pecked and jabbed . Such extraordinary reactions answer the question , so often asked , as to whether colonial birds always find their individual homes among myriads of seemingly identical nest-hollows distributed over acres of undifferentiated surface . Above all else , Nature jealously guards the unity of the family ; each mated pair must fulfill its own obligation of rearing offspring to maturity , and every unconscious tendency to depart from this responsibility is nipped in the bud . PERU ENFORCES WISE CONSERVATION POLICY The guanayes have not always had the freedom from disturbance which they now enjoy along the whole length of the Peruvian coast . Dr. Coker has described the decades of mismanagement which ended in the exhaustion of the ancient guano deposits and in such a vast reduction of the insular bird life that the future of the national agriculture was seriously threatened . The rehabilitation of guano traffic , the conversion of an exploitation into a true industry , the repopulation of the barren rocky islands with colonies of birds whose numbers may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , and the building up from the wreck of the past of the greatest of all business enterprises based upon the conservation of wild animals , make an inspiring story of modern Peru .  | In the short space of fifteen years the larger part of the change has been accomplished . The contract system of guano extraction , with its cutthroat competition and waste , has been abolished , and control has been centered in a National Guano Administration , the policy of which makes immediate advantage secondary to a rigid protection of the birds upon which future resources depend . Credit for the reorganization belongs in the main to the farsighted and patriotic citizens of Peru who succeeded in pushing through , against odds , the necessary legislation , but the influence of foreign investigators , such as Dr. H. O. Forbes and Dr. Coker , must by no means be overlooked . The first undertaking of the National Guano Administration , under the able directorship of Senor Francisco Ballen , was to make each of the numerous guano islands a bird sanctuary , closed at all seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with duties scarcely less exacting than those of lighthouse-keepers , were posted as permanent residents upon every group . Clandestine guano extraction , the stealing of eggs for food or for the use of the albumen in clearing wine , and other depredations which had formerly caused havoc in the colonies , ceased at once . The old method of extracting guano without regard to the presence or condition of the birds has , of course , been abolished . The islands , under the new rule , are worked according to a system of rotation which leaves ample and congenial breeding grounds always available . Courting or nesting birds are shielded with particular care . Moreover , after removal of the guano , an island is promptly vacated and is thereafter given over to the complete possession of the birds for a period of approximately thirty months , at the expiration of which the date for a renewal of digging operations is determined only after thorough reconnaissance . ANNUAL OUTPUT OF ' FERTILIZER INCREASES FROM 25,000 TO 90,000 TONS The creation of a technical section of the Guano Administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Lavalle y Garcia , has resulted in important scientific work upon the islands , including meteorological and zoological investigations , and a detailed study of diseases of the birds . The same department has also conducted a progressive  | advertising campaign in order to make the value and availability of guano familiar to planters throughout the Republic . The regime of the National Guano Administration , with its well-balanced regard for both business and conservation , has resulted in a nearly uniform growth in the increment of natural fertilizer . Ten years ago the annual output was less than 25,000 tons , while to-day it is about 90,000 tons , of which 70,000 tons are used in Peru and the remainder exported . Even to-day 's figures may seem small when compared with the many million tons of guano shipped from the Peruvian islands during the latter half of the nineteenth century . But the old exploitation only drew upon the deposits of past ages , with a constantly diminishing return , while the new method builds up its future as it goes . The guanayes , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding grounds . Unless quite unexpected circumstances intervene , it is probable that the impressive , streaming flocks , which alone connote a healthy and productive condition of the guano-making colonies , may always be seen along the famed seacoast of the Incas.
