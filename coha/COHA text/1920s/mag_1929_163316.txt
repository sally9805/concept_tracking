A U. S. Jew talked last week to English Jews about a Viennese Jew who wanted Jewry to return and live in Palestine . The occasion was a London meeting to memorialize the 25th anniversary of the death of Dr. Theodor Herzl , founder of political Zionism . It was Dr. Herzl who , while reporting the famed Dreyfus affair ( 1894 ) for the Vienna Neue Freie Presse , found his attention focused on antiSemitism , his Jewish consciousness aroused. * Two years later , aged 36 , he published The Jewish State , a speedily famed pamphlet which , with secular , economic emphasis , advocated Jewish national reunion . Followed congresses , interviews with world rulers , potent propagandizing . <P> Eloquent , devoted Dr. Herzl , were he , alive today , might visit or live in Tel Aviv , first Zionist city , population 50,000 . Its shrubbery , stucco residences , theatre , opera house and 50 schools stand on the dunes outside Jaffa , Palestine . Hebrew alone is spoken . The name of Herzl is almost sacred . <P> Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical Tycoon Lord Melchett and Sir Robert Samuel , famed Liberal . None was more closely attended , however , than orotund Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise of Manhattan , who said : " Theodor Herzl was one of the few men truly epochal . . . because he dared to bid the Jew to be what , for nearly two millenia , he had not dared to be-to be himself , a Jew . . . . Before Herzl came the Jews had been so hurt by the world 's ill will that many had denied their own Semitism . Such a denial is infinitely more provocative than a courageous admission . But since Herzl 's day there are fewer Jews concealing their Semitism . ... I was the last comrade that Herzl talked with . He was a worn and spent man . I asked him whether we could not free him from the necessity of potboiling for his Vienna newspaper . . . ' I dare not , ' he answered , ' lest it be said I live on Zionism rather than for it . ' " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To obtain a scapegoat and to cater to anti-Semitic factions , Capt . Alfred Dreyfus , able Jew , was accused by the high command , tried , convicted , sent to Devil 's Island . The question shook Europe . After five years the Dreyfusards won . Capt . Dreyfus was retried , found guilty " with extenuating circumstances , " pardoned by the President . In 1906 he was formally declared innocent . He fought for France in the War , gained the rank of colonel , still lives in Paris .
