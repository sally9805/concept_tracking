I T is not , one will recall , until the fourth scene of the first act that Hamlet confronts the ghost of his father . As soon as the situation has been made clear , the audience has been , consciously or unconsciously , waiting for this ghost to appear , while in the fourth scene this moment has been definitely promised . For earlier in the play Hamlet had arranged to come to the platform at night with Horatio to meet the ghost , and it is now night , he is with Horatio and Marcellus , and they are standing on the platform . Hamlet asks Horatio the hour . " Hor . I think it lacks of twelve . Mar . No , it is struck . Hor . Indeed ? I heard it not : then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk . " Promptly hereafter there is a sound off-stage . " A flourish of trumpets , and ordnance shot off within . " Hamlet 's friends have established the hour as twelve . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course it is not the ghost . It is , rather , the sound of the king 's carousal , for the king " keeps wassail . " A tricky , and effective detail . We have been waiting for a ghost , and get , startlingly , a blare of trumpets . And again , once the trumpets are silent , we feel all the more just how desolate are these three men waiting for a ghost , on a bare " platform , " feel it by this sudden juxtaposition of an imagined scene of lights and merriment . But the trumpets announcing a carousal have suggested a subject of conversation . In the darkness Hamlet discusses the excessive drinking of his countrymen . He points out that it tends to harm their reputation abroad , since , he argues , this one showy vice makes their virtues " in the general censure take corruption . " And for this reason , although he himself is a native of this place , he does not approve of the custom . Indeed , there in the gloom he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Look ,  | my Lord , it comes . " All this time we had been waiting for a ghost , and it comes at the one moment which was not pointing towards it . This ghost , so assiduously prepared for , is yet a surprise . And now that the ghost has come , we are waiting for something further . Programme : a speech from Hamlet . Hamlet must confront the ghost . Here again Shakespeare can feed well upon the use of contrast for his effects . Hamlet has just been talking in a sober , rather argumentative manner ? but now the flood-gates are unloosed : " Angels and ministers of grace defend us ! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn 'd , Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell . . . " and the transition from the matter-of-fact to the grandiose , the full-throated and full-vowelled , is a second burst of trumpets , perhaps even more effective than the first , since it is the rich fulfilment of a promise . Yet this satisfaction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first desiring solely to see Hamlet confront the ghost , we now want Hamlet to learn from the ghost the details ? which are , however , with shrewdness and husbandry , reserved for " Scene V. ? Another Part of the Platform . " I have gone into this scene at some length , since it illustrates so perfectly the relationship between psychology and form , and so aptly indicates how the one is to be defined in terms of the other . That is , the psychology here is not the psychology of the hero , but the psychology of the audience . And by that distinction , form would be the psychology of the audience . Or , seen from another angle , form is the creation of an appetite in the mind of the auditor , and the adequate satisfying of that appetite . This satisfaction ? so complicated is the human mechanism ? at times involves a temporary set of frustrations , but in the end these frustrations prove to be simply a more involved kind of satisfaction , and furthermore serve to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work of art , the poet says something , let us say , about a meeting , writes in such a way that we desire to observe that meeting , and then , if he places that meeting before us ? that is form . While obviously , that is also the psychology of the audience , since it involves desires and their appeasements.  | The seeming breach between form and subject-matter , between technique and psychology , which has taken place in the last century is the result , it seems to me , of scientific criteria being unconsciously introduced into matters of purely aesthetic judgement . The flourishing of science has been so vigorous that we have not yet had time to make a spiritual readjustment adequate to the changes in our resources of material and knowledge . There are disorders of the social system which are caused solely by our undigested wealth ( the basic disorder being , perhaps , the phenomenon of overproduction : to remedy this , instead of having all workers employed on half time , we have half working full time and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest reward of applied science , it has been , up to now , the most menacing condition our modern civilization has had to face ) . It would be absurd to suppose that such social disorders would not be paralleled by disorders of culture and taste , especially since science is so pronouncedly a spiritual factor . So that we are , owing to the sudden wealth science has thrown upon us , all nouveaux-riches in matters of culture , and most poignantly in that field where lack of native firmness is most readily exposed , in matters of aesthetic judgement . One of the most striking derangements of taste which science has temporarily thrown upon us involves the understanding of psychology in art . Psychology has become a body of information ( which is precisely what psychology in science should be , or must be ) . And similarly , in art , we tend to look for psychology as the purveying of information . Thus , a contemporary writer has objected to Joyce 's Ulysses on the ground that there are more psychoanalytic data available in Freud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same system , have destroyed Homer 's Odyssey ! ) To his objection it was answered that one might , similarly , denounce Cezanne 's trees in favour of state forestry bulletins . Yet are not Cezanne 's landscapes themselves tainted with the psychology of information ? Has he not , by perception , pointed out how one object lies against another , indicated what takes place between two colours ( which is the psychology of science , and is less successful in the medium of art than in that of science , since in art such processes are at best implicit , whereas in science they are so readily made explicit ) ? Is Cezanne not , to  | that extent , a state forestry bulletin , except that he tells what goes on in the eye instead of on the tree ? And do not the true values of his work lie elsewhere ? and precisely in what I distinguish as the psychology of form ? Thus , the great influx of information has led the artist also to lay his emphasis on the giving of information ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute the psychology of the hero ( the subject ) for the psychology of the audience . Under such an attitude , when form is preserved it is preserved as an annex , a luxury , or , as some feel , a downright affectation . It remains , though sluggish , like the human appendix , for occasional demands are still made upon it ; but its true vigour is gone , since it is no longer organically required . Proposition : The hypertrophy of the psychology of information is accompanied by the corresponding atrophy of the psychology of form . In information , the matter is intrinsically interesting . And by intrinsically interesting I do not necessarily mean intrinsically valuable , as to witness the intrinsic interest of backyard gossip or the most casual newspaper items . In art , at least the art of the great ages ( Aeschylus , Shakespeare , Racine ) the matter is interesting by means of an extrinsic use , a function . Consider , for instance , the speech of Mark Anthony , the " Brutus is an honourable man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on human conduct , with statistics , intelligence tests , definitions ; imagine it as the finest thing of the sort ever written , and as really being at the roots of an understanding of Brutus . Obviously , the play would simply stop until Anthony had finished . For in the case of Anthony 's speech , the value lies in the fact that his words are shaping the future of the audience 's desire , not the desires of the Roman populace , but the desires of the pit . This is the psychology of form as distinguished from the psychology of information . The distinction is , of course , absolutely true only in its nonexistent extremes . Hamlet 's advice to the players , for instance , has little of the quality which distinguishes Anthony 's speech . It is , rather , intrinsically interesting , although one could very easily prove how the play would benefit by some such delay at this point , and that anything which made this delay possible without violating the consistency of the subject would have , in this , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be absurd to rule intrinsic interest out of literature . I wish simply to have it restored to its properly minor position , seen as merely one out of many possible elements of style . Goethe 's prose , often poorly imagined , or neutral , in its line-for-line texture , especially in the treatment of romantic episode ? perhaps he felt that the romantic episode in itself was enough ? ? is strengthened into a style possessing affirmative virtues by his rich use of aphorism . But this is , after all , but one of many possible facets of appeal . In some places , notably in ' Wilhelm Meister 's Lehrjahre when Wilhelm 's friends disclose the documents they have been collecting about his life unbeknown to him , the aphorisms are almost rousing in their efficacy , since they involve the story . But as a rule the appeal of aphorism is intrinsic : that is , it satisfies without being functionally related to the context . ' . . . Also , to return to the matter of Hamlet , it must be observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " style ; in its alacrity , its development , it really makes this one fragment into a kind of miniature plot . One reason why music can stand repetition so much more sturdily than correspondingly good prose is because music , of all the arts , is by its nature least suited to the psychology of information , and has remained closer to the psychology of form . Here form can not atrophy . Every dissonant chord cries for its solution , and whether the musician resolves or refuses to resolve this dissonance into the chord which the body cries for , he is dealing in human appetites . Correspondingly good prose , however , more prone to the temptations of pure information , can not so much bear repetition since the aesthetic value of information is lost once that information is imparted . If one returns to such a work again it is purely because , in the chaos of modern life , he has been caused to forget it . With a desire , on the other hand , its recovery is as agreeable as its discovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Hamlet gives Guildenstern the pipe to play  | on . For , once the speech is known , its repetition adds a new element to compensate for the loss of novelty . We can not take a recurrent pleasure in the new ( in information ) but we can in the natural ( in form ) . Already , at the moment when Hamlet is holding out the pipe to Guildenstern and asking him to play upon it , we " gloat over " Hamlet 's triumphal descent upon Guildenstern , when , after Guildenstern has , under increasing embarrassment , protested three times that he can not play the instrument , Hamlet launches the retort for which all this was preparation : " Why , look you now , how unworthy a thing you make of me . You would play upon me , you would seem to know my stops ; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery ; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass ; and there is much music , excellent voice , in this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sblood , do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe ? Call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , you can not play upon me. " 1 In the opening lines we hear the promise of the close , and thus feel the emotional curve even more keenly than at first reading . Whereas in most modern art this element is underemphasized . It gives us the gossip of a plot , a plot which too often has for its value the mere fact that we do not know its outcome . ' Music , then , fitted less than any other art for imparting information , deals minutely in frustrations and fulfilments of desire , ' and for that reason more often gives us those curves of emotion  |  | which , because they are natural , can bear repetition without loss . It is for this reason that music , like folk tales , is most capable of lulling us to sleep . A lullaby is a melody which comes quickly to rest , where the obstacles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those waking dreams of struggle and conquest which ( especially during childhood ) we permit ourselves when falling asleep or when trying to induce sleep . Folk tales are just such waking dreams . Thus it is right that art should be called a " waking dream . " The only difficulty with this definition ( indicated by Charles Baudouin in his Psychoanalysis and Aesthetics , a very valuable study of Verhaeren ) is that to-day we understand it to mean art as a waking dream for the artist . Modern criticism , and psychoanalysis in particular , is too prone to define the essence of art in terms of the artist 's weaknesses . It is , rather , the audience which dreams , while the artist oversees the conditions which determine this dream . He is the manipulator of blood , brains , heart , and bowels which , while we sleep , dictate the mould of our desires . This is , of course , the real meaning of artistic felicity ? an exaltation at the correctness of the procedure , so that we enjoy the steady march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment as that which produces our delight with Benedick 's " Peace ! I 'll stop your mouth . ( Kisses her ) " which terminates the imbroglio of Much Ado About Nothing . The methods of maintaining interest which are most natural to the psychology of information ( as it is applied to works of pure art ) are surprise and suspense . The method most natural to the psychology of form is eloquence . For this reason the great ages of Aeschylus , Shakespeare , and Racine , dealing as they did with material which was more or less a matter of common knowledge so that the broad outlines of the plot were known in advance ( while it is the broad outlines which are usually exploited to secure surprise and suspense ) developed formal excellence , or eloquence , as the basis of appeal in their work . Not that there is any difference in kind between the classic method and the method of the cheapest contemporary melodrama . The drama , more than any other form , must never lose sight of its audience : here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And since certain contemporary work is successful , it follows that rudimentary laws of composition are being  | complied with . The distinction is one of intensity rather than of kind . The contemporary audience hears the lines of a play or novel with the same equipment as it brings to reading the lines of its daily paper . It is content to have facts placed before it in some more or less adequate sequence . Eloquence is the minimizing of this interest in fact , per se , so that the " more or less adequate sequence " of their presentation must be relied on to a much greater extent . Thus , those elements of surprise and suspense are subtilized , carried down into the writing of a line or a sentence , until in all its smallest details the work bristles with disclosures , contrasts , restatements with a difference , ellipses , images , aphorism , volume , sound-values , in short all that complex wealth of minutiae which in their line-for-line aspect we call style and in their broader outlines we call form . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity of eloquence is missing , I might cite a recent success , Capek 's R. U. R. Here , in a melodrama which was often astonishing in the rightness of its technical procedure , when the author was finished he had written nothing but the scenario for a play by Shakespeare . It was a play in which the author produced time and again the opportunity , the demand , for eloquence , only to move on . ( At other times , the most successful moments , he utilized the modern discovery of silence , writing moments wherein words could not possibly serve but to detract from the effect : this we might call the " flowering " of information . ) The Adam and Eve scene of the last act , a " commission " which the Shakespeare of the comedies would have loved to fill , was in the verbal barrenness of Capek 's play something shameless to the point of blushing . The Robot , turned human , prompted by the dawn of love to see his first sunrise , or hear the first bird-call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunrise , " or " Hear the pretty birds " ? here one could do nothing but wring his hands at the absence of that aesthetic mould which produced the overslung " speeches " of Romeo and Juliet . Suspense is the concern over the possible outcome of some specific detail of plot rather than for general qualities . Thus , " Will A marry B or C ? " is suspense . In Macbeth , the turn from the murder scene to the porter scene is a much less literal channel of development . Here the presence of one quality calls forth the  | demand for another , rather than one tangible incident of plot awaking an interest in some other possible tangible incident of plot . To illustrate more fully , if an author managed over a certain number of his pages to produce a feeling of sultriness , or oppression , in the reader , this would unconsciously awaken in the reader the desire for a cold , fresh northwind ? and thus some aspect of a northwind would be effective if called forth by some aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in a contemporary poem , T. S. Eliot 's The Waste Land , where the vulgar , oppressively trivial conversation in the public house calls forth in the poet a memory of a line from Shakespeare . These slobs in a public house , after a desolately low-visioned conversation , are now forced by closing time to leave the saloon . They say good-night . And suddenly the poet , feeling his release , drops into another good-night , a goodnight with desinvolture , a good-night out of what was , within the conditions of the poem at least , a graceful and irrecoverable past . " Well that Sunday Albert was home , they had a hot gammon , And they asked me in to dinner , to get the beauty of it hot " ? at this point the bartender interrupts : it is closing time " Goonight Bill . Goonight Lou . Goonight May . Goonight . Ta ta . Goonight . Goonight . Good-night , ladies , good-night , sweet ladies , good-night , goodnight . " There is much more to be said on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make my issue clearer . But I simply wish to point out here that this transition is a bold juxtaposition of one quality created by another , an association in ideas which , if not logical , is nevertheless emotionally natural . In the case of Macbeth , similarly , it would be absurd to say that the audience , after the murder scene , wants a porter scene . But the audience does want the quality which this porter particularizes . The dramatist might , conceivably , have introduced some entirely different character or event in this place , provided only that the event produced the same quality of relationship and contrast ( grotesque seriousness followed by grotesque buffoonery ) . . . . One of the most beautiful and satisfactory " forms " of this sort is to be found in Baudelaire 's Femmes Damnees , where the poet , after describing  | the business of a Lesbian seduction , turns to the full oratory of his apostrophe : " Descendez , descendez , lamentables victimes , Descendez le chemin de l'enfer eternel . . . " while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcends all moral ( or unmoral ) sophistication : the efficacy of appropriateness , of exactly the natural curve in treatment . Here is morality even for the godless , since it is a morality of art , being justified , if for no other reason , by its paralleling of that staleness , that disquieting loss of purpose , which must have followed the procedure of the two characters , the femmes damnees themselves , a remorse which , perhaps only physical in its origin , nevertheless become psychic . ' But to return , we have made three terms synonymous : form , psychology , and eloquence . And eloquence thereby becomes the essence of art , while pity , tragedy , sweetness , humour , in short all the emotions which we experience in life proper , as non-artists , are simply the material on which eloquence may feed . The arousing of pity , for instance , is not the central purpose of art , although it may be an adjunct of artistic effectiveness . One can feel pity much more keenly at the sight of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see art merely as a weak representation of some actual experience . ' That artists to-day are content to write under such an aesthetic accounts in part for the inferior position which art holds in the community . Art , at least in the great periods when it has flowered , was the conversion , or transcendance , of emotion into eloquence , and was thus a factor added  | to life . I am reminded of St Augustine 's caricature of the theatre : that whereas we do not dare to wish people unhappy , we do want to feel sorry for them , and therefore turn to plays so that we can feel sorry although no real misery is involved . One might apply the parallel interpretation to the modern delight in happy endings , and say that we turn to art to indulge our humanitarianism in a well-wishing which we do not permit ourselves towards our actual neighbours . Surely the catharsis of art is more complicated than this , and more reputable . Eloquence itself , as I hope to have established in the instance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to a framework of more stable qualities . Eloquence is simply the end of art , and is thus its essence . Even the poorest art is eloquent , but in a sorry manner , with less intensity , until this aspect is obscured by others fattening upon its leanness . Eloquence is not showiness ; it is , rather , the result of that desire in the artist to make a work perfect by adapting it in every minute detail to the racial appetites . The distinction between the psychology of information and the psychology of form involves a definition of aesthetic truth . It is here precisely , to combat the deflection which the strength of science has caused to our tastes , that we must examine the essential breach between scientific and artistic truth . Truth in art is not the discovery of facts , not an addition to human knowledge in the scientific sense of the word . ' It is , rather , the exercise of human  | propriety , the formulation of symbols which rigidify our sense of poise and rhythm . Artistic truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , whether the " artificial " speech of John Lyly might perhaps be " truer " than the revelations of Dostoevsky . Certainly at its best , in its feeling for a statement which returns upon itself , which attempts the systole to a diastole , it could be much truer than Dostoevsky . ' And if it is not , it fails not through a mistake of Lyly 's aesthetic , but because Lyly was a man poor in character whereas Dostoevsky was rich and complex . When Swift , making the women of Brobdingnag enormous , deduces from this discrepancy between their size and Gulliver 's that Gulliver could sit astride their nipples , he has written something which is aesthetically true , which is , if I may be pardoned , profoundly " proper , " as correct in its Euclidean deduction as any corollary in geometry . Given the companions of Ulysses in the cave of Polyphemus , it is true that they would escape clinging to the bellies of the herd let out to pasture . St Ambrose , detailing the habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the good of mankind , St Ambrose in his limping natural history rich in scientific inaccuracies that are at the very heart of emotional rightness , St Ambrose writes " Of night-birds , especially of the nightingale which hatches her eggs by song ; of the owl , the bat , and the cock at cock-crow ; in what wise these may apply to the guidance of our habits , " and in the sheer rightness of that programme there is the truth of art . In introducing this talk of night-birds , after many pages devoted to other of God 's creatures , he says , " What now ! While we have been talking , you will notice how  | the birds of night have already started fluttering about you , and , in this same fact of warning us to leave off with our discussion , suggest thereby a further topic " and this seems to me to contain the best wisdom of which the human frame is capable , an address , a discourse , which can make our material life seem blatant almost to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the thief abandons his traps , and the sun lights up , and we are in every way called back to God by the wellmeaning admonition of this bird , here the very blindnesses of religion become the deepest truths of art .  |
