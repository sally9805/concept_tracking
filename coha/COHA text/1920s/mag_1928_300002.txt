THE CAVALIER OF TENNESSEE-Meredith Nicholson-Bobbs-Merrill ( $2.50 ) . <P> Andrew Jackson loved cockfighting , horse-racing , apple-toddies ; but he worshipped womanhood , honor , democracy ; and devoted his life to defending these three . This buckskinned Tennessee pioneer worshipped the epitome of exquisite womanhood in Mrs. Rachel Robards , victim of her husband 's jealous bullying . He championed her in her plight , and married her the moment word was received that Robards had divorced her . The actual decree was delayed until long after the blissfully ignorant lovers were married . Village gossips taunted Rachel for " living in sin , " and Jackson was quick to defend her honor , and his , in a series of duels . Gossip revived nonetheless every time Jackson ran for office-a frequent occurrence , for he was representative to Congress at Philadelphia ( where as a Democrat he disapproved the aristocrat 's salons ) , Senator , head of the state militia , President of the U. S. Election to this post he won chiefly by his spectacular defeat of the British in a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound good sense . <P> It is as fighter and lover that Biographer Nicholson makes his glowing portrait of Old Hickory . And there is in the drawing no chiaroscuro of virtue and vice . Just as Andrew Jackson believed a thing to be all black or all white , so he has been painted all whiteman . His fiery tempers are matters of righteous indignation ; his gullibility a matter of holding a man right until he is proved wrong . <P> Meredith Nicholson takes pride in the fact that he , like his hero , is a provincial American . <P> He had voted before he ever saw the sea or any Eastern city . Steeped in the Hoosier tradition , his 30-odd volumes of verse , essay , fiction , reflect the atmosphere of politics and pioneers .
