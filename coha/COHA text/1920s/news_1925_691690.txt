txt I own 30 shares of Mercantile Stores , Inc. , common stook , which I have held for two years . This stock shows me a profit , not only of the stock dividend of one share of preferred  --  and two shares of common , but also the advance in market price in that time of over 200 points . I have just gone over the balance sheet of the company and can not understand why the management carries reserves which seem all out of proportion from oven the most conservative viewpoint . Is it in your opinion that ' they contemplate a further stock dividend or distribution of some of the large cash and security items shown on the balance short , or does the company really need this money in the business ?

If the ' money is used to buy new stores , stockholders should reap the benefit of increased earnings , and consequently a higher price for the stock . The surplus assets , which are probably invested in securities yielding the company about 4 ? 7- , would be employed through the purchase of additional stores to earn a considerably higher yield .
