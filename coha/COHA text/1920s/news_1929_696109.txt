Money The comparative firmness in call money at times recently has been quite a surprise to many market interests who had held the opinion that with the volume of trading down so sharply and demand for funds smaller than a month or so ago , the rate might actually go lower until near the end of the month when preparations again would be in order for the interest and dividend distributions . A Smoke Screen That the activity and strength in pivotal stock at times in recent weeks was merely a smoke screen to permit liquidation in other parts of the market is the growing belief in conservative quarters . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was persistent selling in other directions This practice has been adopted often in the past by those directing the liquidation and it is not unlikely the process was repeated recently . Congress It is probably true that the convening of Congress has had a sobering influence on some of those who were inclined to become too enthusiastic regarding an advancing market in the past few weeks . An effort is to be made in the special session at Washington to give consideration to various matters , aside from the proposals made by President Hoover , and credit may come in for some attention . There is no doubt that uncertainty as to what might be said or done in the halls of Congress has discouraged some of the pools ? hica were showing a tendency to become active again It must be admitted that even speeches in Washington often have been disconcerting to the trading element at times heretofore . Volume The sharp falling off in volume of dealings in recent weeks is looked upon as decidedly satisfactory by bankers who had agreed with the views and wishes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small transactions and price fluctuations such as have been experienced In the past few weeks . Leading commission houses report that their clients are not inclined to enter the market on the long side lust now . This is indicative of the change which has come in the public attitude .
