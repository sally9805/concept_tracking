T HE world once more is agog over Charles A. Lindbergh : his 35,000-mile flight over the United States , his journey to Mexico through fog and rain make him more than ever his country 's hero , the " Ambassador of Good-Will . " And though the world saw his father very differently , " like father , like son " was never more perfectly illustrated than in Charles A. Lindbergh , senior and junior . No two could be more thoroughly alike . One chose statesmanship , the other aviation ; that was the only difference between them . It proved a tremendous difference , however . The very qualities of character which bring the world to one 's feet in aircraft will place one beneath the feet of the world in statecraft . Lindbergh the younger demonstrates a surpassing courage , whereupon multitudes surge about him to do him honor . Lindbergh the elder was equally courageous and ' independent , but the masses he had to face were American mobs . The father was tall and straight , a fine figure of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kindly . He was always calm and impersonal . He used no liquor nor tobacco . I never heard even the smallest " cuss word " pass his lips . He cared nothing for social life . If he had been asked to dance he would have made the same answer as does his lionized son : " I never learned how . " Ta work was his greatest joy . If a task were important he liked to do all parts of it . For example , he had stenographers  --  and did most of his own typewriting . Probably nine-tenths of the many communications I have had from him were his own handiwork . As everybody knows , Congressmen write their own autobiographies for the Congressional Directory . That contributed by the father of the world 's most famous airman was the briefest , I think , ever published . Here it is : " Charles A. Lindbergh , Republican , of Little Falls . " The world marvels at the modesty of the son . It is not at all inexplicable to me who knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our acquaintanceship did Congressman Lindbergh voluntarily refer to a personal matter . He was an attorney  --  a good one , of the Lincoln type ; his honesty was unquestionable . Years before he had handled a Minnesota case for an Eastern millionaire . When this client died it was found that Lindbergh was named administrator of the big estate ; and the will provided that no bond should be required for the execution of the trust . That unusual confidence in his integrity pleased him . He told me about it . It was the nearest to boasting that he ever got . His industry was prodigious . Undoubtedly he was the hardest-working man ever in Congress . It was his daily habit to reach his room in the House Office Building before five o'clock in the morning . Once l asked him how and why he did it . " I must have three or four hours each day by myself for study and writing . After nine there are always interruptions . " That was his answer . His outstanding characteristic was his courage . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come over to the hospital at ten and visit with me while the doctors fix me up . " " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " Oh , a little operation , " he replied . It was not a little operation , and he went through it without an anaesthetic . The ordeal lasted more than an hour and he never gritted his teeth or even gripped my hand , except for a few seconds , when the surgeon 's knife pierced the abdominal cavity . All through that episode we talked about international banking . I had discussed big public problems with him many times , in his office and at my home , but I do not remember an occasion when his mind was given more unreservedly to a serious subject . There was no hint of a distraction . He seemed utterly unmindful of any suffering . He continued with his exposition of a particular point after being taken to his room . Not once did he mention the surgery , except indirectly , when he apologized for having subjected me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman from Minnesota , representing the Little Falls district . If , at any time during that decade , this district had attempted secession there would have been no civil war over it . The powers that be , both Republican and Democrat , would eagerly have sacrificed even a larger territorial part of the Union to get rid of Lindbergh . A question naturally arises : Why did they not go out and defeat him ? They tried , repeatedly . I once asked an Old Guarder why they did not succeed . His explanation was interesting , and possibly had some significance . " We spent so much money , " he said , " trying to lick Lindbergh that the district became too prosperous to care about a change . " He first got in , I suspect , because he was a likable and honest lawyer . His integrity was known to every man and woman in that section of the State . When Lindbergh was admitted to the bar , having graduated in the law class of the University of Michigan at twenty-three ( 1883 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an attorney . He regarded his profession as an official part of the judicial machinery . As a lawyer he acted accordingly . A guilty client did not interest him . It became a tradition in central-eastern Minnesota that he was concerned only in helping to find the exact justice of every controversy . - - In Congress he was a radical of the advanced , uncompromising . type . He tackled the biggest and politically most dangerous national issues . Therefore he was hated and misrepresented more bitterly perhaps than any public man of his generation . " Socialist " was among the mildest of the epithets hurled at him . His enemies accused him of being unsocial . They implied that he shunned functions because of a " crudeness " that was embarrassing to him . Nothing could be further from the truth . He was thoroughly a gentleman , both by birth and breeding . He cared nothing for the social life of the capital , preferring to be studiously by himself , but when it seemed a duty , because of his position , toattend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its unattractiveness , did not at all fit into his Congressional habits . He could not consistently be about his work at five in the morning if the midnight hours were given to sociability . It would not have mattered to the orthodox politicians how much he made a slave of himself , but the results were troublesome . He was better prepared on serious subjects than any " bolshevist " ever encountered , either before or after bolshevism became a well-recognized bugaboo . The " money trust " was Lindbergh 's chief obsession . Not many Congressmen are friends of the " money trust , " but few of them at that time ardently desired to stir it up . " Let sleeping dogs lie , " was quite generally the Congressional policy . Lindbergh , however , persisted in keeping the dangerous animal thoroughly awake . Moreover , he wanted to kennel it , and put the key in the people 's pocket . He demanded an investigation of the " money trust , " and got it , although others took the credit . - Lindbergh introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first it was not taken seriously . But those five o'clock study periods quickly began to show their results . He made out so strong a case that- - it could not be ignored. - The Democrats were then in control of the House . Lindbergh was nominally a Republican , although that party regarded him as an undesirable alien . It was not good politics for those in power to permit any kind of a Republican to sponsor so big a thing as the " money trust " investigation . Other resolutions were presented by Democrats . Henry of Connecticut was the author of one ; Pujo of Louisiana of another , the latter 's being adopted on February 24 , 1912 . From a beginning in which he stood practically alone , Lindbergh saw this inquiry approved by the House with only eight dissenting votes . Among these dissenters were four famous Republican names ? Cannon , Dalzell , Gillett , and Tilson . So the Pujo Committee came into being . It was Lindbergh 's work . It ought to have been the Lindbergh Committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given the credit , but that was not to be . It is doubtful if Lindbergh cared who got the credit so long as an investigation was made . - This " money-trust " fight was continuous until Lindbergh voluntarily left Congress , March 4 , 1917 . The investigation was no sooner under way than he turned his attention to the Glass-Owen bill , which created the Federal Reserve System . He opposed that measure with a vigor and determination rarely exceeded in public life . However one may regard the now existing system , then created , Lindbergh 's first speech - in that debate was a marvelous exposition of the history and economics of financial legislation . His research had been amazing . He presented documents of which most Congressmen had- never heard . Of course the Glass-Owens bill passed , and is now the law of the land . He did not quit . He kept on studying currency and credit . His vigilance in watching the Federal Reserve- System was unceasing . Four years later , shortly before the end of his Congressional career , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives , I , Charles A. Lindbergh , the undersigned , upon my responsibility as a member of the House of Representatives , do hereby impeach W. P. G. Harding , governor ; Paul M. Warburg , vice-governor ; and Frederick A. Delano , Adolph C. Miller , and Charles S. Hamlin , members , each individually as a - member of the Federal Reserve Board , and also all of them collectively as the five active working members of said board , of high crimes and misdemeanors . There followed fifteen counts of an indictment , each of which , he said , " I stand ready to prove . " - He asked the House not to dispose of the solemn proceedings " by a Motion to lay on the table . It would not be doing justice to the country if done in that way . " He said : Either I am right in presenting these articles of impeachment or I am wrong . If I do injustice to the House , if I do injustice to the country in preferring articles of impeachment which ought not- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House to discredit me for doing that thing . I do not , however , expect to be discredited , though undoubtedly powerful influences will be used to prevent favorable action- on the , articles of impeachment . The matter was referred to the Judiciary Committee and , of course , no action was taken . A confidential talk I had with him about this impeachment of the Federal Reserve Board can now be told . As a publicist , I was interested in knowing what was back of it . " Will the House act on your - charges ? " I asked . " No , " he answered ; " I do n't expect any result like that . " " Why , then , did you make the indictment ? " There followed an hour of prophecy  --  which seemed almost inspired in view of what happened . He pointed out what this federal agency could and would do after the war , especially with respect to agriculture . He predicted the manipulated deflation of 1920 , which squeezed from twenty to thirty billions out of the farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took part in the revolt against Cannonism . That was just a flurry for most of the insurgents . Characteristically he kept on fighting after the others had quieted down . The House rules were not reformed as a result of that Cannon controversy . So as late as the Sixty-fourth Congress he made a lone effort " to break the power of the bosses . " He staged a one-man filibuster , objecting to all " unanimous consent business , " seeking thus to force the masters of the House to act on four remedial amendments he had presented . He did not succeed , because it was physically impossible for a single individual to stay on the job every minute for the weeks that were needed to win . Charles A. Lindbergh did not stand for reelection to the House in 1916 . The World War was raging . We hadnot entered " the hell-storm , " as he called it ; but he foresaw our participation and the reaction it would bring . That meant bigger , more vital struggles for him . He could return to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger election contests in order that more people might be reached . The governorship of Minnesota or a seat in the Senate was what ha must seek  --  unselfishly , I think . He was anti-war , from start to finish . " Probably I 'll go down , " he said to me , shortly before the war vote was taken and he was defeated by a narrow margin . He returned to Minnesota , and spoke his convictions wherever he went . He was mobbed more than once , by the war-frenzied . But he was not in the least afraid . The supremest test of courage comes when one confronts the unknown . Charles A. Lindbergh , Sr. , was above all superstition . He faced death , as he did life , with absolute fearlessness . Pioneers are much the same the world over . Lindbergh the elder was as truly a trail-blazer as is his son . The boy , fortunately , , tackled something that could be demonstrated at once . The father had ideas which were a generation ahead of the popular capacity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
