Recently , the Shipping Board invited bids for the purchase of 200 of its tied-up steel ships for scrapping . While the offer was out , at President Coolidge 's urging , the Board agreed that henceforward the disposal of Government ships should be in the hands of the Emergency Fleet Corporation . The reason was that the Corporation , headed by one man ( Admiral Leigh C. Palmer ) , was in a better situation to conduct negotiations decisively and effectively than the Board , with several members . The Board merely reserved the right to pass on the offers for ships which Admiral Palmer recommended for acceptance . <P> Two weeks ago , 20 bids were received for the purchase of the 200 ships offered for scrapping . Last week , Admiral Palmer recommended that the high bid , that of the Boston Iron and Metal Co. of Baltimore for $1,370,000 , be accepted . Promptly the Board rejected the bid and reopened negotiations , hoping to get a better price-practically restoring the status quo by taking the power of negotiation again into its own hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none from Henry Ford appeared , although he said he had sent one . Since then he has made a bid which will be considered in the final award . <P> Some observers predicted that this action would result in the President 's requesting Congress to dissolve the Shipping Board . For long the Administration has regarded the Board as ineffective , muddling , unbusinesslike , and has wished to transfer control of the Government 's fleet to the Emergency Fleet Corporation . The Board has steadily fought to retain its powers , seeking by lip service to the President to convince Congress that there was no need to have it shorn of its powers . Sooner or later , say observers , there will be a showdown .
