Dire and inexorable figures were released , last week , by Great Britain 's aristocratic Minister of Labor , Sir Arthur Herbert Drummond Ramsay Steel-Maitland , LL.D . Though it must have galled him to do so , Sir Arthur was obliged to announce that more Britons are now out of work than at any time since the catastrophic General Strike of 1926 . <P> A year ago 9.9% of Great Britain 's registered workpeople were unemployed ; but the figure crept up to 11.8 last November , and to 12.2 as a bleak New Year came . Correspondents found out what this means in terms of misery , last week , when they went out to Wales and visited the great coal properties of Viscountess Rhondda , admittedly one of the most humane and generous coal operators in the Empire . Appalling was too mild a word for conditions seen . <P> So slack is work that even employed miners earn no more than the 29 shillings weekly ( $7 ) which is paid by the State as a " dole " to the unemployed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even men nominally " employed " are seldom given work more than three days a week . <P> Churches were found closed for want of money to pay a parson . Public houses were boarded up for lack of pennies to buy beer . Miners interviewed repeatedly , said that throughout the Rhondda mining area most families can buy meat not oftener than once a week , seeming to live principally on bread , margarine , tea . At the local Teachers Union an instructor allowed himself to be anonymously quoted thus : <P> " Most of these people have not had a new stitch of clothing or a new pair of shoes since the General Strike , two years ago . . . . Maybe they listened a bit to the Bolshevik then , but that 's all over now . . . . There 's no fight left in any of them . All they want is a chance to work so they can eat . . . . Nobody steals around here . There 's nothing to steal . Half the people have n't a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . " <P> Throughout the week starving British coal miners were cheered by but one fact , the stupendous response of the British public to a radio appeal made by Edward of Wales , on Christmas Day , for contributions to relieve the miners. * Since His Royal Highness spoke more than 320,000 ( $1,555,000 ) directly elicited by his words has poured in . For every pound Sterling contributed the Treasury stands pledged by Parliament to contribute a matching pound . Even with all this stop-gap and state charity , however , Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin seems impotent to devise a constructive scheme which will really stem the tide of unemployment . <P> <P> *A possible contribution would be all or part of Lord ( London Daily Mail ) Beaverbrook 's 25,000 thanks offering , which he offered for having escaped serious injury last week in an automobile accident .
