txt FRENCH FAITH IN LEAGUE . Millerand and Leygues Quoted Against Mr. Beck . To the Editor of The New York Times : In supplementing the evidence adduced by your editorial article and that adduced by Mr. Fosdick in- reply to Mr. Beck 's letter , may I quote the following passages from the message of President Millerand and Premier Leygues of France , delivered on Sept. 25 before the Chamber a Deputies ? President Millerand  --  Our democracy builds legitimate hopes on the progress of the League of Nations . Premier Leygues  --  Regarding foreign affairs ? ? ? to make of the League of Nations a living , powerful organism to end the era. of great wars . Mr. Beck  --  Those who have had any opportunity to discuss the matter in France know that France has no faith in the League of Nations , and outside of a few zealots , publicists , like Mr. Bourgeois , it never did have , except as it regarded the League as a means of bringing the United States into the entanglements of European quarrels . Mr. Beck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Millerand and Leygues were elected by a crushing majority . ? They believe in the League . Surely Mr. Beck must have conferred , not with the great leaders of France , but with a few " zealots , " such as we have in our Senate at Washington . Nearly every objection raised to the League of Nations has been raised on foundations of sand . Example : Mr. Beck and his conviction that France " has no faith in the League . " N. J. CASSAVETES. - New York , Sept. 27 , 1920 . Search for the Covenant . To the Editor of The New York Times : I should like to add my voice to that of your Chicago correspondent , described in your editorial article of Sept. 23 . The question of the ratification of the League of Nations covenant Is the most important Issue of the campaign , and yet only " interpretations " are known to the mass of the . Voters . The " dyed-in-the-wool " Republicans and Democrats are going to vote their party Vckets regardless of issues , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everybody knows that the independents are going to decide this campaign . I , like you , thought that every library would have a copy of the covenant , but in this city ( population 30,000 ) the librarian said she knew of no book in which it could be found and had been recommending that the numerous inquirers buy a copy ; of The World Almanac . Accidentally I found it in the back , of March 's " History of the World War . " Incidentally , there is no voter of my acquaintance , intelligent or otherwise , who has to my knowledge read the original covenant of the League of Nations . Everybody has read " interpretations , " however . E. M. EWING . Asheville . N. C .. Sept. 25 , 1920 . Asphalt . To the Editor of The New York Times : The news article yesterday morning describing the $3,000,000 asphalt plant fire at Maurer , N. J. , contained a rather curious bit of misinformation in the form of a statement that the plant was engaged in making asphalt out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is either obtained directly from petroleum refineries or in the natural state where the volatile constituents of Petroleum have been given off through long periods of time , it creates quite a mistaken impression to describe asphalt as being derived from tar , which is produced mainly from coal and gas and which would be entirely incapable of creating the smooth , resilient pavement of Fifth Avenue and many other New York streets . Asphalt is now produced in great quantities at the large oil refineries , particularly those which use crude oils from California and Mexico . More than three-fifths of all of our high-grade street paving is laid with asphalt , E.nd this would be out of the question it it were a tar product . As asphalt is not a patented material and is not controlled by any one producer any more than is any other petroleum product , it may be regarded as one of Nature 's gifts to an , and it literally helps to " smooth the way " for him . J. E. PENNYBACKER . Secretary the Asphalt Association . New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The New York Times : What is Harding 's real mentalcy ? Is there anything behind his profundicies except stupidicy ? New York , Sept. 29 , 1920.
