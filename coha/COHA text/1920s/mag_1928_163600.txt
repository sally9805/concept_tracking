The Lords and Commons reassembled last week , from a generously long Easter recess , and briskly sat to business : <P> A new " Red Scare " was set palpitating in the Commons by Sir William ( " Jix " ) Joynson-Hicks , pious and reactionary Home Secretary . <P> With an air of crying " Boo ! " Sir William revealed that Scotland Yard had just rounded up a gang of Irish smugglers of arms , in London , and had traced banknotes found in their possession to " a Russian bank in this country ! " <P> When the House received this revelation with equanimity , Sir William nursed his suckling Scare and took it before a Conservative rally at Leamington , where he cried : " We are asked to put up with the subsidizing of crime by a Russian bank in this country . . . . There is a direct chain from the Russian bank to Communist agitators in all the great cities of this land . ... I have the most complete evidence . . . . " <P> Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation before the House ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) , Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin was sorely nettled , last week , when Labor hecklers peppered him with questions designed to make him admit that the Flappers Bill is actually opposed by three leading members of his Cabinet : Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill , Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain , and Secretary of State for India the Earl of Birkenhead . <P> Only in the case of the Earl did hecklers score . They reminded Mr. Baldwin that Lord Birkenhead had recently written in the Good Housekeeping magazine ( British ) : " The incursion of women into . industry and politics has failed , is failing , and must of necessity fail . " <P> When the Prime Minister was asked how such a statement could be squared with the Cabinet 's support of the Votes For Flappers Bill , he frowned and brusquely replied : " If there has been an error of judgment on Lord Birkenhead 's part , that is the worst that I can say . " <P> Amid cries of " Hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Lord of the Admiralty William Clive Bridgeman announced that the Admiralty Board has , in effect , reversed the moral implication of the sentences of " Guilty " recently passed at Gibraltar upon two officers of the Royal Navy who had complained against the shameful conduct and awful oaths of their superior , Rear Admiral Bernard St. Collard ( TIME , March 26 et seq . ) . <P> Mr. Bridgeman revealed that Oath Swearer Collard would be compulsorily retired as " unfit for high command , " * whereas the two officers convicted of technical misconduct in complaining against him will receive fresh commands at sea , " as soon as vacancies appear . " A fresh sensation stirred when one of the officers slated for reinstatement , Commander H. M. Daniel , abruptly resigned from the Royal Navy , last week , and joined the staff of the newspaper which has been loudest in his defense , the Daily Mail .
