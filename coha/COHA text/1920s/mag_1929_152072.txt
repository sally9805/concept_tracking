Perhaps the most striking tribute Edward of Wales was ever paid-or is ever likely to be paid-was voiced last week by notorious " Emperor " A. J. Cook , the ruthless apostle of " class war " who provoked the disastrous British General Strike ( TIME , May 10-24 , 1926 ) . Nine Tories out of ten would not disbelieve anyone who told them that Mr. Cook has actively plotted to topple down the British Throne . He has publicly " thanked God for Moscow ! " because from that city he received thousands of gold rubles to promote the General Strike . Just now the fortunes of " Emperor " Cook are at considerably lower ebb ; and as Secretary of the Coal Miners ' Federation he very thankfully waits upon the Lord Mayor 's Fund , administered to keep Out-of-work miners from starving . Last week the Lord Mayor of London , well-fed Colonel Sir John Edward Kynaston Studd , gave a luncheon at Mansion House and at the speakers ' table sat both Edward of Wales and " Emperor " Cook . <P> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor " got up and began to speak about the Prince 's personal investigation and disclosure of intolerable conditions among the starving miners ( TIME , Feb. 11 ) . " It is thanks to him and his example , " said Mr. Cook , " that I am able to come here without contaminating any one of you Tories . His conduct and attitude have shown that all mankind has qualities in common , one man with every other . He has proved to the miner and his wife and children that in this moment of great suffering they are not forgotten . " <P> " You , sir , " cried " Emperor " Cook huskily , turning directly to H. R. H. , " You , sir , have done a marvelous thing . Never was I so impressed as by your speech on Christmas night . I was with two Communist friends and when your name was announced to speak on behalf of the miners ' fund , they scoffed , but they listened to what you had to say and when you had finished , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets and gave what money they had to the fund . " <P> After luncheon " Emperor " Cook and the future King-Emperor shook hands as they left the table , and stood chatting for several minutes . <P> Next morning the Daily Sketch , London tabloid , printed an interview with " Emperor " Cook , quoted him thus : <P> " The question of monarchy has ceased to be an issue among the working classes . The Prince has been a chief factor in destroying my republicanism . I departed from my revolutionary opinions because the Prince departed from the orthodox conduct of royalty . He has broken the whole tradition of royalty and has made the British throne the safest in the world and himself the safest man in England . He is today the chief advocate of social reform in England . A year ago this statement would have met with hooting and indignation at any labor meeting , but now would receive cheers . " <P> Later " Emperor " Cook received the following telegram : " The political bureau of the Communist party in Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It reached a further stage at yesterday 's banquet in fawning adulation of a typical representative of the class which battens upon workers . "
