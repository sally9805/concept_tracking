The final House debate on the Johnson measure was enlivened by undignified antics . Representative James A. Gallivan , Democrat of Massachusetts , denounced the Ku Klux influence back of the measure . Said he : " You seem to forget that only the other day your ancestors were alien , the sons of England , and France , Ireland and Scotland , Germany , Italy , Poland , Russia and other lands . Wherever the immigrant has gone schools have sprung up , industries have flourished , trade has increased , wealth has multiplied , prosperity has bloomed and patriotism , peace , law , order , intelligence and happiness follow in his footsteps . " <P> Representative Elton Watkins , Democrat of Oregon , walked over to Sabath , Democrat of Illinois , one of the bill 's opponents . Gallivan called out : " Watch out for Watkins , he 's not with us ! " Watkins turned . " - ! " he cried , <P> " What do you mean ? " <P> " Just what I said , you ! " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium height , swung on the burly Gallivan , who used to be the toughest umpire-baiter on the Harvard ball teams of the 80's. * Members intervened and bore off the rash Oregonian before he could hurt himself . <P> Afterwards Mr. Gallivan explained the incident . " He said something nasty to me and I said something nastier . " <P> Mr. Watkins corroborated , in part . " He said something nasty . " <P> *Gallivan played shortstop.
