" Genius " GENIUS , " cried Haydon , ' darting at his can-vas like a lion after some temporary rebuff , " Genius is sent into the world not to obey laws , but to give them ! " For of course Haydon was a genius . Genius is written large all over his memoirs . But it is genius of a particular kind . It is not the Shakespearean but the Victorian genius , not the unconscious , but the conscious , not the true but ? let us pause , however , and read kiaydon 's autobiography ( now reprinted with a brilliant introduction by Mr. Huxley ) before we decide what kind of genius his was . That it was violent in its symptoms and remorseless in its severity is evident . Of all those men and women who have been stricken with genius ? and the number in the British Isles must be great ? none suffered more , or was more terribly its victim than the inspired boy with weak eyes who should have been a bookseller in his father 's shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be a great painter , to honor his country , and to " rescue the Art from that stigma of incapacity which was impressed on it . " He came to London . He made friends with Wilkie . He lived and painted in one room , and there , night after night , Wilkie , Du Fresne , Doctor Millingen , McClaggan , Allan ( " the celebrated painter " ) and Callender all met and drank his good tea out of his large cups and argued about art and politics and divinity and medicine and how Marie Antoinette 's head was cut off ( Du Fresne said he had been present and had flung his red cap into the air ) while Liz of Rathbone Place , who loved their talk but was otherwise cold , sided with one , attacked another , and was found studying Reid on the I-Iuman Mind " with an expression of profound bewilderment . " " Happy period ! " Haydon burst out , " no servants ? no responsibilities ? reputation on the bud ? ambition beginning , friends untried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not been for the demon which possessed him ? the devil which made him , even in those early days , indite letters , which Liz applauded , against the might of the Royal Academy , and vow to bring about their humiliation and the triumph of High Art by vast pictures of Dentatus and Macbeth and Solomon which took months to paint , filled his living room with the reek of oil , required that he should rdissect the forequarters of an ass and go without meat and run into debt , for , as he soon found out , " the expenses of a work of High Art in England are dreadful . " / But there was another consequence of his prepossession . High Art being of necessity large art into the bargain only the great- nobles could afford it , and in consequence the simple life with Liz and big cups of tea was abandoned for the , life , or - at least the dinner tables , of the Mulgraves and the Beaumonts and any other Lord or Lady who could be hypnotized into the belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Achilles in the drawing room , and to their credit to have a man of genius talking very loud and very big at their board . Hay-. don , rapt in his burning enthusiasm for the heroic , for the Elgin Marbles and for himself , took it all seriously . He entertained fashion all day long . Instead of painting , " I walked . about my room , looked into the glass , anticipated what the foreign ambassadors would say , " and seriously believed , when the beauties put up their eyeglasses and lisped their admiration , that his fortune was made and that " all the sovereigns of Europe would hail with delight an English youth who could paint an heroic picture . " But he was disillusioned . The great , he found , care not for art , but for what people say about pictures . " Dear Lord Mulgrave " lost his faith in Dentatus when he heard it criticized . Sir George Beaumont shillied and shallied and said at last that Macbeth was too big and Lady Beaumont had no room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wanted another extraordinary young man , for Wilkie was an old story , and I was a nuisance . " " And so , artists , " he concluded , summing up all that he had suffered from his patrons , but letting us infer too how boldly he had corrected them and how terribly he had bored them : " And so , Artists , be humble and discreet ! " He proved the wisdom of his own saying by marrying , in spite of his debts , a widow with two children , and by having , in quick succession , six more children of his own . With all this weight upon his shoulders he sank steadily more and more deeply into the mud . For his genius never deserted him . It was always flourishing irresistible subjects before his eyes . He was always rushing at his canvas and " rubbing in " the head of Alexander " gloriously " or dashing off some gigantic group of warriors and lions when his room was bare of furniture , his wife screaming in childbirth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying in the cradle . Where a smaller man would have found his private difficulties enough , Haydon took upon himself the cares of the world . ' He was passionately interested in politics , in the Reform bill , in the Trades Union movement , in the success of the British arms . Above all , he was the champion of High Art in England . He must badger Wellington , Peel and every minister in turn to employ young English painters to decorate Westminster Hall and the Houses of Parliament . - Nor could he let the Royal Academy sleep in peace . His friends begged him to stop : but no " The idea of being a Luther or a John Knox in art got the better of my reason . . . . I attacked the Acad. emy , ' with the result that " I had brought forty men and all their high connections on my back at twenty-six years old , and there was nothing left but Victory or Westminster Abbey . 1 made up my mind for the conflict , and ordered at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to Victory and Westminster Abbey lay a more sordid lodging house , through which Haydon passed four times ? the Kings Bench prison . Servants and children , he noted , became familiar with the signs of an approaching execution . He himself learnt how to pawn and how to buttonhole , how to flatter the sheriff 's officer , how to bombard the great ( who were certainly generous if they were not clever ) , how to wring the hearts of landlords , whose humanity was extraordinary ; but one thing he could not do ? deny the demands of his own genius . Portrait painting was an obvious resource . But then how odious to paint a little private individual , a mere Mayor , or Member of Parliament , when one 's head was swarming with Solomons and Jerusalems and Pharaohs and Crucifixions and Ma.cbeths 1 He could scarcely bring himself to do it . One could make them larger than life , it is true , but then the critics sneered , and said that if the ex-Mayor was the size that Haydon painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paltry work . " The trash that one is obliged to talk ! The stuff that one is obliged to copy ! The fidgets that are obliged to be borne ! My God ! . . . " The name of God was often on his lips . He was on terms of cordial intimacy with the Deity . He could not believe that one great spirit could consent to the downfall of another . God and Napoleon and Nelson and Wellington and Haydon were all of the same calibre , all in the grand style . His mind harped on these great names constantly . And , indeed , though poor Mrs : Haydon would smile when he bade her " trust in God " his trust was often justified . He left his house in the morning with the children fighting , with Mary scolding , with no water in the cistern , to trudge all day from patron to pawn shop , and come home at night " tired , croaking , grumbling and muddy " when , just as hope seemed extinct , a letter arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . Once more they were saved . With it all , he declared , he was a very happy man , pink and plump , in spite of all his worries , when Wilkie , who led an abstemious bachelor 's life , was cadaverous and plaintive . Now and again they took the children to the sea , or snatched an afternoon in Kensington Gardens , and if they were in the depths of despair on Wednesday , as likely as not some stroke of fortune would put them into the seventh Heaven on Thursday . Then there were his friends ? Keats and Lamb and Wordsworth and Scott ? arid his walks and his arguments and his supper parties with them . He had above all a mind which was forever tossing and tumbling , like a vigorous and active dolphin , in the seas of thought . " I never feel alone , " he wrote . " With visions of ancient heroes , pictures of Christ , principles of An-dent Art , humorous subjects , deductions , sarcasms against the Academy , piercing remembrances of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write , conceive , fall asleep . . . my mortality at being fatigued . " The power which drove him to these extremities did at least reward him with some of its delights . - But as the symptoms of inspiration multiply -- this passionate joy in creation , this conviction of a divine mission ? one asks oneself what then is false , for falsity there certainly seems to be . First there is something in the superabundance of protest , in the violence of inspiration , which rouses suspicion ; next these vast pictures of crowds , armies , heroes , raptures , agonies , begin even as he sketches them in words to wound our eyes with their floridity , their rhetoric ; and finally we catch ourselves thinking , as some felicity of phrase flashes out , or some pose or arrangement makes its effect , that his genius is a writer 's . He should have held a pen , not a brush . Of all painters , surely he was the best read . " The truth is I am fonder of books than of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his Shakespeare and his Homer when his lay figure had to go to the pawnbroker . There was even one moment when he doubted his own vocation and accused the sublime art of hampering his powers . His instinct to express himself in words was undeniable . Overworked as he was , he always found time to write a diary which is in no way perfunctory but follows with ease and sinuosity the ins and outs of his life . Phrases form naturally at the tip of his pen . " He sat and talked easily , lazily , gazing at the sun with his legs crossed , " he says of Chantrey . " Poor fellow , " he wrote , on hearing that Wilkie was buried at sea , " I wonder what the fish think of him , with their large glassy eyes in the gurgling deep . " Always his painter 's eye lights up his phrase , and scenes which must have been offensive in paint shape themselves naturally and rightly in Wor &.; If only his genius , when it descended from the heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about I But if it had bungled , his genius was unrelenting . Paint he must ; paint he did . The whole world turned against his painting in the end . His cartoons were rejected ; the public went to see Tom Thumb and left his last exhibition deserted ; he could only struggle along by tossing off pictures of Napoleon Musing at the rate of one in two hours and a half . Even his prayers now come to sound a little hoarse and his protests without conviction . He darted , it is true , at another canvas , finished the Saxon Lord , dashed , in Alfred , and " worked , " he declared , " gloriously . " But one morning , the strain overcame him . He blew his brains out . They found him dead before his easel , and Alfred and the First British Jury was sprinkled with his blood . So genius had claimed her victim . And if we seek now any relic of December 29 , 1926 THE NEW all those acres of canvas , those crowds of heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean white walls , people comfortably dining , and a vague rumor that a big picture did once hang here , but the management took it away when the place was done up . All is gone ; Allan " the celebrated painter , " Du Fresne , who saw Marie Antoinette executed ; Millingen , Liz of Rathbone Place , canvases beyond count ; but still the pages that he scribbled without thought of Genius or Art or Posterity remain holding vividly before our eyes the struggling , greedy life with all its black smoke and its flame .
