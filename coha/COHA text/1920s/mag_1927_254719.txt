Remembered now mainly for a tag about one born a minute which has been tied to his name , he was once notorious for his irreligion , notable for his oratory , famed for his political victories , defamed for drunken outbursts of atheism . Son of a Congregational minister , the future spellbinder was taken from Dresden , N.Y. , to Wisconsin at 10 , in 1843 . The Illinois bar admitted him in 1854 and soon the juries were his almost before he addressed them . He organized his own cavalry troop in 1861 but led it into Confederate captivity in 1862 . His political fame followed his election as Attorney General of Illinois in 1867 . His oratorical prowess became nationally known when he arose to nominate James G. Blaine at the Republican presidential convention of 1876 . Thereafter his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brand of godlessness-a succession of vermilion episodes , epigrams , epistles . <P> Episodes : Candidate for Governor of Illinois , Atheist Ingersoll is asked to state his allegiance to the Christian Church . " Man to man , Bob ! " " What ? " " What about it ? " " Why , damn it , just this . My beliefs are my own and I would n't sacrifice one of them to be president of the whole rolling earth . Going ? Well , take another cigar . " <P> Epistles : To deny he will accept nomination for Attorney General- " When I say I am a candidate for a particular office I mean it ; and when I say I am not a candidate for a particular office , I mean that , too .

" <P> The Significance . After contemplating Walt Whitman , styled by him The Magnificent Idler , Author Rogers steps up to look at another post-Civil War celebrity , styled " perfect man , " " drunken atheist , " equal of Demosthenes . The biographer 's literary luggage is this time a collapsible suitcase full of modern stylistic , analytical , rhetorical tricks which make Ingersoll 's oldtime silver - tongued bombast seem , by contrast , like the noises of a nickleplated nickleodeon . Undeniably , Colonel Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , a sun about which minor political planets moved , forming an Ingersollar system .
