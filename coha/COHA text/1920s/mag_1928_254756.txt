Last week was flood season for scientific conventions , conferences , symposia , and the professors attended them well . <P> AT NASHVILLE , TENN . <P> Greatest meeting was that of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Nashville , Tenn . Thither journeyed some 3,000 scientists . They listened to nimble discussions on mathematics , physics , meteorology , zoology , geography , botony , entomology . <P> Physical Theories . " A physical theory does not represent what we might call a real truth . A physical theory is a collection of fundamental hypotheses and general laws , which may be used to deduce particular laws that can be applied to concrete facts . Physical theories are useful , if they explain a large number of facts in simple ways , and if they furnish definitions of terms and a nomenclature to be used in describing phenomena . Physical theories are tools and not creeds , but one is at liberty to believe they represent reality , if one wants to . The belief in a physical theory , however , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The greater the number of useful physical theories that are proposed , the greater the number of good tools we shall have at our disposal , to use in discovering the real truth about the way in which nature acts ; for it is the way in which nature acts that is the prime object of physical research . The multiplicity of theories in physics to-day really represents a healthy growth . " - Professor William Duane of Harvard . <P> Group Thinking . A psychological query has been : Which can think with greater swiftness and accuracy-a group of men or an individual ? Applied to business affairs the query is : Can a board of directors or a president best manage a company ? Professor Goodwin Barbour Watson of Columbia University sought a solution by testing smart Columbia students . To each he gave a nine-letter word ( as neurotics , education , secondary , universal ) , and told him to write out as many three-letter words as he could devise from the letters in the long word . After ten minutes Professor Watson called time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best 49 , and the average 32 . Then the professor offered similar words to groups , telling the members of the groups to shout out the three-letter words as they constructed them . The average group record for ten minutes community-thinking was practically 75 words , more than twice the individual record . Therefore , reasoned Profesor Watson , for at least simple problems group thinking is better than individual thinking .
