It was reported from Washington that Attorney General Daugherty looked worn and tired . If so , his fatigue may well have been caused by the repeated reports in the daily press that he was about to resign- " tomorrow , " " within 48 hours , " etc . For the first week , at least , the reports were unfounded . It was even declared positively that the President had asked for Mr. Daugherty 's resignation . If so , he was slow in tendering it . After a conference with the President , the Attorney General departed on a " mysterious " trip to Chicago . He attended the final sessions of the grand jury which indicted Charles R. Forbes , former Director of the Veterans ' Bureau , for fraud . <P> All week there was a resolution pending in the Senate to investigate Mr. Daugherty 's conduct of the Veterans ' Bureau ( TIME , Mar. 3 ) . Mr. Daugherty had specifically invited an investigation . While still in Chicago , anticipating that an investigation would be authorized , Mr. Daugherty appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland to defend him . Said he : <P> " They will give such attention as may be necessary in my personal behalf so that the regular force of the Department and I may continue to give our attention to the Government business . " <P> Meanwhile , the Senate was enjoying much discourse on the subject of passing the resolution authorizing the investigation . The resolution had been offered by Senator Burton K.

Charges flew back and forth - that Senator Wheeler was trying to pack the committee with opponents of the Attorney General , that the regular Republicans were preparing a whitewashing committee to be named by the President of the Senate . <P> In the debate Senators Willis and Fess , Republicans of Ohio , were the only outspoken defenders of Mr. Daugherty , although Senator Bruce , Democrat of Maryland , attempted to restrain the ardor of the Democrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed : " It strikes me that the Senate is reaching rather a low level . I hope this is not a school of scandal . " <P> In the course of the struggle , the preamble , containing much objurgation , was stricken from the resolution and the word " alleged " was inserted before the charges to be investigated . A compromise was reached whereby the investigating committee was to be elected by the Senate . <P> With these changes , the resolution was passed 66 - 1 , the only adverse vote being cast by Senator Davis Elkins , Republican of West Virginia , who , it is known , does not intend to stand for reelection . The resolution :
