 | I N REALITY I am a home body . Fate has mapped out an adventurous career for me , and I manage somehow to live up to its requirements , but at heart I am not much different from the stay-at-home girl who started housekeeping fourteen years ago in a flat in Independence , Kansas . I am sure it was the prettiest flat in Independence . If I close my eyes , I can see every room just as it was , down to the bric-a-brac ? wedding presents , of course ? on the mantelpieces . Yet we lived in it only a few months . Since then we have had no place that could be called home , in the accepted sense of the word . Whenever we have settled down at all , it has been in furnished apartments , surrounded by other people 's belongings ? things dead and meaningless to us . We have never settled down for long .

During most of the time , we have cruised in the South Seas , not among the islands of romance and beauty you read about in stories , but among the gloomy , sinister Melanesian islands , where sullen black people live wretched lives in the tangled jungle . A little over two years ago , we went to Kenya Colony ? British East Africa they called it when I studied geography ? to hunt big game with the camera . We both think Africa is the most wonderful land in all the world . We have been home for less than six months , but already we have made our plans for going back , and by Christmas we hope to be well  | on our way to " British East , " this time for a five-years ' stay . I say that we have been " home , " but as I write the word it has a false ring . " Home " has come to mean to me , not a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilds . I am restless and vaguely unhappy in New York . It is a city that fills me full of wants . I want to be lazily luxurious . I want to own the lovely , silken things I see in the shops . I want to be as beautiful and alluring as all the beautiful , alluring women I see on Fifth Avenue . I want gaiety and amusement ? dancing , theaters , dinner-parties . I always go on an orgy of civilization when I return to New York . And yet somehow I am never content . The wants are never satisfied ; the excitement and the noise and hurry tire me . After a few weeks I find myself longing to go home to the wilderness , where I can plod along over some we11-beaten game-trail and feel myself queen cf all I survey ? a queen with a sunburned nose , with faded khaki blouse and " shorts " for royal robes , and with a tatterdemalion retinue of negro servants for attendants . I n e v e r dreamed when I married Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure . I knew that Martin had roamed about ever since he was a boy of sixteen . He had been through the South Seas with Jack London and always talked of the cruise with longing in his voice . But I thought , and he thought , too , that he had settled down . My little flat in Independence bounded my horizon . I was young ? far too young , the Independence gossips said ? to be married , and like many girls , I regarded marriage as a crowning achievement . One married ; one settled down ; after that life flowed smoothly and with pleasant monotony to the grave . Perhaps it was because I was so young that in spite of my pretty flat and my big handsome husband whom I adored I was constantly homesick during that first year in Independence . I was an only daughter . My mother and I had always been the closest of companions , and nowImissedher intolerably . I missed her all the more because Martin , who was owner and manager of a motion-picture theater , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely evenings were unendurable . I knew that my mother was lonely , too . She lived in a little town just an hour away by train , so every few weeks I would pick up and go to visit her . Sometimes I stayed until Martin came for me . But one day I had to make a choice between a flat in Independence and a life spent in travel , between civilization and the wilderness ? I might almost say between my mother and my husband . Martin came to my mother 's house to fetch me . I had been there three weeks . On the way home , he was glum and silent . I felt like a martyr . Surely he could not expect me to stay alone in my flat evening after evening ! Did he think just because I had married him I never wanted to see my mother again ?  | When we arrived at the little flat , Martin sat down in silence . I sat on the other side of the room , waiting for him to speak . Finally he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stand this life any longer . I have to get out and do something . I 'm tired of tending a movie in a little town . I 'm going away . " I looked at him , wide-eyed . My throat went dry . But I made my choice instinctively . " If you go , I 'm going too ! " I did go , too , and since then I have traveled with Martin from one end of the world to the other . I suppose we shall lead a gipsy existence until we die . But I am still a home body . The only difference between me and millions of other wives is that I make a home " on the go . " In the beginning it was very humble indeed , this traveling home ? a tiny cutter , tossing from island to island of the blue Pacific , a grass hut on some savage island of Melanesia , the arched roots of a banyan tree , or sometimes all outdoors , with the sky for a roof . We traveled light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurious supplies or elaborate equipment . I did my own work . I washed and ironed and sewed and cooked . And between times I learned to take a man 's share in the work of exploration . I soon could keep up over the difficult jungle trails . I learned to shoot , to manage a boat , and though I had no genius for photography , I learned also to handle a motion-picture camer a and to act as my husband 's assistant in the dark room . AND then we went to Africa . We made our first headquarters in Nairobi , the capital of Kenya Colony . Nairobi is a modern city , with shops and motion-picture theaters and electric lights and taxicabs and a traffic policeman . But if you live in the outskirts of the town you are likely at any time to meet a wild-eyed zebra that has strayed into the streets and does n't know how to find its way out . Or you are likely to come home , as Martin and I did one day , to find your hen-coop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go for a spin from Nairobi to the Athi river , connected with the capital by thirty miles of good road , you feel as if you were living in Noah 's ark . The plains through which you pass are simply crawling with game , and for some inexplicable reason , the herds of animals you startle along the way feel impelled to outdistance your automobile and cross the road in front of it . Zebras , antelopes , ostriches , all leave their feeding and take to their heels at your approach , cross the road in a whirl of dust under your very tires , and then stand quietly to see you pass . Only the baboons are content to sit still and scold at you from the roadside . The mammoth animals that are left over in Africa from prehistoric times ? rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses and elephants and giraffes ? are almost next-door neighbors in Nairobi . So are the great , black-maned African lions . An hour or so from the city , and you may run into any of them . We were scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on our arrival in Nairobi before servants began applying to us for positions . By evening , a score of negro boys were squatting on the lawn outside . Each was armed with from one to fifty well-worn letters of recommendation , most of which were phrased with adroit ambiguity : " Mohammed is a fairly good cook . I never saw him stealing . " " Fundi was my house-boy for three months . He does as well as he can . " Since we knew nothing of wages or conditions of work , we sent all the applicants away and told them to come back next day , by which time we hoped to have advice . Early on the following morning a servant  | brought me my breakfast before I was up . Ile was a big , fine-looking negro , clad in a spotless white skull-cap and konsa , the flowing , nightshirt-like garment that is the livery of Kenya Colony . " Good-morning . You better ? " he asked in polite , hospital tones . His service was so neat and deft and respectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the manager of the hotel . " Aloni , " he replied . " Your bedroom boy . " After a bit more questioning I discovered that I was his employer . Ile had hired him-self ? We were permitted to choose the remainder of our staff . We ended by ignoring letters of recommendation entirely and selected the applicants that looked cleanest and most honest . First of all , we engaged two head men named Jerrymani and Ferraragi for our safari . " Safari " means expedition . In Africa , once you are off the single line of railway and the few automobile roads , an expedition must usually be made on foot , for in many sections the dreaded tsetse fly makes the use of horses and other beasts of burden impossible . We walked literally thousands of miles in Africa . And attending us , carrying food and tents and equipment , we had an escort varying from forty to one hundred and ten porters , according to the length and duration of our journeys into the wilderness . Some porters are trained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from remote hill villages . Few of them know any language save their own tribal tongue . The first requirement of a safari , accordingly , is an efficient head man , or head men , to direct and control them . Jerrymani and Ferraragi were lucky choices , Jerrymani especially . He had been big game hunting with Colonel Roosevelt , and though he was outwardly just a burly , happygo-lucky negro ? a born mimic who was forever showing off his accomplishment , imitating every conceivable sound from the roar of a lion to the screech of a motor-horn ? he had a way with the porters that was nothing short of marvelous . He kept them happy on the hardest march with his jokes and his chaffing , and yet he never for a moment relaxed his authority over them . Ferraragi was more serious , but he was as faithful as Jerrymani . He was my gunbearer ( Jerrymani was Martin 's ) , and though he was not permitted to fire the guns he carried , and could not have hit anything if he had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never flinched . JERRIMANI and Ferraragi were royally paid at twenty-five dollars a month . The cook , as is usual in every land , was the aristocrat of our household staff . While the other servants received only from two and a half to six dollars a month , he received sixteen , and he had an assistant to do such onerous work as paring vegetables , and a scullery boy to look after the pans . The cook 's name was Joanna , but since that had a feminine and inappropriate ring , we called him simply " Mpishi , " which is Swahili for cook . Mpishi 's work costume consisted of a smock-like shirt , khaki " shorts , " tattered socks , and a pair of some one 's castoff hoots . But on Sundays he was gorgeous in starched white trousers , part of a pair of suspenders , and a straw hat perched airily on the top of his head . Two shamba , or garden boys , and Zabenelli and the Toto completed our household staff . Zabenelli was our interpreter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Besides Aloni , he was the only one of our servants who spoke English . The Toto , or the " Kid , " as his name would be in English , was an apprentice bedroom boy , Aloni 's assistant . He was only twelve years old ? a grinning youngster , always spotlessly neat in khaki shorts and starched white shirt and cap . When he carried my basket to market for me , he added a jaunty cerise sash to his costume and swung his hips in conscious pride as he walked along behind me . With this staff of servants we took up our headquarters in our bungalow in the outskirts of Nairobi . Our house was more of a work-shop than a home . Martin converted half of it into an up-to-date laboratory in which to develop his motion-picture films . The largest of the remaining rooms was set aside as the safari room , where we stored our equipment and packed what we needed for our excursions into the " Blue . " In the rest of the space we camped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should spend very little time in Nairobi . The member of our party that appreciated our headquarters most was Kalawat . Kalawat is a little gray Gibbon ape from Borneo . She was only a few weeks old when we got her , and we brought her up " by hand . " She is as dependent as a child upon us , and we are somehow as fond of her as if she were human . She goes with us everywhere we go . Kalawat was so young , when she left Borneo , that she had never had a taste of the natural joys of monkeydom . She had never swung in a tree . She had developed her muscles instead on the curtains and chandeliers of a New York apartment . Now , suddenly , she was in an ape 's paradise . There was an acre of garden surrounding our house , and all about the edge was a row of tall evergreen trees planted about twenty feet apart . Kalawat took to those trees like a duck to water . Though she never ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and round the garden , swinging from one to another , literally by the hour . When she was tired of playing in the branches , she would pick posies and tear them to shreds , or she would gorge herself with fruit . Or sometimes she would do monkey tricks for a delighted audience of natives . I have seen as many as fifty blacks , market women in gay calicoes , with laden baskets on their backs and babies tucked into their blouses , village dandies dressed in skins and smeared with red clay , rickshaw men , porters , servants off duty , all standing convulsed with laughter , watching the antics of a very vain and selfconscious Kalawat . In that land of animals , we came to be known as " the people with the ape . " I WAS very nearly as happy in our garden as Kalawat was . I have always had a garden , whenever we have stopped long enough for seeds to sprout . In Nairobi a garden was sheer self-indulgence , for the markets offered everything in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my own garden , and such a garden as I had never had before . In it grew tropical fruits ? lemons and oranges and pineapples and guavas and bananas ? and side by side with them grew the fruits and vegetables of the temperate zone . Roses rioted everywhere . Flowers of all sorts grew so luxuriantly that they had to be curbed rather than encouraged . In front of the house the shamba boys made two great round flowerbeds , in which I set out quick-growing tropical dowers , red , white , and blue ; for though we are never at home in America , our traveling home is somehow always American , wherever it may be . But though I liked the lazy comfort of Nairobi , it is not that that means Africa to me . What I want to return to is the wilderness . There is nothing of " Darkest Africa " about that wilderness , any more than about Nairobi . It is a land of sunshine and health . Though the equator runs right through it , the altitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical and the temperate . The noonday sun may scorch , but at night you must sleep under blankets . It is very beautiful out in the Blue . There are great stretches of rolling plain spotted with herds of animals as far as eye can reach . There are peaceful wooded hills and valleys . There are long  | reaches of sandy desert ; broad , melancholy lava fields ; lonely lakes ; rivers , some swift , some sluggish and quiet , and teeming with fish . In the African Blue I am never bored or restless . There is always something to do , something strange and beautiful to see . And I am never tired . Each long cool night makes me over , and I rise ready for a new day . Our real home in Africa is a tent pitched miles off the beaten trail . I should say , rather , a series of tents . Every one travels luxuriously in Africa , for white people can not safely rough it on the equator . And we travel perhaps a bit more luxuriously than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most approved models . There is first a sleeping-tent equipped with specially made army cots , longer and wider than the usual army cot and provided with good mattresses . Folded canvas easy chairs and a folding writing table complete the furnishings . Off one end is a little bathroom with a folding canvas tub . When we come in after a day in the open , we always find great kettles of hot water for a refreshing bath steaming over the fire near Mpishi 's hut . PITCHED close to the bedroom tent is the dining-room ? simply a huge , thick tarpaulin roof , with open sides . That , too , has its folding table and chairs . Our dinner service is of white enamel . The complete kit for two persons fits together like a Chinese puzzle and is contained in a huge water pail . Beyond the dining-room is a store-tent , and a little way off is the cook-house , a grass hrt built by our porters in native style . A tiny village of grass huts , sleeping quarters for the cook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as can be persuaded to build them ( usually they are content to sleep in the open about a fire , each with a tattered blanket for covering ) , stands a bit apart . And tents and huts are all enclosed in a crude barricade of thorn-bush to keep out lions and leopards and thieving hyenas that will steal our very boots if we are not on our guard . Tomorrow we shall up stakes , and our porters will shoulder their loads and go chanting off into the unknown , and we shall follow them over trails made by the feet of generations of animals . But today , in our little circle of thorn-bush , we are at home . Tonight I shall lie in my cot and listen to the night sounds of Africa ? the pad of innumerable hoofs , the shrill , ridiculous toy-poodle bark of the zebras , the contagious , strangely human laugh of the hyenas , perhaps the angry snort of a suspicious rhinoceros , or the far-off , hollow , terrible , beautiful roar of the lion . I feel very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon drop off to sleep , and before I know it the sun is shining outdoors , and the cool morning air is fragrant with Mpishi 's bacon and coffee . Our canvas house on safari has something of the cozy intimacy of a playhouse . I often feel like a little girl playing at being grown up . And yet even on safari there is serious housekeeping to be done . My work begins before we set out , with the packing of the food to be taken along . Since a porter 's load is fixed by law at sixty pounds , everything ? tents , films , foodstuffs ? has to be made up into sixty-pound lots . Our food-boxes , or " chop-boxes , " as they are called in " British East , " each hold a week 's provision for two persons . Often I have to pack from eight to twelve of them at a time . Fancy doing your marketing and making your menus for two or three months ahead and not forgetting a single thing ! You ca n't run to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wilderness provides game and fish . Everything else you must bring with you . I shall never forget the time we found ourselves literally hundreds of miles from the nearest store with no salt . Luckily we had left over a handful of the coarse rock salt we used in preserving animal skins , and we husbanded that , crystal by crystal , until we got back to civilization . Our safari menus savored little of camp fare . Except that they lack fresh vegetables and abounded in game , they were not much dif-  | ferent from those we enjoy in New York . Before we went to Africa , we went on a spree of buying in wholesale grocery houses and stocked up with tinned luxuries of every description . We secured the most improbable things in cans ? roast beef and Lyonnaise potatoes and Welsh rabbit and sausages and cheese and puddings ? and we were lucky enough to discover an instant coffee that tasted like coffee and a tinned cream that did not taste of the tin . Into every chop box I put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables to flavor soup , dried fruits for pies and sauces , and canned asparagus and dill pickles to take the place of salad . Even in the wilderness , Mpishi served marvelous meals , beginning with what he called a " toastie " ? an appetizer made with whatever he could find to make it from ? and ending with apple pie that I taught him to make in good American style from canned dried apples . He baked the pie and excellent bread and biscuits , and roasted meats to a turn in an oven made from a huge roasting pan , the bottom filled with hot sand and the top piled over with red coals . I kept him provided with game and fish for his menus . While Martin was off photographing animals , I went , accompanied by my gun-bearer and two or three boys , on a ten-mile trek in the opposite direction , and when I was well out of gun shot sound , for I did not want to frighten the animals away from Martin 's camera , I looked about for meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " master " and the " missus , " and for the porters the gamey , fat zebra that they loved . Sometimes I got a brace of guinea fowl or plump spur fowl . If luck favored me , I brought home a greater bustard , bigger and tastier than a turkey . The Toto would have to turn it slowly on a spit over a bed of coals for nearly a day before it was roasted . When there was a river within reach , I went fishing . " Within reach " was anywhere within twenty miles of camp . But I never minded the long tramp across the plains , for I knew that there was no such thing as " fisherman 's luck " in Africa . In an hour I could pull in as many fish as two of my attendants could carry between them . Occasionally my marketing trips turned into adventures . Once , when I was fishing on the bank of a narrow stream , a big black buffalo rose up on the opposite shore . An African buffalo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has huge , black horns , a round and malignant eye , and the reputation of being one of the most ill-tempered beasts in Africa . Sometimes , when unexpected things happen , I get terribly frightened . But this time , my only thought was " Buffalo steak ! " There is nothing quite so good as buffalo steak . So I snatched my gun from my gun-bearer and dropped Mr. Buffalo neatly in his tracks . I was enormously pleased with myself when I got back to camp . But Martin was angry . " What if you had missed him ? " he kept saying . NOT every day was market day . Often I had humdrum duties to perform in camp , such as mending or straightening up . Even when your wardrobe is limited to very masculine underthings and khaki shirts and an assortment of overalls and " shorts " and riding breeches for the various wilderness occasions , it takes putting in order occasionally , especially when it is washed by Aloni , who pounds it on the stones in a muddy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , using a rock for an ironing table . One has to go very simply dressed in Africa for the sake both of convenience in getting around and of appearing inconspicuous to the animals . But I was always careful of my appearance . I do not think much of a home in which the woman half is frowsy and neglected . The fact that it is a traveling home is no excuse . I saw to it that my clothes were always clean and well-mended , and I paid as much at tention to my skin and my finger-nails and m ; hair as if I had been in New York City . As I sat in the shade of my tent , drying my hair or darning stockings , I looked out or strange sights . Sometimes wandering herd : of gazelles grazed near the camp . Sometime fifty zebras went flashing by at full gallop From time to time I captured a young creature that had wandered from its mother , and fec it until it was strong enough to shift for itself On a dull day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischievous as a child She would hide my spools from me , or she would torment the boys , snatching their caps and running chattering with them to the tof of the tallest tree . When we were in monkey country , she would sit on a rock wistfully " whooing " to her wild cousins . But if any of them approached , she would rush back to me and wind her arms about my neck in terror . ON DAYS when there were no domestic duties to be attended to , I went on expeditions with Martin , or under his direction I made some pictures from a " blind . " A blind is simply a little stone hut camouflaged with thorn-bush It is always situated near a water-hole , where animals come to drink . Hidden in a blind , you can take pictures of animals that would be off like the wind if they once caught sight of you . We used to go to the blinds before daylight . We set off in velvety dark and went across the plains on foot . Herds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes a rhinoceros would rise , snorting and sniffling , from under our very feet . Then I would jump and quicken my pace . Sometimes we heard the roar of a lion . It always sounded very distant , but hunters told us that the lion was a ventriloquist and could make himself sound further away than he really was to deceive his prey , so I never felt quite easy . Once we reached the blind , Martin would set up the camera for me , and the boys would arrange my canvas easy chair and my supply of food and magazines , and then they would all go off , leaving me to wait alone for dawn and the animals . The animals usually appeared in the distance with the first light . But they were always very suspicious , and sometimes they would hesitate for hours before they mustered up courage to drink . At last , they would step cautiously down to the water-hole and drink in little sips , looking up every moment to see if there was an enemy in sight , and sniffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear off , and they would he themselves . To sit in a blind is like attending a play . The animals quarrel and converse amiably ? you understand every word . Sometimes a halfdozen species meet at a single pool ? zebras , two or three kinds of gazelles , the gnu , and the great gawky giraffe . Screaming tick-birds ride their backs , busily searching for vermin in their hides . Guinea fowls and spur-fowls flap from under their hoofs . Mr. Ostrich is the bully of the piece . He swaggers in and out among the animals , and they edge away from him , for they know the force of his powerful legs . I took many pictures from blinds , and some of them were almost as good as Martin 's . But the first ones I took were a ridiculous failure , I returned to camp at the end of an eventful day , sure that I had a perfect reel of film . But when we got back to Nairobi and developed it I found that I had filmed foot after foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs ? and nothing more . That failure was chiefly funny . But another failure on my part caused Martin to lose what would have been one of the best pictures of ow trip . One morning , while we were camped at Marsabit , away off in the desert toward the border of Abyssinia , Martin and I started off with two gun-bearers to look for pictures When we had gone only a little way from camp  | we saw a rhinoceros asleep under a tree . Martin set up the camera and told me to turn the crank when he gave the signal . Then he and Jerrymani walked slowly toward the rhino . He was very close to it before he held up his hand . I began turning the crank , but before I had made a half-dozen revolutions I stopped , transfixed with terror . The rhinoceros was on its feet , and by its side was another one . I AM not a very brave person . I know I do a great many things that seem courageous to women who have never been put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind in the heart of Africa , miles from any human being . I can go off on shooting and fishing trips with no other company than my black boys just one degree removed from savagery , and:not the shadow of a fear will cross my mind . But those things are a part of the routine of every-day life in Africa and do not call for courage . It is the unexpected that puts your bravery to the test . I might have faced one rhino boldly , but that second unexpected beast was too much for me . The pair of them stood there a moment , wrinkled and evil , big as motor-cars , and snorting and sniffling in anger . Then with one accord they lunged toward Martin . I grabbed my gun from my gun-bearer , but before I could cock it , the rhinos had turned in a great cloud of dust and were making off as fast as they could go in the opposite direction . I stood paralyzed , looking after them . Martin turned to me , his face alight at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the situation at a glance , and his expression turned to one of disappointment . I had failed him in an emergency . I could not explain , could not say a word . All I wanted to do was to hide myself somewhere and cry . I fairly ran back to camp and threw myself on my cot and sobbed and sobbed . Martin came after me and tried to tell me it did not matter . But I knew it did matter . And after a while we made a pact . We promised each other to stick to the camera until it became certain that we must either desert it or perish , and never to shoot until we were sure that it was an animal 's life or one of ours . We kept that pact faithfully . After a few trials , it was comparatively easy for me to keep it , for I soon learned that nine times out of ten wild animals were more afraid of us than we were of them . But once , toward the very end of our trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lake Paradise . You will not find Lake Paradise on the map . It has been lost to white men for many years . We rediscovered it , but we will not tell where it is , for we are going back there to make picture-records of the animals that live on the wooded shores , and we do not want the beasts hunted and made wild . I have never seen a place so beautiful as Lake Paradise . Its banks are clothed in primeval forest . And a little way from the shore are rocky pools overhung with trees draped in silvery moss , sybaritic baths where the great elephants come during the heat of the day to stand half-submerged among blue African water lilies and lazily doze the hours away , while fluttering thousands of butterflies , yellow and blue and white , play about them . I hate rhinos . They are so big and so ugly . I know that they are stupid and that their reputation for fierceness is largely bluff . Still , I never got over my fear of them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hour , from rocks overhanging their pools , until I felt that I knew them very well indeed . They were bigger than the rhinos . I could have hidden myself completely behind one of their great ears . I knew that they had bad tempers , 9 too , and that they were to be especially dreaded as adversaries because , unlike the rhino and the great pig of a hippopotamus , they were intelligent . But they seemed so harmless in their perfumed- rock bathtubs . And their eyes were humorous and kind . Just the day before the one we had set for leaving Lake Paradise , a strange little native named Boguni , whom we had taken into our party because of his almost uncanny knowledge of elephants and their ways , came to tell us that there was a herd of seven elephants , among them a fine tusker , only a mile away , so Martin and I , with the gun-bearers , set out to get one last picture before breaking camp . We found the elephants in a clearing , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took my place at the camera , and Martin crept up toward the unsuspecting beasts . When I he was very near , he raised his rifle and discharged both barrels at the tusker . The elephant jumped clear off the ground , but he did n't topple over dead as I expected him to do . Instead he came down on all four feet and made straight for Martin . The seven elephants followed him , and so did seven more , and still more . The clearing and the woods about it seemed alive with elephants . Martin fired again and ran back toward me . My heart was in my throat , but I remembered my promise and kept turning the crank . A dozen feet away from me Martin fired for the fourth time . But still the beast kept coming . He was all but on Martin when I let go the crank and snatched my rile from Ferraragi and fired . I did not stop to take aim ; I just fired . But my shot went home . The elephant swerved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , went a little further , and dropped .

Martin brought me back , and when I could find courage to look at the dead elephant , I forgot my fright in pity for him . It seemed too bad he had to leave forever the cool forest and the pleasant pools of Lake Paradise . All the way home the boys chanted , to a minor savage air . " Missus has killed an elephant , Missus has killed an elephant . " But I felt no elation . I hope we never have to kill another elephant .

The floor will be carpeted with skins , and we are going to have a big library table with a top of rhinoceros hide , polished until its wrinkles are all smoothed out and it is as glossy and almost as beautifully marked as tortoise shell . I am going to make curtains of gay cretonne to give a touch of home , and my mother has embroidered some linen tablecloths and napkins for me to take back with me .

And every few weeks we have letters and magazines , delivered by a native runner from Nairobi . We have Kalawat , who is the first to spy us as we come back to camp after a day 's hunt , and who runs to meet us , whooing with joy at our return . And we have each other . Why should we be lonely ?
