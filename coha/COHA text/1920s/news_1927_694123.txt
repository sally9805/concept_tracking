txt Suggestion for Dry Law Advocates . When one considers the tiros and money spent in seeking the cause of cancer , and how typhoid , diphtheria , malaria , tetanus and yellow fever have been robbed of their terrors by those who found the cause first and the cure afterward. one Ls apt to wonder why those seeking a cure for the drink evil have not gone about it in a similar manner . History is full of instances where perverse human nature vegetated In doing just what it was told not to do . If the money spent in securing anti-liquor legislation and trying to enforce it had been spent in learning why pecrple drink and how this desire could be removed . would there not be less friction , enmity , bitterness and hatred and more of the spirit of brotherly love of which we read so much ? WILLIAM D. KEMP'TON . Cincinnati , Ohio . Aug 9. 1927.
