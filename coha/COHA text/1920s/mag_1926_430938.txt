S YTGE listening through a chink in the floor of his bedroom at the inn to the talk in the public room below , was in the typical attitude of Anglo-Irish literature , which is essentially the observation by one cultivated people ( the Anglo-Irish ) of a race supposed for a long time to be naturally subject . The spirit of an agreeable hostess who delights her guests with scraps of the conversation below stairs ( raising a laugh in which none joins so heartily as the stranger from the other side of the Channel ) persists even in Lady Gregory 's Kiltartan note-books , and in most of the plays which have made the fortune of The Abbey Theatre ; but Irish writers , even from the time of Maria Edgeworth , had learned to congratulate themselves on having at their doors a unique subject all to themselves , and soon became a little ashamed of the character of showmen . They have never quite learned , not even Seumas O'Kelly or Liam O'Flaherty , that grave contemplation of humble life practised by the Russians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish temperament ; but the whole subject-matter of Irish literature received a vast accession of dignity and interest through the labours of scholars and philologists , who laid bare to the imaginations of poets an ancient and still not entirely extinguished culture . A literature founded on this ancient culture , as the literatures of modern Europe were founded on the cultures of Greece and Rome , became the ideal of a group of Irish authors , and was in fact actually realized . Does this literature hold within itself the promise of development ? Well , it must be confessed that it owed its sudden bloom to causes  | which are not likely to be repeated . The enchantment experienced by the poets of the Celtic Renascence belonged to a fortunate hour in which political dreams were mingled with the erudite and artistic joys of " rehabilitation , " and subsequent events have proved that an account of this movement does not wholly lie within the history of art and literature . There is one man whose life-story will always tell the story of that movement , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that ancient culture as no one had done before him , though Heaven knows how he did so , for he is one of those men who are incapable of . cimilating any language , ancient or modern , but that into which they are born . In Celtic mythology and legend , however , he was from the first as learned as ever was Ronsard in the mythologies of Greece and Rome . Others had studied before him the Transactions of the Ossianic Society , O'Curry 's MS . Materials of Irish History , and the rest , but the true mentality of the Gael had transpired neither in the heavy consonantal diction of Ferguson nor in the Homericized Carlylese of Standish O'Grady : it was Yeats who , without knowing a word of Gaelic , penetrated to the esoteric world of Druidic magic ; and if his phrase at times seemed coloured by Keats and Shelley , Morris and Swinburne , he was only reclaiming for the Gael that verbal magic which Matthew Arnold himself had declared to be derived from Celtic sources . It was from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Druidic culture ; it was Theosophy which was able to supplement the scanty hints of the Druidic mysteries vouchsafed by Julius Caesar , and to furnish a living system of arcane teaching . Yeats 's early poems are in fact as full of Hinduism as of Celticism , and it was in the East ? in the Noh-plays of the Japanese ? that he was one day to find the solution of those dramatic problems with which , as we shall see , he had long wrestled somewhat thanklessly in The Abbey Theatre . No wonder that Yeats and his friend AE , who could conjure up the mighty heroes of Celtic lore and make of Erin 's mysterious past part of that Eternal Moment of which the artist is the artificer ? no wonder that they believed in Irish literature ! On the face of it , Ireland was not a bit like the country which they beheld in their visions , the people whom one talked with as one  | bicycled about the country seemed far more like the people portrayed , in the traditional spirit of Anglo-Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannay , than they were to the Rafterys and Red Hanrahans of Yeats 's stories , ' but no Irishman wears his heart upon his sleeve , and the faithless retainer of Coole Park was possibly not less sincere when he poured into Mr Yeats 's ears new marvels of the Celtic twilight than he was later on when he recounted to an amused visitor the yarn he had palmed off upon the poet . With his belief , derived from Blake , in poetry as a form of magic , he became less and less what is called an " open air " man . The enchanting poet of The Lake Isle of Innisfree and The Man Who Dreamed of Fairyland was still the enchanting poet of The Fiddler of Dooney and of The Embroidered Cloths , but his rhythms and imagery came to him more and more in visions of the night or from the ambiguous world of necromancy and seances ; and as to AE , though his work as one of Sir Horace Plunkett 's organizers took him to every part of the country , yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best commune with that Ireland which had been and which was still to be . And it was this mystical Ireland , beheld only clairvoyantly , an Ireland sunk in ancient memories , which turned out to be the real one ! Yeats , and the literary movement in which he was the commanding figure , may be said to have conjured up the armed bands of 1916 . It happened in this way . One gathers that Yeats and AE had almost reached the conclusion that the kingdom of the Gael , like that of the Jews , was a spiritual kingdom and not of this world , and that the value of political agitation or of armed resistance to British authority was for the most part symbolical . The soul of Ireland was to be kept pure as within a wall of brass by its hatred of England , which represented the unclean outer world and a civilization essentially detestable ; but the amount of sympathy which they were able to afford for such movements as that for the revival of the Irish language , or for the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Catholic generation . There was always something uncongenial to Catholic Ireland in Anglo-Irish literature ; it galled the Catholic youth to be a subject race , subject not only politically but in a literary sense .  | They wanted a literature and a nationality which they could call their own , and the increasing vogue of Anglo-Irish literature made them the more resolute that their literature should be in the Irish language . A movement , of which Yeats and AE knew very little , and which repudiated them as leaders , a Catholic and native movement , with a political programme which seemed altogether incapable of realization , began to recruit its forces among those youths who , a hundred years earlier , would have remained at home or in the public house when the Protestant Robert Emmet made his sacrifice of blood . What we may call Yeats 's middle period is filled up for the most part with work at The Abbey Theatre . We may or may not believe that he might have been better employed than in managing a theatre and writing plays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic gift it might be answered that in The Land of Heart 's Desire he had already succeeded in doing what the Elizabethan dramatists longed and tried unsuccessfully to do ; and he was able to do so because that " Celtic " element which survived in Shakespeare was the element in which Yeats moved with real power and understanding . In a word , Yeats had this advantage over Shakespeare , that he believed in the fairies ; and though a belief in fairies is not a sufficiently central belief to serve a poet much in manipulating a drama of human destiny , yet an acquiescence in the supernatural was perhaps sufficiently characteristic of Irish writers to justify Yeats in his notable and bold design of founding a distinctive Irish drama . Certainly the theme of tragedy and comedy alike becomes different in a world of direct vision , a world in which the doubts that tortured Shakespeare disappear , and in which human destiny , restored to its natural setting , is seen to be controlled by supernatural influences as direct as the Nemesis of Greek tragedy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining an entrance to this world , but imagination , and Yeats has expounded his theory of ancestral imagination ? of which folkimagination is a part ? in the series of essays , Ideas of Good and Evil . From these one gathers that the artist of the future , conceiving a Buddhistic aversion for all " realism , " for " character , " " emphasis , " " vitality , " for all in short which makes the dramatic subject-matter in most literatures , will apply himself to the reintegration of the folk-memory amongst men , a well of authentic  | symbolism , drawing from which the poets and artists of all nations will become a secret and priestly order . Yeats undoubtedly entertained the grandiose scheme of making The Abbey Theatre an instrument of propaganda to this end . The Abbey Theatre became famous , but though without the help of Yeats 's energy and eloquence it would never have become famous , it was not as a centre of mystical propaganda that it succeeded . The spirit which at length prevailed in it , to the chagrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature ; and he who had refused Mr Shaw 's offer of John Bull 's Other Island had to look on at the rapturous enjoyment with which Mr Boyle 's boisterous comedies were hailed . But the man who really broke up the mould of Irish drama as it existed in Yeats 's mind was John Millington Synge , a writer who gave The Abbey Theatre itself an exciting part in the drama of Irish life . Synge was no mystic , and he cared as little for Yeats 's theories of a drama " remote , spiritual and ideal " as for AE 's " plumed and skinny shee . " He was a listener , and it was he who heard the promptings of the ironic muse who at that time was endeavouring to be heard in Ireland . In defending Synge , then , Yeats was fighting in a cause which was not really his own . Synge was more than an episode in Yeats 's history : he was a disturbing event , which brought Yeats back from the abstract to the personal . The Abbey stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with never-failing heart of controversy and with admirable self-forgetfulness , he preached his doctrine of the imaginative arts from the ambiguous text of The Playboy . But there were his own plays too . I have said that Synge broke up the mould of the Irish drama as it existed in Yeats 's mind , and to Yeats the development of The Abbey Theatre , though it succeeded beyond all his expectations , must have brought a good deal of personal disappointment . He had dreamed of a true folk-theatre , almost religious in character , to which his contribution was to be the dramatic presentation of the story of Cuchullin , and to this , perhaps the great ambition of his life , he had to bid farewell when he produced his short poetic plays . These plays were never really in the new tradition of The Abbey Theatre . The beautiful lines which drifted down to us , weighted with poetic imagery , the blank verse which rose out of the babble of the meaner personages , made us think of the Shakes- pearians more than of any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abbey stage , and the Irish heroes , impersonated by actors who gained their renown in peasant parts , gave one the feeling that they had fallen on very evil times , especially when one thought of their Teutonic compeers , moving amid the splendours of Wagnerian orchestration . It must be confessed that Yeats lost something of his literary good temper in these theatrical transactions . He had expected a far greater docility from his Irish audience than an Attic playwright could have looked for when he competed for the crown . Aeschylus and Sophocles had their chagrins , and I refuse to believe that even an Athenian audience went to the theatre in the spirit which Yeats demanded of our poor modern mentality , with its shreds of belief hanging about it and an evening to be accounted for ! But if any regret remained with us that we had not done justice to Yeats , it was allayed when we heard eventually that he had himself renounced the poetic drama inherited from the Shakespearians . In a London drawing-room this undaunted poet hailed in the Noh-play of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic form in fact suits his elfin spirit better than the blank verse play . He is himself again , and can be as symbolic and personal , and as full of his new lunar philosophy as he pleases . It seemed hardly likely now that he would produce the great poem we had expected from him . Every now and then a tiny volume came from The Cuala Press , chiefly short personal poems , in which he ' seems often reminded of his enemies and thwarters : occasionally he is his lyric self again , as in The Wild Swans of Coole , or The Cold Heaven , or in All Souls ' Night . Is Yeats a great poet ? Poets are of two kinds , and a poet may be great in either kind : the poet who lives in a world of his own , to which in certain moods we have the passport , like Spenser or William Morris ; and the poet who invades our own most private world and lays hold upon our secret passions and aspirations . Yeats , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a critic whose literary judgements always stay in one 's mind after one has resisted them a while , used to say that Yeats 's contribution was at least equal to that of Coleridge . Almost unconsciously , in our estimate of Coleridge , we take into account the vague outlines of those  | poems which he never completed , and so attribute to him a massiveness which is more truly his suggestiveness . Moore , of course , was thinking of the amount and of the beauty of the best work of the two poets , rather than of establishing any " parallel , " and his judgement , I think , fairly well indicates the standing of Yeats . Take him in one of his best-known passages : " Who dreamed that beauty passes like a dream ? For these red lips , with all their mournful pride , Mournful that no new wonder may betide , Troy passed away in one high funeral gleam , And Usna 's children died . " It would be hard to match this sumptuous language with anything in Coleridge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I were asked to name my own favourite among the poems I think I should say The Fiddler of Dooney , partly because a certain feeling transpires in that poem which is rare in Yeats ; for through some obduracy of temperament he fails for the most part to establish a sympathetic communication between our world and his own . But Yeats is more absolutely a poet than Coleridge : the body of his thought is poetic , and this can hardly be said of Coleridge , whose verse , after his brief period of exaltation , is often mawkish and merely sentimental . The mention of Coleridge , indeed , suggests rather a contrast than a comparison . Poetry was an unclaimed precinct in Coleridge 's mind , a tricksy spirit which fed on opium , and the author of Aids to Reflection is hardly on speaking terms with the author of Kubla Khan ; whereas Yeats the poet and Yeats the philosopher are one and the same person . Like Coleridge , he is a great theorist about the imagination ; but for Coleridge imagination was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality " : the spiritual world rather than the world of spirits . For Yeats , on the other hand , imagination is the essence of personality , and is already the denizen of a world in which it can converse with like spiritual essences , and even hold communion with the dead . Yeats ( in this respect like Coleridge ) is almost as strong in prose as in verse , and the style in which he recounts his visions ( or those of  | Owen Aherne ) , while as positive as that of Swedenborg , is as richly embroidered as that of Sir Thomas Browne . It is possible , however , to " think nobly of the soul " and yet to attribute to the imaginative faculty a function more subordinate than is pleasing to most poets . Blake , upon whom this doctrine is fathered , was a painter , and for a painter the world of imagination is almost necessarily the world of vision ; yet there have been highly imaginative men ? physicists , musicians , metaphysicians ? who , even if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of doing so . There is much in personality which Yeats is indifferent to , and even dislikes the names of ? will , character , reason ? and the proof of the survival after death of the whole composite system of personality , conscious and subconscious , rests on more than the testimony of the imagination . Through all Yeats 's prose writings runs the suggestion , sometimes rising to the assertion , that the imaginative man , or artist , does not " create " anything ; that Roland , Hamlet , Faust are not mere abstractions but " a few of all those countless divinities who have taken upon themselves spiritual bodies in the minds of the modern poets and romance-writers . " Ordinarily we are content to account for the vitality and individuality of these inhabitants of the imaginative world by attributing to the artist a peculiar gift for distinguishing types and for clothing these with form and semblance out of his own heightened experience ; but for Blake and Mr Yeats , nothing can be real to the mind which is not real in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion that the figure of Mr Micawber himself was encountered in some grotesque spiritual region congenial to its author . The imaginative arts are indeed vehicles of revelation , but of a revelation of that world of personality which is equivalent to all that it comprehends . The preface to the little book which contained the jubilant announcement of the discovery of the Noh-play bears the date , very notable in recent Irish history , " April , 1916 . " For some time we had been seeing less of Yeats in Dublin , and like his predecessor Thomas Moore , who was also a poet of Kathleen ni Houlihan , he seemed to prefer to live with his chief audience , in England . His poems teemed with all kinds of repudiations of Irish political methods and even of his numerous Irish imitators . He had written of the Ireland immediately before the Great War :  | " Was it for this the ' Wild Geese spread The grey wing upon every tide ; For this that all that blood was shed , For this Edward Fitzgerald died , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brave ? Romantic Ireland 's dead and gone , It 's with O'Leary in the grave . " Still , Yeats was always a daemonic man , a man , that is , to whom events suggest the key-word or the decisive action ; and I sometimes wonder whether this scornful refrain was not the spark which fell upon the inflammable minds of the young Gaelic enthusiasts , poets most of them , and kindled their vague aspirations into a realistic purpose . Certainly it was about that time that Catholic Ireland began to be definitely " romantic " in Yeats 's sense . No one could have been more surprised than he when he heard that the Irish capital was rolled in battle-smoke , yet upon no one was it more obligatory to applaud the Insurrection . This was clearly the occasion for a palinode , and after a somewhat hurried consultation with his muses he sent forth his lines with the refrain " A terrible beauty is born " ? a personal and honourable confession of the mistake he had made . The event meant much more both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment ; for Yeats it meant a complete change in his life and a new period in his poetic progress , but of the direction which this will take there is as yet insufficient indication . Nathaniel Hawthorne in one of his fantasies has taken up the careers of Byron , Shelley , and Keats at the point where they were broken off by death and carried them on into old age , and the development which he has imagined for each of these poets is not more surprising than the transformation which time has wrought for Yeats . In the new Irish Free State , to which Kathleen ni Houlihan has not yet wholly adapted herself , Senator Yeats is a model citizen : instituting business-like committees for the promotion of Celtic studies ; talking plain good sense about the Irish  | language ; inspecting the sanitary conditions of children 's schools ; resisting as a Protestant the imposition of Catholic divorce laws . Never when I walked with Yeats in his victorious youth did I venture to think of him as a future supporter of the Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only temporary , of Kathleen ni Houlihan , we are not to think of him as a poet whose theme has vanished . In his recent poems a more personal vein has begun to flow , a faculty of dealing with personal concerns and happenings in the light of certain mystical doctrines , the nature of which I will not attempt to investigate , especially as they seem to involve the use of mathematical figures and symbols . His country house , his family , his material well-being ? of these things he writes with a certain wistful satisfaction , as one unexpectedly prosperous and happy , yet almost in the spirit of a changeling , never perfectly reconciled to these solid advantages . Always he is not merely a believer in a spirit-world but by birthright its denizen . Yeats 's faith in the unseen is not that potent and effulgent sentiment , a belief in God : no comfortable hope or help proceeds from it , yet the meditative intensity of such poems as A Prayer for My Daughter , Thoughts upon the Present State of the World , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , exercises a powerful spell . Yeats , as we have found in this review of his life , is one with whom external events have always been determining influences , and in his future development we shall look for a response to the fortunes of that country of which he is now the principal ornament .  |
