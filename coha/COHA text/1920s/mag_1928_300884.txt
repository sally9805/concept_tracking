Death by falling from great heights is pleasant-provided the smash-up at earth is thorough . Professor Heim of Zurich , who stated so last week , once fell off a precipice of Mount Saentis . He lit on his head and distinctly heard the thud . Stout , he recovered ; introspective , he recalled his falling sensations . Delicious music soughed by his ears . He was very calm . Only after an hour from his rocky landing did he feel the pain of his broken bones . <P> The experience set him researching . He questioned Alpinists who had tumbled over precipices . He talked with people fallen with disabled airplanes , with foiled suicides . From all he got a concurrence of testimony : that their thoughts were lucid and followed each other with weird swiftness , that they were fully aware of , and resigned to death , that music sounded . Some felt as if they were passing through rosy clouds . None felt pain immediately upon striking earth . Such too are symptoms of asphyxia .
