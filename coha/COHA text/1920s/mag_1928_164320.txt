Coolidge &; Lindbergh <P> Sirs : <P> Congressmen have flown-and Congresswomen . Cabinet members have flown . Governors fly . Great generals , admirals , bankers and philanthropists fly . The President of Germany flies . Why does n't Calvin Coolidge go up ? Our leader should fly with Lindbergh ! Perhaps he thinks it would be too great a loss to the country if he crashed fatally . I think it would be a great loss , but President Coolidge pointed out himself that there are plenty of big men to take his place . As a matter of fact , if Coolidge flew with Lindbergh and they crashed , the loss of Lindbergh would dwarf the loss of Coolidge . On the other hand , the spectacle of our leader joining in on the greatest enterprise of the age ( Conquering the Air ) would exalt this country far more than anything else Mr. Coolidge could do . If he died , he would die a real hero and never be forgotten . <P> But dying is out of the question . The remote risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Lindbergh , a magnificently " sporting " thing for him to do in a country which prides itself on its sportsmanship . There 's too much play-safe policy among its public figures . Roosevelt would fly with Lindbergh like a shot-he would have the day Lindbergh got home from Paris ! Better late than never . <P> SIDNEY HENDERSON <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> <P> Engineer Hoover <P> Sirs : <P> " . . . An outstanding international reputation as an engineer . " One is constantly hearing that about Herbert Hoover . But what did he do ? I ask from goodnatured ignorance , not a heckler 's corner . Where is his Panama Canal , his Brooklyn Bridge , his Moffat tunnel . . . ? <P> L. NASEBY BROWN <P> Philadelphia , Pa . <P> The first big job Engineer Hoover had was to introduce U. S. methods in Australia 's goldfields . Then , aged 25 , he advised on mines and railroads for the late Emperor Kwang-Hs of China . He introduced U. S. methods to Kyshtym in South Russia , making an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where young Russian engineers soon pilgrimaged to complete their education . Italy engaged Engineer Hoover one summer to prospect in the Alps for the iron old Romans must have used for their swords. * Engineer Hoover and his brother , Theodore Jesse Hoover ( who lives in Swanton , Calif. ) , perfected and installed a method for recovering zinc from the dumps of Australian lead and silver mines . In Burma , Engineer Hoover bought an abandoned mine and transformed it into one of the world 's largest , employing 20,000 men . In 1914 , he had the choice of selling out this property or becoming a British citizen . He sold , refusing also a title and a British Cabinet position. - ED . <P> <P> $10,000 Man <P> Sirs : <P> Klansman Milstead said it . TIME , by its attitude towards the Klan , loses one more subscriber . <P> TIME infers the membership of the Klan to be weak-minded . If a brilliant war record in command of 1,000 men , a salary of $10,000 and a national reputation in his profession indicates weakness of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing the character of the members perhaps better than TIME , does , he predicts that it will take more than TIME 'S feeble attacks to stop the steady progress of the Klan .
