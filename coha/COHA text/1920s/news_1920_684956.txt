txt The Allies decided today upon their answer to Berlin 's request that Germany be , relieved from the obligation to hand over for trial army officers and functionaries accused of crimes during the world war . The reply will consist of a curt letter to the Berlin Government , reminding it of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles . and the letter will be accompanied by a list of 780 men which Germany is summoned to deliver to the Entente authorities .

It will be remembered that Hindenburg and Ludendorff once offered to give themselves up in place of the exKaiser , and Paris . is speculating on what will be their attitude now if their surrender is asked for by the Allies .
