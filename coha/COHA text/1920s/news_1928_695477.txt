txt FROM BONDS TO STOCKS . New Army of Speculators Is Held Responsible for Inflation . To the Editor of The Ncw York Times : We have been warned many times of late by the bankers of the perils of stock market sreculation . Coupled with these warnings have been hints that the country may find itself in a quandary should the banks , owing to the diversion of vast sums of money into stock market channels , find themselves unable to meet the pressing needs of agriculturists for the movement of crops , or those of other important commercial activities . True , the bankers have tried to remedy the situation by curbing the brokers ' loans , but , if reports are correct , they were only partially successful in their efforts , owing to the availability of funds from other sources , so that the stock market game continues to go merrily along . There has been a great change going on in the country 's financial structure during the last ten ? years . During the war period the public was urged to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrimped and saved . But , after a while , these same people realized for the fiat time in their lives that they were bondholders ! Now the bond , the good variety , is a sturdy standby , but your newly fledged investor is anxious to get ahead . On the stock market he sees alluring possibilities . And so the timid financial adventurers of yesterday have launched out into the more exciting field of speculation . As individuals , many of us have " played the market . " It is in its wider aspect , however , when we pause to ask ourselves if we are developing into a nation of gamblers that the situation becomes serious . When and where is it all going to end ? Market prognosticators for the past year have been predicting a drastic " break . " And there have been breaks . But after a short pause up prices have gone again , some stocks soaring to new record " highs . " Why ? Because this new army of speculating optimists will not be downed ! The banks and investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " long pull , " with the reinvestment of dividends , as the soundest money making scheme . These , however , would have to be made extremely attractive . They might also feature the very small percentage of successful speculators over a period of time . But is the public in any mood right now to listen ? Of course , if the situation ever reached the point of a national menace we could invoke the aid of the Federal Government to step in and forbid speculation without a special form of permit . The lawyers could then determine what is speculation in fact . N. C. FENTON . New York . Oct. 3 , 1928 . DEBTS AND REPARATIONS . We Have a Responsibility In Con- , nection With German Payments . To the Editor , of The New York Times : THE Tuxes gives Mr. Mellon 's usual denial of any just basis  --  for M. Poincares renewed suggestion of a connection between the collection of reparations and the payment to us of Allies ' debts . In relations between individuals , the only analogy we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If I interfere with another 's wish to manage his affairs in his own way , I indubitably assume an obligation to see that he does not suffer unjustly as a result of that interference . If a community takes away from its members the ? right of each to decide for himself what debts he will claim from his neighbors and collect by any means at his command , it assumes an obligation to cooperate with him to such extent as may be necessary and within its power in the collection of those portions of his claims which it admits are just . We decidedly interfered in regard to the ? war costs for which we ? sanctioned the demand for reparations from Germany . Our Allies bought from us vast quantities ? of war supplies , ' as real a part of the cost to them of the war as devastated cities or sunken . ships . We demand that they pay us for these supplies , but we positively decline to permit our Allies to pass the bills on to Germany for payment as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the war enabled us to dictate , and we did dictate , what parts of their very real war costs our Allies might or might not demand from Germany . We joined in holding Germany responsible for forcing the war on the world , we joined in occupying German territory as a means of enforcing terms of which reparations were among the most essential . Even though our Senate did not finally confirm the treaty , the demand for reparations had nothing to do with that failure . And even if it had , that would not alter our moral obligation , incurred through having taken a dominant part in deciding what war costs might be demanded and how they might be collected . If we did not have a form of government that could negotiate responsibly , we should have kept out of all negotiations that did not directly concern us ? as , I believe , Japan did ? and , . not having done so , we should share in the loss if the Allies lose out on the credit side of the account which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the debit side , which is all credit ( but not creditable ) to us . A similar situation where individuals were concerned would leave no doubt as to the obligation incurred . The world at the end of the war , and today , may be compared to a community having a few traditions loosely governing conduct , but with no Government having the admitted right to settle disputes between its members . Might would be right . Assume one man much stronger than any other , who insisted upon having a dominant voice in any dispute in which he had even the smallest interest . If he decided what others who had suffered grievous wrongs might demand in reparation , but refused to back up their efforts to collect , though they had accepted his participation only because that implied an intention to use his power to back up the decision  --  yet pressed for payment of his own claims against the sufferers whom he had undertaken to assist , how long could he maintain his dominant position in the community ? If he could maintain it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they respected him . Is that the basis on which we want to maintain our position in the world , even assuming that it is possible to do so on that basis over any considerable period ? S. L. G. KNOX . Englewood , N. J. , Oct. 3 , 1928 . Official News From Spain . To the Editor of The Ncw York Times : On account of certain cable news from Europe , published in several newspapers of this city on Oct. 1 , I am instructed by the Spanish Embassy at Washington to deny such untrue news and to transmit to you the following cablegram received from the Premier : " Certain unscrupulous telegraphic agencies continue to resort to rumors of political difficulties in Spain , forgetting , in the first Place , that , properly said , there b not any Politics at present . The last rumor is the most picturesque , assuming that his Majesty , while at San Sebastian , had refused his signature to the Premier on several decrees of destitution of authorities that the Premier proposed to relieve of their positions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the value of . such tricks , but the good faith of the foreign opinions might be surprised by such misleading news , and therefore it is convenient to make it known to the public that nothing has happened in Spain , and that nothing will happen , as there is lack of . ambient for the most insignificant disturbance , and that those who might intend to promote it are closely watched : and that on the contrary , his Majesty the Ring has shown every day the greater proof of affection and confidence that lie has in his present GOVernment- " RAFAEL DE CASAREa , Consul General for Spain .

To the Editor of The New York Times : What could be more affecting than the crocodile tears which Republicans are shedding over Democracy 's drafting of Mr. Roosevelt while he is lank : from infantile paralysis ?

To the Editor of The New York Times : Like Senator Moses I am a backwoodsman from darkest New Hampshire , so take keen delight in all you write of our elect " Pullman Pilgrim . " But often after reading long interviews with him I find myself humming lines of the old song which runs , " Oh , what a death to be talked to death ! Oh , what a death to die !

IL , Oct. a , =a. - DEMOCRATS AND THE TARIFF Leaders Should Make Clear Fallacies of the Relit-Aileen Position . To the Editor of The Ncw York Times : . If the Democratic - Party is ? not to throw away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans on the tariff issue . No amount of anti prohibition sentiment , and no amount of resentment against Republican neglect of the farmers , will be sufficient to . win for Smith if Hoover 's claims for the Republican tariff are not plainly and squarely met . And they , can be . Hoover has laid himself- open to the most crushing refutation . But with Democratic politicians soft-pedaling the issue and trying to make the public believe that they are not less in favor of high protection than the Republicans are , we might as well hail Hoover as our next President and save the ezpcnses of a political campaign . The ? industrial magnates who control ? the ' Republican Party arc not going to throw their support to Smith on any consideration whatsoever . The Republican ? Party from it3 foundation has been a high-tariff party , and has drawn the revenues that have won it success from the contributions of tariff beneficiaries . They know perfectly well what it will do , and they will not take any chances . As ' a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do , and he is in a position to know : ? it will not only maintain the high rates that we have but will make sharp ? advances in many schedules . The first point to make clear is that the protective tariff contributes not one cent toward raising the general level of wages . If all the rates were doubled tomorrow , there would be nothing in the situation to lead the employers to pay one cent more . What ' is it that the tariff does do , then ? At most it can make it possible to carry on some industries which , on account of our previously existing high wage level , would otherwise be impossible . Let me illustrate . A small quantity of good tea is grown in this country . We have large areas of land that are excellently adapted to that crop ; but we can not grow more , because at the wages American laborers are able to command we can not afford to get the tea picked . But if a protective tariff of half a dollar a pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply all our needs . We could then afford to pay our pickers American wages , and thus divert a sufficient number of them from other lines of work . But the general wage level would not be raised in the slightest . On the other hand , we would all be paying about half a dollar a pound more for tea , and to that extent the purchasing power of every man 's wages would be lowered . If the slate were wiped clean ? if we were back in the early days of this Republic  --  there would be no excuse for a protective tariff . We are sometimes told that without protection we could carry on . no industries whatsoever  --  that they are all like the teagrowing in my illustration . If that were the case a tariff could not help us . We could not build up industries by everybody 's taxing himself to help everybody else . That would be hoisting ourselves by our bootstraps . Every industry that requires protection is a burden that has to be borne and ' some one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of things , and the slate can not be wiped clean . As far as abstract principles go , free trade is right ; but no man of common sense would now advocate free trade for the American people . Like it or not like it , we are committed to a large measure of protection . Where , then , is the difference between the Republican and Democratic policies in this matter of protection ? It lies in this : that through their control of the national organization of the Republican Party , certain industrial magnates have fixed the tariff rates upon their own products at a level far higher than protection requires . Behind the tariff walls they have organized themselves into monopolies , and are using the forms of law as a means of wholesale extortion . The Democratic Party , on the other hand , proposeso fix the tariff at a ' level which will maintain effective competition ; that is to say , will force our monopolists to sell us goods at a fair price , since otherwise we would be able to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean loss of employment for any workman , and it would mean an immense benefit to us all . When Hoover says in his Newark speech that " the first of our policies which have given security and expansion of employment has been the enactment of the protective tariff , " he says what every man who has had any training in economics knows to be false . There are some matters in which there is a difference of scientific opinion , but this is not one of them . Hoover , of course , has had no such training . But I am not sure that even on the ground of ignorance we can excuse the passage which follows , where he declares that the adoption of the Democratic tariff policy " would let in a flood of foreign goods , destroy employment and lower wages , and " ? God save the mark ! ? " demoralize our farmers all over the United States . " Nevertheless , appeals like this , if they are not well countered , will win hundreds of thousands of votes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-time labor agitators , who fought against the introduction of machinery into industry  --  that if machines did the work men would lose their jobs . They could not see that by enriching mankind and raising the standard of living the machine would make far more jobs than ever existed before . In the same way , the industrial workers of today are told that every dollar 's worth of goods bought abroad means so much less employment for American labor . They do not know that exports and imports limit each other , and that if our great and promising export trade is to continue to expand we must buy more and more largely abroad ; and that instead of there being fewer jobs for Americans in consequence there will be more and better ones . The Democratic Party ought not to let this matter rest in silence . Not a vote will be lost by speaking out . The men who will be offended by the criticism of our extortionate tariff rates  --  not one cent from which goes to labor  --  will in any case support the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever . - THEODORE DE LAGUNA ; Bryn Mawr , Pa. , Oct. 2 , 1928.
