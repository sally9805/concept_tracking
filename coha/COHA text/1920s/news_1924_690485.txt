But one of the coaches complains about the food , which he describes as " distinctly unsuited to keep the team in good condition . ' Such a charge against the land - of BRILLAT-SAVAIUN , which has given so many delectable dishes to the world , comes as surprise . Can it be that the masters of the culinary art failed to supply good food , or is it merely that there was a noticeable absence of corned beef hash , ham and eggs , corn bread . milk , cereals and other American fa ' vorites which in France are practically lunknown ? French soldiers looked askance on the American Army ration , and shunned baked beans and good refrigerated beef . They considered our passion for dried cereals as a form of the generally incomprehensible American madness .

In their search for milk and eggs the doughboys were a constant puzzle to the French housewives , who were particularly unable to understand ' why they preferred their eggs fried in heavy grease to having them beaten into a delectable omelet .

Certainly an unaccustomed diet often is harmful , and a diet which is too rich is generally considered unsuitable for athletes in training . It is not unlikely that France , with so much still to learn about sports , has not yet been able to appreciate this truth .

In the atmosphere surrounding a joint session of the Public Service Commission and the-Transit Commission there is apparently something inimical to clear and bold thinking in behalf of the people . And yet the problem of increased rates was speedily shown to be one of arithmetic and not of sentiment . Spokesmen for the organized commuters questioned the basic valuation figures upon which the railroad company predicates its right to a larger revenue . Some testimony was adduced to show that on a previous occasion and under different circumstances the Long Island Railroad had questioned the Interstate Commerce Commission valuation figures which it now cites . Iii other respects , too , the question is one for close and cool inquiry . Commuter traffic is a special field subject largely to its own laws and to variations within the scope of its own schedules . In the controversy that has been going on since the Long Island proposals became public , unofficial figures have been cited to show that rates , in specific instances , are higher on Long Island than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cases were too special . Selected cases could probably be adduced un Long Island to make a different showing . Commutation rates on the same railroad show striking divergencies in relation to mileage . A comparative study of such schedules would seem to be indicated in conjunction with the basic problem of valuation and total net returns . A further problem concerns the question of efficiency in dealing with a commuter traffic which hag been mounting as rapidly as it has done on Long Island . With increased commuter travel along the same trackage the old rates might be expected to show increased net returns . Ten years ago the modGreen ern Greenwich Village was for founded .

Paint , windowboxes , pink geraniums , green shutters and wrought iron were the liberating influences from the Village . The failures were with stucco . Redbrick houses , with vivid white trim , seemed to belong . But stucco proved to be the lipstick of architecture . Put on , it came off .

To complete the list of his qualities , his eyes are said to be too far back and his head entirely out of drawing . Undoubtedly , the nature fakers could tell us what sort of complex afflicts him , for they have again revived the story that the woodcock is capable of self-surgery , and has been known to put a broken leg in splints and to dress his wounds with plaster made of mud and grass .
