A bay in the wall on the eastern side of Waterloo Bridge . The wall is well down stage , so that there is barely room in the foreground for what would be the sidewalk of the bridge . In the recess of the wall is a long bench . At the extreme right and left are high lamps , the globes of which have been smeared with black paint so that they give only a murky light . There is very strong moonlight . There is nothing beyond the wall , except perhaps the sombre suggestions of buildings and the dome of St. Paul 's to the eastward . There are no lights whatever in the buildings . Now and then , throughout this scene , there should be heard the whistles of river boats . KITTY is seated on the bench , eating an apple . She is a blatant London tart , profoundly pessimistic but meticulously cheerful , about thirty-five , heavily painted , and conveying only occasional suggestions of the charm she might once have possessed . She is looking casually to right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  watching for customers . When she sees a soldier coming she tosses the core of the apple over the wall , swallows hastily , pulls up her skirt a bit , and assumes an alluring pose . A MILITARY POLICEMAN comes in from the right . He wears the regulation Tommy 's uniform . On his sleeve is a red band with the initials " M. P. " in blue letters . He carries a stout cane . MILITARY POLICEMAN Evening , Kitty . p. 3 KITTY Oh  --  it 's you , is it ? Good evening . MILITARY POLICEMAN What are you doing ? KITTY I 've been'aving my supper . But I threw it into the river when I saw you coming . MILITARY POLICEMAN You need n't ' ave minded me . I could n't ' ave accepted your kind invitation to join you . I 'm on duty . KITTY That 's my complaint against you M. P. 's . You 're always on duty . MILITARY POLICEMAN Oh , well  --  some one'as to keep the peace . KITTY Peace ! ( She laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking toward the river ) Lovely evening , ai n't it ? KITTY It 's a ' orrible evening . MILITARY POLICEMAN Lovely for Fritzie , I mean . ' Ow 's trade ? KITTY Never been worse . What 's ' appened to the army ? MILITARY POLICEMAN They 've suffered a lot of casualties , that 's what 's ' appened . They ai n't being too free with their leaves KITTY It 's bloody mismanagement , if you should ask me . I give you my word  --  not ten men ' as crossed this bridge in the past hour . p. 4 MILITARY POLICEMAN It 's the moon , sweet'cart  --  the beautiful full moon  --  the fox-'unters ' delight . KITTY The fox-'unters can ' ave it  --  and the bombs that come with it . I wish the blasted thing 'd go into a clipse and stay there . MILITARY POLICEMAN Why not try writing to The Times about it ? ( GERTRUDE comes in from the right . ) KITTY ' Ullo , Gertrude . ' Ow 's luck ? GERTRUDE ( crossing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ullo , red-band . MILITARY POLICEMAN Good evening to you . KITTY Where you going ? GERTRUDE To Waterloo Station to meet the South'ampton train . KITTY Expecting any one ? GERTRUDE ( going on ) No  --  just ' oping . Toodleoo , Kitty . KITTY ' Bye , Gertrude . ( GERTRUDE goes out at the left . ) MILITARY POLICEMAN All the best . You ought to go with ' er . That South'ampton train is apt to be loaded with sailors . p. 5 KITTY Do n't I know it ? I got one of them once . ' E ' ad n't a penny but he grew so fond of me ' e deserted . I thought I was going to ' ave ' im on my ' ands for the duration . MILITARY POLICEMAN Look sharp , there ! ( An OFFICER comes in from the right . The M. P. stiffens to attention and salutes . The OFFICER returns the salute in an offhand manner and goes out . ) My word  --  that gave me a start ! I must be off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd strip me of my arm-band and send me back to the war . KITTY We must n't let that ' appen . I could n't bear to lose you . I ' ave few enough friends among the police . MILITARY POLICEMAN ( looking toward the left ) ' Ere comes some trade for you now . I 'll go this way so as not to frighten ' em . KITTY You are kind . MILITARY POLICEMAN Well  --  cheero , Kitty . KITTY Night , night . ( He goes out at the right . A SERGEANT-MAJOR and a SERGEANT come in from the left . They are very smart and impressive . They barely glance at KITTY as they pass . ) SERGEANT-MAJOR I tried to show him'ow wrong he was , and at the same time flatter ' im into thinking I was agreeing with him . But you know ' ow these Sandhurst lads put it on p. 6 SERGEANT Do n't I ! KITTY Evening , sergeants . ( They pause and glare at her . ) SERGEANT-MAJOR Eh ? What 's that ? KITTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody tart . KITTY Oh , yes ? Well , I was n't even speaking to you . SERGEANT Who were you speakin ' to , then ? KITTY To the Sergeant-Major . SERGEANT-MAJOR Thank you  --  but the Sergeant-Major is n't taking any of you  --  not to-night . SERGEANT It 's shameful ' ow this bridge is being infested with prostitutes . One ca n't move a step without being solicited . ( They move on . ) KITTY ( going after them ) That 's the curse of this war , ai n't it  --  prostitutes and sergeants ? SERGEANT-MAJOR Be careful who you speak to  --  or you 'll be reported to the military police . KITTY Oh , do n't mind me , Sergeant-Major . I 'm just a ' appy-go-lucky type . I always ' ave a cheery word for the troops  --  Britannia 's pride ! Boys of the bull-dog breed ! ( She follows this with an obscene noise. ) p. 7 SERGEANT ' Arken to ' er . KITTY Now run along , mates . I 'm expectin ' my fiancy ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarity with you . SERGEANT ( incredulous ) Your fiancy ? KITTY Yes  --  ' e 's a general , ' e is , and ' e ' as a peculiar dislike for sergeants . SERGEANT Do you ' ear that , Sergeant-Major ? A blikin ' general , no less . ( He laughts heartily . ) Perhaps if you wait ' ere long enough , in all this moonlight , old ' Indenburgh himself will be over in one of his bleeding Zeppelins to kiss you with a bomb . SERGEANT-MAJOR That 's enough , Sergeant . Leave ' er alone . KITTY And you are n't going to ask me to ' ave a bite to eat with you ? SERGEANT-MAJOR No , thank you . We 're both married men . Come on . KITTY ( as they go out at the right ) Oh  --  you 're both married , eh ! To each other ? ( She sings after them , " If you want to find the Sergeants , I know where they are , I know where they are . " ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pert and pretty , but jaded and fed up . She is American , with a few Cockney mannerisms in her speech that have been acquired during her four years in England . She is dressed in a shabby tailored suit , and is carrying an ancient suitcase. ) p. 8 MYRA Hello , Kitty . KITTY ( peering at her ) Who 's that ? MYRA Do n't you remember me ? KITTY Why  --  if it ai n't the Yank . ' Ullo , Myra ! ( They embrace . ) We 'd about given you up . ' Ow 've you been , ducky , and when did you get back ? MYRA I just pulled in to Waterloo Station . KITTY I 'd begun to think we was never going to see you again . MYRA Well  --  here I am ! KITTY My  --  I am glad to ' ave you back , ducky ! It 's been months since I saw you . MYRA It seems like years . I 'd forgotten what this town looks like . KITTY And ' ow did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that girls like you and me was n't built for working on a farm . KITTY I could 've told you that in the first place . Where 'd you go ? MYRA Oh , I was in Kent for a while KITTY Tending the ' ops , I suppose . p. 9 MYRA Sure  --  and then they shifted me to a God-forsaken little hole down in Surrey . KITTY What a ' orrible experience ! But you 're looking fit , I must say . MYRA Oh , it 's a healthy life , for those that like health . KITTY ' Ave you got any money ? MYRA The last time I counted it was three shillings . KITTY Did n't they pay you for your farmerette duty ? MYRA They did not . All I got was board . You see , I was doing patriotic service . KITTY Well , I 've been doing patriotic service , too . All I get is the M. P. 's telling me to move on . ( GERTRUDE comes in from the left , arm in arm with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're fair getting me out of breath . SAILOR You 'll ' ave to kick it up a bit , my girl , if you 're coming along wi ' me . ( GERTRUDE waves to KITTY as she follows the SAILOR out . ) MYRA Gertie , was n't it ? KITTY Yes  --  and look what 's she 's got ! Whoops  --  ai n't she naval ! p. 10 MYRA I hate sailors . KITTY You 're like me , ducky  --  always loyal to the army . ( MYRA has been looking across the bridge toward the ominous bulk of London . ) MYRA How is business around this old graveyard ? KITTY Shocking . This war MYRA I know . I 've been reading the Sunday papers . We do n't seem to be going so good these days . KITTY The bloody Russians ' ave given in . The Italians ' as gone ' ome in disgust  --  and as for us ! Why , only last week they were ' olding thanksgiving services ' ere for the great victory we won at Cambrai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even while the bells of St. Paul 's and the Abbey were ringing out in celebration , the boys in the streets were shouting news of the German counter-attack and ' ow we 'd lost I do n't know ' ow many thousand men . Oh , it 's appalling ! MYRA I noticed the people in the station , and in the streets coming over . They looked as if they was all hurrying to a funeral or something . KITTY That 's just what they are doing . I give you my word , London 's dead . Nothing fit to eat or drink , no signs of life and no ' ope of any . It 's going to be a wretched winter . p. 11 MYRA It must be terrible for us . KITTY It 's ruinous . What are your plans ? MYRA I ai n't made any . I do n't suppose there 's any shows going into rehearsal ? KITTY None that I know of . Will you go back to Mrs.'Obley 's to live ? MYRA I guess so . Is it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . The old girl 's as preachy as ever . MYRA Well  --  I 'm used to her . KITTY I 'm afraid Mrs.'Obley wo n't welcome you very cordially if you ' ave no money . MYRA She 's got all my stuff there . She 's been holding it for what I owe her . KITTY If you 're counting on any kindness from ' er you 'll go to bed ' ungry MYRA I 'll be lucky to go to bed at all . She 'll holler for the room rent in advance . Say  --  you could n't stake me to a few shillings for a couple of days , could you , Kitty ? KITTY If I only could . But Yank , if you 've got three bob you 're better off than me . ' Ullo ! What 's this ? Oh  --  it 's only a civvie ! ( She has started toward the right , but has turned away in disappointment . An elderly CIVILLAN comes in from the right . He is poorly dressed , but gentle in speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat. ) p. 12 CIVILIAN I beg pardon , Miss  --  KITTY ( affably ) Yes ? CIVILIAN Am I right for Balham ? KITTY Balham ? You can take a ' lectric train at Waterloo that 'll fetch you there . CIVILIAN I  --  I think I 'd rather walk . KITTY It 's a long way , sir . CIVILIAN But it 's such a fine night  --  clear , bracing air . KITTY ( with a glance at MYRA ) Well  --  you keep straight on Waterloo Road , and then bear off on Kennington Park Road . But it 's miles and miles . CIVILIAN I 'll be all the better for a walk . Thank you so much . ( He lifts his hat . ) Good evening . ( He starts out . ) KITTY Good evening to you , sir . ( The CIVILIAN is gone . ) Poor old codger . The trouble with ' im is ' e ai n't got the price of a thripenny ticket . ' E 'll be fagged out before ' e ever sees Balham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk all the way over the Hog's-back to Guildford this afternoon , lugging this damned bag . p. 13 KITTY And no one to give you a lift ? MYRA God , no . You do n't see many cars on the roads these days . KITTY I know . Most of the taxis ' ere ' as stopped running Nobody can get any petrol except the blinking red tabs . I expect you 're too tired to go to work to-night . MYRA You 're damned right I am . All I want to do is go to bed  --  and when I get there , I want to go to sleep . KITTY You 're a lazy one . What you ought to do is come with me along the Strand and make some money so you can surprise Mrs.'Obley with the rent . MYRA ( looking along the bridge ) The way it looks to me there ai n't any money on the streets to-night . KITTY Oh  --  it 'll be better later  --  after the raid 's over . MYRA Is there going to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge is so empty . Everyone 's in the tubes and shelters already . MYRA We did n't get any of that stuff down in the country KITTY Well , Fritzie never misses a clear night ' ere , And I can promise you its been raising ' ell with trade  --  keeps the soldiers off the streets . ( She looks upward . ) The dirty ' Un . p. 14 MYRA Well , cheer up , Kitty . With the cold weather coming on , maybe it 'll get foggy . KITTY That 's all the protection we can expect . Fog ! You never see our Flying Corps driving the ' Un back . If they were on the job , the Gothas and Zeppelins would n't get beyond Margate . ( An Australian soldier comes in from the left , whistling cheerily the march song , " Colonel Bogey . " ) ' I , Australia  --  lookin ' for a nice girl ? ( He thumbs his nose and goes out . ) Bloody Colonial ! Oh  --  Lord  --  trade is shocking bad . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the wind up . MYRA ( she has again been regarding the dismal prospect of London ) Oh  --  it 's a rotten town . KITTY ( indignant ) What is ? MYRA London . KITTY I resent that ! MYRA Well , what do you think of it , yourself ? KITTY I ' ave a right to complain about it , cause I 'm native . You ai n't . You 're a guest . MYRA Sure  --  just the same as a crook that 's sent up is a guest in prison . And that 's what London means to me . When I walked out of that station and felt the old pavements under my feet , I said to myself , " Oh , God ! Do , I have to start pounding those again ! " I tell you , Kitty  --  farming is tough work , and it 's dull  --  but it 's a damned sight better than this . p. 15 KITTY ( knowingly ) I see , ducky . Being out in the open air so much ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me virtuous . It 's made me homesick . It 's made me wish I was out of this country of yours . KITTY ( injured ) That 's gratitude , that is . After the way we 've befriended you , and treated you as one of us , and MYRA Oh , now , do n't take it that way , Kitty . You ca n't blame me for thinking how swell it would be to be back in New York , where there 's no war , and plenty of money , and electric lights KITTY Yes  --  and if you were there , you 'd be doing the same thing you 're doing ' ere , would n't you ? MYRA A fat chance ! Why , if I was home , I might get another job in the chorus , and have the men running after me , instead of me running after them . KITTY The trouble with you is you 're getting snobbish . MYRA Say  --  that 's just what I 'd like to get . I 'd like to think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd walk out of the stage door in Forty-first street , the whole carriage trade 'd be there , fighting to get at me . The thing I hate is the walking up and down , up and down , all day , all night  --  chasing after bums , like that sailor Gertie was with . And having to listen to them telling you to get the hell out of the way , you bloody tart . That 's why I ai n't in love with the idea of getting back to London . p. 16 KITTY That 's all very fine . But ' ere you are  --  back on the old bridge  --  and what are you going to do about it ? MYRA I 'm going back to work and get sore feet like I used to do . KITTY ( sympathetic ) I understand ' ow you feel , ducky . But it 'll seem better after you 've ' ad a good night 's rest . MYRA Say  --  I think I 'll change my mind about tonight . KITTY ' Ow ? MYRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hobley 's and then start out . KITTY You mean on the job ? MYRA On the job . If I wait till to-morrow , it 'll only be that much harder . KITTY ( delighted ) That 's more like it , ducky ! That 's the stuff to give the troops . Now you 're sounding like your old self again . MYRA It 'll be great to see all the girls again . Agnes , and Phbe , and Harriet , and KITTY Phbe 's gone to Aldershot , but you 'll find plenty of the others . Why not walk with me as far as the Strand ? MYRA No  --  you go on ahead . You might meet a customer , and I 'd be in the way , with this suitcase . p. 17 KITTY You 're very thoughtful . I may see you a bit later on . MYRA I hope so . KITTY And if we do n't meet before morning , I 'll come across the roof and call on you . Right ? MYRA Sure . Good luck , Kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I 'm afraid . There 's too much of this bloody moonlight . ( After KITTY 'S exit , MYRA starts to pick up her suitcase  --  but looks to the left and sees ROY coming . As he enters , he pauses to gaze over the parapet at the impressive prospect of St. Paul 's Cathedral by moonlight . ROY is a palpable , forthright soldier , with a red , honest face . His ill-fitting but clean uniform is marked with the shinging insignia of the Royal Canadian Regiment . On each sleeve is a Lance Corporal 's chevron ; on his left sleeve , a gold wound stripe . A haversack is slung over his shoulder . MYRA takes a good look at him . As he is passing her she makes an apparently awkward movement with her suitcase so that she shoves it in his path , and he stumbles over it ) . MYRA Oh  --  I 'm terribly sorry ROY CRONIN Oh  --  that 's all right p. 18 MYRA It was very clumsy of me , but I ROY CRONIN ( moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I did n't know which way I was going . ( She affects to be bewildered by the immensity of London . ) ROY CRONIN You a stranger here ? MYRA Yes  --  I  --  I just arrived at the station , and I could n't seem to pick up a taxi anywhere , and I 'm kind of ROY CRONIN Say ! You talk like an American . MYRA That 's what I am , soldier , ROY CRONIN Well , I 'll be darned . What are you doing here ? I mean , how do you happen to be in this town ? MYRA Oh  --  I 've been over here doing war work . ROY CRONIN Well ! You and me both . MYRA Are you an American ? ROY CRONIN Why , sure ! Could n't you tell that just to listen to me ? MYRA Well  --  I thought that was an English uniform . ROY CRONIN Oh , do n't let that fool you . It 's Canadian . There 's lots of us in this outfit . p. 19 MYRA You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't you ? ( She is making no secret of her admiration . ) ROY CRONIN ( laughing sheepishly ) Well  --  I guess so  --  but , say  --  I certainly am glad to hear the sound of your voice . It 's been a long time since I 've heard a woman talk like that . Where do you come from ? MYRA I was last seen in New York . ROY CRONIN New York City ? MYRA Yes . ROY CRONIN I come from up-State . Locke 's Falls . MYRA Is that so ? ROY CRONIN Ever been there ? MYRA No  --  I 've never been to Locke 's Falls . ROY CRONIN Well , I guess you have n't missed much . But I like it . How long have you been here in London ? MYRA Four years . ROY CRONIN You mean to say you were here before the war ? ( He ca n't imagine that any one was here before the war . ) MYRA Yes . I saw it start . ROY CRONIN What were you  --  just on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show . ROY CRONIN You mean , like a play ? MYRA A musical show . ROY CRONIN No ! You 're an actress ? MYRA No  --  not exactly . I 'm a chorus girl . ( She says this in the hope that it will impress and excite him . It does . ) ROY CRONIN A chorus girl ! Gosh MYRA I guess that sounds pretty awful to you . ROY CRONIN It does not . It sounds fine to me ! What  --  what was the name of the show you came over with ? MYRA It was called " the Pink Lady . " ROY CRONIN Well  --  can you beat that ! " The Pink Lady " ! Why , I saw that in Syracuse . That was one good show , all right . Were you in it then ? MYRA No  --  I missed Syracuse . ROY CRONIN I suppose it was kind of a second-rate company that played it there . But it certainly was a great hit . I can remember every bit of it . MYRA Yes  --  everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to meet anybody who was in " The Pink Lady . " Are you still on the stage ? p. 21 MYRA No  --  I gave that up . ROY CRONIN Got sick of it , I suppose ? MYRA Yes , I got sick of it . And on top of that , I could n't get a job . ROY CRONIN Ah  --  I 'll bet they do n't know what talent is over here . MYRA Perhaps that 's it . ROY CRONIN So you 've been doing war work . What kind ? MYRA Does it seem to you that you 're asking a lot of questions ? ROY CRONIN I 'm sorry , Miss . You probably think I 'm pretty fresh . But , honestly  --  you do n't know what your voice did to me . It just took me back home , and I guess you know what a long way that is . MYRA Sure  --  that 's all right . ( He gives evidence of starting to leave ; she draws him back with a hasty question . ) Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . I 've been in hospital . I 'm on sick leave . MYRA ( very solicitous ) Were you wounded ? ROY CRONIN Yes  --  I got a nice little Blighty . MYRA Oh  --  you poor thing ! Whereabouts did it get you ? p. 22 ROY CRONIN Shoulder and legs . MYRA All at once ? ROY CRONIN Well  --  it was just a machine gun . ( He indicates his right shoulder . ) And then I got some splinters before they 'd scraped me up . MYRA ( looking him over ) But you 're all well now , are n't you ? ROY CRONIN I ought to be . They 've been working on me since last April . MYRA And you 've been in hospital all that time ! ROY CRONIN Oh , well . There 's lots worse places than hospital . MYRA Well  --  I 'm afraid I 'll have to be moving along . ROY CRONIN Where were you going ? MYRA Oh  --  I have a little flat that I always go to when I 'm in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice , homelike atmosphere . ROY CRONIN Are you walking there ? MYRA I 'm afraid I 'll have to . There does n't seem to be a sign of a taxi . I suppose you 'll be going out to see the town ? ROY CRONIN Say  --  the only thing I want to see now is some food . I 'm so hungry I could What 's that ? p. 23 MYRA Say ! Listen ! ( There is a dreadful shriek from a warning siren , followed by the sound of distant artillery . ) There it comes ! ROY CRONIN It sounds like the guns were opening up . What 's the idea ? ( The barrage increases . Mixed with it are the sounds of bugles , whistles and more sirens screaming the alarm . ) MYRA Heinie 's up . ( Two civilians run across from right to left . ) ROY CRONIN ( excited ) No ! Is it an air raid ? MYRA That 's just what it is . We 'd better be moving ( A shrill voice is heard shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROY CRONIN I 've always wanted to see a raid on London . ( He is looking over the parapet toward the east . He takes out a cigarette . ) MYRA If you stay here you 're liable to see too much of it . ROY CRONIN Why  --  the chances are a million to one against a bomb dropping around here . MYRA It is n't the bombs that make it dangerous to be out . It 's the shrapnel from our own guns . It comes down over the city like a rain-storm. p. 24 ROY CRONIN Just the same , it sure is something to see . Just think of the old guy up there with eight million people to aim at . ( He starts to light his cigarette . She jumps forward and blows out the match . ) MYRA Do n't be a damned fool ! ROY CRONIN What 's the matter ? MYRA You could go to jail for showing a light . ROY CRONIN Gosh  --  this is funny . I thought I was on leave , away from the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier . Well , I 'm going . ROY CRONIN Here  --  give me that grip . ( He takes her suitcase away from her . ) Where are you going ? MYRA I do n't know , but I 'm not going to stay here ( A special constable , wearing a tin hat , rides in on a bicycle , shouting , " Take cover ! Take cover ! " and rides out . ) ROY CRONIN There 's a job I 'd like to have . MYRA Are you coming ? Or will you give me back my suitcase ? ROY CRONIN Could n't we go and get something to eat ? p. 25 MYRA No  --  all the places close up during the raids . Come on ! ROY CRONIN All right  --  anywhere you say . ( She goes out at the right . He follows her . The barrage has increased in volume as more batteries have opened up . The bugle calls , sirens and cries of " Take cover ! " are heard from all directions . Bursts from machine guns are added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound : the vibrant , rhythmic hum of German airplane motors . ) CURTAIN ( The lowering of the curtain muffles the sound of the barrage , which continues to be heard , dimly , during the brief intermission between scenes and intermittently throughout most of the scene that follows. ) p. 26 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ISCENE II A room in Mrs. HOBLEY 'S lodging house in one of the mean streets between Aldwych and Covent Garden . The furniture is cheaply elegant but shabby . There is a table in the centre , a bed against the wall at the right , a door at the left , a window at the back , a washstand , bureau , dressing-table and several chairs . At the right is MYRA 'S battered trunk , with a label , " The Pink Lady  --  Hotel . " There is an antiquated gramophone on a small table near the bed at the right ; it has a horn shaped and colored like a morning glory . On the walls are some pictures  --  one a shiny photographic portrait of EDWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . HOBLEY is at the window , which is somewhat to the right of centre . She is drawing the curtains so that no crack of light can emerge between the lowered shade and the sill . The gramophone is playing the " Beautiful Lady " waltz from " The Pink Lady . " This should be heard before the curtain goes up . MRS . HOBLEY is a woman of about forty , with a few pathetic simulations of refinement . On her face is a permanent expression of resignation , with which are mixed suspicion and scorn . She is in a constant stage of lamentation because she , a flagrantly good woman , has been compelled by force of wartime circumstance to subsist on the profits of the prostitution that goes on under her roof . At present , her one aim in life is self-justification . MYRA comes in . MYRA Hello  --  Mrs. HOBLEY. p. 27 MRS . HOBLEY What ? Who 's that ? Oh ! So you 've come back , ' ave you ? MYRA Were n't you expecting me ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYRA Can I have the room ? MRS . HOBLEY The room is to let , as you may see . ( She has turned off the gramophone , abruptly , without lifting the needle . ) MYRA That 's fine . MRS . HOBLEY The first week will be payable strictly in advance . MYRA Well  --  you 'll have to MRS . HOBLEY So I 'll trouble you for twenty-two shillings . MYRA What ? Twenty-two shillings ? Why you only used to charge me fourteen MRS . HOBLEY Conditions that are painful to me ' ave forced me to raise the rent . MYRA But that 's terrible . You 've got no right to ask that much for a dump like this . MRS . HOBLEY While you 've been away  --  wherever you ' ave been  --  you 've probably managed to forget that there 's such a thing as a war going on . Everything 's dearer . It 's all I can do to make body and soul meet . Twenty-two shillings for a sunny , airy apartment like this is little enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look elsewhere . p. 28 MYRA Where 's my trunk ? MRS . HOBLEY I ' ave it in safe keeping . MYRA I notice you 've been playing my gramophone and wearing out the records . MRS . HOBLEY That gramophone is not yours . It 's mine , and so 's your trunk mine , and all its contents , and they 'll remain mine until such time as you pay me in full for what 's been owing since last April . You 'll see the itemized bill on the dresser there . MYRA ( looking at the bill ) Well  --  I 'll take the room back , for the time being . But you 'll have to wait a little while for the first payment . MRS . HOBLEY Oh , will I ? I 'm not so sure that I will . I notice you ' ave no luggage with you . MYRA Yes , I have . But it MRS . HOBLEY I suppose you left it at the Carlton , eh ? MYRA No  --  it 's being brought up by  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ? MYRA Yes  --  a gentleman . MRS . HOBLEY ( pretending to be pained ) Indeed ! Up to your old ways , are n't you ? p. 29 MYRA It 's none of your business what I 'm doing . MRS . HOBLEY Do n't be insolent with me , you common little miserable street walker . None of my business , eh ! MYRA No  --  it is n't . I do n't owe you anything . You 've got my trunk and most of my clothes in your possession . MRS . HOBLEY And a valuable wardrobe it is . I could n't even give it away to the Salvation Army . I want my pay , in money . That 's the very least I ' ave a right to demand . MYRA You 'll get your money , all right . MRS . HOBLEY When ? After your gentleman ' as paid up for ' is licentious enjoyment ? MYRA I told you you 'd be paid . Now will you kindly get to hell out of here ? MRS . HOBLEY Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you are  --  because I 've stood by in silence while you polluted my ' ouse with your immoralities  --  because I 've accepted from you the money you 've made by preying on our poor soldiers that 's fighting to protect our country from the ' Un . But you wo n't ( There is a suggestion of tears of mortification in her voice . ) MYRA Oh , shut up  --  shut up ! ( She is looking about the room to see if everything is there , and paying little attention to Mrs. HOBLEY. ) p. 30 MRS . HOBLEY I wo n't shut up . It 's a grievous shame when a decent person is reduced to struggling for ' er rights with scum like you . God ' imself knows I 've been patient with you . MYRA Is that so ? ( Merely a polite question . ) MRS . HOBLEY But I can tell you my patience is out . It 's time you learned that I 'm not conducting this ' ouse as a charitable institution for you and your kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been occupied much lately . MRS . HOBLEY Well  --  what if it ' as n't ? MYRA And yet you 've got the nerve to raise the rent on me . MRS . HOBLEY It 's no more than I deserve for tolerating you at all . MYRA Oh  --  I see ! That extra eight shillings is hush money for your conscience . MRS . HOBLEY I do n't understand you . MYRA You do n't have to . You 'll get paid . That 's all you need to know . MRS . HOBLEY I 'll see to that ! Where is ' e  --  this friend of yours ? MYRA He 's down below , in the fish-and-chip shop . They let him in to get some food . p. 31 MRS . HOBLEY What is ' e  --  a soldier ? MYRA Yes . MRS . HOBLEY ' Ow much money ' as ' e ? MYRA How should I know ? I have n't searched him . MRS . HOBLEY I 'll just ' ave a look at ' im before I decide if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you to look at him . I want you to get out . MRS . HOBLEY Oh ? Is there anything queer about him ? MYRA Say  --  why do you have to stay here ? Why do n't you get down into the cellar ? Do n't you know there 's an air raid ? MRS . HOBLEY I ' ave other things than the German bombers to protect myself against . If my poor , gallant ' usband were ' ere MYRA It wo n't do you any good to be so damned suspicious . Do n't you think I 'm able to get twenty-two shillings ? MRS . HOBLEY You do n't even know ' e ' as that much . MYRA He 's only just started his leave . He 's got all his pay . MRS . HOBLEY Per'aps ' e ' as sense enough to keep it . MYRA I tell you I 'll get it out of him . You can leave that to me. p. 32 MRS . HOBLEY You 'd jolly well better , or you 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( she has heard footsteps on the stairs outside . She goes to the door and calls , sweetly , " Is that you , soldier ? " Roy 's voice is heard , saying , " Yes  --  that kid told me to come up this way . " MYRA says , " Come right in . " ) ( Roy comes in , carrying the suitcase and three packages , wrapped with newspaper . ) ROY CRONIN Well  --  I could n't get much . ( He looks around the room . He is embarrassed and sheeplishly ill at ease . ) MRS . HOBLEY ( more agreeable ) Good evening . ROY CRONIN How de do . MYRA This is Mrs. HOBLEY , the landlady . ROY CRONIN Very glad to know you , Mrs. HOBLEY . ( He comes forward to shake hands . ) MRS . HOBLEY ( inspecting him with approval ) Maple leafs ! A Canadian . ROY CRONIN Yes , ma'am . ( To MYRA ) There 's some tea there . But they did n't have any milk . p. 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROY CRONIN No  --  I just got out of hospital in Richmond to-day . MRS . HOBLEY Oh  --  I see ! Is n't that lovely ! ' Out of ' ospital , your time 's your own , lots of money  --  you are in luck . ROY CRONIN I certainly am . MYRA I think I heard somebody calling you downstairs , Mrs. HOBLEY . MRS . HOBLEY No doubt you did , my dear . Well  --  I 'll be saying good night . ( To ROY ) It 's always a pleasure to ' ave any of the Canadians with us . We owe you such a debt for all you 've done ROY CRONIN ( with another sheepish laugh ) There 's lots of people over here who say different . MRS . HOBLEY And I ' ope you 'll be very ' appy , on your leave . ( To MYRA ) Good night , my dear . ( She pats MYRA 'S cheek and goes out . ) ROY CRONIN She 's certainly very cordial . MYRA Yes . What have you got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 34 ROY CRONIN Well  --  that 's fish and chips , and there 's some bread and margarine in here , and this is the tea . It 's a pretty punk meal , but MYRA Oh , it looks fine . I think there 's a kettle here some place . ( She goes to a curtained wardrobe at the left and takes from it a kettle , teapot and cups and plates . She fills the kettle from the pitcher on the wash-stand and puts it to boil on a gas heater , but discovers that there is no gas . All this goes on during the subsequent dialogue . ) ROY CRONIN I was lucky to get anything . There was n't a soul in that tea-room except a little boy MYRA Oh  --  that was Halbert Hedward . He 's a great friend of mine . ROY CRONIN All the rest were down in the cellar , but he 'd sneaked upstairs . He said he was on guard in case the Germans got in . MYRA Oh , he 's cute . After the raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets for pieces of shrapnel . ROY CRONIN Souvenirs , eh ? MYRA No , he takes all the pieces he finds down to the war office and turns them in . He thinks they can use them a second time . p. 35 ROY CRONIN Maybe they do at that . Ca n't I help with any of that ? MYRA Well  --  yes  --  you could , if you 've got such a thing as a shilling about you . ROY CRONIN ( reaching in his pants pocket ) Why , sure , I guess I can dig that up . Here . ( He holds out a handful of coins . She takes a shilling . ) MYRA Thanks . ( She pats his hand , then puts the coin in the meter . ) ROY CRONIN Say  --  what is that  --  a slot machine ? MYRA It turns on the gas . ROY CRONIN I thought maybe you were getting a package of gum . MYRA Oh  --  nothing like that . Now do n't forget to remind me to pay you back that shilling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm giving this party , even the gas . MYRA You 're a regular spendthrift , are n't you ? ROY CRONIN Well  --  I feel like one , now . I feel as if I 've got so much money I could buy the whole town . MYRA Oh ! I suppose you 've got a lot of back pay . p. 36 ROY CRONIN Yes  --  you see they hold out on you while you 're in hospital . That means it 's been piling up . MYRA How lovely  --  for you . ROY CRONIN Well  --  I 'm certainly going to try to have a good time with it . MYRA I hope you do n't go and lose it all  --  gambling , or anything like that . ROY CRONIN Oh , do n't worry . I was n't born the day before yesterday . MYRA No ? ROY CRONIN ( happily ) Now you 're trying to kid me . MYRA ( putting her hand on his arm ) Who says I was trying to do anything like that ? ROY CRONIN That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you want . MYRA ( slyly ) Maybe I could n't . ( She turns away to the kettle . ) ROY CRONIN ( fervently ) Gee  --  it 's great being here ! I 'm certainly grateful to old Heinie for putting on this show for me to-night . ( He wanders over to the window . ) It 'll give me one more thing to brag about when I get home . ( He raises the window shade to look out . ) Gosh ! You can see the flashes of the Ac-Acs ( MYRA darts across and pulls down the shade. ) p. 37 MYRA Are you crazy ? ROY CRONIN Oh  --  I 'm sorry . I keep forgetting about it being a war . ( She goes back to the wash-stand to resume her work . ) MYRA If you pull that shade up any more , the cops will be around here to remind you . ROY CRONIN ( fondly ) Cops ! How long has it been since I 've heard that word ! MYRA They wear funny hats over here  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROY CRONIN Would they mind if I smoked ? MYRA No  --  I guess that 'll be allowed . ( He unbuttons one of the pockets of his tunic and takes out a pack of Camels . ) ROY CRONIN Will you have one ? MYRA No , thanks . ROY CRONIN You do n't smoke ? ( He is beginning to feel more at ease . ) MYRA Yes  --  sometimes . ROY CRONIN A lot of girls smoke now . In the hospitals , the V. A. D. 's were always sneaking cigarettes with us patients . p. 38 MYRA Well , you ca n't blame ' em . Those nurses do n't have much fun . ( Roy has lit the cigarette and is watching her as she bustles back and forth across the stage , busy with her preparations . ) ROY CRONIN Gee  --  it does me good to hear your voice . MYRA You 've said that before . ROY CRONIN I know  --  but when I hear you talk , I ca n't seem to believe it . MYRA Why not ? ROY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this town , with bobbies and pubs and air-raids and all that MYRA I should think you 'd be accustomed to hearing a lot of American accents in the Canadian army . They talk just like we do . ROY CRONIN Sure  --  but the difference is , you 're a woman . That 's what makes it so funny . I have n't heard a woman talk like you since I came over in ' 14 . MYRA Fourteen ? Were you here that quick ? ROY CRONIN Yes  --  but it was kind of an accident , though . MYRA How 'd you happen to do it ? ROY CRONIN You mean enlist ?  --  Well  --  how did anybody happen to do it ? I was on the way home from summer camp , and I stopped off in Toronto . That was in August . The town was war crazy then . Things were just getting going . The old contemptibles were on the retreat from Mons to the Marne , and the recruiting officers were shouting their heads off . Everybody was excited  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYRA I remember how it was here . ROY CRONIN I was trying to elbow my way through the crowd when a military band came down the street . They were playing " It 's A Long Way To Tipperary . " The next thing I knew I was hot-footing it up a gang-plank . MYRA I guess it was that way with most . ROY CRONIN Sure it was  --  just boyish enthusiasm . MYRA And has it lasted ? ROY CRONIN What ? MYRA The boyish enthusiasm . ROY CRONIN For three years ? No  --  you do n't stay boyish very long in this war . MYRA ( smiling ) I can see that . Are you getting hungry ? ROY CRONIN You bet I am . MYRA Then why do n't you begin on the fish and chips ? ROY CRONIN I 'd rather wait ' till you sit down . MYRA All right . ( She starts to draw chairs up to the table but he does it for her . ) ROY CRONIN Say  --  you do n't even know my name . p. 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Roy Cronin . Lance Corporal Roy Cronin . Lance Corporal . That 's a hot title , is n't it ? What 's your name ? MYRA Myra . ROY CRONIN Myra . Is that all ? MYRA My last name 's Deauville . ROY CRONIN That sounds French . Are you of French descent ? MYRA No . Deauville 's just my stage name . ROY CRONIN Oh , I see . What 's your real name ? MYRA I do n't use that any more . Stop watching the kettle . You keep it from boiling by watching it . ROY CRONIN I was n't watching the kettle . I was looking at you . MYRA You must be hard up for something to look at . ROY CRONIN Believe me , I am ! MYRA Hey , listen  --  that was n't the right thing to say . ROY CRONIN Oh , gosh ! I guess I 've forgotten how to be polite . But anyway , I think you 're wonderful looking . MYRA I am not . I look like a tramp . p. 41 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYRA No , soldier . What did you say your name was ? ROY CRONIN Roy Cronin . Roy to you . MYRA Now we can begin to eat . ( She takes the kettle off . He jumps up . ) ROY CRONIN Here  --  let me take that . MYRA There is n't much in the way of china and silverware Here . ROY CRONIN Well  --  fingers were invented before forks . ( He laughs . ) MYRA Do you take sugar ? ROY CRONIN Sure . MYRA Well , there is n't any . Wait a minute . ( She goes to her handbag , opens it , and takes from it a small bottle of saccharine pills . ) Here 's some saccharine . ROY CRONIN How many of these pills make a lump of sugar ? MYRA One will be plenty . I guess you 're pretty sick of tea . ( There is one cup and one glass for the tea . She fills the cup and hands it to him . ) ROY CRONIN ( as she pours ) Yes ! I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being such a thing as coffee . No  --  you take the cup and give me the glass . p. 42 MYRA No  --  you keep it . The saccharine is in the cup . I do n't take it sweet . ROY CRONIN Ca n't you get sugar ? MYRA I should say not . You ca n't get much of anything in London that ai n't imitation . All the butter is margarine , and the eggs come in powder , and as for the meat ROY CRONIN Horse , I suppose . MYRA Not even horse . There just ai n't any . However , there 's always Brussels sprouts . ROY CRONIN Gosh ! You have to join the army to get anything to eat . MYRA I guess that 's about it . ROY CRONIN ( his mouth full ) The submarines must be pretty bad . MYRA What did you say ? ROY CRONIN I said  --  the submarines must be getting pretty bad . MYRA Yes . They seem to be a lot worse than the papers let on . Anyway , the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you stay here ? Why did n't you go home long ago ? MYRA Oh  --  there 's lots of reasons for that . p. 43 ROY CRONIN Do n't you want to go home ? MYRA Of course I 'd like to . ROY CRONIN Then what 's kept you back ? Believe me  --  if it was n't for the duration of this war , I 'd be in Locke 's Falls this minute . MYRA Well , if you must know  --  I 've stayed here because I never had the price of a ticket home . ROY CRONIN Did the show close and leave you stranded ? MYRA Oh , no . We were a big success . But I got into another show , a kind of music hall thing . It went out into the provinces and died there . ROY CRONIN It must have been a tough life , all right . MYRA It was . ( A machine-gun can be heard popping . ) ROY CRONIN Listen ! Machine-guns ! ( ROY goes to the window to listen . ) MYRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the city . ROY CRONIN Say  --  I can hear the German plane . Do you hear that  --  rmm , rmmm , rmmm ? He must be flying awful low . MYRA Well , do n't open the window to wave to him . ( There is a loud crash of a bomb in the near vicinity . They both jump. ) p. 44 ROY CRONIN Gosh ! That was n't any too far off . Do you think it 's safe for you to stay in here ? MYRA The roof keeps out the shrapnel . As for the bombs ROY CRONIN Oh  --  if one of them got a direct hit it would n't do us any good to be down in the cellar . ( The machine-gun has stopped firing . ) I guess he 's gone somewhere else . ( He comes back to the table . ) You 've got to hand it to those Heinies  --  flying hundreds of miles over here in the night just for the sake of dropping a few bombs and scaring people . MYRA They must be pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . It must be a thrill to be up there , looking down on London . But I 'd rather be right where I am . ( He sits down and resumes his eating . ) You know , I 've always wondered about chorus girls . MYRA What about them ? ROY CRONIN How much salary they got , and so forth . MYRA We were lucky to pull down four quid a week over here . That 's about twenty dollars . ROY CRONIN That 's awful . And it was hard work , too , I 'll bet . p. 45 MYRA It was no cinch . ROY CRONIN How did you ever learn all those dances ? MYRA Oh  --  just rehearsed and rehearsed . ROY CRONIN ( after a moment 's pause ) When you were on the stage , did you use to be chased a lot by men ? MYRA Not so much as people think . ROY CRONIN I 'll bet if I 'd ever come around to the stage door you would n't even have looked at me . MYRA Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRONIN No  --  I only went to the theatre a few times in my life , mostly in Syracuse . MYRA What did you do for a living ? ROY CRONIN Oh , I fooled around a machine-shop . I was just headed for technical school when I got into this outfit . MYRA What did you do evenings ? ROY CRONIN I used to be mostly at the " Y. " MYRA The what ? ROY CRONIN The " Y "  --  you know , the Y. M. C. A. I was a volunteer physical director . p. 46 MYRA So you 're a Y. M. C. A. boy . ROY CRONIN You think that 's the same as being a sissy , do n't you ? MYRA No , I was n't thinking that . ROY CRONIN Oh , a lot of people kid about the " Y , " but I always liked working there . It keeps you in good physical condition . MYRA You 're pretty healthy , are n't you ? ROY CRONIN Not now . You 've got to remember I 've been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of weight . But it wo n't take me long to get back into shape . MYRA When do you have to go back to the army ? ROY CRONIN I 've got fourteen days ' sick leave . Then I report at Bramshott Camp . I wish you 'd tell me what kind of war work you 've been doing . MYRA It was n't anything interesting . ROY CRONIN What was it  --  entertainment ? MYRA ( disturbed ) What do you mean , entertainment ? ROY CRONIN I mean  --  amusing the troops . Lots of stage people have been doing that , putting on shows at the camps and the rest villages in France . p. 47 MYRA Oh , no  --  I never did any of that . I 've been a farmerette . ROY CRONIN What the heck is a farmerette ? MYRA What does it sound like ? It 's a girl that works on a farm . ROY CRONIN That 's a funny thing for you to do . Where did you ever learn anything about farming ? MYRA No place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I did n't have brains enough , I guess , to be even an assistant trained nurse . They were advertising for women recruits  --  for the Waacs , and all those things . That was last spring , just when the U. S. got into the war . ROY CRONIN And you joined up ? MYRA Yes , I was like you . I suddenly got patriotic and went down to the office in Whitehall , and the next thing I knew they 'd put me to work with a hoe . ROY CRONIN That took a lot of nerve , all right . What made you quit ? MYRA The farming season is over and most of us were laid up for the winter . ROY CRONIN What do you expect to do now ? MYRA I have n't made up my mind . Want some more tea ? p. 48 ROY CRONIN Thanks . This certainly is n't much of a meal , but it was the best I could get . MYRA After you 've been around London a couple of weeks you 'll consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay the whole fourteen days in London . MYRA Oh ! Have you friends you can visit ? ROY CRONIN No  --  There 's not a soul I know over here . But I thought I 'd like to take a little trip . MYRA Where 'd you plan to go ? ROY CRONIN Well , I thought I 'd like to go up to Birmingham and see what it 's like there . And then I promised my family I would n't miss the chance to visit Shakespeare 's birthplace . MYRA That 's very interesting . ROY CRONIN Ever been there ? MYRA No , but I 've heard lots about it . ROY CRONIN Maybe now I 'll decide not to take the trip . MYRA Why not ? ROY CRONIN I think I 'd have a better time staying here in London . MYRA You ought n't to miss the trip . ( They have finished eating by now. ) p. 49 ROY CRONIN I can take that some other time . What I 'd like to do on this leave is see a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean to shows and things like that ? MYRA Why , Yes  --  sure  --  of course I would . But you can find lots better things to do than that . ROY CRONIN I do n't think so . Going around with you would be my idea of a good time . It would be something to look back to ! MYRA Would it ? ROY CRONIN You bet it would ! MYRA Well , I 'm sure I appreciate it . Here  --  I 'll clean this stuff out of here . ROY CRONIN Let me do it . MYRA No  --  you sit still . ( She gathers up the dishes . ) I 'll just put them in the sink outside . ( ROY holds the door open for her as she goes out . He looks around the room , goes to the window , peaks out , then ambles over to the gramophone . He examines the record , and then starts it going . He sits down on the bed to listen , After a while MYRA comes in . ) ROY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's Hazel Dawn 's number . p. 50 ROY CRONIN Gosh  --  how that takes me back . MYRA Me too . ( She sits down beside him . ) ROY CRONIN That was certainly a great show . MYRA Yes . ROY CRONIN That 's a show I 'd like to see again  --  with you in it . MYRA You would n't even notice me in it . ROY CRONIN I would n't notice anything else . MYRA You 're getting easier with your compliments . ROY CRONIN That was n't any compliment . I really meant it . I think you 're a peach . It was pretty lucky , was n't it , our meeting like that in the middle of an air raid ? MYRA Yes , it was . ROY CRONIN I mean  --  two people from the same country , from the same state , with the same ideas about things . MYRA Do you think we 've got the same ideas about things ? ROY CRONIN Of course we have . MYRA What makes you think that , Roy ? ROY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my name . p. 51 MYRA What would I call you by ? ROY CRONIN Well  --  in the army  --  you usually get called by just your last name , or your number . MYRA But what makes you think we 've got the same ideas ? ROY CRONIN We talk the same language , do n't we ? MYRA Yes , but that does n't mean much . It does n't change the fact that you 're a Y. M. C. A. boy . ROY CRONIN Oh , lay off that . MYRA Well , you are . And I 'm a  --  an ex-chorus girl . ROY CRONIN That do n't worry me . MYRA What do n't ? ROY CRONIN Your having been in the chorus . I know you 're all right . MYRA How do you know it ? ROY CRONIN I can just tell MYRA That 's no answer . ROY CRONIN Well  --  what you did  --  I mean volunteering for that farm work . That was a pretty fine thing to do . MYRA And I can just tell you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see  --  we have got the same ideas . ( Whenever the gramophone record runs out , MYRA shuts off the machine . ) MYRA Iguess I 'd like to have a smoke , now . ROY CRONIN Oh , sure . Excuse me . ( He hands her the pack of Camels . ) MYRA Where 'd you get those ? ROY CRONIN In a parcel from home . MYRA I have n't seen any of those since I do n't know when . ROY CRONIN ( lighting the cigarette for her ) It 'll probably taste terrible at first , after you 've got used to English cigarettes . Do you inhale ? MYRA Certainly . ROY CRONIN Girls do n't usually inhale . They just puff . MYRA I 'll bet you do n't like to see girls smoke . ROY CRONIN Well  --  I do n't like it usually , to tell you the truth . But it seems to be different with you . Everything 's different with you . ( She sits down . He has been looking about for the ash-tray . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table beside her. ) p. 53 MYRA Roy do you get many parcels from home ? ROY CRONIN Oh , sure  --  the family send me cake and candy and cigarettes and wristlets and things like that . Say  --  what are you supposed to do with wristlets , anyway ? MYRA You wear them , do n't you ? ROY CRONIN I guess so , but I could n't ever figure out why . ( He sits down , awkwardly , on the edge of the table . ) MYRA What 's your family like , Roy ? ROY CRONIN Oh , I do n't know . They 're just like any other family , I guess . Only there 's more of them . I 've got more near relatives than I know what to do with . MYRA Any children of your own ? ROY CRONIN Gosh , no . I 'm not married . MYRA Oh ! Does all your family live in Locke 's Falls ? ROY CRONIN In it or near it . MYRA It must be very nice . ROY CRONIN Yes  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having so many relatives . But it 's a lot of fun around Christmas . The whole family goes broke on account of the number of presents we have to give to each other . p. 54 MYRA And I 'll bet you have big dinners at Thanksgiving . ROY CRONIN Oh  --  do n't speak of it . I was thinking of that only this afternoon . It must be just about Thanksgiving Day now . MYRA They do n't celebrate it here . ROY CRONIN I 'll say they do n't . They 've got nothing to celebrate it with . Say  --  do you suppose there 'd be any chance of us buying a turkey in this town ? MYRA A turkey ! You might just as well go down to the Tower and ask them to hand you over the crown jewels . ( She goes over to the right with the remains of the bread . ) ROY CRONIN Do you know what I 'd like to be doing ? I 'd like to be eating a big Thanksgiving dinner , with you . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation ? ROY CRONIN And then I 'd like to be taking you out to see the Penn-Cornell game . But probably Penn and Cornell are n't playing this year , on account of the U. S. being in the war . ( The machine-gun is heard popping . He goes to the window . ) There goes that Vickers again . Talk about attracting Heinic 's attention  --  those machine-gunners are liable to make this district unpopular . p. 55 MYRA I should think that 'd sound terrible to you  --  on account of having been hit with one ROY CRONIN Well  --  I do n't know ( He is at the left . She crosses so that she is close to him . ) MYRA They wo n't ever send you back to the trenches , will they ? ROY CRONIN They wo n't , eh ! Say ! They 'll shoot me up the line so fast I 'll bump into the parapet . MYRA You 'd think , with all the time you 've been in the army , and then getting wounded , you 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a safe job . ROY CRONIN They 've got plenty of consideration  --  but the trouble is , they have n't got plenty of men . ( There is the barest suggestion of bravado in his tone as he says this . ) MYRA How will you feel when you get back there ? ROY CRONIN Just the way I did before , I guess . I 'll just sit around and pray for another flesh wound . MYRA Was it just a flesh wound that kept you in hospital for over eight months ? ROY CRONIN Not exactly . It tore away some of the bone in the shoulder . p. 56 MYRA How 'd they ever fix you up ? ROY CRONIN Oh , they kept on operating until I could begin working my arm all right . ( He moves his right arm by way of demonstration . ) The fellers in the ward used to kid me about it . They said the medical officers were running a regular bus service between my cot and the pictures . MYRA The pictures ? ROY CRONIN That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seats in it , like a movie theatre . ( He sits down on the arm of a chair at the left . ) MYRA That must have hurt an awful lot . ROY CRONIN I ought to tell you it did n't hurt at all . But I like to hear you sympathize with me . ( MYRA sits down close to him . ) MYRA Does it do you any good to get sympathy out of me ? ROY CRONIN It does me good just to look at you , Myra . Just being here and MYRA That 's the first time you 've said my name . ROY CRONIN I know it . I did n't have the nerve to before . MYRA You know something , Roy ? p. 57 ROY CRONIN What ? MYRA I do n't think you 've ever gone around much with girls . ROY CRONIN What makes you think that ? MYRA The way you talk to me . ROY CRONIN Well , of course , when you 're in the army you do n't have much chance to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chair into the chair itself . ) MYRA How about when you 're on leave ? ROY CRONIN There 's not much chance even then  --  I mean , with decent girls . Take a feller like me , for instance , in a strange country  --  how would I meet any decent girls ? MYRA I suppose not . ROY CRONIN It took an air raid and a freak of luck to fix it up for me to meet you . MYRA Do you think  --  would you call me a decent girl ? ROY CRONIN I would n't put you in the same class with other girls . MYRA Why not ? ROY CRONIN Well  --  you 're nice . ( The sounds of the barrage , which have been occasionally audible throughout this scene , have stopped entirely by now .

ROY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to make something for you  --  socks , or something like that . ROY CRONIN I can always use socks . And anyway  --  whatever you sent me , I 'd treasure it . MYRA I 'd just like to think there was something to make you think  --  to remind you of our little meeting . ROY CRONIN I do n't need anything to remind me , Myra . I 'm not likely to forget  --  anything about you . You ca n't imagine what it is  --  how it feels to find someone , here , that 's friendly MYRA I guess I can imagine that . ( There is a discreet tap at the door . MYRA is startled . ) MYRA Who 's that ? MRS . HOBLEY ( from outside ) It 's me , dear  --  Mrs.'Obley . MYRA Well ? MRS . HOBLEY I just thought you 'd like to know they 're sounding the " all clear " in the streets . p. 59 MYRA Oh  --  thanks . MRS . HOBLEY I 'll be going to bed now , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see me about anything tonight ? MYRA Not now , Mrs. HOBLEY . I 'll see you in the morning . MRS . HOBLEY Oh ! Then good night . Sleep well . MYRA Good night . ROY CRONIN She 's a good soul , that Mrs. HOBLEY . MYRA Yes  --  she 's a love . ( She has gone back to the dresser and looked at Mrs. HOBLEY 'S bill . ) ROY CRONIN She seems to take a great interest in you . ( He notices that there is something on her mind . ) What 's the matter ? MYRA ( coming down ) Did you hear what she said ? The raid 's over . ROY CRONIN That 's fine . MYRA It 's all right to go out into the streets now . ROY CRONIN That sounds like a hint to me to buzz off . MYRA Well  --  it 's pretty late  --  and I guess you 'll be wanting to get to bed . I mean , you probably are n't accustomed to staying up so late on account of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his haversack and his cap and is handing them to him. ) p. 60 ROY CRONIN Say  --  all I 've done since last April is go to bed . ( He puts on the haversack with poorly disguised reluctance . ) MYRA You need plenty of rest . ROY CRONIN I guess you need it more than I do . MYRA Well  --  good night , Roy . ROY CRONIN Good night . ( He goes to the left , obviously hurt by the abruptness of this dismissal . ) MYRA Where were you expecting to go  --  to-night ? ( She follows him to the door . ) ROY CRONIN ( at the door ) Well  --  I had thought I 'd drop around to the Beaver Hut . That 's the Canadian Y. M. C. A. MYRA Do they have beds there ? ROY CRONIN A few beds , and plenty of floor space . MYRA I hope they make you comfortable . ROY CRONIN Oh , I 'll get fixed up . MYRA Well  --  it certainly has been nice seeing you ROY CRONIN It certainly has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshed by the warmth of her farewell. ) p. 61 MYRA I 've had a great time talking to you . ROY CRONIN So 've I. It 's wonderful to be able to just sit around and not have to do anything . MYRA Yes , it 's wonderful , for a change . ( She turns away . ) ROY CRONIN Well  --  to-morrow we 'll go some place for lunch and I 'll get tickets for a show , anything you suggest MYRA Listen , Roy ROY CRONIN What ? MYRA I think we 'd better say good-by here and now . ROY CRONIN Good-by ? But I 'm going to see you MYRA I wo n't be able to meet you to-morrow , after all . ( She walks away from him . He follows her . ) ROY CRONIN Why not , for Pete 's sake ? MYRA I 'll be very busy . ROY CRONIN Busy with what ? MYRA I 've got to get back to work . ROY CRONIN But you 've been working for a long time , on that farm . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds good , but I 've got to get a job right away . p. 62 ROY CRONIN On the stage ? MYRA Well  --  any job I can get . ROY CRONIN You mean , you need the money ? MYRA That 's about it . ROY CRONIN Now look here  --  you just forget about money for the next couple of weeks . You let me take care of that part of it . MYRA I ca n't do that . ROY CRONIN Certainly you can . I 've got more money than I know what to do with . I 've got over seven pounds in my pocket this minute , and there 's more waiting for me at the pay-corps office . Why , I 'm rich . And I 'd like to know how I could spend it to better advantage than going around with you . MYRA That 's very kind of you , Roy . But just the same , I 'd better get back to work . I 'm not going to let you spend everything you 've got ROY CRONIN I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put yourself in the position of being indebted to me or anybody else . Well , you wo n't be . I 'll be the one whose indebted to you . MYRA I 'd like to give you some advice , Roy . ROY CRONIN If it 's to invest my money in government bonds , I do n't want to hear it . p. 63 MYRA No  --  I 've been thinking it over , and I think you 'd better be starting on your trip to-morrow . ROY CRONIN My trip ? MYRA To Shakespeare 's home , and all those places . ROY CRONIN Oh , to hell with  --  I 'd rather stay here . MYRA You 'd better get out of this town just as quick as you can . ROY CRONIN What 's the matter with it ? MYRA It is n't healthy . ROY CRONIN Is there a plague here , or something ? MYRA It just is n't wholesome for you , Roy . You 're a soldier ROY CRONIN Well , who is n't ? MYRA There 's only two things for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a stranger , like you . . Drink  --  and  --  and get himself mixed up with dirty women . ROY CRONIN Oh , that 's bunk . Just because a lot of the troops run wild when they get into the big city . That 's because they 've got no friends . But you see , I 've got you . Why , there 's lots of things we can do . We can visit all the places of historical interest . There 's any number of ' em here . Anyway , that trip of mine is off . Forget it  --  and forget about money , too . ( He turns and goes to the left . ) I 'll be around in the morning . p. 64 MYRA What time ? ROY CRONIN ( again at the door ) Any time you say . MYRA Well  --  you better not come before noon . ROY CRONIN Want to sleep late , eh ? MYRA Yes . ROY CRONIN It 'll do you good . I 'll kill time somehow or other until noon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROY CRONIN I left those Camels on the table . I thought you might like to have one in the morning . MYRA Oh  --  thanks . ROY CRONIN It certainly has been a lot of fun . MYRA It certainly has . ( He stares at her a few moments . ) ROY CRONIN Would you feel offended if I asked for a little kiss ? MYRA No ,  --  I  --  go ahead . ( Her head is lowered . He bends down and kisses her cheek . ) ROY CRONIN Gosh ! That was kind of embarrassing , was n't it ? MYRA Yes  --  it was . p. 65 ROY CRONIN But it was all right , though . Well ,  --  see you to-morrow . MYRA Sure . ( He goes out . Still smiling , MYRA saunters back to the dresser , picks up the bill Mrs. HOBLEY had left there , looks at it and tosses it down . She regards herself for a moment in the mirror . Then she puts on her hat and coat , opens her trunk and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she throws about her shoulders . She applies powder to her nose and rouge to her checks and lips . She notices the package of Camels and is about to put them into her handbag , but she changes her mind and replaces them on the table . She goes to the door , switching out the lights as she does so . She opens the door and goes out. ) @x MYRA 'S room is just as it was at the end of Act I. The lamp is burning low , the shades are down , but the noonday sun is streaming in through the cracks between the shade and the window frame . MRS . HOBLEY comes in , and sniffs distastefully ; the stuffiness of the unaired room oppresses her . She turns out the light , lifts the shade , puts up the window , does a little straightening up and smoothing the bed , and perhaps gives a few flicks here and there with the dust rag . She approaches the gramophone as though she were going to play it , and then decides not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but before MRS . HOBLEY has had a chance to say " Come in , " the MILITARY POLICEMAN enters . MRS . HOBLEY is startled at sight of him . MILITARY POLICEMAN Morning , Mrs.'Obley . I was told I 'd find you on this floor . MRS . HOBLEY What  --  what are you doing ' ere ? MILITARY POLICEMAN My duty , as always . MRS . HOBLEY ( brusquely ) Well , you can be off with it , then . The military police ' as no duties in my ' ouse  --  I can promise you that . p. 67 MILITARY POLICEMAN ( unperturbed ) Orders from ' eadquarters is that we 're to go through all the lodging ' ouses in this area and inspect passes of all soldiers found therein . MRS . HOBLEY Soldiers ! You know perfectly well there 's no soldiers lodging in this ' ouse . MILITARY POLICEMAN Quite so . But you ' ave other lodgers ' ere , and soldiers are apt to come in , to call . You know what a sociable lot soldiers are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may look to your ' eart 's content , but you 'll find no troops ' ere . MILITARY POLICEMAN Who 's occupying this room now ? MRS . HOBLEY ( exasperated ) By whose authority are you annoying me ? MILITARY POLICEMAN By authority of the King , ma'am . ' E takes a great interest in the doings of all ' is subjects , even the ' umblest . Come along , now . It wo n't ' urt you to tell me what I ' ave to know . MRS . HOBLEY It 's that little one  --  calls ' erself Myra Deauville . ( The MILITARY POLICEMAN has taken a notebook and pencil from his pocket. ) p. 68 MILITARY POLICEMAN ( writing ) Myra . ' Ow do you spell that last ? MRS . HOBLEY D-E-A-U-V-I-L . MILITARY POLICEMAN Age ? MRS . HOBLEY I do n't know  --  twenty-five to thirty . MILITARY POLICEMAN That 's close enough . Profession ? MRS . HOBLEY Yes . MILITARY POLICEMAN I see . Myra Deauville . I do n't think I know ' er . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is she ! ( He makes a note of that . ) Strange I do n't know ' er . ' Ow long ' as she been ' ere ? MRS . HOBLEY She 's just come back , last night . Been away for months , on a farm . MILITARY POLICEMAN I 'll look ' er up later . I like to keep tabs on all of ' em . MRS . HOBLEY Huh ! You must ' ave your ' ands full in these times . MILITARY POLICEMAN Well , it is a task . It 's got so now you ca n't discriminate between the tarts and the decent girls , and vice versa. p. 69 MRS . HOBLEY ( emphatically ) You can thank the war for that ! Decency went out in 1914 . But it 'll come back ; you mark my words ! MILITARY POLICEMAN Of course it 'll come back ! In triumph ! Even if you and me may not be ' ere to welcome it . ' Ave there been any soldiers in ' ere since last night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLICEMAN Ah ! Did you ' appen to notice what ' is regiment was ? MRS . HOBLEY Canadian . MILITARY POLICEMAN Oh , Lord  --  one of those . They 're the ' ardest for us to deal with . They ' ave no respect for authority . I often think , if those Canadians only ' ated the Bosches as much as they ' ate us M. P. 's , they 'd be in Berlin by now . ( He goes toward the window . ) Do you know if Kitty 's in her room ? MRS . HOBLEY I know nothing about that vulgar person . She 's no lodger of mine , thank ' eaven . MILITARY POLICEMAN Well , if you do n't mind I 'll go across the roof and see if she 's got any of the army in ' er possession . Good day , Mrs.'Obley .

HOBLEY ( cordially ) Come right in . ROY CRONIN ( coming in ) Thanks . MRS . HOBLEY I 've just been doing a bit of dusting . I do like to ' ave things neat . ROY CRONIN Where 's Miss  --  Miss Deauville . ( The flossy name embarrasses him . ) MRS . HOBLEY She 's out somewhere  --  shopping , I expect . ( There is a note of scorn in this . ) ROY CRONIN She told me to be here at noon  --  so I guess she 'll be back before long . ( He puts the flowers on the table. ) p. 71 MRS . HOBLEY I do n't doubt she will . ROY CRONIN ( at the window ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? MRS . HOBLEY You get sunlight and fresh air , when you want them . That 's the main thing . They can ' ave their views . ROY CRONIN Well  --  I know if I lived over here , I 'd want to have a room that looked out over Westminster Abbey , or one of those places . MRS . HOBLEY If I was you , I would n't stand too close to that window . ROY CRONIN ( laughing ) What 's the matter ? Is the air-raid still on ? MRS . HOBLEY It 's the Military Police . ROY CRONIN The M. P. 's ? Well , what 's biting them ? MRS . HOBLEY They 're looking for stray soldiers . There was one of em in ' ere just now . ' E went across that roof . ROY CRONIN Well , he ca n't do anything to me . I 've got my pass , and it 's all regular , too . MRS . HOBLEY Let us ' ope so . Now , if you 'll excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sure . I guess it 's all right for me to wait here ? p. 72 MRS . HOBLEY Yes , you can wait . ( She starts to go . ) When she comes in , tell ' er I 'll want to see ' er ROY CRONIN Sure . I 'll tell her that . MRS . HOBLEY ' K you . ( MRS . HOBLEY goes out . ROY starts to whistle " They 'll never believe me . " He takes off his tunic , extracts his polishing kit from his haversack , and sits down . ( He then sets to work shining the brass buttons on his tunic , using a can of Brasso , button-stick , brush and flannel cloth in the process . It is a painstaking operation . As he works , his whistling changes to humming , and when he comes to the words , " And I 'm certainly going to tell them , " he sings them with great positiveness . He hears the sound of footsteps on the roof outside and looks up . KITTY appears at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) KITTY Oh ! ROY CRONIN Where 'd you come from ? KITTY I did n't mean to intrude . Is Myra ' ome ? ROY CRONIN No  --  but she 'll probably be here any minute . KITTY ( about to depart ) Well  --  I sha n't disturb you . p. 73 ROY CRONIN You 're not disturbing me . I just came in myself . KITTY Oh  --  you just came in ? ROY CRONIN Yes . Was Myra expecting you ? KITTY Yes  --  I told her I 'd pop in this morning . I live in the next ' ouse . But I 'll be toddling back . ( She disappears . ) ROY CRONIN ( at the window ) That roof does n't look like a very good place to do much toddling . KITTY ( invisible ) Oh  --  we go back and forth on it all the time . ROY CRONIN If you want to wait for Myra , why do n't you come in ? KITTY ( reappearing at the window ) Do you mind ? ROY CRONIN Not at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROY CRONIN Oh , sure  --  ( KITTY steps in over the low window-sill . ) KITTY It 's all right to look now . ROY CRONIN Sit right down . p. 74 KITTY You 're very kind . ROY CRONIN I just thought I 'd polish up the old brass while I was waiting . It 's quite a job keeping it clean in this town . KITTY I expect you ' ave to give it quite a lot of attention . ROY CRONIN Yes  --  they say shiny buttons will win the war . KITTY Do they ? ROY CRONIN Sure  --  they 've been trying that theory for three years now , and so far as I can see , the war is n't won yet . Maybe it 's time for ' em to try something else . ( He laughs . ) KITTY You are a joker ! ROY CRONIN They make us work for hours polishing these buttons , and then the minute we get in the line we have to smear ' em with lampblack so they wo n't make targets for Heinie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right enough . ROY CRONIN You said it . " Odd " is just the word . KITTY You 're a Canadian , are n't you ? ROY CRONIN Well , I 'm with that army . I belong to the R. C. R. 's . They call us the Brasso Battalion  --  that 's because we use so much of this stuff . p. 75 KITTY We do admire the Canadians . They 've done such ' eroic work . ROY CRONIN They 're good troops , all right . KITTY We 're proud of you , ' ere in the old country . Sons of the Empire  --  that 's what we call the Canadians , and Australians , too . ROY CRONIN The Australians are over-rated . They make a lot of noise and show off  --  but when it comes to proving anything in the line , well , they 're a lot of false alarms , if you ask me . KITTY I agree perfectly . ROY CRONIN Understand that I 'm not a Canadian myself . KITTY No ? ROY CRONIN I 'm an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRONIN Twenty-five per cent of the Canadian army are Americans . We 're not Sons of the Empire at all . We 're kind of red-headed step-children . KITTY All the more credit to you , I 'm sure . I suppose you saw the raid , last night ? ( KITTY is not particularly interested in this guest of MYRA 'S , but is trying hard to be sociable . Later she begins to see the possibilities and to exploit them. ) p. 76 ROY CRONIN Well  --  I heard some of it . KITTY They 're awful things , air raids . They really are dreadful . You 've no idea what ' avoc they 've raised . ( She looks out the window . ) We 'll ' ave another to-night . ROY CRONIN How do you know ? KITTY Look at the weather . Not a cloud in the sky and the moon still at the full . It 's rotten luck . ROY CRONIN I should think it would make everbody kind of jumpy , knowing it 's coming . KITTY We 're accustomed to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ere . Between the ' Un airplanes , that keep us from sleeping , and the ' Un submarines , that keep us from eating , we 're for it every which way . ROY CRONIN I do n't see why they have to drag in the civilians into the war . KITTY Oh , well  --  what 's fair for the troops is fair for us . ( She notices the flowers . ) Where did these lovely flowers come from ? ROY CRONIN Oh  --  I brought those . I happened to be passing through Covent Garden market on the way over and I thought I might as well KITTY They are sweet ! Shall I put them in water ? p. 77 ROY CRONIN Why  --  sure , would you ? ( KITTY puts them in the water pitcher on the wash-stand at the left . ) KITTY I expect you 're an old friend of Myra 's . ROY CRONIN Well  --  yes . We 're friends . KITTY You knew ' er in the States , per'aps ? ROY CRONIN No  --  I never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance . ROY CRONIN Yes  --  that 's it . You a friend of Myra 's , too ? KITTY Oh , my , yes . We 're the best . She and I used to work together . ROY CRONIN Were you in " The Pink Lady " too ? KITTY Oh , no  --  but we 've been intimate for ever so long . It 's strange she never mentioned you . She ' as so few friends . ROY CRONIN Well , to tell you the truth , we only just met . KITTY This morning ? ROY CRONIN No , last night . KITTY Oh ? ROY CRONIN We sort of stumbled over each other during the air raid . p. 78 KITTY That 's odd  --  ' cause I saw her after the raid ROY CRONIN Oh , you did ? Then you must have been in here after I left . I hope she got a good rest . She certainly was tired . KITTY Oh , yes  --  you 're quite right . She was tired , the poor ducky . ROY CRONIN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this  --  air raids and bum food , and KITTY I know  --  she 's such a little thing . ROY CRONIN What kind of a life does she lead , anyway ? KITTY Oh  --  a miserable life . ROY CRONIN How do you mean ? KITTY Why  --  miserable  --  un'appy . ROY CRONIN I guessed that . You know , it 's hard for me to find out much from her about herself . She does n't seem to want to talk about her own affairs . All she does is ask me questions about the war  --  as though I had anything to tell about that that everybody has n't heard a million times . How does she get along ? KITTY It 's a constant struggle . ROY CRONIN You say she has n't got many friends here ? p. 79 KITTY Oh , no . That 's the ' ardest part of it . She 's so lonely . ROY CRONIN I 'll bet she is . You can tell that just to look at her . KITTY She ' as n't a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can count on for ' elp  --  and she does need it . ROY CRONIN You can tell that , too . KITTY Of course , I 'm devoted to ' er . But I 'm poverty - stricken , myself . My dear ' usband is no more . ROY CRONIN Oh  --  I 'm sorry . KITTY ( deliberately tearful ) ' E was a soldier  --  young and ' andsome and full of ' ope , like yourself . ' E got ' is in the crater at Loos . ROY CRONIN Poor feller . That was a nasty scrap . KITTY I ' elp Myra all I can  --  but what can I do ? ROY CRONIN How about Mrs.Hobley ? She seems friendly . KITTY She seems friendly , yes . But Mrs.'Obley is a proper whited sepluchre , I can promise you . She 's ' ard ' earted , she is . Not that one can blame ' er . She ' as to live , like the rest of us . ' Er ' usband 's a prisoner in Germany , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . You know  --  our Tommies are n't paid as ' andsomely as you Canadians . p. 80 ROY CRONIN I know  --  us Canadians are rich . We draw down all of a dollar a day  --  that 's four shillings . KITTY That 's four times what the Tommy is paid . ROY CRONIN Did Myra get any salary while she was on that farm ? KITTY Not a penny . She sacrificed ' erself ' eroically , she did . ROY CRONIN But what 's she going to do now ? How will she support herself ? KITTY I 've wondered about that very thing . Jobs are scarce in London in these ' ard times . ROY CRONIN She does n't seem to be very crazy about going back on the stage . KITTY And quite right , too . The theatre 's no place for a girl like ' er . ROY CRONIN I guess it is n't a very pleasant atmosphere . KITTY A girl in Myra 's position ' as no chance , unless ROY CRONIN Unless what ? KITTY Well  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it my dream  --  that some day , some nice young man would come along and  --  and appreciate Myra . ROY CRONIN Oh ! ( ROY turns away  --  but KITTY shrewdly sees that she has made her point , and she hastens to drive it home. ) p. 81 KITTY And marry'er , and give'er a ' ome , and protect ' er . ROY CRONIN I suppose there has n't been much chance of that in the  --  the environment that she lives in . KITTY You 've got it ! And that 's just the danger she 's facing at this minute . ROY CRONIN How do you mean , danger ? KITTY Bad influences . You do n't know what London is in war time . The immorality ' ere is ghastly . ROY CRONIN I guess Myra can take care of herself on that . KITTY ' Ow can she , if she 's neglected and ' elpless and stony broke and face to face with starvation ? ROY CRONIN Is she broke ? KITTY ' Er condition is desperate  --  desperate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been ' oping for do n't pop up soon , ' e 'll be too late ! That 's what ' e 'll be . ROY CRONIN I never thought it was so bad . KITTY Of course you did n't . You 'd know nothing if you depended on ' er for information . She 's too proud to breathe a word of complaint . That 's so often the way with those who ' ave enjoyed better circumstances . p. 82 ROY CRONIN Did she used to be well off ? KITTY Oh ! Did n't you know of her family ? ROY CRONIN No  --  she never mentioned that she had any . KITTY That 's like ' er . Why  --  she comes of one of the most aristocratic families in the States  --  one of the old families  --  although of course she goes incog . ROY CRONIN Then that 's why she would n't tell me her real name . KITTY Why  --  why , yes ROY CRONIN And do you mean to tell me her family have deserted her ? KITTY I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --  there 's ' er pride again ! She 'd die before she 'd ask them for ' elp . ROY CRONIN The poor kid . ( He is genuinely moved . KITTY is intensely gratified to observe the extent of the progress she has made . ) KITTY Not that I ' ave any right to interfere . I know ' ow it is with those who interest themselves in other people 's troubles . They may ' ave the best of intentions , but do they ever get any thanks for it ? They do not . On the contrary , it 's always , " Mind your own business . " But for all of that , I just ca n't ' elp feeling sick with sympathy for that poor child  --  and she is no more than a child , knowing nothing of the world , nothing of the uglier side of life , plunging ' ead on to the depths of degradation . p. 83 ROY CRONIN Well , believe me , I 'm thankful to you for telling me all this . KITTY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big ' eart and a sense of decency . But ' ow many are there like you ? ' Ow many are there would ' ave any interest in a girl other than her body ? Next to none . You 're in the army  --  you must know that . ROY CRONIN I guess I do know it , all right . It is n't very nice to think about  --  but you 've got to face facts . KITTY Unpleasant as they may be . ROY CRONIN Look here  --  I 've got an idea KITTY ( eagerly ) Yes ? ROY CRONIN You seem to be real kind , and sympathetic . KITTY I 'm no more than a fellow ' uman being . ROY CRONIN I 'd like to do something to fix it up for Myra . I 'm pretty darn fond of her , and I KITTY As who could ' elp but being . ROY CRONIN I do n't see any reason why you and I could n't cook up a scheme that would KITTY Hush ! ( MYRA comes in . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on before going out the night before . ) ' Ullo , dear . p. 84 MYRA Oh  --  I did n't know anybody was here . ( She hastily takes off her hat and the white fox jur . ) KITTY I just stopped in , ducky , and found Mr.  --  ah  --  your friend . We 've ' ad a jolly chat , ' ave n't we ? ( While MYRA is turned away , KITTY rapidly signals to ROY to leave . ) ROY CRONIN Yes  --  I 've been hearing all about the war KITTY I 've been doing my best to persuade the corporal to stay ' till you get back , but he seems to be MYRA ( worried ) Why  --  were you going some place , Roy ? ( KITTY signals to ROY to say " yes " ) ROY CRONIN Yes  --  I 've got to go out to KITTY But he 's promised to be back in a tick . ROY CRONIN I thought I 'd go down to the post office . I 've got a money-order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders ! ROY CRONIN ( at the door ) Oh  --  Mrs.Hobley told me to tell you she was anxious to see you . p. 85 MYRA Oh  --  thanks . ROY CRONIN Will I tell her you 're here ? MYRA No  --  I 'll go right down and see her : ( ROY glances toward KITTY , as though appealing to her to pave the way for him . KITTY nods to him , significantly . He goes out . ) MYRA ( accusingly ) What 've you been saying to him ? KITTY Now , my dear , do n't you worry about what I MYRA Have you been telling him anything ? KITTY I 've been telling ' im nothing that was n't good for ' im to ' ear . Of course , I ' ad to ask a few tactful questions  --  but I soon found out what to say . MYRA And what was that ? KITTY I ' ymned your bloody praises ! I slipped once , but ' e did n't notice it . MYRA How 'd you slip ? KITTY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the raid . You know  --  that time in front of Simpson 's MYRA What did he say ? KITTY ' E corrected me , bless ' is ' eart . What 'd you do with that Army Service Corps bloke you ' ad in tow ? p. 86 MYRA I took him to the Silver Cross Hotel . KITTY What was he good for ? MYRA Eight bob . After I got rid of him , I just fell asleep at the Silver Cross . I ai n't been home since . I was hoping he 'd come here and go away . ( The " he " refers to ROY . ) KITTY Not ' im . ' E waited to ' ear all the information I ' ad to give ' im about you . MYRA ( with a suggestion of belligerence ) And what was that ? KITTY That you 're a poor , maltreated little virgin , ' alf starved , and ' ungry for love . MYRA Thanks  --  but you did n't need to lie to him . KITTY Oh  --  is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor ? MYRA No  --  I meant the other part of it . KITTY Well , that did n't ' urt . Oh , you are a lucky one . Your troubles will trouble you no more . MYRA What the hell are you getting at ? KITTY Do n't be American , ducky . It 's so crude . Now ' arken to me . That ' andsome , wealthy lance-corporal is yours for the asking . p. 87 MYRA How do you know ? KITTY I know because I worked ' im up to the proper state with my own ' ands . ' E 's ' ooked , ' e is . MYRA You 're a good friend , Kitty but you 've been wasting your time . KITTY Oh , ' ave I ! You wait ' til you 've ' ad a little talk with ' im and see what I 've done for you . MYRA What 've you done ? What 've you said ? KITTY First I found out ' ow much ' e knew , which was nothing . From there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told ' im you was a daughter of the aristocracy , travelling incog . MYRA Did he laugh ? KITTY No , ' e did n't laugh . Not ' im . ' I only sat there , polishing ' is buttons , and swallowing everything . ' E took it so ' ard I give you my word I thought ' e 'd bust into tears . So I told him ' ow the war ' ad ruined you  --  only in a financial way , of course  --  and of ' ow brave and ' eroic you 've been in the face of adversity , and of ' ow you could n't ' old out much longer . MYRA Against what ? KITTY Against a life of shame . I said  --  " The only thing on God 's earth that 'll save ' er , " I said , " is a ' usband. " p. 88 MYRA A husband ? KITTY Yes  --  I appealed to everything that was manly in ' im , and ' e was n't slow to respond . Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e catches on if you put it right . ' E knew what I meant  --  an ' ' e 's ready to step up and do ' is duty for King and country . I give you my word , and strike me dead if I exaggerate , that lad 'll marry you to-day  --  and what 's more , I 'm prepared to be your bridesmaid and ' elp you blush . MYRA Did he tell you he was going to marry me ? KITTY Not quite . ' E was coming to that , though , when you burst in and interrupted ' im . But I ' ad ' im at the point , and it wo n't take you more'n ten minutes to lead ' im past it and finish the job . ' E 's yours , I tell you . MYRA What if I do n't want him ? KITTY And what if you do n't ? Of what odds is that ? All you ' ave to do is go through with the ceremony and then sleep with ' im a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you sit back and collect ' is assignments and separation allowance and live in luxury . And there 's your insurance if ' e gets knocked off in action MYRA ( savagely ) Oh , God  --  I do n't want his insurance ! And I do n't want to steal any of his pay away from him , either ! p. 89 KITTY Who says it 's stealing ? Marriage is legal , ai n't it ? Why , it 's ' oly ! Look at what others do . Look at Agnes ' Enning . She ' as four ' usbands in the army  --  two Australians , one Yorkshireman and ' er own ' usband what she married before the war . She 's collecting separation allowances from all of them . And what 's more , she 's making ' em all ' appy . Every one of them finds the war easier to bear because ' e 's got a little wife waitin ' for ' im ' ere in Blighty . Of course , with Agnes there is the risk that two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . But that would n't bother you , with only one on your ' ands . The only responsibility you 'll ' ave is giving ' im what he wants when ' e 's in London , and you ought n't to ' ave much trouble doing that . ' Eaven knows , you 've ' ad enough experience . MYRA Yes  --  and what 's going to happen to him , and to me , after the war ? KITTY ( with disgust ) Oh , you are an optimist . After the war ! And when will that be ? To-morrow ? No ! Next year ? No ! A ' undred years from now ? I doubt it . And where will you be , or me , or this Canadian , after the war ? The lot of us will be singing bloody ' armony in a place where there ai n't no street walkers or soldiers neither . After the war ! You might as well say you wo n't put your money in a bank because there wo n't be any banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( There is a distinct pause . ) Well  --  ai n't you got a word to say to me ? p. 90 MYRA No I could n't get mad at you , Kitty . KITTY I should ' ope not , after all I 've done to put you in the way of a good thing . MYRA It is n't a good thing , Kitty . It 's a stinking thing . KITTY What 's stinking about it , I 'd like to know ? ' E loves you , do n't ' e ? Of course ' e does . Look at the flowers he brought . MYRA Flowers ? KITTY ( indicating them ) Yes , flowers ! Bought them in Covent Garden , ' e did . Now tell me ' e do n't love you . MYRA ( looking at the flowers ) He do n't even know me . And he never will know me , or about me , if I have to go down and jump off Waterloo Bridge , into the river , to keep him from finding out . KITTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things , ai n't it ? You little fool ! You think everything will be settled if ' e goes back into the war and you into the Thames . Never in all my life did I ever ' ear of such stupidity . MYRA Maybe you never saw a man before , decent , like he is . KITTY Maybe I did n't ! And I do n't expect to see one soon again  --  nor will you . Which is just precisely what I 've been talking about . You wo n't ' ave another chance to match this one . p. 91 MYRA I ai n't asking for another like him . KITTY Then what are you asking for ? The Prince of Wales , or the whole brigade of Guards , or what ? MYRA I 'm only asking to get rid of him  --  to get him out of London  --  to never see him again KITTY ( dumfounded ) You 've bloody well gone queer in the ' ead , that 's what you 've done . You ought to be sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYRA Come in . ( ROY comes in . He is obviously crestfallen . ) ROY CRONIN Say  --  I got some bad news . KITTY No ! MYRA What is it , ROY ? ROY CRONIN When I was coming out of the Post Office an M. P. nabbed me . KITTY What ? Are you A. W. L. ? ROY CRONIN No  --  I 'm all right on that  --  but he asked to see my pass and then he told me that all leave is cancelled . MYRA What does that mean ? ROY CRONIN I 've got to get back on duty . p. 92 MYRA But  --  can they do that ? ROY CRONIN You bet they can . MYRA When they 've promised you fourteen days ? ROY CRONIN Aw  --  they do n't promise a thing . They just tell you . KITTY But what 's the reason for it ? ROY CRONIN I guess there 's plenty of reason . There 's been a terrible " do " up in the salient . KITTY But we won it , did n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROY CRONIN Yes , and we lost about half the Canadian corps doing it . Anyway , I 've got to report to the M. O. at Bramshott for physical examination to see if I 'm fit to go back up the line . In a couple of days I 'll be heaving on the channel . MYRA When do you have to go , Roy ? ROY CRONIN I 've got to be there at 8 A. M. to-morrow morning . That means I 'll have to take the last train out to-night . KITTY It 's a rotten shame . Ca n't they give a man breathing space after ' e gets out of hospital before they send ' im back to expose ' isself again ? ROY CRONIN Oh , they 've got to hold the line somehow . But it 's a tough break , all right . I was just beginning to look forward to this leave . p. 93 KITTY Well  --  I should n't be surprised if you did n't want me ' anging around , when your time 's so short I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to leave London ? MYRA No  --  I wo n't be leaving London . KITTY Do n't ! ( She extends her hand to ROY . ) Good-by , Canada . ROY CRONIN ( shaking her hand ) Good-by  --  and thanks , for a lot of things . KITTY Thank me for nothing , I 'm afraid . ' Owever  --  over the top with the best of luck and do n't let anything ' appen to stop our favorite war . ROY CRONIN I 'll see to that . ( KITTY goes out . ) She 's all right . MYRA I 'm awful sorry , Roy . ROY CRONIN Oh , it 's just part of the army . ( He is putting his cleaning kit back in his haversack . ) MYRA That Medical Officer is n't going to make you go back to the trenches . He 'll see that you 've got to have a lot of easy training before you 're fit again . ROY CRONIN He 'll just take one look at me and write me down A. 1 . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they 've just simply got to have men . The way they 've been dropping ' em lately between Cambrai and Passchendaele they 'll take anybody that can stagger up the communication trench . p. 94 MYRA I want to thank you for those flowers , Roy . ROY CRONIN Oh  --  those MYRA It was very sweet of you . If you leave me your address , I 'll send you those socks . What size shoe do you wear ? ROY CRONIN I 'll leave you my address all right . But I 'm going to leave you something else , too . MYRA ( alarmed ) I do n't want anything else . ROY CRONIN Listen , Myra  --  this is a sort of a delicate subject  --  but , how are you fixed for money ? MYRA I 'm absolutely all right . I do n't need a thing . ROY CRONIN I 've heard different . MYRA I know  --  Kitty 's probably been telling you that I 'm hard up . ROY CRONIN As a matter of fact , she has . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . She does n't know about  --  about my private income . ROY CRONIN You 've got a private income ? MYRA Certainly I have . I 've never said much about it , but p. 95 ROY CRONIN Where does it come from ? MYRA I get it from my folks , back home . ROY CRONIN They 're rich , are they ? MYRA ( with assurance ) Oh , sure  --  they never have to worry about money . ROY CRONIN How much do they send you ? A couple of postage stamps now and then so 's you can write home ? MYRA Do n't you insult my family ! I guess they can take care of their daughter , wherever she is . ROY CRONIN I did n't mean to be nasty . But if it 's real money they send you , why do you have to live in a place like this  --  why do you wear clothes that anybody can see are old  --  why did you tell me last night you 'd never had enough to buy a ticket home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a job ? MYRA Well  --  what they send me is n't a million dollars a year . ROY CRONIN I guess I know how much it is , Myra . It is n't a damned cent . You 've been lying to me just to make me MYRA ( vehemently ) What business is it of yours , I 'd like to know . Who gave you a right to question me about my personal affairs ? p. 96 ROY CRONIN I gave myself the right . MYRA And how 'd you manage to do that ? ROY CRONIN By loving you , that 's how . MYRA ( in a twisted voice ) Oh  --  Roy  --  you ca n't do that . ROY CRONIN Oh , I ca n't , ca n't I ? Well , just watch me MYRA ( fiercely ) No , Roy  --  I tell you , you ca n't  --  it is n't possible ! ROY CRONIN What 's the matter , Myra ? Why do you say that ? Why ca n't I love you ? MYRA Because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . I know what 's right and what is n't . How could there be anything wrong about love ? MYRA There can be everything wrong about it . ROY CRONIN Not the kind of love I have for you . That 's  --  that 's good love . MYRA I know it , Roy . ROY CRONIN Then if you know it , why are you standing there telling me it 's wrong ? MYRA Because it just does n't fit  --  you loving me p. 97 ROY CRONIN Oh , Lord . I see what you 're driving at . You 're still thinking about me being a Y. M. C. A. boy . You think I ought n't to fall in love with anybody but a choir singer . Ca n't you get that fool idea out of your head ? I do n't care if you were in a thousand shows , or the circus . I love you . MYRA No , you do n't , Roy . ROY CRONIN Who says I do n't ? MYRA I say it  --  and I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you see what 's led up to it ? You 're not in any state to know what you 're talking about . ROY CRONIN You mean you think I 'm crazy ? MYRA No  --  you 're lonesome , Roy . That 's the trouble with you . You 've been away from home for three years  --  in a strange army  --  in hospitals  --  in a war . You go on leave and get a few days to yourself , and then you meet a girl that sounds like home . And all of a sudden you find out that you 've been aching for a woman , any woman . I do n't mean by that anything  --  anything out of the way . It 's just companionship . Your heart is sick because it 's been empty so long . And when you find somebody you can talk to , your heart fills all up , and you mistake it for love . ROY CRONIN It 's filled up , all right . It 's filled up with you . p. 98 MYRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness . That 's what makes you see things all wrong . ROY CRONIN ( vehemently ) Oh , does it ! Well , did you ever hear of any man falling in love with any girl for any other reason ? MYRA Loneliness does n't last , Roy  --  neither does that kind of love . ROY CRONIN I guess I can take my chances on that . MYRA Wait ' til you get back to your own people , and you 're happy and peaceful  --  and then see how much you think about me . ROY CRONIN I 'm not going to wait that long . I would n't want to see them . I 'd rather get a napoo in France and have it over with . MYRA You 'd be better off  --  that way  --  than married to me . ROY CRONIN ( hesitantly ) Are you maybe thinking a little about your own family ? MYRA What do you mean ? ROY CRONIN I mean  --  are you thinking that you would n't want to get married to a kind of a hick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks ? p. 99 MYRA Yes , Roy  --  that 's one of the things . I 'd be ashamed to introduce you to my parents if they were still living , which they are n't , thank God ! And do you want to know why I 'd be ashamed ? Because my father and mother were a couple of drunken bums . They lived in East St. Louis , that exclusive suburb . That 's where I come from . I ran away and went on the stage because I was scared to stay in my own home . I was scared one or the other of them might kill me while they were liquored . That 's how much aristocracy I am . ROY CRONIN ( after a brief pause ) And you talk about me being lonely . Me  --  with everything I 've got MYRA That 's it , Roy . You 've got enough in your own life ROY CRONIN And what have you got ? What have you to MYRA I can take care of myself ! ( She walks away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend her stubbornness . ) ROY CRONIN Is there anybody at all  --  I mean any man  --  that you 're in love with ? MYRA No , there is n't . ROY CRONIN Or even some one that you used to love  --  that you were promised to  --  like some soldier that was killed in the war ? p. 100 MYRA I never loved any one . ROY CRONIN Then I 'm not going to stand here and argue any more . ( He goes to her , takes hold of her arms , and looks into her face . ) Let me look at you . ( She looks down . ) Do n't hold your head like that . Look at me . ( She raises her eyes . After a moment she goes into his arms , clutching him . ) MYRA ( half strangled ) Roy ! ROY CRONIN ( incoherently ) Do n't say anything more , sweetheart . I know how it is . You just do n't want to let me get into this , because you think I might regret it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to regret this  --  ever  --  ever . I guess I know who I was made for , who I 've been waiting for all this time . I guess I know who it is I love and worship . ( He releases her and steps back . She has been rigid in his arms and remains so . ) Now  --  there 's a lot we 've got to do  --  and we 've got to do it fast . MYRA ( dully ) What ? ROY CRONIN Well  --  I guess we 've got to see about getting a license . Do you know anything about the laws over here ? ( MYRA shakes her head . ) Well  --  we 'll soon find out . Do you know any ministers ? p. 101 MYRA No , I do n't know any ministers . ROY CRONIN What 's your religious faith ? MYRA I 'm a Roman Catholic . ROY CRONIN Well  --  that will be all right . We 'll find a priest . And then there 'll be a lot of red tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 'll be easy . I know a man in the pay office  --  Captain Faulkner , he used to be with my battalion but he got crippled on the Somme . He 's a friend of mine . But we 'll have to make it pretty fast , so we can get everything done before I leave tonight . You 'd better get your hat on right away . MYRA Do I have to go with you ? ROY CRONIN Sure you have to go . You 're a party to this . MYRA I mean  --  could n't you go first and make the arrangements , and then I could meet you some place ? ROY CRONIN No  --  because the first thing is to get a license , and you 'll certainly have to sign that . MYRA Yes  --  certainly . ROY CRONIN So , come on  --  Myra . Snap it up and we 'll get started . MYRA Roy ! ROY CRONIN What is it , Myra ? p. 102 MYRA I want to change my dress . Would you mind ? ROY CRONIN Waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . ) But please  --  please make it fast . MYRA Yes , Roy . ( He goes out . She instantly jams on her hat and seizes her suitcase . She tiptoes to the window and looks out over the roof toward KITTY 'S . Then she comes back to the table in the centre , opens a drawer , fishes around in it until she finds a writing tablet and a pencil , and then scrawls a brief note . She tears the page from the tablet , folds it , and stands it up on the table like a tent . She goes over to the wash-stand and takes two or three of the flowers from the pitcher . Then she goes back to the window , picks up her suitcase , gives one look toward the door , and goes out the window and disappears . ) ( For a few moments there is absolute silence . Then the sound of MRS . HOBLEY 'S strident voice is heard from the hall outside , mingling with ROY 'S . She seems to be saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' er , " " Down over the roof , " " Let me in there " ; he is saying , " You 're mistaken . " " She 's in there now , " " Tell him he 's crazy . " There is a peremptory banging on the door . ROY calls " MYRA  --  tell her you 're there . " MRS . HOBLEY says , " I 'll see for myself . " MRS . HOBLEY thrusts open the door and strides in , followed hesitantly by ROY. ) p. 103 ROY CRONIN ( in the door ) Is it all right to come in ? ( MRS . HOBLEY looks around the room , then goes to the window and looks out . She then turns to ROY . ) MRS . HOBLEY Well  --  where is she ? ROY CRONIN She must be here . Myra ! ( He goes to the window . ) MRS . HOBLEY Why waste your breath ? Ca n't you see for yourself ? ROY CRONIN ( going to the right ) Myra ! Is there any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , bar that one . ROY CRONIN She could n't have gone out of that . I was right there . ( He goes to the curtained wardrobe at the left . ) Myra ! MRS . HOBLEY She 's gone out there , I tell you . Over the roof and through the next ' ouse to the street . My nephew saw her with his own eyes . ROY CRONIN ( returning to the window ) We 'd better go next door and see if MRS . HOBLEY It 's no use doing that . She 's in the tube by now , ' eaded ' eaven knows where . She 's ' opped it , that 's what she 's done . p. 104 ROY CRONIN There must have been some special reason for her doing that . She could n't have MRS . HOBLEY Oh , was n't there just ! She ' ad to get out without ' aving to face me ! ROY CRONIN ( coming down ) Why ? MRS . HOBLEY You know well enough , you ' ypocrite . ROY CRONIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! It 's a conspiracy to fraud me ROY CRONIN Did she owe you money ? MRS . HOBLEY Did she owe me money ! You think I do n't know that she posted you deliberately out there to keep me off , while she made good ' er escape . And now you think you can just march out and meet ' er at the agreed spot . Well , I wo n't ' ave it . I 'll ' ave the police on both of you , I will . I wo n't be cheated and robbed by you and that little ' arlot . ROY CRONIN What did you call her ? MRS . HOBLEY I called ' er what she is  --  a filthy little ' arlot . ROY CRONIN ( trembling ) Are n't you kind of careless with what you say ? p. 105 MRS . HOBLEY No  --  I 'm choosing my words carefully  --  more carefully than I choose my lodgers . ( She is on the verge of tears . ) I 'd like to keep my ' ouse respectable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice . But ' ow am I going to live in these wicked times , and my poor ' usband suffering torture and slow death in a ' Un prison , and food more precious than jewels ROY CRONIN Never mind the grousing . You said something that MRS . HOBLEY You think I 'm conducting a fast ' ouse ' ere because I let rooms to the likes of ' er , because I make no complaint when she ' as men in ' er rooms , night after night , because I accept from ' er the money she takes from them . You think you can insult me and scorn me and cheat me of my just due . Well , you ca n't ! You or your tart , either . You may not know it , Canadian , but there 's law in this land ROY CRONIN How much does she owe you ? ( He is taking out his pay book , in which are folded some banknotes . ) MRS . HOBLEY You mean  --  you 'll pay me ? ROY CRONIN That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , sir . You 're a gentleman , you are  --  which is more'n I can say for most of the soldiers she 's ' ad in ' ere . p. 106 ROY CRONIN I asked you how much she owes you . MRS . HOBLEY Well  --  there 's two pound eighteen owing from April , and then there 's a week 's advance on the room now ROY CRONIN What 's the rent here ? MRS . HOBLEY On this room ? ROY CRONIN Yes . MRS . HOBLEY Thirty shillings a week . ROY CRONIN ( slowly ) Thirty and forty is seventy , and eighteen , did you say ? MRS . HOBLEY Eighteen  --  quite correct , sir . ROY CRONIN That 's eighty-eight shillings  --  four pounds eight . ( He takes a five-pound note and a one-pound note and hands them to her . ) There 's six pounds . That 'll pay what she owes you , and two weeks in advance on this room , with a little to spare . You can credit that . MRS . HOBLEY Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a ROY CRONIN Kindly give me a receipt for that . MRS . HOBLEY Gladly , sir . ( She goes to the table , and writes the receipt on the tablet . He starts to fasten the strap on his haversack. ) p. 107 ROY CRONIN Just make it out that you received it from her . MRS . HOBLEY Yes , sir . There you are , sir . ( She hands him the receipt . ) ROY CRONIN Thanks . ( He starts toward the door , then turns . ) Where would I be likely to find her ? MRS . HOBLEY Probably along the Strand , Leicester Square , Piccadilly  --  those are the regular places for prostitutes like ' er . And then of course there 's Waterloo Bridge . Many of ' em ' aunt that to catch the soldiers coming in on leave . ( Again he starts for the door . She notices the note on the table , picks it up and reads it . ) Just a moment , sir . ROY CRONIN What ? MRS . HOBLEY She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For me ? MRS . HOBLEY It do n't say who it 's for . It just says , " I ca n't do it . Good-by . " That 's all . ( ROY takes the note from her and looks at it . ) It 's none of my affair , sir , what you do or what you do n't do . But I know ' er , and I know ' er kind , to my cost . And if you take my advice , sir , when you meet ' er you 'll take that receipt and you 'll throw it in ' er painted face , and then ' ave no more to do with ' er . Because traffic with ' arlots leads only to sin , and sin leads to suffering . And a soldier like you , sir , ' as enough of suffering in this awful war without ' aving to be contaminated and robbed by loose women of the streets . p. 108 ROY CRONIN ( walking toward the door ) Oh , shut your God-damned face . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of the artillery , sirens and bugles again are heard , indicative of another air-raid. ) p. 109 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT IISCENE II The bay on Waterloo Bridge . It is late at night . MYRA is sitting on the bench , huddled into a corner . The special constable rides across , shouting as before , " Take cover ! Take cover ! " An elderly LABORER and his WIFE run in from the right . He , seeing MYRA , stops . LABORER ' Old ' ard  --  what 's this ? WIFE Come along , Charlie . ' Urry ! LABORER Wait a mo ' . ( He speaks to MYRA . ) What 's wrong , Miss ? MYRA Nothing 's wrong . I 'm all right . LABORER Then come on . You ca n't stay ' ere . WIFE You come on yourself ! MYRA Do n't mind me . I want to stay here . LABORER But Jerry 's up . It 's a air-raid . MYRA I know WIFE Leave ' er alone , charlie . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , Miss ? MYRA No  --  honestly . I 'm perfectly all right . p. 110 WIFE It 's ' er own concern , charlie . Come on ! I 'm frightened MYRA Go ahead , please . LABORER All right , Miss . I expect you know what WIFE For God 's sake , run . ( There is a loud explosion near at hand . A bomb has landed on the embankment . The LABORER and his wife run out at the left . ) ( ROY comes in from the right . He sees MYRA before she sees him , and is close to her before she looks up . When she sees him staring at her , she utters a little cry . ) ROY CRONIN ( in a strained voice ) I 've been looking for you . I 'd about given up hope of finding you . MYRA You ought n't to have tried to find me . ROY CRONIN I 've been walking backward and forward on this bridge , and up and down the Strand and Leicester Square and Piccadilly for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYRA Who  --  told you that ? ROY CRONIN Mrs.Hobley . MYRA Oh  --  you talked to her ? ROY CRONIN Yes . p. 111 MYRA I was afraid you would ROY CRONIN I got your note . MYRA Well  --  there was n't anything else for me to say . ROY CRONIN ( harshly ) Was n't there ? MYRA Nothing more that  --  that I wanted to say , to you . ROY CRONIN I guess not . But I wanted to find you . I had to give you something . ( He takes out his pay book and extracts from it the receipt MRS . HOBLEY had given him . ) Here 's a receipt from Mrs.Hobley . It covers two weeks ' advance rent on your room . ( He hands it to her . ) MYRA I did n't want you ROY CRONIN And here 's something else you 'd better take . I went to the pay corps office and made an arrangement for an assignment  --  they turn over so much a month out of my pay to you . You 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper they 'll give you . Ask for Capt . Faulkner when you get there . He knows all about it . He 'll take care of you , all right . It is n't much money , but still I 'd just like to know you were getting it . Be sure to ask for Capt . Faulkner . I guess that 's all . ( He looks at his wrist watch . ) I 've got to get an eleven fourteen train at Waterloo . ( She is holding the receipt and the card in her hand . Suddenly she bursts into convulsive , hysterical sobs . For a while , he stands watching her , dumbly. ) p. 112 ROY CRONIN Do n't cry , Myra  --  do n't cry like that MYRA ( wildly ) Go away  --  go away ! ROY CRONIN I ca n't stand to hear you cry like that ! MYRA Go away to your train . ROY CRONIN ( coming closer to her ) I ca n't stand it , I tell you  --  when I 've been fighting all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the things I 've wanted to say . I knew the only way to make it easy for you was just to show you what I think , and then go , without making any fuss and then you sit there , crying ! MYRA You 've got to stop thinking about me . ROY CRONIN Ask me to stop breathing ! It 'd be easier MYRA You 've got to do it  --  that 's all . ROY CRONIN I do n't have to do it . I do n't have to do anything that 's impossible , do I ? ( He sits down on the bench beside her and makes a fierce but awkward attempt to take her in his arms . She twists herself away from him . ) MYRA It 's late , Roy . You 've got to go to your train . p. 113 ROY CRONIN Listen , Myra  --  supposing I do n't go to that train ? MYRA ( standing up ) Oh  --  but you 've got to . It 's the last ROY CRONIN Who says I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report ROY CRONIN They ! Who 's they ! A lot of damned officers that want men . They want men so they can take another ridge  --  and lose it again . Well , I 've done enough of that . I 've got other things to do . They can all go to hell ! I 'm going to say here , with you MYRA You ca n't do that , Roy . They gave you orders ROY CRONIN All I have to do is miss that train  --  and that 's all I 'm going to do . To-morrow they 're going to be expecting me at the camp and I wo n't be there . MYRA They 'll send the M. P. 's to arrest you . ROY CRONIN What difference is it to me what they do ? I 'm finished with them . They do n't own me any more . They can have their number back , because I wo n't be using it from now on . I love you , sweetheart . Do you hear that ? Do you understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 114 MYRA You ca n't get out that way , Roy . ROY CRONIN Oh , ca n't I ! For three years I 've done everything they told me . I 've sloped arms when they told me and saluted when they told me ; I 've stood up straight when they told me and ducked when they told me . For three years I 've played their game . Now , by God , I 'm going to play my own . MYRA It 's no use talking big like that , Roy . It is n't your game . ROY CRONIN I 'm the best judge as to that . I guess I know when I 'm through with their war . It 's time they found out that human beings ca n't go on obeying them forever . I 've found you . That makes everything different . MYRA Not you , Roy . Why , you 're a model soldier , and nothing will ever make you different . You belong with them , doing what they tell you to . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself down . ROY CRONIN ( harshly ) Listen , Myra , there 's something I want you to tell me . Do you love me ? MYRA That has n't got anything to do with your going ROY CRONIN It 's got everything to do with it . Why did you come here , to this bridge , and wait here  --  when you knew I 'd have to go this way p. 115 MYRA I was a fool to do it . I knew I was a fool . But I had to , Roy . I thought I could hide here , and then you 'd go by and never notice me . I had to see you just once more . ROY CRONIN Then you do feel  --  something about me  --  that you did n't feel about those others MYRA I love you , Roy . I love you I love everything about you  --  everything you are . I did n't know I coud love anybody , until  --  until you said we ought to get married . But I know it now , Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll always be thankful for it . ROY CRONIN Then that 's the answer , is n't it ? We love each other  --  we belong to each other . MYRA No , Roy ! I do n't belong in the same lifetime with you . I 'm a whore ! ( He has relaxed his hold on her , but now he seizes her again in his arms and presses her face against him as though to silence her . ) ROY CRONIN ( passionately ) You 're not ! You 're good ! I know it . I 'll swear it before God ! MYRA All right , then , prove it to Him . Prove to Him that I did n't break your life in two . Let Him see that I sent you back to the line , to fight the war . Make Him know that p. 116 ROY CRONIN Yes  --  fight the war ! What 's the war , anyway ? It 's that guy up there in his aeroplane . What do I care about him and his bombs ? ( He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a vast crowd listening to him . ) What do I care who he is , or what he does , or what happens to him ? That war 's over for me . What I 've got to fight is the whole dirty world . That 's the enemy that 's against you and me . That 's what makes the rotten mess we 've got to live in . Look at them  --  shooting their guns up into the air , firing their little shells at something they ca n't even see . Why do n't they turn their guns down into the streets , and shoot at what 's there ? Why do n't they be merciful and kill the people that want to be killed ? Oh God  --  if they 'd ever stopped to figure things out the way I 've had to do , the whole lot of them would be committing suicide instead of shooting into the air . MYRA Roy  --  you must n't get excited like that . ROY CRONIN I know  --  it 's a waste of breath  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of ROY 's long speech the faint sounds of an airplane have been heard growing louder and louder . There is now a burst of machine-gun fire and the crash of a bomb , driving them into each other 's arms . The noise subsides as the plane goes elsewhere. ) p. 117 MYRA You want to do something for me , do n't you , Roy ? ROY CRONIN Yes . ( His voice is now dead . He has had his say . ) MYRA You want to make me happy , do n't you ? ROY CRONIN Yes . MYRA You want me to know that you know I 'm not  --  what I 'm ROY CRONIN Yes ! MYRA Then get to that train . ROY CRONIN And go back to the line and get knocked off and never see you again ? MYRA That is n't the point . ROY CRONIN I wish I knew what is the point . MYRA You will . What 's your address in France , Roy ? ROY CRONIN It 's on that card I gave you  --  MYRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are you going to do ? MYRA I 'll be all right . ROY CRONIN It 's easy to say that . MYRA It 's easier to mean it , now . p. 118 ROY CRONIN If I get that train , will you go back to your room ? MYRA Yes . ROY CRONIN And sign that paper at the pay office tomorrow ? MYRA ( with reluctance ) Yes , Roy . Now please go . ROY CRONIN Oh  --  I forgot to tell you  --  there 'll be some insurance , quite a lot of it , if I get MYRA Do n't say that , Roy ! You 're going to come through fine . You 're going to live , and get back to your folks and forget about everything bad that 's happened ROY CRONIN Forget ! God Almighty ! What 's going to make me forget ? What 's going to make me get out of my mind what 's been burned in there ? ( The MILITARY POLICEMAN comes in from the right , briskly . He is wearing a tin hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you doing ' ere , soldier ? ROY CRONIN Leave me alone . MILITARY POLICEMAN Let 's ' ave a look at your pass . MYRA It 's all right , policeman . He 's going to that 11:14 train . p. 119 MILITARY POLICEMAN Then I 'll just go along with you and ' elp you find the station . ROY CRONIN I know where it is . ( He stares at MYRA . ) Good-by . ( The MILITARY POLICEMAN stands at the left , waiting . ) MYRA Good-by , Roy . You might write me a letter , once in a while ? ROY CRONIN I will . MYRA And I hope the socks will fit . ROY CRONIN They 'll fit . MILITARY POLICEMAN Come on , soldier . ROY CRONIN I 'll try to get back , some time . MYRA That 's right , Roy . Good-by . ( He kisses her . ) ROY CRONIN Good-by , darling . ( He goes out at the left . ) ( The sound of the German airplane is again heard , circling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . The MILITARY POLICEMAN looks up . ) MILITARY POLICEMAN Better be getting off this bridge , Miss . It 's dangerous . ( MYRA turns and starts to go toward the right , slowly . The MILITARY POLICEMAN turns and goes out at the left , quickly . The motor of the Gotha bomber is droning directly overhead . MYRA looks upward , and pauses . Then she opens her handbag and takes from it the wilted package of Camels . She takes one and light it , very deliberately. ) p. 120 MYRA ( looking upward ) Here I am , Heinie I 'm right down here . ( She holds up the lighted match. )
