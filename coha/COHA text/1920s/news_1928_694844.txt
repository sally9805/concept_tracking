txt NEW TREATY WITH FRANCE VIEWED AS STEP BACKWARD In Effect It Drastically Limits the Questions Which May Be Submitted for Investigation and Report To the Editor of The New York Times : A comparison of the texts of the new arbitration treaty with France end the Bryan Treaty for the Advancement of Peace , signed Sept. 15 , 1914. must inevitably lead to the conclusioa that the new treaty constitutes an unfortunate step backward . Whereas the Bryan treaty provided for investigation and report of all disputes of whatever nature , the new treaty , whether intentionally or through careless drafting . in effect drastically curtails the questions which may be submitted to this procedure . Article I of the new arbitration treaty reaffirms Article I of the Treaty for the Advancement of Peace with a slight change of wording . TREATY OF SEPT. 15 , 1914 : Article I-Any disputes arising between the Government of the ' United States of America and the 11 Government of the French Republic , of whatever nature they may be , shall , when ordinary diplomatic proceedings have failed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be submitted for investigation and report to a Permanent International Commission constituted in the manner prescribed in the following article . The High Contracting Parties agree not to resort , with respect to each other , to any act of force during the investigation to be made by thee commission an : before its report is handed in . TREATY OF FEB. 6 , 1928 : Article I-Any disputes arising between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic , of whatever nature they may be , shall , when ordinary diplomatic proceedings have failed and the High Contracting Parties do not have recourse to adjudication by a competent tribunal , be submitted for investigation and report , as prescribed in the treaty signed at Washington , Sept. 15 , 1914 , to the Permanent International Commis . Ilion constituted pursuant thereto . Many Provisions Incorporated . Thus the only important textual change is the substitution of the words " adjudication by a competent tribunal " for the words " recourse to arbitration . " The new treaty omits the second paragraph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disputes " shall be submitted for Investigation and report , as prescribed in the treaty signed at Washington , Sept. 15 , 1914 , " it may presumably be interpreted to include the agreement " not to resort , with respect to each other , to any act of force during the investigation . " Thus all parts of the 1914 treaty necessary for and pertaining to conciliation , investigation and report are confirmed and impliedly incorporated in the treaty.Uew Article II of the new treaty provides measures for arbitral or perhaps judicial settlement of certain justiciable questions as opposed to the method of settlement by investigation and report provided in Article I. Article III of the 1928 ' - eaty is as follows : Article III-The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject matter of which ( a ) is within the domestic jurisdiction of either of the high contracting-parties ; ( b ) involves the interests of third parties ; ( c ) depends upon or involves the maintenance of the traditional attitude of the United States concerning American questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends upon or involves the observance of the obligations of France in accordance with the covenant of the League of Nations . Certain Disputes Excepted . It is the intention of the parties to except from arbitral settlement ( or aettlenient before a competent tribunal as pointed out in Article II of this treaty ) the four categories of cases specified in Article HI . This Interpretation would be in accordance with the custom of States to except certain classes of disputes from possible arbitral or judicial settlement . The treaty of Sept. 15 , 1914 , which provides only for investigation and report , stipulates no exceptions to disputes which may be submitted to this procedure . Under the terms of Article III of the treaty of Feb. 6 , 1928 , it is plainly stated that " the provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject-matter of which falls Into any of four specified categories.l " However , the method provided in Article I of this treaty for settlement of disputes by investigation and report Is a " provision " of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article I. The four classes of cases named in Article III may not therefore be the subject of investigation and report under Article I. This means that the new treaty is in this respect weaker than the treaty of 1914 , because under the latter , all matters without exception were subject to investigation and re . port . In case of a lispute arising between the two teethes , it may be asked whether they have a choice of submitting the matter for investigation and report under the terms of the Bryan Treaty or under the terms of the new treaty . It would seem that such a choice is impossible under existing practice in international law , for in case of a conflict between different treaties between the same States , the later treaty , in point of date , is binding . It is sometimes the custom in drawing up international treaties to insert an article definitely stipulating that the new treaty does not affect certain previous treaty commitments between the high contracting parties . Thus the as yet unratified convention between the United States and the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following provision : Article XIII-It is expressly understood and agreed that nothing provided in this treaty shall in any wise affect the rights of either of the two High Contracting Parties or to be taken as limitation , definition , restriction or restrictive construction of the rights of either party under the Treaty of Nov. 18 , 1903 , and the Treaty of Sept. 2 , 1914 , except as expressly provided in this treaty . * ? * The absence of such a clause in the new treaty with France may not be without significance . MILDR.ED S. WERTHEIMER . HERBERT W. BRIGGS . New York , Feb. 28 , 1928 . A SIMPLE MATTER Mere Voters Could Answer Senator Borah 's Questionnaire . To the Editor of The New York Times : If Senator Borah were to hit upon a plan of questioning ordinary citizens as to how they intend to vote in the next Presidential election with reference to the Eighteenth Amendment , and I were to be among those addressed thus , I would answer : The resubmission of the question not coming within the sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same channels as its original passage , I should want to see the Presidential candidate take a position above the opposing sections ; so that when the issue comes before him he might act with an eye single to its merits . There would be logic and pertinence in pointedly interrogating a Congressional candidate on the reopening of a legislative issue ; but not a Presidential candidate , since the office of President is that of executive . Besides , the drink question is not even a party question ; nor , in its whole motivation , is It a question that truly divides the drys and the wets . Thus we find outright wets who are for the Eighteenth Amendment-the bootleggers , for example , and such others as are commercially interested in its continuance ; and , on the other hand , we find earnest drys-such as are deeply concerned in the observance of law and are mindful of the dignity of the individual-who are against the Eighteenth Amendment . So there you are . So far as the President is to occupy himself with the drink question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the constitutional amendment or to a modification of the Volstead act , it must be by way of bringing the two sides together on the basis of public interest and in accordance with the ideals upon which this Commonwealth is founded . GABRIEL WELLS . New York , March 1 , 1928 , FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OPPOSED Finland Proposal Is Regarded as Being Merely a Half-Way Measure for Peace To the Editor of The New York Times : The new plan of financial guarantees , proposed last year by Finland and now supported before the Security and Arbitration Committee by Great Britain , must be judged by its applicability to the central purpose of the League . " The task of the League , " Lord Cecil correctly states , " is to destroy war " ; the means " must be an international police force * * * or an international posse coraitatus . " Does the new plan tend to help or to hinder this fundamental object ? Superficially considered , the new plan seems to accomplish the same purpose as the military guarantees without their disadvantages . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations ; it substitutes for the sending of troops the purely governmental operation of transferring cash . It derives the nations of that obvious pretext for maintaining a large standing army , the pretext that they must have troops in excess of those necessary for defense in order to be able to contribute to the posse comitatus . Finally , it offers the security that the nations insist is a prerequisite to disarmament . The acid test of the value of the League of Nations , as of any other cooperative scheme , is the willingness of the partners to make sacrifices for the benefit of the whole . The covenant and the protocol both envisage that . Yet , although the nations have accepted the covenant , they are not willing to give military aid against the aggressor as defined In the protocol . Instead , if the new plan is adopted , they will lend money to any member State that is attacked or threatened with attack . The chief objection to the military guarantee is that there exist groups of powers within the League and - that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their friends or allies . Could not the same objection be made to the plan for financial guarantees ? Would Great Britain or Germany , let us say , lend money to France to defeat an attack from Italy ? It is more likely that they would refuse to give their money , just as they have refused to pledge their troops , in support of enemies of their friends . Then we have the ever-present question of determining who the aggressor is . In an editorial of Feb. 22 THE TIMES suggests that if Germany had known in 1914 the extent of the financial power that was to be ranged against her she would not have declared war . Yet historians and statesmen were not sure in 1914 which power precipitated the war , and they are still in doubt . Indeed , there is much evidence to show that the Governments did their utmost to prevent the outbreak of war . At any rate , hurried decisions about the vexed question of responsibility are likely to do grave injustice . Moreover , it may be seriously doubted whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany in 1914 . Finally , there is one objection to the plan for financial guarantees that can not be made against military guarantees . The next war will start and end in record time . Even in 1914 both sides expected to get decisive results within six weeks , a period of time too short for the influence of money to make itself felt . In the next war , if there is one , the time will be more nearly six hours ! In short , if the new plan for financial guarantees is adopted , we can be sure that the powers are willing to go half way toward the maintenance of peace , but we may well doubt whether half-way measures will suf ; flee . In a case of such transcendent importance it is all or nothing . M. H. COCHFtAN . New York , Feb. 28 , 1928 , OLD-TIME ROSE FANCIER GREW GREEN BLOOMS To the Editor of The New York Times : I read in THe TIMES that there are no naturally green flowers or blossoms . In Waterloo , N.

She had In her back yard the greatest variety of roses I have ever seen ; among them was one bush on which grew green roses . The rose had somewhat the shape of a carnation ; that is , the edges of the blossom leaf were serrated . I had never before seen green roses growing , and Mrs. May plucked one and gave it to me . I pressed it and had it for many years , and I am not sure that it is not among my possessions somewhere even yet . I kept it in an envelope marked " A Green Rose . " MRS . E. K. PEASE . New York , Feb. 27 , 1928 . FINANCING NEEDED Help for New Industries Would Reduce Unemployment To the Editor of The New York Times : Secretary of Labor Davis , in a statement which appeared in THE TIMES of Feb. 28 attributes unemployment , in part at least , to labor displacement by machinery . He recommends that steps be taken to prevent the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , has been speeding up the older industries without developing new ones . Further he says , " My plea has been that our inventive genius should direct itself to the discovery Of new human needs and the development of new industries to supply them . " In his opinion , new invention is one of the only ways to cure the situation . Unfortunately , if the situation is to be met through the exploitation of new industries the cure will be slow indeed . There is no dearth of economically valuable new inventions originating here , and many are brought here from abroad . Europe at present is very prolific and propositions are available today that would aid materially in the direction Secretary Davis proposes . But the trouble is tnere are no recognized financial channels through which such new industries , regardless of their worth , can be fostered . Private financing is essential initially , hence any organization that undertakes to investigate and exploit meritorious inventions soon finds itseif overloaded and obliged to limit Its activities , whereas if suitable arrangements were available the new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn would undertake to place them squarely in tile field as healthy enterprises with ample funds and under sound management . There is a wonderful opportunity , not alone to aid the unemployed , but to stimulate the industrial structure generally , by the systematic development of new industries on a basis comparable with that which exists now for the fileancing of established industries . The present system is predicated on the idea that the public , which supplies all of the funds employed in business and industry , should only participate after several years of successful operations , hence they seldom have an opportunity , that is a legitimate opportunity , to get in on the ground floor of a new undertaking . ahey realize , nevertheless , that while the safety factor at this period may be lower , the earning possibilities are many times ' greater than ever obtains after the stock is released through authorized channels for public purchase . In an effort to reap some of these large profits and owing to the fact that no medium exists through which the public can make contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they waste millions of Idollars annually through unscrupulous promoters , who promise the very thing that legitimate business affords during its early stages-the real period of opportunity , which diminishes in proportion as the enterprise becomes seasoned , or safe , as it is called . Inventions and the exploration of new enterprises , if speeded up , Would doubtless aid in keeping down Unemployment , but Secretary Davis overlooked the biggest factor to be compensated for , and that is the effect of the numerous consolidatioas that are taking place in almost every line of business . One of the advantages of consolidation , in business , is that generally it results in reducing the number of employes necessary-and hence reduces the cost of operation . EDWARD F. CHANDLER . New York , Feb. 28 , 1928 . RESULT OF " SNAP " COURSES . To the Editor of The New York Times : A recent letter to THE TIMES from Albert Perry Brigham of Hamilton , N. Y. , commenting on Dean Hawkes 's reference to " snap " courses , pointed out that the late Nathaniel Southgate Shaler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest teacher of earth science that America ever had . It seems to me worth noting , as evidence of the impress left by this giver of snap courses , that his students at Harvard , in his name , endowed the Shaler Professorship of Geology at Berea College , Berea , Ky . The funds thus given , approximately $90,000 , are now close to the point where it will be possible to establish at Berea a second chair , the Shaler Professorship of Chemistry . It will operate at Berea in connection with a modern science hall now being built . K. A. WILSON . Ossining , N. Y. , Feb. 28 , 1928 . TRAINING THE YOUNG IDEA . To the Editor of The New York Times : I submit for general consideration a statement made by Judge Albert Vitale in an address before the Siwanoy Democratic Club in the Bronx . He said : " It is the solemn duty of every man of influence to take under his wing and guidance at least one member of the younger generation . " Judge Vitale 's idea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to aid the American youth . His suggestion is that physicians should devote some time to the advising of pre-medical students , lawyers to pre-law students , &c.; That is , men with experience and influence in special fields should advise and aid to the best of their ability as many deserving young men interested in these fields as possible . MICHAEL 3 . LEPORE. /stew York , Feb. 27 , 1ti2g. , BALLOT BOX STUFFING TALE IS REFUTED BY THE RETURNS Grover Cleveland , Supposed Beneficiary , Lost Cheektowaga by One Vote in His First Campaign There was printed recently in the up-State press a somewhat extended Associated Press dispatch from Buffalo , telling of the death of George Urban Jr . In giving an account of his career , the dispatch said ; " An anecdote of Cleveland that Urban took delight in recalling was One having to do with the ( first election of Cleveland as President . He related how , contrary to early expectations , early returns indicated that Cheektowaga , Republican stronghold , was voting heavily for Cleveland , and when the final returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district was almost unanimous . Cleveland attributed the vietorn to Urban . Returns Tell Different Story . " Nearly thirty years later , et a public dinner , however , Urban told how a stuffed ballot box had been substituted by friends of Cleveland whom Urban refused to name . " The official election returns for 1884 conclusively controvert this Cheektowaga tale . Such returns show that the vote of Cheektowaga in 1884 was far from being almost unanimous for Cleveland . On the contrary , Cheektowaga at that election gave a majority for Blaine . The exact vote at the Presidental election was Blame 263 , Cleveland 262-a Republican majority of 1 . That this vote in Cheektowaga , which at that period and for some years after had only one election district , was normal , is also shown by the fact , ascertained likewise from the official returns , that Cheektowaga was usually very close politically . In 1883 it gave a Republican majority of 11 , in 1885 it gave a Democratic majority of 17 , in 1886 It gave a Republican majority of 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stuffing of the ballot box in Cheektowaga in 1884 . Vote Was Not Stolen . Those who are interested in accurate political information may care to make note an article entitled , " Was New York 's 1884 Vote Stolen ? " contributed by Francis Lynde Stetson and William Gorham Rice to the North American Review forn January , 1914 , and they may care also to know that THE NEW YORK TIMES Index contains under my name reference to letters in recent years disposing of various tales more or less resembling the attributed Urban anecdote . The North American Review article ended with this sentence : " The conclusion of the whole matter is that New York 's vote was not stolen in 1884 ; that none of the principals had reason to suppose that it was stolen ; that at the time no responsible person or paper adhered to the charge that it was stolen , and that these facts are attested by evidence still in existence and readily accessible . WILLIAM GORHAM RICE . Albany , Feb. 28 , 1928 . SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND CIVIL SERVICE Associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor of The New York Times : Civil service for Associate City Superintendents is asked by the Public Education Association , and a bill , urged by them , is now pending in our State Legislature to place these officers on the civil service list . For months this well-informed association has devoted itself to this measure , but , I believe , that I speak for a large number of our citizens who have had actual experience in city educational matters when I ask that this bill be not passed . The Superintendents are now appointed by the Board of Education . What would-or could-a Civil Service Commission do in making such appointments that a Board of Education , equipped with greater knowledge of school conditions and personalities , can not do ? If it is true that the Board of Education may at some time perform its job inefficiently , so also may the Civil Service Commission , as witness the methods and negligence so scathingly condemned in the Knapp case . In the appointment of executives like Associate City Superintendents , personality , character and executive ability are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedagogical kno ; sledge probably could be tested and determined with fair equity by the Civil Service Commission ; but I can think of few positions in the world where the aforesaid personality and character are more important , and the commission would have to rate these intangible factors as skillfully as it could rate a written paper . Is this commission as well qualified to do this as the Board of Education ? The members of the latter are pre-supposed to be citizens of highest qual- ity ; they are primarily interested in education and our public schools , or they would not be serving ; they maintain close contact with the affairs and personnel of those schools ; and if they do not always come up to the high standard of their office , it is reasonable to assume , at least , that the same Mayor who appointed them would not appoint more valuable types for the Civil Service Commission . The political background is certainly more acutely present in the appointment of the latter . Imagine our foremost educators taking a civil service examination and then waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other university installing such a system for its executive educational heads ! It sounds ridiculous , but why is the thought any more absurd for an institution of higher learning than for our public schools ? The Public Education Association has been so long eloquent on one side of this subject that it no longer has an open mind . Those of us who know the educational system may have an opinion as to where the serious fault lies . I believe the Public Education Association itself has such an opinion . It should Arike the real evil , no matter whom it hurts , and not spend its time and money to urge more clerical types in our school system under the designation of Associate City Superintendents , especielle when one for whose benefit such recommendation is made , the City Superintendent , is opposed to civil service appointments of his associates and has expressed himself as satisfied with the present arrangement and has praised his associates for their loyalty and efficiency . I.-1VI5NTEFIORE LEVY . New York , Feb. 28 , 1928 . TOLSTOY AND TURGENEF Apropos the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tolstoy Society , and the publication of a new and definitive edition of the great Russian moralist 's works in commemoration of the hundredth anniversary of his birth , it may be interesting to call attention to the estimate of Tolstoy lately pronounced by an eminent Spanish critic . Senor Salvador Madariaga , who holds the chair of Spanish Literature at Oxford , and who is now , I believe , visiting this country , recently published a stimulating essay on " The Genius of Spain . " In it may be found this passage : If the six greatest names of European literature be singled out , it is ? likely that the choice of them would be somewhat as follows : Shakespeare , Cervantes , Dante , Goethe , Rabelais and Tolstoy . There might be discussions as to this or that name , but if there are two which are safe on the list they are certainly those of the Englishman and the Spaniard . This list of names is provocative . No one , I suppose , would question Cervantes 's right to a high place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not feel that as an artist , at least in the field of pure fiction , Turgenef may justly dispute with Tolstoy a claim to a chair in Sefior Madariaga 's academy of European literary dblebrities . I simply throw the question out for debate . It may serve to relieve our minds momentarily of the depressing contemplation of the condition of Russian literature today under Sovietism . It is only fair to add , however , that revolution does not always strike at literature . Prince Kropotkln said of Turgenef in 1899 : " Of all the novel writers of our century , Turgenef has certainly attained the greatest perfection as an artist and his prose sounds to the Russian ear like music - music as deep as that of Beethoven . " Still more striking is the opinion of Se'rgei Stepniak , the outlawed terrorist , himself an accomplished writer both in Russian and English , who , In an essay published in 1894 , wrote : " This recognition ( of Turgenef ) was of slow growth . It had nothing in it of the sudden wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Tolstoy to worldwide fame. * * Tolstoy is more plastical , and certainly as deep and original and rich in creative power as Turgenef , and Dostoievsky is more intense , fervid and dramatic . But as an artist , as master of the combination of details into a harmonious whole , as an architect of imaginative work , he surpasses all the prose writers of his country and has but few equals among the great novelists of other lands . " LAWRENCE F. ABBOTT . Cornwall , N. Y. , Feb. 28 , 1928. - THE ORDER OF DAYS To the Editor of The New York Times : J. H. Carroll takes exception to the statement that the change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian made a difference as regards the names of the days of the week and asserts that these have always followed each other in regular order . The Gregorian calendar became effective in England on Sept. 2 , the last day of the Julian calendar . The next day was under this new order called the 14th . Now , had no change been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , had the 2d been Monday , have fallen upon a Saturday . Supposing that this date was the one-millionth since the creation , would it not follow , inasmuch as the consecutive character of the days of the week had been changed from what they would have been under the old re. - gime during the previous 365 days , that this also holds good if you go back 1.000,000 days ? Furthermore , in view of Mr. Carroll 's statement that these days of the week have always followed each other since the dawn of time , should we not take into account the fact stated in the Bible that on one oocasion Joshua succeeded in causing the sun to stand still " for about the space of one whole day , " and in the absence of any information to the contrary conclude that a day was then found missing and consequently this asserted consecutiveness was somewhat disrupted ? But in any event this is all germane to the suggestion that these days of the week have their names changed from their heathen origin to something better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . If the Jewish statement that the darkness occurring on the day of the crucifixion was due to a natural occurrence-an eclipse-is true it would be an easy matter to determine the exact date of both Easter and the Passover , and this should be done , for undoubtedly both these feasts had their origin on an exact date which had no reference to the moon . Why any one should raise an objection to such a thing is hard to understand . EDMUND R. CUMMINS . Vereester . Mass. , Feb. 27 , 1928 , JEFFERSON DAVIS WORE I SHAWL FOR OVERCOAT To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES published an interesting account of the use of shawls as overcoats by the men of the 1860s and their exhibition in Boston by the New England Historical and Genealogical Society .

Charleston , S. C. , Feb. 28 , 1928 . THOSE TOWN NAMES Robert Harpur Had Voice in Classical Designations . To the Editor of The New York Times : While not wishing to prolong the discussion over the classical names borne by scores of New York State cities and towns , I think William Pierrepont White and others should know what is being taught on the subject in our public schools . I therefore quote from a geography textbook written by Professor H. W. Rockwell , President of the State Teachers College at Buffalo , and now used extensively in the grades , according to information recently furnished me by a local teacher : " The reason for the selection of these names is to be found in the fact that Robert Harpur , who was an early American educator , served as secretary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sponsor for the military townships of Central New York , whose classical names have ever since been the subject of speculation and wonder . He died in 1825 in Southern New York in the little village of Harpursville , named for him and his family . " Professor Rockwell , no doubt , has good authority for this statement , which fills in the gap of historical evidence needed to round out the story presented by your various correspondents . Naming the culprit , however , has not relieved other early State officials of their share of responsibility in the indiscretion thus perpetrated . It is interesting to note that when censure fell upon their heads the immediately began " passing the buck . " Governor George Clinton denied having anything to do with the matter ; Surveyor General Simeon De Witt declared he deserved none of the discredit , and so the blame was handed down to an elusive somebody , now brought to light as Robert Harper , at one time secretary to the Land Office Commission . In defense of this American classicist , to whose hobby so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that with the task he had on hand he might have done far worse , as a glance at a New Yolk State gazetteer will reveal . Surely Rome is to be preferred to Cigarville and Athens to Painted Post , both in point of euphony and suggestion . Mr. Harpur 's real transgression lay in the wider influence he exerted , for it is safe to assume that places later receiving their misnomers did so from the precedent established when twenty-eight townships were given classical designations at one fell swoep .

This did some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , but many of the requisite words were unheard of , unknown and useless for permanent incorporation in one 's vocabulary . As a little school girl in a mining town in California , when the old blue back spelling book was our authority , I participated in a " spelling bee " when the boys were arranged on one side of the room and the girls on the opposite side . The teacher or some grown-up conducted the affair and alternated the words between the participants . On a word pronounced like " dente . n , " after the usual three trials , I met my Waterloo . It really was not a disgraceful defeat , for how could a youngster of only 9 or 10 years know anything about " demesne " ? But in all the years that have followed , soon a half a century , I have never forgotten the word or its meaning .

New Rochelle , N. Y. , Feb. 28 , 1928 OLD FASHION NOTE . To the Editor of The New York Times : Let us cheer up ! Here is proof that New York is getting better . In rummaging through some old books I ran across " Letters Home " by William Morris , an Englishman , who said of New York in 1874 : " A friend of mine tells me of a little matter which came under his own observation the other day , wherein a boy , 14 years of age , abused and insulted his mother in a most shocking manner because she objected to his having a revolver pocket made in some new trousers which were being made for him . I am told that a tailor invariably puts a revolver pocket in trousers unless ordered not to do so . The pocket is placed rather behind and somewhat higher than the ordinary pocket , on the back of the right hip . When placed here the revolver is ready at once to the hand . The position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ' while the person carrying it is seated , the nozzle , or mouth of the barrel , points clear of the leg .

Dr. Brown Gives Definitions and Decries Proposed Naval Expansion As Inopportune To the Editor of The New York Times : The real issue now before the House Committee on Naval Affairs is not whether our present navy should be weakened , but whether our country should continue its historic policy for a moderate navy or whether it should embark upon a policy of huge expansion . I was asked by members of the committee whether I favored " a navy for defense . " I replied : " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which needs definition . Every Government that has waged war for a hundred years has claimed that it has done so in defense of something that it deemed vital to its interests . No nation will admit that it plans aggressive warfare . Moreover , the crucial question arises , defense against what ? If against Great Britain , as some reckless agitators are urging , manifestly we must have an enormous navy ; if against some country like Spain , half of our present navy would suffice ; if against invasion , the navy- we now have is ample . The term ' adequate defense , ' therefore , simply confuses the issue unless it is made more specific . " The most serious objection to the proposed development is not financial , grave as that undoubtedly is . It is rather its effect upon the spirit and temper of the American people . A naval program of the proposed size and cost would inevitably set the American people to thinking about war , talking about it , imagining that it must be prepared for and suspecting the intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations could be secured only by trumpeting these suspicions and war scares up and down the land and in the halls of Congress , with the inevitable result in a war psychology at the very time of all times when the world needs to develop a peace psychology . Grave International Effect . Equally grave is the effect upon our international relations . I do not speak as a doctrinaire . For over thirty years I have been related to missionary work in other lands . American Christians are maintaining 16,000 missionaries and contributing $39,000,000 annually for the support of their extensive educational , medical , evangelistic and philanthropic work .

Surely , therefore , those who administer this money as vital an interest ir the navei policy of our Goverrimee ; as any business corporation colliepossibly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not calling for tl , : n expansion of the American Navy but they seriously deprecate the pending proposal . It would be easy to quoto declarations of missionary bodies t : this effeet . The boards of foreigr missiotis ef the Methodist Episcopal . Congregetenal and Protestant Episcopal churches , the Federal Council of the Chureaes of Christ in America and other bodies that might be mentioned have recently a.donted strong protests . We do not believe in the alleged " missionary gunboat policy . " Missionaries go out upon an errand of peace . Their influence largely depends upon relations of good-will . A show of military or naval force in connection with missionary work , or any action that might be construed by the peoples of Asia as implying that the physical force of the American Government is behind it , gravely weakens their influence . Now , the recent discussions have created an unfortunate impression in several lands . On the very day , Jan. 29 , 1927 , that President Coolidge in a public address said , " As a nation we are advocates of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Rear Admiral publicly demanded a policy of military and naval preparedness , and sharply criticized the " pernicious efforts " of those who opeosed it . The Rear Admiral declared that war would come in fourteen years and condemned the Washington conference at which " the United States relinquished her position of national security " and ? was outwitted by Japan and England . " There are in Japan , as in the United States , men who demand a policy of preparedness and men who demand a policy of peace . The pending proposals in Congress have played directly into the handa of the war party in Japan . That party can not be blamed for feeling that America is preparing to fight Japan when the remarks of retired Admirals and men in high position can be quoted to that identical effect , and when the acting President of the Navy League of the United States is reported in Tnn Times of Feb. 25 as having said that " the United States must maintain a larger navy to oppose England and Japan successfully . " Japan Sees Us Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are promptly cabled to Japan and published in its newspapers . Since England and Japan are the only nations in the world strong enough to fight the United States , and since the Japanese well know that Americans do not fear an attack from England , can we wonder that Dr. William Axling wrote from Japan : " I am constantly learning of expressions of conviction by responsible men that America is preparing for war with Japan . Many of these men are leaders in the peace movement . They believe that America will force the Issue so that war Can not be avoided . " The Tokio Mainichi , onn nt the .4. rk fluential newspapers in Japan , said : " Although Japan will not by any means change her attitude toward the limitation agreement , it is now up to America to make clear her position , especially as regards the meaning of the Pacific war peril as feared by American naval authorities . If Japan is really the object of a Pacific war peril we would like to know it for future reference . " At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consicfege ton of statesmanship and hupianfty dictates the cultivation of the spirit of peace and international good-will , it is nothing less than wicked to foster suspicion and a sense of peril from an imaginary foe . One can not year after year shout from the housetops the imperative need of military and naval preparedness , sharpen weapons of warfare , and demand large additions to them without creating a war psychology which sooner or later will demand bloody expression .. ARTHUR J. BROWN . New York , Feb. 27 , 1928 , TESTS FOR TOADS Temperament Should Be Considered in Fort Worth Trial . To the Editor of The New York Times : Eastland , Texas , has been made famous by a horned toad . It is claimed that this particular toad was officially sealed up in the cornerstone of the Court House on July 29 , 1897 , for the purpose of testing the legend that toads live under some conditions for hundreds of years . Scientists and biologists in Washington and elsewhere are now asserting that this is a fake . In other words , they claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reliable than the testimony of those who were on " location . " At the very time that scientists were explaining some years ago that ballplayers could not throw curved balls , a ballplayer was doing it at Cincinnati , Ohio . Many years ago when I was a young man in Columbiana County , Ohio , one of the workmen in a small stone quarry , in splitting a large solid sandstone , accidentally liberated , in my presence and in the presence of others , a toad that on being given air and sunlight , Immediately became alive . This sandstone had been blasted out from under ten to fifteen feet of earth , after which it was then split open . The imprint of the toad was impressed in the solid sandstone . The toad had evidently been embedded in the stone for thousands of years I notice that the Riverside Civic League of Fort Worth , Texas , intends to make a test of this question by sealing up a live toad in solid concrete . In my opinion this would hardly be a fair test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those in sandstone . Furthermore , toads , like human beings , are different . One toad might stand the ordeal and another one might not . To make a real scientific test of this phenomenon at least one hundred toads should be used , and under such circumstances and with such materials as to parallel nature . H. H. EMMONS . Canton , Ohio , Feb. 28 , 1928 . OUR PATENT SYSTEM DEFENDED Regardless of Possible Faults It Does Gives Protection to Inventors To the Editor of The New York Times : Tete TIMES of Feb. 26 printed a letter from G. A. Clarke , who decries our present patent system . Mr. Clarke in this letter very harshly criticizes the patent situation in this country , and , I believe , very unjustly . Moreover , his letter contains several inaccurate statements which I feel should be corrected . First , Mr. Clarke quotes a former Commissioner of Patents as stating that the officials of the Patent Office think the inventor is a nuisance and that only the capitalist promoting the invention is considered . This statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring true of a former Commissioner of Patents . Furthermore , except in those cases where an application for a patent is filed by an attorney for the backer or in those rare instances where the Patent Office examiner comes into contact with the backer , the examiner does not know who is interested in the invention , Mr. Clarke would abolish the entire patent system , but he offers no substitute which would help the inventor to retain the monopoly of the fruits of his inventive ability . Does it appear logical that without a pat ' eat monopoly inventors would work out their new devices and processes and merely dedicate the results of their inventive skill to the public without remuneration ? Does not every inventor strive to perfect a salable invention , and does not the grant of a patent give him the only means possible of preventing others from using his invention without payment to him of royalties ? It must be borne in mind that the grant of letters patent does not give the patentee the right to make , use and sell his invention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using and selling his invention . Instead of hindering the industrial progress of this country , as
