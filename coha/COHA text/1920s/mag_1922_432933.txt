I WAS down at Banga in July , for a health-change . Rhoda Rivers was there . You remember , she came out with me more than a year ago ; she has been at Banga ever since . The Mission put her there because the Wards would be sure to be kind to her , and there is no one better than Mrs. Ward for training the novice . You ' ve got to take account of these things when you set a girl as young as Rhoda ? I 'm sure she can not be more than twenty-five ? in a circumstance so violent in its difference from what she knows or what she can have imagined . I noticed the change in Rhoda as soon as she came in , and it was more than the change we look to see in the first year . It was n't just Africa ? she had n't gone off so much in her color as in her temperament . She was as pretty as I remember her to have been on the steamer , but not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom of her surface . I ca n't say I missed all this at first . I got in about three o'clock ; came in from Ajap that day , ? on my wheel of course , ? and that was pretty good going , as you will agree , in the rainy season and on that clay road , with the sun like a flame about your body all morning . Anyway , I got in before the rain fell ; the thunder of it was about the house ten minutes after I arrived . They put me in Rhoda 's room . I had a bath in her rubber tub , and was all dry in some of her good smelling clothesbefore she came in . Funny how she can keep her belongings sweet in the rainy season ? and in that little old but of the Wards , where the rain drives through the slits in the bark every day . I was lying on her cot ? her bed was side-tracked up the coast somewhere , poor kid ? when she came in . Wet to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to see me to devour me . She put her arms around me and laid her cold wet cheek against mine , and I could feel the warm tears run out of her eyes . I remembered my own first year in this forest , before I could speak the language , or was so crazy about the work as I am now , or knew the forest women . Many a lonely night I have looked out of the window in that old clearing that used to be in the elbow of the Mboto River ? it has gone back to forest now , but it was the pioneer station then ; and I used to look out into the rain or the moonlight , wondering to see the lonely place it was ? and myself in it . It 's one thing , is n't it , to read about Livingstone , and quite another to look out of a little cabin in a little clearing in an African forest and to think ? well , here I am , an African missionary ! I suppose that Rhoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the hang of her job or the taste for her profession . I met her mother before we sailed , and I was her cabin-mate coming down the coast , so I was as near a friend as she had in the Dark Continent , and the only one who called her by her first name . But you know all these things , and how you seem , in your first year , to have no first name or other personal identification ; and you ' 11 believe that Rhoda was glad to see me . She bathed and dressed , talking to me all the time . She wanted to know how long I would stay , and could n't I come back for Christmas , and did I think her hair had grown darker . She shook out that hair of hers ? the color of barley sugar candy ? into its cloud of sparkle , and peered at it in the glass . The dark of the rain was in the room , and she lit a lamp . A black woman came in , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs and thighs were wet ; her body was covered with a khaki coat . Those Pala women pick up all sorts of things to wear when they are paid at the beach for the rubber they carry down . I was awfully interested to see how Rhoda would handle the woman ; you know how we must always speculate about new missionaries and how they will take hold ; and I must say that Rhoda had never given me a sense that she had a vocation . But I liked the way she seemed to know the woman and to like to have her there , talking to her in a halting Pala that was n't half bad for a first-year baby missionary . I understand that dialect from the time I worked with the Pala to the south . The Pala woman sat on the floor , ? new planks since you were at that station , ? and began to love Rhoda with her eyes ; which I was glad to see : there is no better sign . Rhoda spread her hair ; the woman slapped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' My mother , if you could see this beauty ! ' You know how they do . And Rhoda , like the rest of us when we were new , rose to that . The VOL . Is0 ? NO. 5 lamp that shines behind her face was lit for a moment ; she looked at herself in the glass and her sweet upper lip smiled . It gave me a pang to see so pretty a girl so sensitive to such praise . Rhoda lives in the east room of that little house , and the Wards in the west ; they eat in the middle room . Will Arden cats with them ; but he has put up a bit of a cabin for himself . I had n't seen him since he came back from furlough . He and I were at the same station in the south three years ago , so WC had a lot to talk about . And three of my schoolgirls have been married off to Pala men ; so Mrs. Ward and I had a lot to talk about . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk was quick around the table that night , and of the usual exciting sort that we drop into when we have been long enough in the work : about marriages , and epidemics , and poisonings , and personalities , and who has a baby , and who has stolen a woman , and who has distinguished himself as a villain or a Christian . Items of murder , items of hunting , items of government . control ? all the sort of thing that seems exciting when you really know a neighborhood . We were going along like this , marrying and baptizing and killing people off , when I happened to look at Rhoda . There was her little face under her candy-colored hair , like an unlighted lamp under a bright shade . What did site care for Town Topics south of the So River ? She was thinking thoughts of far away , or perhaps not thinking at all . That young spirit was drowsing away the dull hour till there should be a knock at the door . I remembered how , on the steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young fellows from the trading-posts all along the Coast had turned dazzled faces toward that light . Poor lads , ? lost now in what isolated clearings , ? drowsing away dull hours , as lonely and lonelier than she . Their last look from the surfboat had been for her , when we dropped them off as we came south . Sitting in the jumble of their luggage between the rowers , they had kept off their helmets longer than was wise , turning their diminishing white faces up to where she leaned over the rail . I suppose that many a one of them has a quite adequate image of her in his heart to this day , and takes occasion to wonder , in the most unlikely places , is that lovely Rivers girl married yet ? Of course , when she was sent in to Pala and Will Arden was at Pala too , there was a thought in the Mission mind that here is where Arden ' meets , ' ? as the Pala people say of a day of reckoning . But I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it had died . After I came out of my enchantment of ? well , you know the enchantment of fresh and friendly talk after long isolations ? and tools note of Rhoda sitting there like a shadow under the caves on a moonlit night , I took note as well of my confederates . What were they thinking of that eclipse ? And they were not thinking . Perhaps they did not know it was an eclipse . You know how at a station there is a kind of blindness ? it is the blindness of custom . I watched to see if Mrs. Ward liked her , and she did . I thought Will Arden was a little harsh with her : he told her he had seen her with her helmet off , and how could she be so unwise ? There is no doctor at Banga , so I suppose they all felt responsible for her . And site resented it ? that was plain . Of course the Wards clamored when they heard that she had been without her hehnet , and she said ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Some carriers had begged to see her hair . You can think how they all jumped on her for that , and told her the old tale of how , Mrs. Carson lost her helmet out of a canoe , and had a sunstroke before the crew could get her ashore . I judged that Rhoda had heard this horror before . Anyway , there site sat , looking very bored by the misadventures of Mrs. Carson , and there sat Will Arden , looking at her with those bright eyes he gets when he is crossed . And I was thinking : too bad to see such brightness dimmed . And I thought : I suppose we all went through it . And then I wondered : but did we ? None of us was so lovely to start with , except perhaps Mary Allen ; and there is Bob Allen , to feed that dame of beauty . I could have chatted with the Wards all night , ? I certainly do like that woman , ? but I went to bed early on Rhoda 's account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that being the familiar hunger of the first year . Her cot and my cot were under the same mosquito-net in her little room , which was as full of moonlight as a cup mac be of water ; and I thought she would murmur to me for hours ? I meant she should . But I could n't keep awake , I had been on the road since dawn , and this for three mornings . I dropped asleep before she began to be intimate . I woke with the call of the guinea-fowl , like the good traveler I hate learned to be ; and when I lit the lamp , Rhoda was still asleep , pale in her bright hair . Mrs. Ward had my breakfast ready by ? bless her ! ? and I was going to be off with the first pallor of day . Will Arden came over to look at my wheel ; I held the lantern while he pumped it up . So far as I know , the wheel had been under the house all night , but there it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my supplies , he said I had better keep them ; we were short at that time in the Mission , and Blake , he said , would be willing to part with some of his . This was the first word ever I heard of Blake , but I knew he must be the trader over at the Clark and Batson factory across the river . Someone had said there was a white man at that post . Will Arden shouted to his boy , who answered at his elbow , ? as of course he would do when there was a wheel in repair , ? and he was ordered to go to Mr. Blake with a note , which Arden began to write on one knee where he knelt beside the wheel . Rhoda stood then in the lighted doorway and said it was useless ? that Mr. Blake was away taking stock of his black traders to the north . Since when ? Mr. Arden wanted to know ; and Rhoda knew that ten . As for me , I knew that the day was growing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull out on my old tire , patched up by Will Arden ; the sun was rising when I slid out of the clearing into the government road . You know how everything goes wrong once you start late , and I was less than an hour from the station when I had a blow-out . I was on my knees before my kit of tools when Blake came up ? in that stealing way a bicycle has , giving me no warning until I heard him say good-morning . When I looked up , he had dismounted beside me ; his helmet was in his hand . Well , he was terribly disappointed when he saw who I was , and taken aback . Anti-climax is the word , and I can not pretend that this lightning change from illumination to eclipse commended Mr. Blake . It is because I am not young , I thought , or because I ant an American . But . I know now that he took me for Rhoda , not knowing what other white woman would be abroad in that wilderness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Blake did all that could be done for my . mechanical infirmities . And I must still remember with sonic complacency that . we parted without any comment from him on the futility of my profession . You know how they suffer until they have told us how mad we are . Well , I left him still burdened with that repressed desire ; I thought he could work it off on Will Arden ? as doubtless lie had done and would do . More I can not tell you of Mr. Blake , but I have neser been one to wonder how Rhoda could have done as she did . I must always remember the face he showed me when he thought that I was she , and before he withdrew and slammed the door . I suppose that even Bottom must have had some secret for Titania that . Shakespeare himself did not guess ; and Mr. Blake , at worst , was very far from being an ass ? yes , and from a villain . He was a very presentable and well-mannered young man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows . so Well as Rhoda what he may have been at best ? The rest of what I can tell you I got from Rhoda when the Banga people came clown at Easter for the conference . She told me all she could one night , then , and I patched it up out of what she said , and what she did n't say , and of what I know as a rolling stone knows moss . It began , it seems , when Rhoda had been three months at Banga . She imagines that it began with loneliness , but I 'm for vanity . A new dress figured in the prologue : she had put on a new dress from her little reserve store , and there was no comment . When she presented herself , ? like a nosegay , I suppose , in that little bark cabin , ? no one said , How sweet you look ! Mr. Arden , when he looked at her , looked away . Ile was always doing that , Rhoda said ; or nagging her about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone else . Even Mrs. Ward did not look at her ? and this I do n't believe . But it seems that , on this fatal clay and at the noon meal , there was talk of the most impersonal and boresome things . A company of rustics had come in that morning from : Rumba , fifty miles away ; they had brought children for the school , and sick for the hospital , and all their poor thrilling questions about the Things of God . They had devoured all the human interest of the Wards and Will Arden , who came to the table still vibrating with those contacts . As a matter of fact , that little expedition was the initial gesture from the people of the Ngela tribe , and an historic event . There is this to be remembered of Rhoda ? she did not yet know the language , and there was not yet any little trail of friendly intercourse from the door of her own heart to the humble hearts about her . And on this day , so full of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass her ; she sulked , with tears in her turquoise eyes . I do assure you that such hours are remembered by all of us : we wake from a warns dream when home seemed near , to find ourselves lost and forsaken in such a dark forest as we had not imagined . It ; is like Dante on the verge of his gloomy wood , and high time for Virgil to come to the rescue . Ca n't you see old Minkoe Ntem cast for Virgil ? I give you my word I have seen her its that role : that old black woman took me by the hand and led use out of the wilderness into the open clearing of my career . And so did someone , black or white , do for one and the other of us , coining along in the nick of time . Well , as I take it , here was Rhoda at midnight , and all the rest of them engaging themselves at highs noon with the personal affairs of the scum of Rumba . There is this difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your heart is not here . Obviously her only friend was herself -- otherwise the world was strange . She cried before she went out that day . And that was the day she made friends with Mr. Blake . She was on the path that runs east from Banga , ? in those days she was going about in the villages learning the language and the people , ? and he was coming back from one of his inland trips . He got off his wheel and walked with her a bit . He said that she had on a pretty frock ; that it did a chap 's heart good to see the like in this forlorn country . He told her how lonely hr was , and that this was his first term out , and , so help him , his last . Quito different it was , he said , to what a man would think before he had seen it for himself . He was one of five sons ; the Old Chap was a doctor in the suburbs of Manchester . His mother was keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his line . Missions were all right , he supposed , for middle-aged people who were done with the pleasures of life ; but he joist could n't feel it right that a person like herself should be buried in this last ditch . They spoke of home and of home-going he was to go home in six months , Well , never again for him ! And for me , ' she said , ' always again forever ! ' A missionary was like that . she told him ; they always came back . Was it a vow , he wanted to know : and she told bins ? not exactly a vow . and that they seemed to like it . Good Lord ! ' he said . This was their first meeting , and she went home with that lighted face that I remember from the steamer . After this they met often . For her sake he used to come to the Wards ' cabin of an evening , when they all sat together about the lamp on the table . and the many moths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was not screened in those days , and there was good hunting for Will Arden , who was an amateur of moths . Neither Blake nor Rhoda had much comfort of these visits ? the Wards were friendly enough , but Blake did not like them . I suppose he thought there must be something morbid in people who came out to the West Coast on such an errand . Better times were meetings by the way , when they could speak of ? well , there is no very accurate record of those conversations ; we do n't need it . She liked him , and she missed him when he would be off hunting ivories under the bamboo beds of the inland villages . She knew to a day when he would return from these expeditions . For him she dressed her prettiest and brushed her bright hair ? as she would have done for the Wards or for Will Arden , had they been any sort of reflectors . But no , it seems that they were not reflectors . It was just as if , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . More then than at any time , but always a little . Will Arden and she were in the school together ; he sat at one end of the shadow tinder that great thatch and she was busy at the other . There they were , day after day , the two white people among those three or four hundred young brown bodies . ' Everyone there thought her a wonder except Will Arden ! I suppose she looked at him twenty times for his once ; and when she did meet his eye , there was a shadow on him . And he had a way about him when he helped her ? it seems he often helped her ? that just took the joy out of life . At this point I said to Rhoda , murmuring beside me on her cot , that I thought this strange ; Will Arden had seemed to me , when I worked with him in any time , to be a very genial and responsive sort of person . That was another thing , she told me , that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel lonely : that night in July , when I had slept at the station , Will Arden had been so friendly with me , using all the time his nicest voice that he never used for her , no matter how hard she tried to please hint . She could n't forgive him for his harshness ; she thought about it all the next day ; and when she thought , she cried . She was crying on the path when Mr. Blake met her ? came up behind her on his wheel in his classic fashion , and caught her , I suppose , just as he had caught me . And that was the time he kissed her . I ask myself , with Rhoda in mind , if there was not cause . From her rather slim account of this event , I gather that there was comfort in it . It was the Kiss Consoling . I make out , without too much help from Rhoda , that he gave that poor dejected child the comfort of a restrained and tender devotion . She does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never do so , for she speeds up just here to the presentation of her apologia . That kindness against which she leaned in her afternoon hour of bitterness and self-pity has gone down the river , as the Pala people say . He had this to offer ? that she must go home with him when he should go ; that the Coast was no place for a soft little girl like herself ; that his mother would be glad of such a darling as she was ? and a missionary , too ! And how easy it would be ? they could be married at the beach and that would be easy , would n't it ? Easy ! It is evident that our young Blake had never been married in the Colony , and neither had Rhoda . However , these were not the difficult ies that presented themselves to Rhoda , who said site could n't think of such a thing . Missionaries never did such things , she told him . They would all reproach her . In her imagination , the reproaches of Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , Mr. Blake could not fathom these missionary reproaches ? for him they were without . form and void . A girl , he said , had a right to marry whom she pleased ; and while he knew only too well how far from good enough he was , surely she would be better off at home with him than ever she could be , living with saints in t he jungle . Well , she would n't hear to it . You can think if this was the end of his urging . Every time they met after that there was the same palaver . Rhoda 's memory is full of her misery at this time ; but . I seem to see that pale man waiting in the green gloom of one and another forest trail , until that young creature should join him to discuss the things of love and of loneliness ? and to withdraw . He could n't bear to go home when the time came ; but there were his duties to his chief at the beach factory , and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said good-bye , he begging to the last and making her kiss him because it was good-bye , and telling her that he would be back in six months . She would be ready for hint then , he knew . It rained on them or they would be saying good-bye still , suppose . This would have been the end of it , says Rhoda , if it had not been for Will Arden . He looked at her that night with cold eyes , asking her did she feel feverish , and when had she last taken her quinine . Because site told him that she did better without her quinine , and would never be taking it again , ? I hope you get the full flavor of this outrageous sauce , ? he excused himself from the table . Yes ? actually ? one as bad as t he other . I suppose she must have needed her quinine dreadfully , for she lay awake all night , brooding . Not so much about poor Blake , ? who was eating his heart out in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arden , his harshness and other vices . And by morning she was ready for action . You know the stored dynamics that result from such a night . It seems that she had a habit of going east to Tyanga , where she would spend a night or two among the women of that neighborhood . Mrs. Ward supposed that she was going that way , and there was no one else to ask her a quest ion . She just made up two loads , gave them to two boys , ordered them off to Tyanga , and started west on her wheel . She was so full of the pleasure of not saying good-bye to Will Arden , that she never gave a thought to the Wards . And when I think of Mrs. Ward , I ca n't forgive her . She knew where Blake was to camp t hat night ; she had to push to make for he had three hours ' start of her . Do n't ask me what she was thinking all that day ; riding like that , I suppose she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it rained ? the brother of yesterday 's rain , as the Pala people say . The Mboto River rose ; there was no one at the bank to ferry her across , but the raft was there . She put her wheel aboard that crazy old log-craft , and pulled herself across by the rattan cable . She must have been pretty well frightened when she came to the mad middle of the river ; and once across , there was no question of going back ? if indeed the thought of return canoe to mind . When she passed through the villages , women ran out to greet her ; but she did not stop for that , or to eat her lunch , or at all , until afternoon was going down . So she says . I suppose that site could not face the inner ques. tion , so she just kept moving . When she mute to the foot of the Bitandi hills , Blake met her . He was strolling on that lovely bit of trail between Bitandi village and the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was out for a saunter , there being nothing else to do after the journey and in such villages . And there she was ! She was too faint , she says , to speak . He made her lie beside the path on his jacket , while he ran back to his tent in the village for bread and tea . He fed her . Rhoda says that he was very sweet to her . There was nothing in that hour to trouble her remembrance in the telling . He took her to the village of Bitandi , where his tent was pitched . He had his cot brought out into the last daylight , and she lay there , looking up at the early-pricking stars , while he oversaw he evening meal . The fire was laid in the clearing ; the good odor of wood-smoke and of bacon was abroad ; the infinite quiet of the wilderness fell upon them like dew . Rhoda relaxed : she melted to the delicious calm of an appeased fatigue . Presently they ate together , sitting cross-legged on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very happy . This is her only coherent connnent on that hour . I wonder what was the complexion of his happiness ? ens he full of jests , as some happy people are , or was he tender ? or did he rave about their future ? How did he express that new man she had released when she appeared , ever so still , on the trail ? But no , she will not say , and I am never to know . And I suppose she sat there , pale and weary , for his solicitude and his love to play about . I suppose , if he jested , she smiled ever so little ; and S he was tender , she was ever so little withdrawn ; and if he spoke of their future , she warned him by a shadow , ever so faint , in those confiding eyes . The villagers sat about on the rim of the light of the lantern ? be sure of that . There was a flashing of bright eyes and the white teeth of laughter in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white woman 's hair , and t he beauty and the wealth of white people . No question marred this approval ? he was known and she was known , and their companionship ills a custom of their tribe . ' White people , they do so . It is the trader and the Mission girl . She has come to tell as the word of God . Presently she will do so , it is her custom . We visited her in her village , begging her to visit us . in our village , and she agreed , saying that when the season was dry , she would visit us . And tell us the word of God . ' Blake told her that he would sleep in Malinga 's village , turning that old rascal out of his palaver house . He was all for going early to bed . Rhoda , I infer , wanted anything but to be alone . Consider how impeccable must have been the conduct that so comforted her in his presence . She went with him to the shadow where the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest , he kissed her , making many promises . Rhoda is evasive at this point ; her memories make her restive . I think he was then at his best , and that she gave him a happy moment . She went back to his tent and sat in his camp-chair before it . His lantern on the ground made its unwavering ring of white man 's light . From the huddle of lost huts about her came the odor of wood-fires . She thought that she was now to be alone , and she felt the first lapping of the tide of self-knowledge . How can we know what she felt when she sensed the incoming of that tide . And then the women began to gather about her , bringing their little stools and their bits of firewood to . sit on . They looked at her with their glancing eyes , bright above the brightness of their brass collars . Their brown bodies and their beaded head-dresses gave off the odor of smoke . They began to speak to her in their gentlest voices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tender , spoke to her in the accent they reserve for children . They begged her ? you know how Willer ! do ? for five words of the word of God . And she , because she has a real flair for her profession , gave them what they asked . ' I always did love , ' says Rhoda , to talk with the women . ' And there they were talking about these things , when there came in to the clearing a little group of travelers . These were beach-people on a journey . They stopped of course to see the white woman , and they stood at ease regardhtg her . They spoke to her in the beach English that was strange to Rhoda 's ear ? not pleasant . One of them had a child asleep in a sling at her side ; this was a pretty woman , Rhoda says , looking very fine in her bright cloth that was tightened under her arms . She wore a handkerchief about her head . She looked at Rhoda with a laughing curiosity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man live ? He live for bush ? Where you pickanniny live ? You never born proper pickaninny ? You wait , I fit for show you proper piekaninny , ? fine too much ! ' She gave the baby a little hitch N. ith her shoulder , which brought the sleeping head into the light . It was a beautiful half-white child . Rhoda observed this with a pang . She was not accustomed to half-white children ; there were none in this part of the forest . She looked hard at the baby , and the mother looked hard at Rhoda . It was a white man 's child , she told her , with that pride you know ; and she lifted the baby out of the deer-skin sling ; she held the little golden body out to Rhoda . Rhoda drew back . White babies she ! mew , and black babies she knew ; but poor Rhoda , she was afraid of that little yellow baby . There he hung between his mother 's hands , and drew up his sweet little knees , beating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child of the trader that is at Banga now ; I was with him before he went inland . ' Rhoda , telling me of this , trembled en her cot beside me ; I felt her body tremble with the memory of this moment . IV Well , there you arc . You must imagine it for yourself . It is to be remembered of Rhoda that she was young . The thoughts that swept her poured out of the narrow gorge of a girl 's experience ; they were forced by that narrowness into a raging torrent . What did Rhoda know to temper that fury of shame ? There she sat in the canvas chair before the tent , with the baby hanging like a yellow fruit from those brown outstretched arms . Not for long , surely . Presently the women were gone . She sat alone by the lantern . She does not know what time it was . I want you to know that this was a perfectly endless night . The moon rose , and there she was in the clearing between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . And all this time she was cold and she was frightened . Poor Rhoda ? she was afraid of that man who had kissed her so tenderly , ages ago , where the little path goes out into the forest darkness . She sat forever , suffering fear , and shame . When the moon rose and she saw herself sitting there in that moonlit clearing , her fears took a sudden body . She watched the outlet of the forest trail with a cruel apprehension ? suppose he were to appear there ? suppose that ! She saw him emerge ? a stranger . A wicked stranger . This is what I make of her account of that deadly fear : he would come to her , and he would not come in the guise of the man who had fed her and harmed her and sent her to bed ; she could not think how he would come , but surely as a stranger , and wicked . So she sat and faced the east and the mounting moon , trembling . Presently , within , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she must move ? get out of that ? get home . And by home she was meaning the little cabin where she lived with the Wards . It should now be the middle of the night ; not a soul was abroad in that little clearing . She took the lantern from the ground , and she put her helmet on her head . There could be no question of her wheel in the dark . When she moved , she had to check her wish to run until she felt the dark of the trail about her ; and then she knew she must pass through ' Malinga 's village , where Blake was sleeping , and she was afraid to do this . She trembled at the opening of that clearing for a long time , wishing that she knew the secret ways behind the cluster of bark huts . One but was open to the night ? that would be the place where Blake was sleeping . And was he sleeping ? How to pass that open door ! She could not stand forever there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and her chance . Softly in her little canvas shoes she ventured into the moonlight ; neither man nor clog stirred ; in that little hamlet this one creature stirred , stealing ever so gently , her lantern at her knee , until she had passed Blake 's door ? and then she fled . Once in the forest again , she was quite calm . She leaned against a tree , quieting her heart with deep breaths . She was not at all afraid of snakes orleopards or elephants or gorillas or any of those likely things ? she never gave t hem a thought . She was just utterly at home and safe in the forest . She moved on at the heart of her globe of light ? the incredible green of the forest revealed in diameter about her . In her heart she embraced what she saw . The forest was for that hour her element ; tears of easement fell with as little strain as the forest dew . The little trail , and the deeps above it , were kind to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , she sat down on a bit of the firewood , drawing the logs together and warming her hands at that flame . She thought just nothing at all of the makers of that fire ? who they might have been , or were they near or far . She was wishing for a bite to eat ? even a stick of cassava bread , she was thinking , half-asleep over her fire . And then she saw the lantern . There was of course only one white man in the world for that poor child , and whether he came from east or west , he would be Blake ? ten lanterns shining in the dark of that forest would just have been ten Makes , and she a hunted hare at the heart of the circumference . With her shaken light in hand , she broke off into the hush . I can not think she ran about in that tangle for long ? how could she have ? With her lantern to betray her ! But she hit the immemorial mould of the forest more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , before Arden , his lantern in pursuit of hers , closed upon her . He did not speak ; he was horrorstruck by her horror of him . She beat him off , but he held her till she sank against him and her lids slid over the terror of her eyes . There were the two of them , lantern by lantern , the golden glow shattered by the close forest-shadows . He got her hack to the path when her little fire was , and her helmet fallen beside it . He was very sweet to her , smoothing her bright scattered hair , drawing the leaves and the moss out of it . He was like a mother , Rhoda says , and that was what Rhoda needed . She cried and cried , telling him everything she knew or had felt of loneliness . And about Blake ? hiding nothing of her agonies of shame . You could never believe , Rhoda says of Arden , how different he was from what he had been . And all he said to her then was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying always the right thing in the pauses of her tale . He had come to find her ho said , when he heard that her carriers had gone cast while she had gone west . They spoke presently of lesser things ; she began to be drowsy . A pallor came among the trees , and that was the dawn . Arden said that he must see Blake ; Rhoda says that he seemed to feel that she should see him , too . Arden said , ' Surely be loves you . ' But Rhoda could n't bear that she was agitated again , I suppose , and cried until Arden let her off . He left her there by the fire and his lantern , that was paler in the dawn ; Blake 's lantern he took with him . She slept on Arden 's coat . Do n't ask me about driver-ants , or snakes , or anyof the common menaces that should have kept her awake . She did not wake until Arden spoke to her again , He was kneeling there beside her with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup was Blake 's , and the coffee was hot from Blake 's thermos bottle . She remembers that it was good . and that there was a rain of sunlight through the green leaves , and a butterfly , ever so burnished , near and nearer . Arden said they might go home ? that he had said good-bye to Blake . So they went home , says Rhoda . She slept most of that day in a village west of the Mboto River , on a bed of leaves in the but of a Christian woman . There was good food there , out of the kettles of that village ? wonderful mushroom soup . And Arden was quite too - wonderful ; you see here the cant of the quite-too-wonderful Arden whom Rhoda has married . Well , there it is , as much as she knows of it . I do n't know how murk Mrs. Ward knew of it , or knows ; I rust her to be dumb . Arden , I should think , knows as much as man can know . And Rhoda still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a little silver cup with a wooden rim : that was his .
