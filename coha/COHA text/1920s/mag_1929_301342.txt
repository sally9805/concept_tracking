BOLIVIA-PARAGUAY <P> Wrathful charges and irate denials continued to characterize the warlike relations of Bolivia and Paraguay , last week , despite the fact that both Governments had declared a truce ( TIME , Dec. 31 ) and accepted mediation by the Pan-American Parley at Washington . President Jos P. Guggiari of Paraguay ( a Swiss by birth ) observed that " Bolivia has always been greedy . " He specifically charged in a cable to the U.S. State Department that , last week , Bolivian troops were still advancing into Paraguayan territory . Intimations from President Hernando Siles of Bolivia were in the sense that this charge was a dastardly lie . <P> Meanwhile officials of the Pan-American Parley cabled to both Governments for acceptance or comment upon the text of a protocol which , if signed between them , would set up an arbitral board to investigate the original clash between Bolivian and Paraguayan troops in the disputed region called Gran Chaco ( TIME , Dec. 24 ) . <P> First to reply was Dr. Juan Y. Ramirez , Charge d'Affaires at the Paraguayan legation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditional upon the insertion of certain slight changes , to be made known in the event of a meeting of the involved parties .
