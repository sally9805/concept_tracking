txt Although President CoomDGE is anxious to have General WOOD return to the Philippines as Governor General , it now seems almost certain that the General will decide to turn over his office to a successor . Almost seven years of uninterrupted service in the tropics , coupled with two serious operations and the shock of an automobile accident , have made it imperative for him to take a long rest in order to regain health . General WOOD 'S enormous vitality offset the handicap of advancing years . But when to the debilitating influence of the climate is added the ceaseless strain of carrying out the administrative tasks of his office with too few assistants . in the face of constant opposition from the people whom he was sent out to help , it is obvious that the Governor General deserves a respite . It our country properly provided for those who have served it with signal distinction , he would be able to retire with the certainty of finishing his life in comfort . One of the reasons why the Presdent has been particularly anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in complete accord with the Governor 's policies . The work of reconstruction which has fallen to General WooD has been most difficult . It has been made effective largely through his thorough knowledge of Filipino charac- ter and his deep sympathy for the Filipino people . That work is not finished . To carry it through requires a man of General WOOD 'S type , infinitely patient , unfailingly courteous , politely firm and thoroughly versed in the knowledge how to deal with alien races . Such a man is almost impossible to find . If the President were to choose as General WOOD 'S successor a man of ordinary political training , without experience in the Far East , it is to be hoped that he would take the occasion to reaffirm the principles which he has already stated about our relations with the Philippines , and to make it clear beyond any doubt that he expects the new Governor to finish the work now in hand . Inevitably the resignation of General WOOD would be hailed by the Filipino politicians who have fought him as a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor for their own ends and will try to force concessions from him which they had not been able to obtain from General WOOD . One of the difficulties experienced by all Governors of the Philippines has been the lack of a clear-cut policy forcefully upheld by the Administration in Washington . President COOLIDGE has done more than any of his predecessors to remove this handicap , and has shown that he understands the need of plain speaking . If General WOOD does not return to the Philippines , he will still be able to do much to help the people of those islands by telling his countrymen more about them and their problems . He knows them as do few Americans . Furthermore , he can speak with the authority of one who has had extended experience as a colonial administrator . America 's task in the Philippines is not yet completed . It is beset with many pitfalls . In enlightening his countrymen about these problems General WOOD will be serving both Americans and Filipinos .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
