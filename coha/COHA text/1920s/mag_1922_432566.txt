A LETTER is sometimes very real , very personal ? a living thing , that wheedles , cajoles , interests , charms , lures one 's thoughts from daily concerns and projects , creating a little life of its own . I received one of this sort from Winnetka , Illinois , years ago ; and after answering my correspondent 's questions , I coukl not keep myself from complimenting him 011 his script , telling him it was like Poe 's and Mallarme 's , natural and free from affectation ; whereas Francois Coppee 's merely mocked the fourteenth century . So I wrote ; for 1 always find it hard to raise up one man without pulling clown another ; and after posting my letter to Mr. Husband , I often caught myself wondering what manner of man he might be : young or old ( his letter read like the letter of a young man ) , rich or poor , I asked , firm of purpose , or likely to be led away ? This last question begetting a scruple lest a casual phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerith on vellum by him would be a beautiful thing in any man 's library and , later , a nation 's possession ? should beguile him from his own tasks and bring a weighty parcel to 121 Ebury Street . I dipped my pen in the ink ; but , before writing a word , it began to seem ungracious to tell Mr. Husband that my letter of the eighth implied no more than a visionary admiration of a script . So I reached out for a telegraph form and wrote : Pay no heed to mine of the eighth . But will not this telegram give undue importance to a remark 310that he will accept as casual and unimportant if I refrain ? I asked . And clay after clay doubts continued to gather ; many specious phrases tempted me , but withal I kept my hand from paper ; and at last a letter arrived from Winnetka , which I read eagerly for a reference to the transcription of The Brook Kerith ; and finding none , it behooved me to judge Mr. Husband as a clever man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casual from the pertinent . Again I drew a sheet of letter-paper toward me , this time with a view to putting a number of questions to Mr. Husband about himself : was he a professional writer ? had he published any books ? and if he had , would he be kind enough to send them to me ? The answer I got was that he had written a book telling his experience in the coal mine into which he de scended after taking his degree at Harvard ; and whilst turning over the leaves of the short book that the post had brought , I said : I thought the sting was deep enough in me , but had the alternative been to seek a book five hundred feet under the earth , or not to write one , I should have been bookless . After turning over some more pages telling of the different shifts and the long way a miner has to go before he reaches the seam , I wrote a letter , but keep no faintest memory of it , nor of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote from the coast of Ireland , whither he had gone to hunt German submarines , having enlisted ; and it was not till the other day that I got a letter written from an hotel in Jermyn Street , telling me he was in London for a short holiday , and sent a note to him saying that he would find me home at teatime . At half-past four the same day , t he young stalwart , who , after taking his degree at Harvard , had hewn coal for eight or ten months in one of the deepest mines of Indiana , stepped out of a taxi before the door of HI Ebury Street . I am not far now , I said , from I he knowledge whether his quest in the mine was a literary one , a derivative of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Travels with a Donkey , or ? What else could it be ? A moment after , I found myself the object of the same admiration that Zola used frequently when I called to see him . You will get over all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering into serious conversation it seemed but courteous to express a hope that he had not suffered too much in the crossing . But a man who has prowled the Irish coast in winter in an American torpedo-boat does not stiffer from seasickness , and the topic was dropped for a more homely question : When did you arrive in London ? Mr. Husband answered : This morning . His first act was , therefore , to write to me , whereat I felt complimented ; and on my inquiring how he had spent his hours , he told me that he had spent them seeking the church in which Pepys was baptized . It lies behind Mark Lane , he said . Near the Tower , I interjected . I do n't know where the Tower is , he replied ; I have n't yet been there . The taxi took me round by the British Museum ? Ah , I thought the taxi that stopped at my door looked a little tired ! But you found the Church ? He answered that he had ; and I heard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bracket , and looks clown upon the pew in which the diarist and his wife used to sit . You have imagined a great many things , Mr. Husband was kind enough to say , but I doubt if even you can imagine how much it means to me to come to a city that I have heard of all my life . All the books I have read , at least three quarters of them , were about London , or written in London ; and here I am in London , with a fortnight before me to see as much of it as I can in the time . You will show me your pictures , I hope ? We walked round the dining-room , and went upstairs to the drawing-room . Alt ! here is the Aubusson carpet , he said . At first , the drift of his remark escaped me ; but a moment after , I remembered that I had introduced the carpet into different books ; and having spoken of Monet and Monet , we returned to the dining-room , to talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had outstayed his welcome , whereupon I begged him not to think that this was so ; and he stayed for another half-hour , talking so well that I forgot the coal mine , and it was not till he stood on my threshold that I remembered it . Mr. Husband , I have often wished to ask you , ? it seemed unseemly to put the question in a letter , but face to face , ? why did you go down into a mine to hew coal for ten months ? I had learnt all I could learn out of books at Harvard , he answered , and I felt that books did not seem to bring me nearer to life . If I had lived in Europe , I should very likely have gone to Paris , as you did ; but being in America , there was nothing else for me to do but go down into a coal mine . An excellent answer this seemed to me to be , and after watching him from my doorstep , I returned to my study to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have given a better answer , better than any I discovered in all my meditations , for it profits a man but little to have read all the books in the world if he miss life . But he has not missed it ; he finds it wherever he goes ; and I caught glimpses in my thoughts of Mr. Husband visiting Westminster Abbey , St. Paul 's Cathedral , the Tower of London , walking in a dream and dreaming as he walked ; and not a little curious to know how London struck him , I wrote , asking hint to dinner ; an invitation that he accepted . You have had a week of sight-seeing , I said , and I hope London has not disappointed you . Only in two things , he answered . And what has disappointed you ? I was disappointed , he replied , in the Elgin marbles and in Sickert 's portrait of you in the Tate Gallery . This strange association of images ? the Theseus on one hand and Mr. Sickert 's portrait on the other ? took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , doubtless , that whereas Assyrian and Babylonian sculpture represented oriental despotism , the Greeks had ? Before I could bring my commonplace apology to a close , however , Mr. Husband interjected : ? But Mr. Sickert 's portrait misses you altogether . If a portrait is not like the sitter , it is not a portrait . The quality of Sickert 's painting , I said , occasionally rivals that of Manet ; but he is not primarily a portrait-painter inasmuch ? A portrait that misses the sitter . Mr. Husband interposed ; raising my voice a little , I insisted upon being heard : though Ingres 's portraits are often very like his sitters , the absence of what is known in the studios as quality causes us to turn away from them with a feeling of disappointment , but the quality , or shall I say virtue , of Sickert 's painting always detains me . I think a portrait ought to be like , Mr. Husband muttered , causing use a moment 's annoyance , from which I escaped by changing the subject of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anxious to hear the further adventures of this young man , who was not prevented by his father 's bankruptcy from finishing his University course and taking a degree ; for while learning , he taught , edited books , thrived , and having in ten months tasted all there was of life in a mine , started for Texas and the chasing of cows , to leave this second source of life for a third ? Mrs. Husband . And certain from the knowledge of his character already obtained that he had married his body 's and soul 's desire , I listened to the praises of her for whom he had consented to settle into a profitable business . Your business gives you time to pursue your literary career ? I inquired ; and learnt that he had no fault . to find with his business but one ? it dragged him from his bed at seven in the morning . And nobody enjoys sleep more than I do , said Mr. Husband . Better than sleep , he added , is dozing . To turn over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dream is my wife and my children , he answered . An answer I appreciate , I replied , though I never had a wife . But dozing , lying between sleeping and waking , chasing dreams ? ah , yes , I know what that is . One of the charms of London is that I need n't get out of bed till nine , Mr. Husband muttered , addressing himself to himself rather than to me . And what do you dream when you lie awake in London ? I asked , anxious to learn Mr. Husband as far as was possible in two visits . I dream , said he , that the next world is as pleasant as this one ; and of course , if it is , we need have no fear of death . Another Paul ! said I to myself ; and aloud : 0 death , where is thy victory ? 0 death , where is thy sting ? At which Mr. Husband 's face was overspread with such a genial light of cheerfulness , that he set my thoughts flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of dewy hillsides and a radiant morning , with a young man blowing a fanfare to his comrades , the meaning of which was : Life is a perfect gift , and our duty is to enjoy it ; by doing so we can help others to enjoy . If Mr. Husband had left my thoughts to swarm , an idea of a young man might have fixed itself in me , to flourish in due time . The reader must not , however , draw from these words the conclusion that Mr. Husband had outstayed his welcome , nor can he be blamed for not having read himself into my mind . It were folly to find fault with a guest because he is not a soothsayer ; and as Mr. Husband had come to hear me talk literature , it was but natural that he should break the silence with an inquiry about the book I was writing , and impossible for me to do else titan abandon my dream of him and turn to In Single Strictness , saying that the revised sheets had been returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission this seemed to me to be , and to enliven it , I confessed that , whilst writing this new book , I seemed to myself to be writing something I had never written before , and for that reason believed it to be as good as any of the books I had offered to the public within the last ten years . And so you took pleasure , Mr. Husband said , in writing this last book . Yes , for the reason I have given , and for another reason : I thought it was going to be my last book . But you will always go on writing ? I am afraid I have written too much , and the man who writes many books raises his tombstone . But , I continued , if one does not write , and has lost the art of reading and never acquired that of fishing or of gardening , the hours go by on leaden wings . For you life extends in endless perspective beyond your own life ; but I have nothing to look forward to when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provinces might be given to me to look after ) , or to the learning of French and the senile temptation of writing a book in that language . But the end has not yet come , Mr. Husband , for on opening Impressions and Opinions ? One of your best books , Mr. Husband interjected ; I always take it up with pleas-me . After reading a few pages , I said , thoughts began to gather in me of another book of essays , one that would not be unworthy to offer to nay American readers . And what , asked Mr. Husband , will be the title of your new book ? I answered that I was thinking of calling it A Parley , or Parleys and Opinions , or perhaps Conversations in Ebury Street . And its character ? he inquired . I shall try to make it more like Avowals ? sets of conversations between me and my friends . But you will not omit the article about Balzac ? Not altogether , I answered . But the original article begins by comparing The Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a traveler standing on the crest of the hill . I once liked that opening , said Mr. Husband . I doubt if you would like it if you were to read it again , I answered ; and he asked me if I had another opening in my mind . I replied that I had , saying : A line of Matthew Arnold has given me the clue ; but not the line about seeing life steadily and seeing it whole . And to explain my aversion towards the aphorism , I recalled to his memory John Eglinton , one of the stalwarts who still walks daily from Terenure to the National Library , determined that , come what may , he will not fail in his duty to see life steadily and to set it whole . We debated this phrase beloved of journalists , till I began to feel that the evening was passing away , and to remove thoughts of the clock on the mantelpiece from my guest 's mind , I returned for his sake to Arnold , who , after all , is literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , headed by John Eglinton , astray . Two things , he says somewhere , are required for a work of art ; the man and the moment ; and if Arnold 's words be true , and the moment be necessary , it seems to me not at all unlikely that we have seen the end of art in Europe . And you will answer me ? I will venture to suggest , I ? ) , guest interposed , that the moment Arnold deems requisite will occur again . It does not seem to me likely , I replied , that the moment which called The Human Comedy into being will be repeated . Everything is repetition , but in distant time . The sun brings back the mallows in the garden , and they live again and spring in another year ; but we , the great and mighty , or wise , when once we have died , in hollow earth we sleep , gone down into silence ; a right long , and endless , and unawakening sleep . I am prepared to admit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , with all that is in it , great and little , returns after attaining unity , to spread itself out once more into sidereal systems billions of years hence . But our minds are too feeble to comprehend a billion years ; and maybe a billion billion years would be needed for the accomplishment of Edgar Poe 's poetic prediction . From Poe we returned to Balzae . Balzac was a man of the Napoleonic period , I said , and you will admit that many centuries will he needed to bring back the antique world to us . It was not until after the Battle of Waterloo that the antique world slipped forever behind us ; and to apprehend the dis-tance we have traversed since then , we need only to go to Portsmouth and look at Nelson 's battleship ; or , if she has been thrown to the ship-breakers , at a picture of her . Her mast and yards will tell us that she is of the kin of the ancient galley . Whereas a dreadnought ? I will not labor the point . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man remains the same . His instincts are the same , no doubt , I replied , but his beliefs in good and evil presences are different in every century ; and who shall say that with the death of superstition ? But is superstition dead ? my guest asked me , And I answered that the superstitions that peopled the woods with Sileni and fauns , that gave Neptune to the sea and Zeus to the skies , were a more spiritual influence than our superstitions ? never to sit down thirteen to dinner , and to be sure to turn round three times if you see two magpies . And on these words we returned from theology to earth , myself holding forth , as it was my duty to do , since Mr. Husband had come to hear me speak , that art was the first of human instincts . The caveman drew before he began to worship , I said . I know the scientists hold that the caveman did not draw for his pleasure , but for some belief that the animal drawn was potentially dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest to The Golden Bough , and was speaking of the great artistic periods , when Mr. Husband interposed with a question : Have you found a satisfactory definition of art ? Tolstoy , he said , after rejecting many definitions , defined art as a means whereby a man communicates his sensations to another man . Tolstoy , I answered , was unmsthetic , and the average man reads his own justification in ? Which do you place highest , Mr. Husband asked , War and Peace , or Anna . Karenina ? I answered that a reply would lead me far away from the first chapter of my new book . And you know , Mr. Husband , I said , you asked nic to tell it to you . Mr. Husband acq uiesced . We must not , however , leave Tolstoy too quickly , I continued ; he is too great a man to be dismissed . A phrase often met in contemporary criticism is dirt a man can be judged only by his best works ; all the same , it may be contended that it'inan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little variation , the inspiration of the truly great man being always by him . Few would come out of such a judgment unscathed , but ' Folstoy would be sent to the galleys by a jury of : esthetes for Sebastopol ; for in it he is eye and nothing but eye ? an eye that sees everything and records everything , with the unvarying monotony of a. cinematograph . If this terrible old man , after compiling many extravagant books on the indissolubility of marriage , had not run away from his wife and died in a railway station at the age of eighty-two , he would have been able to add to his long list of eccentricities another : a solemn declaration yelled from the Steppes , of course , that whereas Angelo or Donatello lied , the cinematograph tells the truth . But being without the iesthetic sense , Mr. Husband interposed , his definition of art is as unacceptable as the definitions he disregarded . So it seems to me to be , I answered ; and seeing that my guest was waiting for my definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulae whereby man interprets Nature . And man , I continued , being isolated in different communities for several thousand years after the birth of civilization , was able to invent many formulae . Now and then a seed came from overseas , and in .0 new soil and in a different climate a new flowerage began . Latin literature is derived from the Greek ; it is said that Roman statues were the work of Greek sculptors ? which may be true ; who shall say ? Be this as it may , it is certain that , in the third or the fourth century , art vanished from the earth , sonic theorists giving as a reason the descent of northern barbarians into Italy , others contending that to have art there must be long periods without art . What concerns us is not the reasons for the disappearance of art from the world , but the fact that it did disappear in the third century ? not to reappear again for nearly a thousand years . May not history repeat itself ? Mr. Husband asked . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ; and it would have been strange if art had not returned , the circumstance of the thirteenth century not differing very wieldy from the fourth . A Christian world not differing very widely from a pagan , Mr. Husband interposed . The mediaval world was hardly larger than the ancient world , I replied , only portions of the planet being known to men . But today we are without gods , and the world is no bigger than a bandbox ; every man is looking over the next man 's shoulder , and a portrait painted in Christiania is indistinguishable from a portrait in Lima . The circumstances of the antique world and the modern were , till a hundred years ago , practically the same . We lived till 1850 in isolated communities ; every town had a society , customs , and dialect of its own . Till 1850 many languages were spoken in these islands . I remember the humming of looms in the village street , housewives spinning at cottage doors ; and at the end of a passage in my house in Mayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteehth century ; the precise date I can not vouch for , but it is certain that a grandfather-clock has not been made in Castlebar since 1810 . It was about that time that beer ceased to be made at Moore Hall ; the brew-house still existed in my childhood , but we got our beer from Ballinrobe ; now the beer comes to 13aWino be from Dublin . Moore Hall was built in 1780 by Mayo builders and carpenters , and few houses in Ireland or England have withstood a hundred years of wear and neglect better than this hale old house , standing on a hill overlooking some ancient island castles . In my childhood , Mayo builders , carpenters , and blacksmiths were little inferior to those who built Moore Hall . I remember one of Mayo 's carpenters designing and making a handsome wardrobe ; he could not read or write , but it may be doubted if Mayo 's newspaper-reading peasantry could show so excellent a craftsman ; and of this I am sure , that Mayo is a drearier county , for landlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the first half of the nineteenth . I looked inquiringly across the hearthrug , afraid lest this big-framed , even-complexioned , blue-eyed , dark-haired young American , who sat in the armchair opposite to me , was wearying of my discourse . I am not given to holding forth like my friend W. B. Yeats , and I beg the reader to believe me when I say that , if I emulated Yeats on the 27th of March , 1922 , it was because my guest wished it . Yeats does not waste himself on one ; so there is a distinction . And afraid to pursue my theme till it became tedious , I bethought myself of an anecdote whereby I aright enliven it for hint ; wherefore I related that some twelve or fifteen years ago I went to call on Sir William ( then simple ) Orpen , who came to Dublin every six months to teach drawing in the Metropolitan School of Art . Thestudios in which I was invited to seek him seemed strangely crowded for a country whose chief ambition is the priesthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the clerical appearance of the students caught my eye , and I began to ask myself if Ireland had turned from theology to sculpture , for the greater number were producing faint resemblances to pears and apples with wet clay . My wonderment was interrupted by Orpen malting his way through the serried ranks , his smile telling me as he came that he guessed the reason of my astonishment . But , said I , whence come all these people to learn modeling ? There must be fifty or sixty here . ? From all parts of Ireland , he answered . And the money that brings them to Dublin ? whence comes it ? ? They do n't pay to come here ; they are paid to come . And what do they come here for ? To get diplomas , he replied , that will allow them to teach . ? So men come here not to study art , but to learn to teach art , I said . The teacher has to be taught ! ? Yes , Ile said ; and it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students dress like clerics . They come from Christian Brothers ' schools , Orpen answered . But what conception , I said , can the people who invented this system have of art ? ? You must ask your friend , Mr. T. P. Gill , about that , Or-pen replied . And I heard that a Metropolitan School of Art has been set up in every large town ; for , according to the newest principles , everybody must get his chance whether he wants it or not . To admit , Orpen continued , that one man brings a gift into the world and that the next man does not , would amount to an admission that the Liberal Party can not rectify Nature 's mistakes . What would become of democracy if such a thing were admitted ? I ant amazed , I said , for I did n't suspect imbecility in the average man . The average man is not imbecile , said Orpen , but principals are . The Minister of Education would admit that genius can not be produced artificially , but his contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is his business to look after mediocrity . He might even say : Let us create an atmosphere . Wonderful , thrice wonderful ! I replied ; and began a story that I had from my friend ' Tonics , the Slade Professor , of how an artist was treated by Mr. Fisher , or his department . The man was an artist ? he had gained his living by painting ; but after the war he fell into difficult circumstances , and applied for the post of teacher at a provincial school ; mind you , he was an artist who had gained his living by painting . The headmaster of the school at which he wished to teach had seen his paintings in various exhibitions , and the artist thought that all was settled . But when he interviewed Mr. Fisher , or his department , I know not which , he was told : Yes , your pictures are well enough , ? we have photographs of them before us , ? but you must go to Kensington and go through a course of pedagogy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard the word . Tonks explained it to me , and I answered : Well then , if a school were started to teach young ladies how to write novels , and I applied for the post , I should have to learn how I was to teach them to write novels ? Most undoubtedly you would ! That is the Fisher formula . Mr. Fisher , I continued , will admit that his system is not perfect ; he hopes , of course , to improve it as time goes on ; others will say that we are pursuing a false system of teaching , but nobody will admit that all teaching is futile , ? worse than futile , poisonous , ? and that the poison will continue generation after generation , until there is no handicraft and no art worth speaking of left in England . So you see , Mr. Husband , we are without hope of a Renaissance of illiteracy . It would seem that every epoch is represented by a word , the thirteenth by filioque , the Napoleonic Empire by organization , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would welcome a reversion to theology . The arts flourished in it , and , if certain questions were not asked , men and women were left to their instincts . You think , said my guest , that man has not advanced in intelligence ? But you do not think so , Mr. Husband ; nor does anybody but those without knowledge of the world 's history ? 1 he history of Greece , for example . Mr. Fisher knows that forcible education was not the law of Athens , and that wisdom thrived without it ; and if he believes in detaining young folk at school till they arc sixteen , and brings down Wranglers from Cambridge and Firsts from Oxford to teach them , it is because he does not ! mow how life is made , or because his belief in forcible education springs from money . Money hides from learned men many things that the poor know well , and every workman knows that a boy released from school when he is fourteen is set upon learning a trade ; but if he be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes part of the vagrant class . At sixteen , a boy begins to look round , to think ; and seeing that there is no future for him in ploughing , mowing , carting hay , and reaping corn , or following a flock , he hesitates to return whence he came . If he be a town lad , the plumbing trade does not entice him ; the slater 's still less , for , if the sewers are deep , the roofs are high ; and if you press him ; saying : Well , if you do n't enter a trade , how do you hope to get a living ? Live on the old man , I A CONVERSATION IN EBURY STREET expect , is the answer you will get . NOW the new laws allow boys to be kept at school till they are sixteen ; but they permit exceptional boys to be detained till they are eighteen , the exceptional boy , in the eyes of the schoolmaster , being the boy who passes examinations . At one moment of my life , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acquaintances who had taken Firsts at Oxford ; and looking back upon them now , they seem a very sorry squad , indeed . Some lived upon their relations ; some had small incomes , from two hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds a year , and struggled to make two ends meet in furnished apartments ; some turned to journalism , and wrote paragraphs and turn-overs for the Globe newspaper ; scone drifted into the Times office ; others into chambers in the Temple , glad to accept what are known as soaps at tine Old Bailey . It was not that these men canto into the world stupid : as boys they were intelligent enough ; but the effort to acquire knowledge for the honor of a First poisoned their minds . Education , said Mr. Husband , must conic from within , not from without . In response , I answered , to an instinctive prompting . All education of value , Mr. Husband continued , is self-education ; that is my experience . I regretted afterward not having listened instead of recording my own experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe , and I said : Our concern is not with the men who go to universities and wear their brains away in learning things tinny do not want to learn , for the sake of their parents , who would like to say : Johnny took a First . At Oxford a few mental wrecks do n't matter making of round pegs for squareholes , Mr. Husband chinned in , and I answered : Yet it should be clear to everybody Ito gives five minutes thought to the question that the destiny of the great majority of mankind is to dig the field . Ant everlasting law that no Government can change , said Mr. Husband , and I replied : The country goes to the town , but the town never returns to the country . I often wonder if Mr. Fisher , on awakening from his educational dreams , asks himself how the world will get its food when the shepherd no longer goes to the fold , lantern in hand , and the ploughman to the stable . It is hard to think that he ponders his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the explanation that he is a Londoner , bred and born , is not enough . He can not have escaped seeing a man hedging and ditching , on his holidays ; but very learned men often have eyes only for print , and are tunable to appreciate the country until they read it in books ; it may be that Mr. Fisher is one of these . If Inc understands what he reads in print , all will be well , said Mr. Husband ; for I can see that you are bent on enlightening hint . I was moved to reprove Mr. Husband for his facetiousness ; but , remembering that he was my guest , I said : Though there be no hedging and ditching in America , Mr. Husband , there are certainly coal mines , and you are perhaps the one educated man in the world wino has hewn coal in a mine five hundred feet deep , of his own free will . So tell me , you who know something of manual labor at firsthand , ? no , I am not purring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible ? I read yesterday in the newspaper , Mr. Husband said , a speech by Mt . Winston Churchill , in which he told that Bolshevism had reduced Russia , the granary of Europe , to a desert where millions are dying of starvation . Bolshevism , he said , will do the same in England if it gets a footing here ; and while Mr. Churchill spoke , Mr. Fisher was making the bed for Lenin . I was about to start again on the words : The law that is over us , when my guest interrupted , and I listened , nothing loath , having already had my fill of words . It may be well for you to hear , said Mr. Husband , ? I hope you do n't mind ? On the contrary , I 1V-plied ; you can illuminate the question whether forced education ? I AI - as going to say , began Mr. Husband ; and then stopped suddenly , as if ashamed at having interrupted me . I waited . I was going to say , he repeated , that Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have not read Aristotle , I answered ? my defective education . A wisdom that has illuminated century after century is not listened to to-day , his ideas being I mated as out of keeping with the progress that has been made since his day . Progress ! I continued , looking into Mr. Husband 's face ; a book might be written indeed about the progress we have made . But , however well written , the hook would fail to open the eyes of the blind century we live in . The worst slavery of all is to be set to perform tasks that are out of our instinct . A hare beating a tambourine in Regent Street is one of the most pathetic of all spectacles . I saw one once and introduced poor puss ? Into Evelyn lopes , said Mr. Husband . Yes ; and now I compare the showman to the Minister of Education , who is daily dragging men and women out of their instincts , out of their nature , out of their genius , creating the worst slavery of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have revealed to INIr . Fisher the fact that the Liberal professions can not absorb everybody . It might , indeed . And so we find ourselves in the midst of doctors who would like to look after a farm , artists of the stuff that sailors are made of , secretaries who detest writing and dream over their machines of washing-up dishes , and shop-girls who wearily stand behind the counter , thinking how happy they would be broom in hand . After a pause , during which Mr. Husband was kind enough to wait for me to collect my thoughts , I said : We have forsworn our hands , and invented machines that do badly the work that the hand slid very well ; and having got so far , we would , by means of enforced education , wipe out original instincts and remake mankind ; for it amounts to as much . Everybody in the Education Office knows that he can not educate himself , but he is convinced that he can educate somebody else . The Liberal belief that everything can be remedied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likefilioqvc , reveals us to ourselves , and , if not for long , we apprehend for a moment , at least , how-pathetic is the race of man . I wonder what Aristotle would think of the modern belief that everybody is a slave who does not go to an office and sit ; on a high stool and keep accounts . I wonder what Aristotle , who thought it quite natural that men should be born slaves , would think of the idea of the office-stool and a fortnight 's holiday . I think I can see him , in any thoughts , looking at the office-stook and after looking at it for some time , his words sound in any ears : But men are shaped differently ; do you not keep different sizes ? I think I can hear Mr. Fisher answer : At present the size does not fit all men ; but we hope that all men will soon begin to fit the stool . A Platonist , surely , Aristotle murmurs . I always dreaded his influence and now find it predominant after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then Aristotle might ask : Enforced education , or enforced slavery ? which ? Why is one meritorious and the other abominable ? All these young men and women do not want education ; they hate it . tIE , yes , said Mr. Husband , interrupting my dream . There are many among the young generation who dislike , and intensely , the education that is being forced upon them ; who , as you would say , Mr. Moore , are inspired by their instincts to avoid it ; and many would prefer to educate themselves , feeling that they could do it better . But their parents are not of that opinion ; for parents ascribe their comparative failure to their lack of education . Therefore they cry out that their children shall be retained at school till they are sixteen , and make sacrifices for this calamitous end . Parents , I said , have sacrificed their children . Once it was to gods , now it is to education ; fetish after fetish , and none more reasonable than another . The flower blooms according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow their courses according to law . Everywhere we look , we find law ; but however much we may seek , the cause of the law escapes us . Perhaps , I said , that is the reason why we try to get above the laws of Nature . Tell me , I continued , changing the subject suddenly ; passing from philosophy to practical truths , is it true that in America all manual labor is done by emigrants ? I believe the servant problem is a very pressing one . Our servants come from Ireland , Italy , and Sweden , Mr. Husband replied , and that is why the immigration laws are not more strict ; at least seventy per cent of our manual labor comes from the middle of Europe . The first generation works hard , the second generation works less , the third generation looks upon itself as American , and as-pires to the liberal professions , which can not absorb everybody . I asked him if he had met no American hewing coal . About five-andtwenty per cent in the mine in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of some lean hunters , who came sometimes front the Blue Ridge Mountains of Maryland : who , he said , when not hunting or mining , are employed in feuds , vendettas , the causes of which are forgotten , so long ago is it since the original shooting , Dick knows that he must shoot Jim when he meets him , and Jim is not more knowledgeable ; enough it is for him to know that he must pull the trigger first . Mr. Husband 's stories of the Blue Ridge Mountains were brought nearer home by a remark that even Irish raiders could learn something from these lean mountain men . Are there mountains in Maryland ? I asked . You see , clear reader , I was fortunate enough to be possessed of an instinct that persuaded me to accept thrashings rather titan submit to education , else my lot might have been to write like Mr. Hardy , our modern /Eschylus ; whereas , by a little act of courage and avoiding the Bible till I was fifty , I wrote The Brook Kerifh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I remember next of the evening 's conversation is Mr. Husband telling me many stories of the childishness and improvidence of the negroes he had met in the mine . You are not afraid , I asked Mr. Husband , that , when they outnumber the whites , they will revolt ? A successful revolt , he answered , implies organization . And we spoke of Hayti , Mr. Husband telling , what every schoolboy knows , but which I did not , that Hayti had belonged to the French , and that the French revolutionaries sent over a deputation conferring freedom upon the negroes , the first result of which was a massacre of the whites and then a massacre of each other . Mr. Husband 's anecdotes illustrating the childishness of negroes had enlivened our conversation ; and unwilling that it should again darken , I asked him if his eyes could distinguish a gleam of light on our horizon . His cheerful optimism did not desert his voice even when he said that the world would continue its breakneck pace till it toppled over into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted , Mr. Moore , emerging , much reduced by famine , a smaller but more beautiful planet . And it seeming to me that I could not run the risk of losing the pleasing optimism of Mr. Husband 's voice , I refrained from speaking of the desolating tide of children flooding our doorways , and spoke instead of my Parisian life ? one that all Americans like to hear ; peopling my anecdotes with those who assembled at Tortoni 's during the seventies . And as a bonne bouche , I related my last visits to the great tribe of Impressionists , now reduced to two , Monet and Mary Casatt ; and Mr. Husband listened , as all Americans listen to such tales , till he began to remember that his clays in London were numbered , and that he must not miss a night of long slumber . For heaven only knows when the chance of a ten-hours sleep will come again ! lie said . I think I told you that I have to leave my bed at seven ? Yes , I remember , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do not leave on account of me ; I sleep on in the morning and rise when I am rested . Mr. Husband hesitated , as if he had something still in his mind to say , and I wondered what it could be . We have talked , he said , when I opened the front door for him , about a great many things , without , however , mentioning my handwriting . You see , I am now in business , and ant afraid it would be rather too long a job to copy out the whole book ; but if you would like a chapter of it ? My dear Mr. Husband , your letters are enough ; and after bidding him good-bye once more , I returned to my Aubusson carpet and my lyre-shapen clock , feeling that I would have done better to have talked less and to have drawn Mr. Husband into further confidences about himself . But no further confidences would have helped nie to understand him better than his first avowal : that , after leaving Harvard University , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? what ? The last thing that anybody would suspect : life ? primal , fundamental life . And I sought , without finding them , the words in which he had said he had gone down into the mine in search of primal life . He said nothing about escaping from conventions and prejudices ? what did he say ? I asked myself ; and stirred the fire without being able to recall his words . The words , however , that I am sure of , are : If I had been in Europe , I might have done as you did ? gone to France and lived in Montmartre ; but being in America , there was nothing for me to do but go down into a coal mine . How admirable ! How altogether admirable ! In these words we see the man from end to end , we weigh him , we appraise him . And before a dwindling fire I sat for a long time , thinking of Mr. Husband 's sea voyage , his arrival in New York ; pausing after rising from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he would sleep a night in New York , or catch a train to take him to Chicago . The answer came : He is too eager to see his wife again , to wait in New York ; he will catch the train .
