The smart retort to , " Do you want a fight ? " is still , of course , " Sir , I am a Tolstoyan ! " <P> Last week , however , it was revealed at London that Count Leo Tolstoy ( 1828-1910 ) , although an apostle of religious humility and the other cheek , once made a sharp retort to Bernard Shaw . The occasion was the submission by Mr. Shaw of several of his works for criticism to the Count . Tolstoy 's letter in reply was released , in London , by erudite Mr. Aylmer Maude , now collecting and translating Tolstoyana . <P> The letter , in part : " . . . Dear Mr. Shaw , life is a great and serious affair . . . . You are not sufficiently serious . . . . The questions you deal with are of such enormous importance that . . . to make them the subject of satires may easily do harm . " <P> Expounding his own views of religion in contrast to Shavian materialism , Count Tolstoy concluded : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That , according to you , mankind 's improvement will be accomplished when ordinary people become supermen , or fresh supermen are produced ; while in my opinion it will occur when men disencumber the true religions of Christianity from all the accretions which deter them , and when all , uniting in the understanding of life which lies at the base of all , realize their reasonable relation to the world 's eternal origin and accept the guidance for life which flows therefrom . . . .
