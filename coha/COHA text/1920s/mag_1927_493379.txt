HERBERT HOOVER 'S praises have been sung so many times that the refrain is like a popular hit of a past season . The catch has gone out of it . The Quaker who , when nearly everyone else was fighting or spoiling for 4 fight , dedicated himself to the relief of Belgium ; the engineer who went into public service , first in the difficult role of war food-administrator , then as Secretary of Commerce ; the champion of waste elimination ? this Hoover , once so freshly appeal ? ing , is now taken so for granted that when he is called for emergency relief wherever there is relief to be directed , whether in Louisiana or Vermont , nobody takes any more notice than when the mo ? torized fire-truck rolls out of the station at the Bound of the alarm . People are now thinking of Mr. Hoover , when they think of him , as a pos ? sible President . " President Hoover . " ' What sort of associations would that be likely to call to mind , four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical exami ? nation of these new possibilities , not to begin with an enlivened memory of those past services . There are a few sincere and competent persons who are , Without qualification , opposed to Hoover . But most of those who find fault with him , and whose judg ? Inent is worthy of respect , qualify their dispraise is saying that , in view of his obvious qualities , he Is to be preferred to any other candidate who has it chance for the Republican nomination . In any race of the availables for the approval of forward- . " king people , Mr. Hoover would leave Mr. Cool ? ige floundering at the mark . He would pass Mr. " awes going around the other way . Mr. Lowden , with so many farmers for him , would make a bet- ter showing , but Mr. Hoover would probably pass hint in the stretch . Mr. Hughes , honest and re ? sPectable though he is , would be too cold to offer serious competition . Remembering , then , that we are not setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'al , or even merely an undefined perfection , it is worth inquiring into the complaints that are made against him , not so much to sit in judgment on Bevil , to find out whether he is politically angel or as to see what they may tell us about his es rracter and direction . They may furnish the shadows for the portrait . l'irst both historically and in political impor- . rice ) are the complaints of farmers and their rep- ' esentatives . During the ' War , the price of wheat was limited , at the minimum , to two dollars a bushel , by act of Congress . It was not permitted to rise far above this minimum , by virtue of pol ? icies carried out by the administration . The farm ? ers blamed Mr. Hoover for the upper limit . Mr. Hoover and his friends deny his responsibility for it . The maximum prices , they say , were decided upon by others . It remains incontestable that any decisions as to price were effectuated by Allied and American wheat purchases , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation . It re ? mains true that , if Mr. Hoover had thrown his great influence in favor of a higher price , it might have been achieved . It remains true that he did not do so . Why ? Instructed opinion holds that if Mr. Hoover considered and decided against a high- er price , his action was sound . The prices main- tained were high enough to encourage ample wheat production for the war period . Higher prices would have put enormously greater strain on financial re ? sources , would have further stimulated inflation of credit and currency , and would have left the farm ? ers themselves , after the War , facing more drastic deflation , with larger stocks on hand . Yet I should like Mr. Hoover better if he accepted broad re ? sponsibility for the price of wheat , and justified it . There is also complaint by the pork raisers . In 1917 there appeared a growing and serious short ? age of hogs in this country . Investigation disclosed that the main reason for it was the high price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the price of hogs . A committee of experts was called upon to study the matter , and in a report , read through ? out the Middle West , it pointed out that during the ten-year period before the War , 11.67 bushels of corn at Chicago had sold , on the average , for as much as 100 much as 13.3 bushels of corn , production could quickly be brought back to nor ? mal . Thereupon the Food Administration an ? nounced that , " as to hogs farrowed next spring 1918 we will try to stabilize the price so that the farmer can count on getting for each hundred pounds of hog ready for market , thirteen times the average cost per bushel of the corn fed into the hogs . " Noted emissaries spread this promise broadcast , and the farmers took it seriously . When the fall of 1918 came , the Administra ? tion had difficulty in fulfilling its promise . The ratio in Chicago fell in October to 10.5 to 1 . There was a large crop of hogs , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted . The price might have fallen further in a free mar ? ket , but at least it was not maintained at the ex ? pected level . The average ratio for the crop proved to be 11.4 to 1 . This result was defended , not by an explanation of the difficulties , but by stating that the ratio of 13 to 1 had in fact been main ? tained between the price of 100 pounds of hog and the price of a bushel of corn on the farm . But corn on the farm is not the same as corn at Chi ? cago , and the farmers had thought the promise referred to the Chicago price . Very likely Mr. Hoover was not to blame , as many indignant farmers believed , for the failure of the promise . But the defense offered does not seem quite candid . Another essential activity of the Food Admin ? istration , undertaken as a complement to regula ? tion of prices paid to the farmers , was limitation of the packers ' profits . At the beginning , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early summer of 1918 , it appeared that the result of this rule was to allow the packers tremendous gains . The Federal Trade Commission was asked to in ? vestigate and report . Its investigation was conduct ? ed by competent accountants of its staff , as well as by several of the most eminent private accountants , brought in for the purpose . The experts were agreed , in the main , that marked changes ought to be made in the profits regulation . Profits for the big five were already from two-and-one-half to three times as high as they had earned in 1912 , 1913 and 1914 . There is not space here to go into the complex details of the matter . But Mr. Hoover rejected in toto the Federal Trade Commission 's analysis and recommendations . There is no ques ? tion that , in many of his comments on the conten ? tions of the accountants , Mr. Hoover was grossly in error . His view of the economics of the situa ? tion was na ? ve , to say the least . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were much too large . They were , furthermore , more injured by the subsequent deflation than they probably would have been , had the Trade Commission 's advice been followed . Now , the bearing of all this lies in the difference between the way the wheat and hog-raisers fared and the way the packers fared , under the Food Administration . The pressure of circumstances was allowed to prevail differently in one case than in the other . The significance of the contrast does not for a moment lie in any suspicion of corruption . There are many who would say that it lies in a bias of Mr. Hoover 's in favor of big business . He may have such a bias , but I believe the explana ? tion is less simple . It was not necessary to pay higher prices to the farmers in order to induce them to grow the needed products . It might have been difficult or even impossible to pay more . Prices enough higher to have benefited the individual farmer much would seriously have impeded prose ? cution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ers were powerful , aggressive and acquisitive . Mr. Hoover did not want to fight them and Germany at the same time . He was willing , therefore , topay much for their cooperation , in view of the fact that even a large profit for them did not mean a heavy toll per pound of meat , and that some of the excess profits would be taxed back to the Treas ? ury . Mr. Hoover 's job was to be Administrator of Food for war purposes , not to administer jus ? tice . And Mr. Hoover is a practical man . Mr. Hoover 's brush with farm representatives did not end with the War . It so happened that his first contemporary as Secretary of Agriculture , Mr. Wallace , was one of those who had opposed his course as Food Administrator . Relations were not cordial between the two departments . There was a feeling in Agriculture that Mr. Hoover 's newly aggressive department was treading on its toes . Fears were expressed that he would take over , for his own glory , certain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was jealousy about the newly proposed corn ' mercial attaches abroad under Mr. Hoover ; the Department of Agriculture wanted attaches of its own to deal with matters of crop marketing . Even ' tually Mr. Wallace , in an effort to do something to speed farm relief , gave sympathetic aid to the McNary-Haugen plan ; Mr. Hoover vigorously 011 ' posed it . There is not one of these controversies in which an exceedingly good case can not be made out for Mr. Hoover 's position . And the strength of Mr. Hoover 's influence with the Harding-Cool ? idge administration is demonstrated by the fact that in every one he was the victor . Mr. Wallace resigned , his subordinates in the Department vvh ? opposed and distrusted Mr. Hoover are there n ? longer ; the McNary-Haugen plan was denounced ; the present Secretary , Mr. Jardine , is in entire sympathy with Mr. Hoover and his policies . One could go much further in demonstrating Mr ' Hoover 's influence in matters relating to other de partments . Secretary Work of the Interior is close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred , from Interior to Commerce , with the assent and approval of Mr. Work , and much against the vv " of some of its members who aspired to a DcPal ment of Mines . The Department of State , whieu was jealous of Mr. Hoover 's commercial attaches , did not prevail against him . Per contra , Mr ' Hoover is generally credited with responsibility for ) the policy , announced by the State Department , of A. censoring private loans to foreign countries . . T a result of such activities , there are those who fear Mr. Hoover as an ambitious man , grasping Powar wherever he can lay his hands on it.viessr i In view of this well known energy , and in the of Mr. Hoover 's demonstrated influence With ' n administration , one is surprised by an opposite ? . strain of comment . It is met again and aga ; chiefly from those sympathetic with progressive liberal causes . Let us list a few instances ( rntist bi which can not be documented , but for which ex ? cellent authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con ? sidered in Congress , labor became agitated because of a clause which might be interpreted as forbid ? ding non-political strikes . To a conference of labor leaders Mr. Hoover gave his assurance that it was not so intended and would not be abused . Labor extended full support to the bill . After the War was over ? in 1919 ? the clause was relied upon by a federal judge in an injunction against a national coal strike . Mr. Hoover , in private conversation , said he was shocked by the injunction . Publicly he said nothing . Early in the Harding administration , Senator Norris developed an elaborate plan for emergency farm relief which would have involved the public financing of agencies to aid the distribution of American farm products throughout the world , by buying from producers ' cooperatives and selling to consumers ' cooperatives ? thus clearing the channels of the excessive profits and waste of laissez-faire distribution . Mr. Norris was assured , on good au ? thority , that Mr. Hoover favored the plan . At the last moment it became known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mr. Hoover sat in the Cabinet all through the scandals of the Harding regime ? Forbes , Teapot Dome , Elk Hills , Daugherty . It has been said by his friends that he knew much about these things before they were made public , and felt outraged about them , that he would have resigned if action had not been taken . Yet there is no record or sign that he did anything to force action ; nor is it known that he ever communicated any knowledge he may have had to those who pushed the investigations , or made any public comment on these affairs at the time or since . A similar inactivity has been noted in the scan ? dal of the corrupt Pennsylvania elections , although it is said by some close to Mr. Hoover that he Was much disturbed by them . A word from Mr. Hoover on either of these matters would have done much to stiffen public opinion . When the Child Labor Amendment was being attacked , Mr. Hoover 's aid was sought by its sup-Porters . He gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence with the business world , Would have been important . There is no record of any public word by him in its favor . It is now said , by persons known to be of pro ? gressive tendency , that Mr. Hoover holds admi ? rable opinions on such leading present issues as taxation , railway valuation , and foreign policy in Nexico and Nicaragua . Nothing officially escapes his lips on these subjects . from When explanation of this sort of thing is sought ' r ? ? M Mr. Hoover 's friends , the response is heated . , , , rr . Hoover is Secretary of Commerce , not Presi- ' " ent , or guardian of the public morals . Do you expect him to oppose the administration , or some other branch of it , in spite of his ' executive re ? sponsibilities , as a free lance might ? Or do you expect him to resign every other day ? Further ? more , Mr. Hoover is a Quaker , not a crusader . One has to admit that a progressively inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth in order to survive eight years of Harding and Coolidge . It is , however , true that Mr. Hoover is more than Secretary of Commerce , is something of a crusader , in certain respects . Circumstances allow him to be vigorous in one type of contro ? versy , though not in another type . He fights when he thinks he can do so without endangering his position ; not otherwise . For some reason , he re ? mains where the circumstances can limit him as they do . The chief reason has been , of course , his work as Secretary of Commerce ; it is by this that he would want to be judged . When he took the office , great hopes were entertained . As Food Adminis ? trator he had given evidence of the ability to pro ? mote , largely by voluntary means , better economic organization of supply and distribution so as to avoid waste . Such a technique , applied in peace , would have tremendous possibilities . Mr. Hoover 's Department has been teeming with activity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's conference on unemployment , held in consequence of the depression of 1920-21 . He sponsored the famous engineers ' report on waste in industry . He has gone on from these beginnings by publishing an extensive series of cur ? rent business statistics about production , stocks on hand , prices , employment and the like , by stimu ? lating many industries to adopt programs reducing the number of sizes and styles of their products ( " simplification " ) , by furthering a program of stabilization and economical construction in the building industry . He has energetically striven to assist export trade , and has spoken in favor both of more scientific research as an aid to industry and . of more scientific research of the pure type . He has promoted the cause of the improved St. Lawrence and other waterways . Yet there have been revealing limitations in these activities . The main result of the unemployment conference was a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research which recommended numer ? ous methods of prevention and relief , to be initi ? ated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently encouraged by Mr. Hoover , such as better statistical information , more intel ? ligent management of individual concerns , the adop ? tion of plans to diminish seasonal slackness . But among them were also other measures , of greater importance ? such as advance planning of public works to compensate for industrial fluctuations , a national system of employment exchanges , reliable figures on unemployment , and unemployment insur ance . In these recommendations Mr. Hoover has shown little or no interest . It so happens that he has pushed the measures of detail , the measures that would immediately benefit the individual em ? ployer , and has ignored the broader measures to which most employers were either indifferent or hostile . Today , when there is probably more un ? employment than since 1921 , when the index of factory employment stands 5 percent below a year ago , we have no national system of placing those who might find jobs , we have no detailed knowl ? edge of unemployment in specific trades and local ? ities , we have no means of compensating those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , contents himself with issuing statements about our great prosperity and its probable continuance . The waste-elimination program has been carried out largely by " simplification . " Manufacturers and others immediately interested in a given product are called together and told that it is their job , in their own interest and that of the public , to agree on a limitation of sizes and styles . Over sixty such projects have been accepted ; thousands of needless varieties have been eliminated ; immense savings have been made . Publications of the De ? partment claim , as a result , great benefits to the ultimate consumer as to service and price . About these claims , critics are dubious . The ultimate con ? sumer is seldom represented in the conferences . He has , indeed , few representatives to be invited , un ? less we think of the government itself as his agent . But the government leaves everything to the busi ? ness man and his technicians . The sizes and styles chosen for preservation depend , not upon any sci ? entific investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be met , but upon the prevail ? ing existing demand , or upon the producers ' con ? venience . A study , made by the Department , of the course of prices after the adoption of specific programs , shows that while in some cases they have fallen , in other cases they have risen . There is no assurance that most of the savings do not go into profits . That depends , as with any other improve ? ment in process , on the exigencies of competition or monopoly , and the state of the market . No ingenuity of Mr. Hoover 's has been devoted to carrying through to the consumer the benefits which make simplification popular with manu ? facturers . It is quite possible that Mr. Hoover is uncon ? scious of such limitations . Contrary to popular im ? pression , and in spite of his excellence as engineer and executive , he is an indifferent economist . Many of his economic views are conceived in advance of the evidence , and are held stubbornly after the evidence goes against him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved by hunches and prejudices ; he is often impatient of candid research ? even somewhat cold to the research of his own Department in the physical sciences , so long as it has not an immediate contribu ? tion to make to some pressing industrial problem , When , in spite of the fact that no adequate sur ? vey of the situation had been made in any govern ? ment department , he had decided that France ought to and could pay a large part of her debt to the United States , he was much annoyed by the care ? ful studies of non-governmental economists indi ? eating that she could not do so well . It is not known that he has ever studied or attempted seri. ously to refute the able documents on this most important subject , published , for instance , by the Institute of Economics . In this matter he adopted and held , without much inquiry , the popular at ? titude . When , in 1924 , certain coal operators asked for his advice about meeting the representatives of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so and to conclude an agreement ; this is much to his credit . But in his letter he said , after referring to the overproduction and disor ? ganization of the bituminous industry , " The real cure is a period of continuous operation under free competition and full movement of coal . " This , he said , " would result in the elimination of producers who depend on famine prices by the ordinary proc ? esses of competition . It would result in a concen ? tration of labor in more continuous employment in the more economically worked mines . It would render the business of the lower cost oper ? ators more stable , the prices of coal would be lower . " He thus endorsed the belief in " free competition " held both by the union officials and the employers . But most of the results he predicted have not come to pass . The industry is more disorganized than ever . Experts disagreed with Mr. Hoover 's pre ? scription at the time , and have since shown , Point by point , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , radical and unpopular . Since 1924 Mr. Hoover has given us no new light on 50rt coal ? perhaps the sorest spot in the economy . Everyone will remember Mr. Hoover 's outburst against the British on the ground of the restricting of rubber production under the Stevenson Plan ' national Rubber prices were high . Tire manufacturers were complaining . The British were restricting the ex ? port of rubber from the growing territories under their jurisdiction . Mr. Hoover apparently believed , and said , that this course was iniquitous , that free competition should be restored , that if the British rubber interests continued to bleed us in this man- ner we could retaliate by monopolistic schemes . rle overlooked the fact that the Stevenson plan was an attempt , however crude , at price stabilization , a plan which had formerly prevented the aban ; , 1 , donment of many plantations when the price c ) rubber was low ; that , without it , prices might Jar ' , have gone much higher than they did . He showed no understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fair price is gene recognized by modern economists as a helpful meas ? ure in unduly competitive situations , as a preventive of booms and depressions , with their inevitable waste . It is true that prices should not be controlled wholly in the interest of the producer , that monop ? oly needs to be curbed . It is true that iVIr . Hoover , by his activity in this regard , " threw a scare " into the British and was probably influential in bring ? ing about a lower price . But he evinced no com ? prehension of the real economics of the situation . He has , furthermore , exhibited no such indignation against abuses of monopoly by American interests . One of the most important issues now before the United States is the problem of electric power . Shall certain large power plants be publicly owned , as a check on the great profits of private monop ? oly ? How may the present defects in regulation be remedied ? Mr. Hoover has had close contacts With this issue at specific points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Lawrence . He has given no sign of concern about the consumers ' welfare in the matter . Where does he stand on Public operation , on valuation , on regulation ? There is good authority for stating that , at certain points , he has brought pressure to bear in favor of the con ? tentions of the private power interests . Perhaps this statement unfairly represents his present posi ? tion . But if he is now opposed to the power lobby , those who would benefit from a publication of his views do not know them . On the record , one would expect Mr. Hoover to be more concerned with the technical developments in power production and dis ? tribution than with their harnessing in the con ? sumers ' interest . Has Mr. Hoover ever investigated , or advised the administration , upon the tariff problem ? Has he ever considered its bearing on his efforts to pro ? mote foreign trade , or on the Allied war debts ? There is no evidence that he has . The record does not show Mr. Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Com ? merce , consciously an ally of predatory business in ? terests . Neither does it show him to be a super- I.ative economist , with a far-seeing social policy . His Justification for remaining in the Harding-Coolidge Cabinet at the cost of strategic silences is good , but not overwhelming . It may be fair to say that he has done as well in that milieu as anyone could be expected to do . One can not classify Herbert Hoover with the Political Presidents . He is shy , he is not master of the ready phrase and the warm handclasp , his speeches do not resound , he is even a little weak in organizing political support . In the higher sense of politics , he can not be expected to become a na- tjonal symbol , inspiring enthusiasm among those he does not know by virtue of deep confidence in his spiritual integrity or his ultimate meaning . People Will never honor the precedents of " Teddy " and " Al " by calling him " Bertie . " Nor will they rally about him for espousal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seems more like the well trained head of a great industrial corporation . He is an inde ? fatigable worker . Energy radiates through his administrative staff . He is constantly doing things . Slackness , indifference , insubordination do not flour ? ish about him . He will want , not to let things drift , but to manage , and he will care about detail . He will be " bullish " about the future . He will look for " results , " and what he means by " results " will be something immediate and tangible . He will be impatient of slow processes . He will not have the imaginative genius of a Henry Ford , to plan and execute the impossible , to combat the ruling tend ? ency and the powers that be , occasionally to risk the absurd . He will waste no time on lost causes , or causes which can not win until his day is over . He will be in advance of the procession , but not too far in advance . He will sacrifice everything which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His intention will be , on the whole , generous and humane . He will work on hunches and will make quick adjustments to situations . Circumstances and the balance of existing forces will determine his direction . He will not inquire too closely what all his activity is really about . Nothing he does will have revolutionary implications ; rather he will re ? fine and improve what he finds ready to his hand . And he will make egregious mistakes . While business leaders generally like him , a few of the larger ones distrust him . I believe there is little occasion for this distrust . It is true that , as a public executive , he does things to improve and enlarge the realm of his administration just as any one of them would try to enhance the importance of his own organization . Among those who are jealous of every activity of government , because it may intrude on the power of private business , this seems " dangerous . " But Mr. Hoover is too much like them to think or act very differently about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present indus ? trial order in the United States to live up to its better possibilities . He will do little to change it as its rulers do not want it changed . Anyone coming to him in advocacy of a reform will have to show that there is a combination of forces which can effectuate the reform before he will heartily espouse it . For Mr. Hoover is " practical . " If it be ob ? jected , by those who are not so much in sympathy with the present regime in industry , that this age needs more vision , more understanding , more feel ? ing for imponderables than Mr. Hoover is likely to give it , the answer is obvious . The man they want may exist , but they can not have him as a Re ? publican President . Perhaps even Mr. Hoover can not be nominated . The social and economic scene will have to be much changed before a better man can be the protagonist .
