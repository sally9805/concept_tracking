txt Commenting today , between rear platform speeches , on the Republican victory in Maine , Governor Cox said : " The result in Maine is no surprise . The majority . is accounted for by tae augmented total vote . Chairman Hays went Into the State early and that clearly meant that Maine asks to be prepared as the pyrotechnical display for this campaign . But neither pyrotechnics nor money tan win this fight . It will be decided outside of Maine . In the 1916 September election the Republicans carried Maine , and yet in November President Wilson carried thirty States " and divided the electoral vote in West Virginia . " In the course of his addresses today the Governor asserted that a fund of from $25,000,000 to $30.000,000 was being raised to beat him . He made the statement in replying to a " heckler " at Nampa , where a stop was made just before Boise City was reached . MentIons $30,000,000 Fund . " If you are elected President , " shouted the " heckler , " ? " how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealth of the country is held by 2 per cent . of the people ? ' . ' " I tell you how , " replied Cox . " If 80 per cent .. of the people - will forget politics and help me to lick the 2 per cent . that is raising a fund of from $25,000,090 to $30,000,000 to beat me. we will make the Government an agency of 100 per cent . of the people and not of 2 per cent , of the people . " This is the first time Governor Cox has mentioned a sum over $15,000,000 as the amount the Republican Party is seeking to raise . Entering the Progressive . stronghold of Idaho today , the Governor told the vdters they should repudiate the leadership of Senator William E. Borah where the League of Nations was concerned and refuse to follow the leadership . of Senator Harding , who , the Democratic candidate asserted , was not only opposed to the League , but was a reactionary representing a return to conditions of government worse than those against which Theodore Roosevelt fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor . This is Senator Borah 's home , but he was no. - on hand . He was making an address attacking the League in Governor Cox 's home city , Dayton , Ohio . The primary question is a big issue in Idaho , the Republican Legislature having put an end to the  --  primaries , according to some of the - leaders , to prevent the Non-Partisan .. League from gaining control of political organizations . Governor Cox expressed surprise to find that the State had .. cast aside the primary laws . He held that it was a mistake and presupposed that the peo ple could not be trusted as to judgment and patriotism . " That , " he added , " is a slander on the citizenship of anyState . " While . Governor Cox made much of the League of Nations , he . also dwelt on progress and the in government as the cur ' for the evils of radicalism . He is convinced that only a small fraction of the voters in Washington State , Oregon and Idaho are radicals at heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice in government are responsible for the growth of radicalism . Governor 's Voice Stronger ; - He also believes a ' revolt against the Harding leadership of the Republican Party may be started here if he ( Cox ) can convince the voters that he is the new leader ? of a distinctly progressive movement . The candidate displayed the greatest interest in the Idaho country . which he never had visited , and he describes his experiences in the great Northwest as an inspiration . He told his audiences today that it should be made a .. condition that any ' man nominated for the Presidency make a tour like his , study the needs of the country , and get close to the people , so that he might have a better understanding of their desires . The Governor 's voice held out well during the day and he was in fine fettle for his address tonight after making half a dozen speeches en route , four of them from the rear platform . He said he would rather take a chance on losing his voice than disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Weiser , where half the town was out with a band at 9:15 o'clock this morning . There were addresses also at Payette and Ontario . At Caldwell men climbed on freight cars to hear and see the candidate . The meeting also was attended by 500 school children . A stop was made at Meridian and the party arrived in Boise City- about 3 o'clock this afternoon . Governor Cox was accompanied on his tour of the State by Senator John P. Nugent and Theodore A. Walters , Democratic nominee for Governor . Nugent was one of the Democratic Senators who voted for the Lodge reservations . He is running for re-election . Governor Cox in all of his addresses today declared no one knew where Senator Harding stood on the League of Nations and expressed doubt that Senator Harding himself knew , as he had changed his position at least eight times up to this point . The need for reclamation work on a much broader scale was stressed by the candidate . " When we have kept the faith with our allies and with our countrymen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " we . can turn our thought directly to the immediate problems that concern the people of this great West . Irrigation and reclamation offer not only great hope to the future of America , but  --  provide the means for meeting the proper requests from soldiers of the late war for land development . I favor not only . increased appropriations for this work , under supervision which will retain the benefits to all the people for all time , but the enlargement of all projects when it has been made possible to do this under the disarmament of nations plan which will follow the adoption of the League of Nations . " He again urged the necessity for the appointment of a budget commissioner to work with the President and the adoption of a budget system . Governor Cox will give his attention to Utah and Nevada tomorrow and then go on to California . Renews Wood Charges .. BOISE CITY , Idaho . Sept. 14 ( Associated Press ) . ? Goveritor Cox closed his day in Idaho with a speech at a large meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges and evidence in their support regarding Republican campaign contributions . Referring to alleged promises by William M. Wood . President of the American Woolen Company , to the Republican campaign handbook enterprise of William Barnes , Jr. , of New York . Governor Cox said he observed in today 's papers that the core poration 's mills had been ordered reopened . He " was too modest , " he added , to discuss the incident further , except to recount his recent attacks on the corporation and Mr. Wood , whom he charged with seeking to depress wool prices , in the face of increased demand , and to force employes to accept lower wages . He again denounced " big business " and charged it with contributing toward purchase of the Presidency . '
