W HEN Secretary of the Interior Wilbur makes final disposition of the power at Boulder Dam the attitude of the Hoover Administration toward the future of the country 's power resources will be known . In the present Boulder Dam controversy the issue between public and private ' development is drawn as clearly as it could be drawnUntil hearings held recently before Secretary Wilbur at which his tentative plan for disposing of the power was discussed this had not been generally apparent . His allocation , at first glance , seemed to give States and municipalities such generous treatment as to make complaint of his concessions to power companies seem captious ; but at these hearings the matter appeared in a new light . City after city registered its protest against the Secretary 's proposal to give the Southern California Edison Company one-fourth of all the power to be generated at the great dam which is to ' be built by the federal government . In two days of discussion one man , and only one , spoke in favor of the Wilbur plan. - He was W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great concern that distributes power throughout this part of California . . ( Continued on page 718 ) This is the situation . The use of all power generated at Boulder Dam for the next fifty years is about to be assigned to some one . In the second week of December Secretary Wilbur is to sign some sort of contract which will dispose of this great resource for almost two generations . It is necessary that such a contract be signed because the Boulder Dam Act safeguards the government 's $165,000,000 investment by providing that not a stone shall be turned toward construction of the dam or any other phase of the work until valid contracts have been executed guaranteeing in advance repayment with interest of the cost of the project . There are more than twenty bidders for the power from the dam . Several bidders would like to take the whole output , 550,000 firm horsepower . There is no doubt that the necessary contracts could be secured from any one of several sources , all safeguarding the federal government effectively . The problem is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest as the act provides . Secretary Wilbur announced a tentative division late in October . For the Metropolitan Water District of southern California he set aside 50 per cent of all the power . The Metropolitan Water District is an organization of a dozen cities which must get drinking water for their future needs frOm the Colorado River . They can not get the water except by pumping it across a range of mountains . It is for this that their power is to be used . Mr. Wilbur had no choice but to give them all the power they need for this purpose since Congress specified in the Boulder Darn Act that one of its primary motives was to make drinking water available to the peoples who need it . The district has no authority to go into the power business in any way . None of the power allotted to this body will be resold . The rest of the power the Secretary divided evenly between the city of Los Angeles and the Southern California Edison Company , reserving 18 per cent of the total , each for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decide they wish to do so , and reserving 4 per cent for use of small cities of the Southwest . Thus the Edison Company is to receive half the power available for use as power in southern California , for distribution among wholesale and retail customers . It is this which has startled and disturbed the cities that fought so long and gallantly for passage of the Boulder Dam bill , expecting to receive from the federal government a fair proportion of the power it makes available . While the Edison Company used all its resources to defeat the bill , these cities kept up their fighting courage by a vision of a future independent of the company . They felt sure of this independence because the Boulder - Dam bill as passed by Congress specifies that where cities or States and private companies make conflicting applications for power , the public agencies shall be given the same preference rights as are set forth in the federal Water Power Act : In issuing preliminary permits . . . or licenses the commission shall give preference to applications therefor by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deemed by the commission equally well adapted , or shall within a reasonable time be made equally well adapted , to conserve and utilize in the public interest the navigation and water resources of the region . There has been no dispute , the surprised city spokesmen pointed out to Mr. Wilbur , as to the equal acceptability of their plans for using power and those of the Edison Cornpany . There has been no doubt of their financial responsibility . They feel that Congress plainly intended them to have this power . They do not understand under what interpretation of the law the Edison Company can be given any of it . Their interpretation of the preference clauses was strongly supported at the hearing by Representative Phil Swing , one of the authors of the bill , and Senator Key Pittman of Nevada , who was a member of the Senate committee which framed it . If the Edison Company is given what Mr. Wilbur plans to give it , this is what will happen . The cities will have to buy their power back from the Edison Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the power somehow . Their growth demands it . They will , of course , pay a greater price to the Edison Company than will be charged by the government . Los Angeles owns a large power-generating plant and municipal distributing system . Its power bureau does a $14 , - 000,000 business annually . It supplies two-thirds of the residents of the city with current for light and heat . The other third buy power from the Edison Company . In the twelve years the city has been operating its system it has forced reductions in power rates which have saved the people of the nearby territory $25,000,000 . But the generating plant is not large enough to supply the needs of all the people , so the city now buys power from the Edison Company and retails it , paying the company $3,700,000 a year . If it gets the power it wants from Boulder Dam it will not have to buy this power from the Edison Company , and further rate reductions will be possible . The city will be able , also , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on the Edison Company . The city of Pasadena has its own electric plant . Its people used to pay the Edison Company twelve cents a kilowatt hour for current . They now pay the city four cents . But the city needs power from Boulder Dam to meet its growing needs . The city of Burbank has its own distributing system . It buys power from the Edison Company now at nine mills per kilowatt hour , and retails it to its people . If it is allowed to buy Boulder Dam power from the government it will have to pay only four or five mills per kilowatt hour . Glendale is in much the same situation , and so are the other smaller cities . They are unable to construct generating plants for themselves , though they believe in public power development . - " But , " said Mr. Mullendore of the Edison Company , " if you wish to serve the public interest , you must give the power to us . We serve four-fifths of the people in the Southwest , and turn three-fourths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , for there is no one elSe to speak for them . Shall they be denied a share of the benefits coming from an investment of the federal government ? " A remarkable argument , but Mr. Mullendore made it . " Did you serve the interests of this public when you tried for many years to keep the Boulder Dam bill from passing ? " he was asked . To this there seemed to be no particular answer . " Fortunately , " said Senator Pittman , " Congress has determined what is the public interest . It has determined that it is to the public interest to let a municipality serve its people rather than a private company . " Power allocation was not the only phase of the Wilbur plan complained of at the recent hearings . Secretary Wilbur has rejected the plan for government construction , equipment , and operation of the Boulder Dam power plant provided for in the Swing-Johnson bill , and worked out instead a motley scheme which presents the most complex and difficult situation that could be devised , according to W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water and Power . The Secretary plans to have the federal government build the power plant , but the generating machinery which must be imbedded in this structure , fastened to its foundation , floor , and walls , an integral part of the whole , he does not intend the government to own , though Congress has authorized him to spend the necessary money to instal it . The city of Los Angeles must instal the machinery , he has ruled , the costs of installation and operation to be borne jointly by the city , the Edison Company , and the small allottees of power . Such a plan will cost three million dollars more than if the machinery were installed . by the federal government . It is hard to see why the Secretary should favor an arrangement of this kind which seems disadvantageous to everybody concerned . And while Mr. Wilbur proposes to make the city of Los Angeles the contracting agent for power he provides for a board of control " to act with the city of Los Angeles in operation of the plant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority . It is to have two members , the Edison Company is to have two members , and a fifth member is to be named by the Secretary of the Interior . The small cities of southern California have joined Los Angeles in protesting against this arrangement . Without exception they asked for operation of the plant by the federal government , or else by the city and the Metropolitan Water District . If the Edison Company is to receive any power by waiver by the public agencies of their preference rights , this is no reason for divided authority in operation and maintenance of the plant , Los Angeles argues . And if she is overruled and forced to consent to operation of the plant by a board of control , she will never consent , according to her spokesmen , to permitting the Edison Company such a large representation on it as the Secretary suggests , which amounts to giving the Edison Company one-quarter of the power , none of the responsibility , and two-fifths of the authority over the power with an excellent chance of capturing complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Secretary Wilbur maintained an inscrutable attitude as he listened to condemnation of his plan . He asked only one question of importance . " Just from a general standpoint of federal policy , " he said to W. B. Mathews of Los Angeles , " would you think it desirable for the federal government to start in equipping power plants for the municipalities of the United States ? " This of course is not precisely what Congress had in mind when it undertook a $165,000,000 project to protect its citizens from flood and drought , and made provision for safeguarding its investment by selling power , finally providing that since it was selling power , States and cities should have first opportunity to purchase . But then " I am spending very little time trying to find out what was in the mind of Congress , " said Mr. Wilbur ; " I have to abide by the bill as passed . " And the last part of that statement , at least , the mayors and city.attorneys and city engineers.gathered before him prayerfully indorsed , and pointed to their preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different pages of the same issue of a New York newspaper recently which A- the Drifter thinks should have been side by side . A dispatch from Helena , Arkansas , told how , a judge there ordered the destruction of a kind of electric chair used in the sheriff 's office for the purpose of getting confessions from prisoners . The chair had been in use a long time and had been rebuilt three times . The judge 's knowledge of it came through the statement of a Negro in court that the chair had been used to extort from him a false confession that he had killed his step-son . When the pain became unbearable , the Negro said , he told the officers in charge that he would sign a confession if they would turn off the current . * * ii O N another page of the same newspaper was a dispatch from Seattle , Washington , describing another device used with prisoners , known as a " lie detector . " It , too , had been used to obtain a confession from an alleged murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , the dispatch was apparently intended to gain approbation for the device as a new application of science toward the detection of crime . As described , the " lie detector " consists of two leather plates which go under the arms , with a chain at the back to hold them in place . A rubber tube wound around one arm registers the blood pressure , while an electric wire leads to a needle which traces a record of the respiration and blood pressure . So far , so good . The instrument itself is not one of torture . But the description of the way in which it was used , although hailed by the prosecuting attorney as a great step forward in the campaign against crime , left the Drifter with precisely the same feeling about the " lie detector " as about the device used in Arkansas . In describing a seven-day session with his prisoner the prosecuting attorney said : - The entire examination , for six or eight hours each day , has centered around the question : " Where is Bassett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a hundred times : " Is it in a lake ? " " Is it in the Sound ? " " Is it in a well ? " On all these questions , if he answered , the answer was " No , " and in any case a negative reaction was registered . We found he would not answer any question relating to cemeteries . When we worked along that line he struggled , threw his arms about , feigned fainting spells . . . We had a plate made showing every grave in a Swedish cemetery , but Mayer positively refused to look at it . The most force that we used on him was last Sunday . When Mr. Keeler had just finished a series of questions on the graves and cemeteries about Bothell , Mayer , suddenly roused , sprang like a cat and smashed the machine . * x* E VEN then the inquisition did not stop . The prisoner was seized , shackled , and sent back to his cell , and after the machine had been repaired the examination was resumed while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot " ? whatever that may be . " We gave him one day 's rest in the last week , " said the attorney .
