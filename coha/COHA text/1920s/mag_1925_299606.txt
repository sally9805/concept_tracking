THE MATRIARCH - G. B. Stern - Dutton ( $2.50 ) . <P> Matriarchy , recurring through several generations of a family , is never without the suggestion that original female promiscuity has brought fatherhood into disrepute , as an agency too casual to be revered and too dubious to be trusted . That suggestion is implicit in the affairs of the Jewish family Rakowitz . Babette , afterwards the first Mrs. Rakowitz , used to march each evening , attended by two white trouser-legs , to the camp of the Emperor Napoleon at Pressburg . She bred and ruled many Rakowitzes , passed her domineering spirit down through seven generations of Rakowitz women who overruled seven generations of Rakowitz men . The book is an extraordinary graph of the involved ganglia , the subtle criss-crossing veins , the interwoven tissues of a great family . It is written as Mr. H. G. Wells used to write before too many ideas gave his style the gout.
