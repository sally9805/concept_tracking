More than a million votes were cast in Cook county . Early telephone returns covered only the office of state 's attorney in the local field and it tv : = on this place alone that anything approaching final figures was received up to a late hour this morning . But these showed that State 's Attorney Crowe had been reelected by more than 225,000 votes . The scattering returns on other local offices . backed up by Crowe 's showing , the Republican state ticket 's lead in the city and the whopping Coolidge vote sent the Democrats home early , convinced they were beaten all along the line . Runs Ahead of Coolidge . State 's Attorney Crowe apparently ran ahead of President . Coolidge . Es ' iimates placed the President 's total In Cook county as 540,000 , . while the incomplete reports indicated Crowe had piled up a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prosecutor 's office , also ran ahead of his ticket . The estimates were that he got 345,000 votes in the county , while Davis received only 225,000 . Bury Hope ' Thompson . Hope Thompson , the candidate of the Better GoVernment association , made even a much weaker showing than was conceded to him during the closing days of the campaign . Deserted at the last minute by the Ku Klux Klan , he received only a small part of the " bone dry " vote and careful estimates ' placed his Iota ' somewhere about 45,000 . It was a Republican day throughout the county . Ward after ward counted normally as Democratic went for Coolidge . Small and those on the Republi , can state ticket , ran neck and neck with the President throughout the city . ** was taken to mean that they received a large portion of the La Follette presidential vote . G. 0 . F. Runaway in Country . And in the country towns of the county the Republicans ran even bet . ter than they did in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs showed the Republicans running about three to one ahead of the Democrats . For example , Charles S. Deneen , Republican nominee for United States senator , polled : 0,190 votes in those precincts to 3,825 recorded for Col. Albert A. Sprague , his Democratic rival , and Sprague was doing better than most of his ticket . The one line that ran unevenly in the record was the race between Gov . Small and Norman L. Jones . Jones picked up in strongly Republican territory in Lake View , Hyde Park and Austin in the city , and in such suburbs ac Evanston , Oak Park and La Grange . but so strong was the Coolidge movement among the voters that even the governor carried the'county by 170,000 or more . Some estimates placed his margin as better than 200,000 . Dennis Egan Beaten . During the early part of the evening Democratic headqua-ters was cheered by talk that there was still a chance for such candidateA as Chief , Bailiff Dennis J. Egan and P. A. Nash of the board of review , for both of whom special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before even this sort of conversation disappv.red. 2 Among some of them there is still a : faint hope that the figures may be s.vrong in connection with these offices ' which mean ' so much to the organixa'ion , but the leaders conceded that they are lost . . , The big conclusion concerning the entire Republican ' ticket drawn from Crowqs victory was that the whole . sale kihifing threatened among the Republican factions had not materially affegtpd the result . Crowe was the man most seriously threatened by the almost public dec. larations of hostility from the Lundin ? Small camp . Therefore , the leaders concluded , if the determined effort to scratch Crowe had not dragged him down anywhere near the danger point , the rest of the ticket was safe . ' Even in the scattered returns avail able at press time there was consider . able evidence that knifing and trailing had been attempted oh an extun ? sive scale . That it had not peen more successful was ascribed largely to the physical impossibility of carrying oat this sort of work on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters hurrying up those in the polling booths . Trading Nullifies Itself . The trading also was said to have been of such a wide range that nobody received the benefit of it in one spot without being hurt , by a hosti:e trade in some other territory . The partisan returns which were sent to county headquarters by pre ? cinct and ward leaders aupplemented the police returns to the extent that they proved the Republican trend all along the line . A message that ' one county candidate had run exceedingly well in one district , was immediately offset by another that he had dropped behind in another section . The net re ? suit was a conclusion that as a whole the local Republican aspirants had been carried so high by the national tide that district knifing and sectional deals had had little appreciable effect . Miller Gets Judgeship . Some particular interest in the county fight attached to one of . the three judicial vacancies that were filled by the voters . The Chicago Bar association indorsed Md. 3 . M. Arvey , Democratic nomin6e against Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group under the division of these three places among the three factions . But Ald. Arvey , like the rest of his party candidates , went down to defeat .
