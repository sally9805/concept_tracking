Showman Gest described the accident repeatedly , volubly to newsgatherers : how the cars had rolled over on their sides in the water ; how he , asleep , tad had a " rude " awakening ; how he grabbed in-the dark , caught his watch-chain hanging from the upper berth , bashed through the window , clambered out . <P> He exclaimed : " Think of it !
