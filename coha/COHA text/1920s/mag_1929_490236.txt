THE New York CentraPs fleet of nine daily twenty-hour trains between New York and Chicago seemed all right until we looked into it and found that five of the trains are from Chicago and four from New York . This city is one train shy of breaking even . We did a little figuring-and the results are alarming- . Eleven Pullmans is about a trainload and there are twenty-four berths in a Pullman , n counting the drawin , ? r-rnoms either . If all the berths on the trains from Chicago arc full ( and that 's not being pessimistic , it 's just facing facts ) it means eleven times twelve times two , or two hundred and sixty-four more people arriving from Chicago than leave for it . Things mount up . It gives New York an import surplus of 96,360 Chicagoans a year  --  all because one railroad did n't think its job through . It means more fish for the Aquarium , perhaps an addition to it , and a new subway , just when we 're getting half-settled . We call upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine to Chicago and one back . They can return the Pullmans in ballast . At that rate we would export seven hundred fifty thousand of our own iohabitan is a year . Then we 'd be getting some place . You 'd notice the differ-ence in street traffic in less than a month . HARVARD came out only pretty well in the survey of football subsidies . There was a blot on her escutcheon . It was n't a very big blot , but it was a blot : big enough so the song will have to be changed from " Fair Harvard " to " So-So Harvard . " However , you must n't get the idea that Harvard is entirely dissolute in the matter of athletics . On the hack of the envelopes tes ? which the Athletic Association sends out to alumni , the first printed instruction is this : " All Harvard men may buy for their relatives or friends , for whose respectable conduct at the games they are willing to vouch , a reasonable number of season tickets . " As long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't lost its integrity . And as long as it does n't split its infinitives . THE ingredients of a sandwich named The New Yorker have been brought to our attention by its backers . " We feet , " they write , " that the sandwich we are now introducing will appeal , as your publication , to the sophisticated . " They then go on to describe the sandwich  --  Roquefort and cream cheese , mixed , spread , and toasted , melted under an overhead broiler and served with two strips of bacon and liberally sprinkled with paprika , piping hot on two pieces of toast . Sometimes it 's hard ' fa know just how far we 've really corm with this magazine . Five long ydirs pf. - ha rd plugging , and when finally a sandwich is created in our image , it has n't so much as a bit of roast beef inside of it . Just a bunch of cheese . WE have read , very solemnly , Mr. Fox 's plan for introducing talk- ing pictures into schools , hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one we 're not sure about . It means that children will hear the guns of Bunker Hill and see the whites of the Redcoats ' eyes . It means that medical students everywhere will he able to watch major operations . It means that country people will go to church to hear not the local parson but Harry Emerson Fosdick . On the face of it , this seems like good news , and important news . Yet it scares us to death . What 's going to happen to science and religion when the cinema people begin to glorify -4 ? ts.40 -- 44 them and whip them into shape ? We 've never yet seen a talkie in which the director could resist having one of the characters break out in song . The last picture we saw , they were , so hard up for a. little sound they dragged in a jew's-harp and an ocarina. 17kre doubt if any director could photogtaph Bunker Hill for the kiddies with:kit stopping the fighting at least once for Major Pitcairn to sing " Sonny Boy . " We doubt if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mandolin solo by one of the surgeons . Also , we are troubled by the haunting dread of living in a completely canned civilization where everyone will look like Clara Bow and talk like Eddie Leonard . Without doubting Mr. Fox 's honorable intention , we are none the less anxious to know whether the talkies are going to approach science and education the way they have approached life . We want to know whether they intend to give truth a happy ending ! Vital THE limited autographed edition of Mr. Coolidge 's book numbers one thousand . It sells for twenty-five dollars and the royalties run into money . A representative of the publisher took the sheets  --  not the books themselves  --  up to Northampton to be signed . He took 1,030 , explaining that the odd thirty were for people around his office . Mr. Coolidge set to work with his pen . He signed away for an hour or more , the publisher 's man feeding him the sheets from time to time . As he did so lie talked . He chatted , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become rather loquacious . He neared the end of the task . The publisher 's man was fingering the last few pieces of paper in his lap . " How many sheets haVe you got left there ? " asked Mr. Coolidge . The man counted them . " Twelve , " he reported . " That 's what I make it , " said Mr. Coolidge , " a thousand and eighteen . " Light IF you 're keeping a couple of scrap-books on the Electric Light Golden Jubilee at Dearborn you might want YO paste in a few facts that were crowded out of the journals one way or another . To begin with , Henry Ford paid for the whole works , which cost twenty-eight hundred thousand dollars . This took care handily of all the major operations , moving Menlo Park , building a new Independence Hall stronger and better than the old one , hiring three thousand laborers , eight thousand two hundred secret-service men , sixty waiters for the banquet ( all of whom were frisked before they were entrusted with a tray ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Someone , more or less as a joke , suggested to Ford that he ought to transport his guests in old rigs , so he picked up a phone and ordered fifty bought . ) Now , even with all that money , there still had to be someone to pull things together so that they would go off all right , and not only that but make sense to the public and the newspapers . Otherwise the thing might just fall of its own weight and bewilderment . The man selected for the task was Edward L. Bernays , once representative of the King of Arabia , erstwhile adviser of Joan Lowell , press agent for Stewart 's new store , etc. , etc . He is a specialist in creating news events  --  like the Wall Street flurry , which it is only fair to add he did n't have a hand in . Once , however , he urged Czechoslovakia to announce its independence on a Sunday so that it would get a better break in the daily press . Things like that . Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Jubilee business , had worked out plans for it , someone thought of Bernays . The Pioneers are men who once worked with Edison , and their sons . They planned the Jubilee at a meeting in the Astor Hotel here last February . At that meeting it came out that Edison had promised to spend the fiftieth anniversary of the light bulb 's invention with Ford , which complicated things  --  for everyone , that is , except Bernays . Bernays works well with multimillionaires , as the success of the great celebration shows . Under Ford 's aegis he got into touch with governors , other countries , syndicates , etc . Under his direction committees were formed from Maine to Honolulu , holidays declared , lights turned on and off , speeches made , and a special stamp issued by the Post Office Department . Of course , the real greatness of Edison deserved all these things , and the people from the President down were sincerely desirous of honoring him in a big way , but it took a public-relations counsellor to put it over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame . colleges , man ! " shouted one arguer . " Eastern colleges have tradition ! What tradition have you got out west ? " " Say , listen , " coldly replied the gen- ? tleman corn the West . " Give us ten years more and we 'll have a tradition out there that will make Yale and Harvard look sick . " Poor Poe DEMENT. it or not , but a lady who stopped off at Richmond , Virginia , to visit the Poe house , which that city has recently set aside as a memorial , instructed a taxi-driver , a large darky , to drive her there . At the end of a ? $2.55 ride the cab drew up before a tremendous building , as imposing as a penitentiary . " Are you certain this is the Poe house she asked , startled . " Sho am , " said the driver and pointed to a brass sign at the entrance : " County Alms House . " Travellers bring back little stories . One motoring through New England Caine upon , at Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Here Lies the Body of Boatswain Allen Whose Body Was Lost at Sea . " Tarrying long enough to satisfy his curiosity as to the origin of this , the visitor learned that Boatswain Allen 's body had really been lost at sea but that the headstone-maker of the period , commissioned to do a memorial shaft , began it " Here Lice the Body ? " because he always began headstones that way and did n't know of any other . The town officials let him have his way . Diamonds THE eight or ten gentlemen with whom we were shown around the Black , Starr &; Frost building , at Fifth Avenue and Forty-eighth , enlarged and remodelled to admit Gorham , Inc. , all removed their hats . You walk on floors of Siena travertin and fumed teak from Java . Colonnettes and panelling , arches and cornices take their motifs from places and things as varied as Four Feathers Inn , Haddon Hall , the Tudor rose , the Palazzo Communale , an old Worcestershire cottage , and sixteenth-century sword-hilts . It was the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed us , to examine , a **26;508;TOOLONG ve-thousan &doll; ar necklace . it was a rather incongruous setting for a display that caught our perverse fancy even more than the necklace  --  some platinum settings , bereft of their jewels , which once belonged to Diamond Jim Brady . They were his famous " transportation set " ? cuff-links , tie-clasp , penholder , and other pieces , in the shape of a camel , a train , an automobile , etc . Black , Starr &; Frost bought the outfit for twenty-five thousand dollars , largely because of one blue diamond , which , in a setting that seems to represent a wheel and is as big as a half-dollar , once flared from Brady 's finger . Another exhibit was a fresh-water pearl , as large as a marble , imbedded in a half shell . A farmer found it in the White River , in Arkansas , came to New York , peddled it around , and finally sold it to Black , Starr for seven thousand dollars . The owner stipu lated that the shell must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this being that unless the pearl comes out round and perfect when it is chipped loose from the shell , it will be worthless . The jewelry compam ' s experts , after a careful examination , decided that the chances were it would he perfect . They have n't found out yet , though . The management has swallowed its curiosity and is using the shell and pearl as something odd to show around . ? AF the store we met Mrs. Polly Pettit , who has been window-dresser for Gorham 's and will now serve both stores ( they will both he open for two months and then she will have just the merger-store to look after ) . She is the only woman officer of the Display Men 's Association , the official organization of the window-dressers , and acts as its vice-president , no less . Mrs. Pettit became a " display man " rather by accident . Eight years ago she devised , as a favor for a birthday party in honor of her small son , a candy man made by sticking toothpicks into gumdrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salable and she sounded out Hoyler 's . They were interested and her career as a w  --  ndowdresser began . Incidentally , more than fifty thousand gumdrop dolls were sold in the year following their appearance in Fluyler 's windows . Mrs. Pettit next turned her talent to creative work with pencils for a pencil company and built a New York skyline out of them which attracted attention from many , including Gorham 's . She says there are two major types of show-windows : the prestige window , which attempts to sell nothing but which honors some great person or occasion ; and the merchandise window , which directly displays articles to he sold . An arrangement of silver bowls holding red cherries , which she devised for Washington 's birthday this year , was a combination of the two types ( a prestige-merchandise window ) . She gives much cf her time to research , looking up old Godcy prints of brides , for instance , to go with a display of wedding gifts , searching through " Bartlett " for appropriate quotations , and sci on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it time job . Recently , for example , she hunted up some old playing cards to he used in connection with a window exhibition of the newest and smartest monogrammed cards , and somehow or other came by Indian , Korean , Chinese , and Italian cards of ancient date . Prying into the history of playing cards , she found that they descend from an ancient religious cult , the devotees of which consulted cards to divine the will of the gods . Instead of the present symbnls  --  hearts , diamonds , clubs , and spades  --  those formerly used were a coin , rod , sword , and chalice . Her son , Johnny , for whom she made the candy man , is now eleven and helps her as much as he can , but she does n't intend him for a display man . She says it 's a woman 's job . Fusion and Confusion APOOR hurt honest fellow decided the other night that , what with the market the way it is , he would seek nut sonic inexpensive way of passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere and hearing La Guardia speak . Being in the neighborhood of the Fusion leader 's headquarters , he dropped in and asked where La Guardia was speaking that night . A man looked up from his desk and said Mr. La Guardia was not speaking that night . Another attacH challenged this with the statement that he thought Fiorcllo was making a tour of several rostrums . A third man said no , that he was speaking in just one place . The first man got hack into the game with the news that La Guardia had cancelled that one speech and was n't speaking anywhere . The caller ventured the suggestion that there might he an entry or a memo around somewhere , telling where Mr. La Guardia really was , and what he was doing . A search was accordingly made , but nothing came of it . " May I use your phone , then asked the visitor . He was shown to one , called a number , possibly Mayor Walker 's , and presently hung up , having found out what he wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment Music School , 466 Grand Street . boys , " he said . " Thanks , " said the La Guardia headquarters , as indeed they should have . Ticker News THE Great Days in Wall Street spread their effects in ever-widening circles . A gentleman boarding a crosstown car was bewildered when the conductor asked him if he might just glance at the afternoon paper he was carrying . The gentleman handed it over ; the conductor ruffled through the pages : " Closed at a hundred and ten , up a quarter , " he yelled to the motorman . The motorman clanged his bell , and the car proceeded . Incidentally , the newsboys around the Grand Central h t on a smart slogan for that fatal Tuesday 's news . " Read ' em and weep ! " they were yelling to the passing commuters . Yo-Yo THIS backwater hamlet has been very slow to discover Yo-Yo . Cities like Dallas and Birmingham knew about it long ago . Before ever the first Yo-Yo twirled in local drawing-rooms , . a lad from Texas named Delma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nearest mayor . Papers in prosperous cities began to hold Yo-Yo contests , like the World 's marble contest . Yo-Yo is a small yellow top with a groove in the centre . Around the axis is a string . We could describe it , but it would be simpler for you to buy one . You wind the string , drop the top , and give a hopeful little yank before it reaches the bottom of the spin . If you have uncanny gifts or arc m cahoots with leprechauns , you can make it twirl its way back up the string again . It 's apt to wobble , and if it wobbles you 're lost . If your name is Delma you can do " The Strut " and " The Spinner . " The printed directions that come with it say " you can invent many tricks yourself . " ( The only decent trick we 've invented so far is called " Putting It Away in the Desk . " ) Yo-Yo is supposed to be Filipino for " come back . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come " or " back hack , " but that 's because we do n't know Filipino . The story is that it is an ancient game of the Philippine Islands , but that it was reinvented in this country by a Santa Barbara bellboy
