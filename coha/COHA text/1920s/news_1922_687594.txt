" The federcil inspectors of income Ida ; returns have disallowed this increase 4,11. salary , Are they right or wrong ? Is there any regulation which forbids readjasting salaries at the end of the year ? ? J. C .. AnsWer  --  There is no regulation forbidding readjustment-of compensation at any time it is warranted , but for income tax purposes an increase in salary of an officer of a corporation out of proportion to the duties of his office is not allowed . Frequently this is forbiddeis , as in your case , where the inspector thinks that the increase is excessive , and in fixing the limit of compensation for income tax purposes a number of factors arc taken into consideration , including the estimated value of the services rendered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' same character , and any other factor that has a bearing on the situation .

I exchange bonds u inch cost me pair and am allowed more than par in making rite exchange for bonds of ( mother corporation , an : 1 liable to federal tax , on the difference between the cost and exchange price . providing the transaction is made for investment ' purposes ? ? H. P. Answer  --  If the bonds received are of like kind or use , that is , of the same " nature or quality " there is no gain or loss on the exchange . This is the requirement of regulations , but it is so general and allows for such a wide variety of interpretation , that it is difficult to state specifically what is required . If tax free municipal bonds are exchanged for taxable corporation bonds , it would hardly be an exchange for property of like " nature or quality " so far as income tax purposes are concerned . But from another point of ' view it might . But an exchange of railroad bonds for an automobile company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far as appears , not knowing the " nature or quality " of the bonds in question , your case is that of an exchange in which no gain results . At any rate , if we were at all doubtful we would regard it as an exchange in which no gain results , trusting that the indefiniteness of the regulations allows for sufficiently wide interpretation to inclutie our case in its provisions . income tax law differ .

It is similar to the situation in which the amount of income tax paid to the state is allowed as a deduction in computing federal income tax .

The New York law levies a tax On individual inheritances , as subdivided on delivery to - beneficiaries . The federal estate tax - is an item deductible by the estate before division . After division , no beneficiaries may make a deduction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Inlenty-fifth , " Loss on Reiddence "  - -  my situation is the reverse .

As attorney for a non-resident , you ought to become familiar with Section 217 of the law , and Articles 316 , 317 , 313 , and 322 of Regulations 62. attention has been called to your replies to hpe:ries Nor , 24694 and 24711. referring to profit or loss on sale of rf  --  idential property . It occurs to me that these two replies may mislead some taxpayer , and therefore take the liberty to call your attention to one or two Points in connection with same . - The replies and questions refer , of . rouis ? , to the old law , but it may not be ooticed by eaate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these Items . Seelien 206 provides for competing the tax separately on capital pain . Von will note that Paragraph . 6 . states , among r things ; " but does not include property held for the personal uste or consumption of the taxpayer or his in ' , Lily . " Regulation 62 , Article 1651 , among other ti , higs , states : " The term ' capital assets ' is defined to mean property of any kind it-literer acquired and held by the taxpayer for profit or investment for more than two years , ' whether or not connected with his trade or business , not including property ( for example . a dwelling ) held for the personal use or consumption of the taxpayer or his family . " You it ill thus see that the " replies " ore correct , in Hunt a tax would hole to be paid on a profit : swirl. : on a sale of this sort prior to the first of this year ; and also that a tax would hare to be paid on profit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ' , if the property was not used by the taxpayer himself as a dwelling . It is also true that profit on all sales of residential property under tire new late ' are not taxable. ? J. D. Answer  --  We do riot agree with you . The regulations , in defining income , include profit from the sale of property. , Just because a residence is excluded from the definition of capital assets , which by implication excludes profit on the sale of it from camputation of capital gain , does not mean that such profit is excluded altogether from ordinary taxable income . The regulations gay profit from sale of property is taxable , and loss from sale of residential property is not deductible . This makes profit on sale of such property taxable income , while it prohibits deduction of loss  --  a situation similar to that in other transactions from which gain or loss results . 24722 ?
