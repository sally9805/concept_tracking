During the 1924 presidential campaign , much was heard concerning the " Coolidge myth . " Democrats maintained that between the President 's capacity and the President 's reputation yawned a tremendous chasm , that a Republican press had created a fiction of a " strong , silent " White House occupant . When the President won the election with a plurality of 7,300,000 votes , they attributed his victory to the potency of the Coolidge " myth . " <P> To the mangling of this " myth " many Democratic journalists have dedicated their writing-none more vigorously than Frank R. Kent , Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Sun . Each day his Washington despatches appear in the Sun ; in them the President looks very much as if viewed through the wrong end of an opera glass . Is a White House conference " muzzled , " does a flood emergency inspire no extra session of Congress , Mr. Kent sharply , succinctly gives the anti-Administration aspect of the occurrence . <P> Last fortnight , for example , the President reviewed the United States Fleet . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A New Way to Review a Fleet . When Presidents Roosevelt , Wilson and Harding reviewed the Fleet , said Mr. Kent , " silk-hatted and frock-coated they stood rigidly on the bridges of their boats from the moment the first gun was fired until the last ship had passed . . . . Full dress is the order of the day . It is n't a matter of taste-it 's orders . And presence of the President on the bridge is essential to the review . . . . <P> " Apparently Mr. Coolidge did not know and was not informed about these things . . . . Anyhow , he is the first President to review the American Navy in a yachting cap and a business suit-but that is what he wore . Also he is the first President who left the bridge after 20 minutes of the review and , retiring to the stern of his boat , there had his picture taken and reclined for the rest of the two hours on a couch from which he could neither see nor be seen by the battleships as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington are humming today-and not in gratification . <P> " Apparently the spectacle did not interest the Commander-in-Chief-at least not to the point of complimenting the American Navy either by his presence and attention while it passed , or by recognizing the dignity of the occasion by wearing the regulation full-dress presidential uniform . . . . " <P> A day-by-day newspaper column is necessarily restricted to more or less isolated incidents-a magazine article gives fuller scope for a well-rounded discussion of a subject . Such an article Mr. Kent contributed , in August , 1924 , to the American Mercury , nor is there any evidence that his point of view has shifted since that date . Entitled " Mr. Coolidge , " the article began by maintaining that Washington correspondents , awed by the presidential office , eager for presidential esteem , always paint a President " a little prettier than he is.
