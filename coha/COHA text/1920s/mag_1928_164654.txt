Publisher William Randolph Hearst , splash-patriot , named newspaper after newspaper The ( Boston , New York , Chicago , Baltimore ) American . <P> If he had been less patriotic , more cosmic , he might have chosen Sun , World , Globe , Star , Comet , Meteor . <P> Didactic , self-righteous , he could have named his papers Citizen , Tribune , Sentinel , Monitor , Leader , Pilot . <P> Or , more humbly , he might have been content to watch , listen , report . Reportorial newspaper labels : Observer , Recorder , Review , Eye , Optic , Chronicle , Argus , Register , Messenger , Gazette , Herald , Telegram , Journal , Expositor , Reporter , Truth , Echo , Outlook , Spectator , Ledger , Bulletin , Mirror , News , Press . <P> It probably never occurred to him to name a newspaper The Bee . <P> In 1871 , Henry Justin Allen was three years old . But 1,000 miles or so west of Warren County , Pa. , where Baby Henry was learning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding life unusually busy . Within a few months he became 30 years old , a father and a newspaper owner . The baby he named Victor . The newspaper he called the Omaha Bee . <P> Neither choice was extraordinary . Victor was a good name for a child born in the Omaha of 1871 . Greatness seemed to hang over the young city , chartered only 14 years and already connected by telegraph with Chicago , St. Louis , even with distant San Francisco . Three years earlier , Telegrapher Rosewater had watched the spectacular , noisy entry of the railroads , the great Rock Island , Burlington and North Western systems . Across the Missouri river lay Iowa and prosperous Council Bluffs . The birth of Victor and of the Omaha Bee coincided almost exactly with the birth of the meat-packing industry in the city . Omaha seemed clearly destined to be an imperial , or at least victorious , city . <P> But industry was necessary , and the bee is the symbol of industry . For a newspaper , omnipresence was obviously desirable , and Telegrapher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stinging . Actually , it was a printing house employe who suggested the name . But Telegrapher Rosewater always thought it a happy choice . Similar reasons , later , influenced publishers in Bellefourche , South Dakota ; Owanka , South Dakota ; Braymer , Mo. ; Barnard , Kan . <P> No quoting Literary Digest existed in 1871 to extract the first strong utterances of the Omaha Bee . Staunchly Republican , the Omaha Bee fought many a battle with its senior , the Democratic Omaha World-Herald . Most fast , most furious , were the wars of 1894-96 , when a silver-tongued Boy Orator sat in the editor 's chair at the World-Herald offices . William Jennings Bryan was no mean antagonist . His personality still dominates the World-Herald . Such battles tested , strengthened the Omaha Bee , so that its name became a Literary Digest perennial . <P> William Randolph Hearst kept on naming his newspapers the American . Henry Justin Allen learned to talk , became editor and publisher of the Wichita ( Kan . ) Beacon , governor of Kansas ( 1919-23 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded his father , sold the Bee to a grain merchant named Nelson B. Updike , who merged it with the evening Omaha Daily News . Mr. Updike bought the Bee because he had an idea , stillborn , that he could send John Joseph Pershing to the White House . Another idea , successful , was to import Arthur Brisbane 's daily chitchat . The
