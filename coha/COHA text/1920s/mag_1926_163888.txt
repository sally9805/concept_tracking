Son <P> In Manhattan , a month ago , detectives observed the conduct of a raggedy , bearded " bummer " on an elevated railway platform ; questioned him , arrested him , took him to court , whence he departed with a pocketful of money given by court attendants who thought they knew a good old scoundrel when they saw one . <P> He was Pat Crowe , " outlaw , author and lecturer , " whose misdemeanors began with robbing Omaha streetcars in 1890 and included a diamond theft , homicidal attempts , a visit to and escape from Joliet prison , hold-ups and pilfering on railroads . Lately Pat Crowe has been going straight , the foeman of crime and drink . Pamphlets that stuffed their author 's pockets said : " The best man we have this side of eternity is the man who warns us of possible danger . . . . Beware of hypocrites and deceivers who sit in high places . " <P> Last week , a detective in Washington , D. C. , was reminiscing to newspaper reporters about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ) to kidnap John Davison Rockefeller .

Many years have passed . Pat Crowe has gone straight . And newspaper readers discovered how false was the impression they have had of Cudahy Jr . ever since Pat Crowe 's kidnaping trial .

J. , the undergraduate daily newspaper of the university there situate prints a perennial advertisement : <P> Come to JOE 'S There you get those good Majestic Sandwiches There you get a small check cashed <P> It is honest advertising . Majestic sandwiches are - majestic . And all the " small checks " that black-haired , sleepy-eyed Joe has cashed for empty-pocketed freshmen must by now tot up a figure somewhere near what Joe 's countrymen , the Italians , borrowed from the U. S. during the War . Obliging to a fault , Joe shifts his cigar-stub , bends upon his supplicants the most perfunctory glance of appraisal , punches his register and hands over five , ten , fifteen dollars with out demur . Sometimes the scribbled slips he takes to the bank come back marked " No Funds " or " Unknown . " But not often . Joe 's advertisement and his faith in man continue .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
