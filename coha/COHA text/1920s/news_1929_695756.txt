txt HAVANA NOT ALL SINISTER . Capital of Cuba Contains Many Inspiring and Beautiful Sights for Tourists I desire to clarify certain statements contained in THE TIMES article , " New World Paris More Like Madrid . " The article refers to the City of Havana and more In particular to its points of interest to the visiting American . It is stated that " in . Morro Castle the tourists will see the chute through which during the wars of liberty Cuban prisoners were shot down into the sharks ' nest , " and in a subsequent paragraph that " a group of forty students were lined up and every fifth shot to appease the military blood lust , the charge being that they had slurred a Spaniard who had fallen in a duel with a Cuban . " Qualifications Advisable . Both statements should be qualified . So far as I know there is no historical authority for the assertion that the chute in Morro Castle was ever employed for the purpose of disposing of the bodies of those who gave their lives in a holocaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionists were , for the most part , effected in the " Foso de los Laureles , " which is in the Cabana fortress . As for the students , the gory episode was not enacted to appease the military blood lust . The main factor in bringing about the execution of the unfortunate young men was the autocratic sway held by the body of volunteers of Havana , which in the history of the Cuban revolution invariably played a most distressing role , having not only antagonized the legitimate aspirations of the Cuban patriots but the cause of Spain as well . Furthermore , the students were not accused of merely slurring a Spaniard who had fallen in a duel with a Cuban , hut of having desecrated his grave . Some of the victims were sons of Spaniards , and one of them was the scion of a powerful Spanish family which offered to pay his weight in gold to save him from execution . More Inspiring Things . Liut there are other things less gruesome . and far more inspiring to the American tourist in the capital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may counteract the unsavory and depressing legend of the sharks , raucously megaphoned to the tourist while within the grim walls of El Morro , will be a visit to the Spanish clubs and hospitals . These institutions , the peer of which would probably be sought in vain , constitute an honor to the different branches of the Spanish colony , their only sponsors and devisers , and also to the Cuban nation within which they have prospered and flourished . The Spanish societies , Centro Asturian ? , Centro G'allego and Centro de Dependientes , to name only the outstanding ones , are all installed in sumptuous buildings of impressive proportions . Their roster contains many thousands of members . The privilege of membership is extended to Spaniards and Cubans alike , and members are entitled to attendance at the schools conducted by the centros and to free treatment and surgical operations as often as necessary in the most up-to-date hospitals in the world . The centros also have their savings departments and in times of economic crisis have repatriated at their own expense all the Spaniards that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a public burden . FRANCISCO New London , Conn. , Dec. 31 , 1923 . THE SLIGHTED R. A correspondent of TEE TI : . , E.1 , in commenting on the disappearance of the letter r from the spoken language of the American people , goes pretty far afield in ascribing to conscious imitation of the British upper classes what is for the most part due to laziness . The enunciation of r following a vowel requires some effort which most people are disinclined to make , more especially that element of our population residing south of the Mason-Dixon line . As I was walking down Pennsylvania Avenue the other evening this gem of speech floated in upon my ear from the circuniambient air : " Ah wade wown moh'n uh owah foh 'm , smawn , ' nee din show up , " which being interpreted meant , " I waited around more than an hour for him this morning and he did n't show up . " The dress . manner , and general appearance of the speaker indicated a person whose defects of pronunciation were probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible explanation would be that the warm climate has an enervating effect upon all classes in that region , inclining them to an extreme economy of effort in uttering their thoughts . The above phonetic reproduction may look cryptic in print , but no one whc , heard him could mistake his meaning . It will be observed that w does duty for r in " Wowrn , " also that other consonants , inconvenient to articulate , suffer a change amounting in some instances to complete obliteration . C. Q. YOUNG . Washington , D. 0 . , Jan. 1 , 1929 . SAVING TELEPHONE TIME . Figuring on the premise that telephone users In this country make more than 200,000,000 calls a year , an estimate is made to show the cost of using the needless word " Hello " and other time-wasters . Worse than the " hell-lo-o " man is the person with a cigarette or a wad of chewing gum in his mouth who speaks so indistinctly that he gets a wrong number and then " bawls out " Central for it . In many places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is the man who has an office boy call up busy people and order them to " hold the wire . " In order to impress the one called with the prominence of the boss of the office boy a busy roan is kept waiting for some favor to be asked . G. M. BEERBOWER . Hollywood , Fla. , Dec. 31 , 1928 . PASSPORT TROUBLES , For a country that boasts of progress we are woefully conservative . The civilizes countries are waiting for us to abolish the passports as obsolete , yet we travelers , ten years after the armistice , are treated as if the war was still on . From a small town I ordered the necessary papers for my wife , myself and two nieces . I received four passports at $10 each . I found out too late that one passport would have been sufficient , as the girls were minors . We were in Europe eighteen months and those passports cost me in all $360 . The which gave me to think , as I came from the old country in 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy it cost $80 for passports in 1926 . VICTOR SIMON . Itoche.der , Y. Jan. 1 , 1929.
