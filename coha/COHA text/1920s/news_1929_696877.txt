txt We had headed for Axel Heiberg Glacier . We knew that Amundsen had reported the highest point of the pass there 10,500 feet high , with towering peaks on each side , but would they be so close together that air currents would dash us to the ground , hovering as we would be . with our heavy load near the absolute ceiling of the plane , near the altitude where the controls of the plane no longer function ? To the right was another great glacier we had seen on - our baselaying flight . It looked passable . But was it ? It appeared , wide enough . Were there mountains beyond that would block us ? over which we could not fly ? The top of the pass was dartly cloud covered .. - Would Axel Heiberg Glacier be entirely cloud covered ? Clouds so frequently hover around the tops of these mountains , even on the clearest days . Fog Forming While Fliers Conferred on Course . The sun on the bare . vertical rocks sends up warm currents which , striking the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would we choose the unknown ' lacier ? If we should fail to get over and have to turn back down the glacier to select another pass we could not reach the Pole . The gas would be too low . We would have to turn back to Little America . It seemed a flip of the coin . We decided to stake success on the unknown glacier to the right . The white clouds around the mountains that bounded the top of the pass to the right and left merged with white in the centre of the pass . Was it snow or clouds , and , if clouds , could we fly above them ? Would the clouds stretch over the plateau to the South Pole , making flying impossible ? Danger of Collision With Cloud-Hidden Peaks . We would have to keep out of clouds while dodging around among the mountains , for in the clouds we would almost certainly collide with a peak . Soon we had passed near our little cache.of food . and gasoline more than a mile above it . It was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude . When we had landed at that base the mountain ridge running in an easterly and westerly direction about four miles south of it loomed above us from the snow as a very large mountain . Now we could see behind it , and to the south , southeast and southwest were great towering peaks that made our base mountain look like a pigmy . We realized forcefully then how very little indeed the foot traveler sees . Now below us was the ice line of the Great Glacier . For a distance it was terribly crevassed , cracks running parallel , looking like a great washing board  --  not a good landing place . Awed by Huge Shapes Carved by Ice of Ages . The mountain peaks and formations that were in our view now were awe-inspiring in their majesty , terrible in the colossal shapes that had been carved into extraordinary jagged and rounded forms by ice cutting through them for the untold years that the bottom of the world has been in the clutches of an ice age . As we eagerly looked around we felt very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , since the childhood of mankind , have symbolized its aspiration . Everywhere we looked was some formation probably no living thing had ever before seen , for this area , the coldest on the earth , is dead . and June Struggling for Pictures . But there was little time for such thoughts . Our plane was a busy plane  --  a great contrast to our lifeless surroundings . There was with his great aerial camera , elated at his opportunity to record for geography the unknown things about him , snapping picture after picture and panting from his strenuous efforts in the rarefied air of our high altitude  --  the air bumps throwing him about as he aimed his fifty-pound camera through the window . But all of it did n't prevent him from looking around and smiling at us occasionally . Good old Mac , an invincible , straight-shooting fellow to whom ' one ca n't help becoming attached . There was Harold June cranking away at his moving-picture camera to get a panorama of the mountains or dashing over to the radio to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The critical time has come now , the moment we had discussed a thousand times . What had been our gasoline consumption. ? Would we have enough left to reach the Pole ? Would we have too much aboard to climb over the hump ? Calmly , even tranquilly , Harold stands examining the gauges of the five gas tanks in the great wing . Then he unscrews the cap of the tank in the fuselage and measures , with a graduated stick , the gas left in that tank . Then he cuts open some of the sealed five-gallon tins , dumrs the gas into the tank so that we can throw the tins overboard . Each can weighs hardly a pound  --  but every pound counts at the critical ceiling of the plane . He figures for a moment on a pad and hands me the result with a smile . We have enough gas to go beyond the Pole if we do n't have to dump any . Then Harold looks at the engines , listens to their hum and examines the gauges . Harold is as expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Balchen Tense in Fight to Gain Altitude . There was Bernt concentrating on his fight to gain altitude , still with uncertainty ahead , for the glacier was a long one and the lowest point of the pass before us was still above the nose of the plane . The confused air currents from the cliffs had begun to toss the plane about more violently . We could note tenseness and strain on Bernt 's face as he put himself into the job he was doing so well . As I stood there at his shoulder , there flashed into my mind for a moment the time we were tossed about in the night storm clouds in the inky blackness over France on the transatlantic flight . I have a good many reasons to know the stuff that is in Bernt . In the air and on the ground he plays the game , always true , a capable and dependable man . Lee Side of Pass Hugged as Wind Increased . The air began to get rougher . Bernt hugged the peaks on the lee side of the pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry the plane up than down . We were getting close to the highest altitude the plane could reach . A 9,000-foot peak was near us on our right and the wind from our left was striking it and being shot upward , helping us up , we thought . The altimeter showed 10,000 feet , but we could not depend on that . The barometer here was likely to read the same as over Little America because of local pressure changes . Our weight was a bit over 13,000 pounds . To the right we saw some deep gorges that surely would mean turbulent air . Bernt eased over to the left , where there was a long , fairly smooth slope running up to a peak , some 15,000 feet high . He avoided the turbulent area , but the down-currents here made more difficult the fight for altitude . The ailerons failed to respond and the wheel turned loosely in Bernt 's hands . Still we were not high enough safely to get over the pass ahead . Glimpsed Plateau Through the Clouds . We saw now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks to the right and left . ? It was a critical moment . The air was too rarefied to hold up our heavy load . Bernt yelled in my ear above the roar of the engines : " We must drop 200 pounds immediately or go back . " Harold was standing by the dump valve of our fuselage tank . A little pressure on the valve and we could let go 600 pounds of gasoline . If we dumped that gas , we could not reach the Pole and get back to the base . Food was the only thing left to throw overboard , but would it be fair to those three fellows if we dumped precious food ? We would be a long time on the Plateau if we should have a forced landing . We had the food packed in 125-pound bags near the trapdoor ready for quick action . " A bag of food overboard , " I yelled to Harold . Dumping Has Immediate Effect . He signaled to Mac , who was standing by the trapdoor . " Shall I do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , - 23- 1 of the brown bags . Bernt looked around and smiled . That little weight had an immediate effect . A plane , when it is hovering near its absolute ceiling , is like a balloon . A few pounds overboard will make her shoot up . Things were better now , but I was not sure it was fair to those fellows to dump food . Bernt was now easing over to the right , where luckily it was clear over the lowest part of the pass . We would get out of the descending currents and probably be helped by the ascending ones . - We were not high enough yet . I looked around . Mac was hard at work with his camera . No matter what would happen , he had to record those mountains . I felt then that if we had gone down in a tail spin , Mac would have taken pictures on the way down . If there had been time , I might have told Mac he would have to throw his heavy camera overboard to gain altitude . Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am sure he would have followed his camera through the trap door . Gain Altitude , but Slowly . Harold went nonchalantly about his many duties as if it were all in a day 's work . When he listened to the engines , his pleasure plainly showed in his face . The great Cyclone and two Whirlwinds went on roaring sweetly . If one of them should stop , down we would go to the glacier , unless we could dump many hundred pounds very quickly . We had gradually gained more altitude , but not enough . A few hundred feet now might make the difference between success or dismal failure . How much hung upon those few hundred feet ! It was very rough now and Mac and Harold could hardly hold their feet . Very slowly we went up . Suddenly the wheel turned loosely in Bernt 's hands . " Quick ! Dump more ! " he shouted . I pointed to another bag of food . Mac shoved it through the trapdoor and we watched her hit the glacier . Two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four men , lies out there on that lifeless glacier . Head . Out on Plateau for the Pole . Again it did the trick . We seemed to shoot up . We could not let any more food go . Nor could we dump gasoline and have any reserve supply left for reaching the Pole . There was nothing more to dump . We must make it . The minutes went very slowly . At last we reached the pass . We had a few hundred feet to spare . Bernt gave a shout of joy . There were no mountains beyond the pass . The plateau stretched ahead , cloudless and glistening in the sun , giving an unobstructed route to the Pole . We were over the dreaded hump . The Pole lay dead ahead over the horizon .
