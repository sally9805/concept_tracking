There was oratory , humor , poetry , vituperation and blatherskitism in Congress last week . Most of it was directed against President Coolidge 's and Secretary Kellogg 's policy in Nicaragua and Mexico . The Administration read about it , no doubt : but he 'd stubbornly to its own ideas on U. S. foreign policy . Could the following representatives of the people have spoken in vain ? <P> Senator Borah oi Idaho , of course , orated before crowded galleries ; suggested that the U. S. keep the marines in Nicaragua only long enough to supervise an election , which President Diaz should authorize , to elect a new President . Mr. Borah wound up with stirring generalizations : " Inaugurate a campaign of peace . . . get in touch with the masses . " <P> Senator LaFollette of Wisconsin produced some curt prose worthy of his mighty father : " This document Mr. Kellogg 's Bolshevist evidence is the flimsiest sort of propaganda . If it had emanated from any other source than the Secretary of State I venture the assertion that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication . It would have gone not to the composing room , but to the waste basket . " <P> Representative Huddleston of Alabama said early in the week : " The whole maneuver seems to be something like trying to pick up a pin with an immense pair of blacksmith 's tongs . . . . " <P> Senator Norris of Nebraska , himself no mean versifier , parodied James Whitcomb Riley 's Little Orphant Annie with especial reference to Secretary Kellogg : <P> Onc't they was a Bolshevik , who would n't say his prayers- So Kellogg sent him off to bed , away upstairs . An ' Kellogg heered him holler , an ' Coolidge heered him bawl . But when they tur n't the kivvers down , he was n't there at all ! They seeked him down in Mexico , they cussed him in the press ; They seeked him ' round the Capitol , an ' everywhere I guess But all they ever found of him was whiskers , hair and clout- An ' the Bolsheviks I 'll get you ef you do n't watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , Moses of New Hampshire were the chief defenders of the Administration .
