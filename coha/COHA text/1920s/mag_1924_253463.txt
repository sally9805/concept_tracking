C. T. Troutman , sufferer from tumor of the brain , was under treatment at the Fort Wayne Hospital , Indiana . Surgeons despaired . An operation , they declared , was hopeless . The patient went to Dr. Charles H. Frazier , Director of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital , an institution where operations are performed which command medical attention and newspaper notoriety . For five hours and forty minutes , Troutman was under the knife ; six surgeons and physicians , with their assistants , were in action . The patient was so weak that ether could not be administered ; a local anesthetic dulled the pain but not the mind of Troutman , who , throughout the ordeal , exchanged quips and jokes with the surgeons . Once , he laughed . Beyond all expectation , this feat of surgery was successful . Again the doctors of the University Hospital have arrested the attention of the press ; again they have saved the life of a man in extremity .                @ @ @ @ @
