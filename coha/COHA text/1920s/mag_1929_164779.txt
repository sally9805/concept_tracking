In the Protestant Episcopal Church a dean is not a bishop 's pawn , but deans and bishops go together . Where there is a bishop , there is a cathedral ( in most cases ) ; where a cathedral is , there is a dean . Since deans and bishops must see each other constantly to do ghostly and secular business together , it is well that they should dwell together in charity . Not always is this the case . Last winter Manhattan 's Bishop William Thomas Manning , high-church authoritarian , fell out with Dean Howard Chandler Robbins , broad-church independent ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) . Said Dean Robbins : " There is a fundamental difference of opinion as to the rights of the dean . " Dean Robbins resigned , became professor of pastoral theology at General Theological Seminary , Manhattan , principal training school of Episcopal deacons . <P> So deanless since May has been the great ( 37-years-abuilding ) Cathedral of St. John the Divine . But last week Bishop Manning nominated as Dean Robbins ' successor Dr. Milo Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . On Nov. 26 the Cathedral 's board of trustees will meet , consider the nomination and vote . <P> Dr. Gates is a close friend of Bishop Manning . Short , round , bespectacled , 63 , with plump , mild face and greyish head , he dislikes to be called high-church , prefers " oldfashioned Episcopalian . " He has been head of the parish of the Intercession more than 25 years . Born in Gardner , Mass. , he is a graduate of Amherst ( nine years before Calvin Coolidge ) , the General Seminary , St. Stephen 's College . He is known as a good preacher , scholar of church architecture , president of the Sanctity of Marriage Society which seeks to keep divorced persons from remarrying in the Church , 32nd-degree Mason , national chaplain of the National Association of Masonic Square Clubs . The Editing Committee for the recent revision of the Prayer Book ( TIME , Oct. 21 ) listed Dr. Gates as a member , but he could not go to Boston to read proof . He declared he trusted implicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week gave his congregation jovial news . Said he : " Saints are everywhere . Everyone here is a saint . In visiting prisons I find saints . A saint is anybody in the world trying to do the best he can with the help of God . "
