Scars of Jealousy . It was well past mid-afternoon in Thomas H. Ince 's Hollywood ranch and the visiting stockholders were thirsty for another picture . Tugging viciously at the bellpull , which , from seeing his own pictures , Mr. Ince seriously believed to be a correct as well as expensive convenience , the great man summoned Lambert Hillyer , his director . <P> " Hillyer , " he said , " go out in the pantry and mix up another picture . " <P> Mr. Hillyer retired to the pantry and opened Mr. Ince 's cabinet of well-aged ingredients . He poured in a bit of ruffled silk ancestry in the French Court . His eye fell on the " Southern Stuff " label and jumped his story a few hundred years . He injected a shot of chorus girls in ' a Southern mansion and three fingers of " Poor White " mountain life . He stirred in a murder and falsely accused his hero . A hot bit from the " Forest Fire " cruet and a dash of " Blood Hounds " finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors , he presented it to the stockholders . <P> " The Real Old Stuff , " they said , smacking their lips . <P> The Rustle of Silk . Better than average acting is dissipated in the weakly wandering film from Cosmo Hamilton 's novel . Betty Compson , Conway Tearle , Anna Nilsson , and Cyril Chadwick are asked to convince the customers that a girl will become a lady 's maid simply to bask in the presence of her beloved-the lady 's husband . Their love fuses . Finally , the hero becomes Prime Minister . There are flashbacks of Watteau shepherdesses and a few shootings . Out of the conglomerate mass it is possible that there are two or three selected bits which will appeal to everyone . Possibly also there are two or three beings in each audience who will enjoy the entire adventure . But it 's pretty hard to fool all-even of the morons-all of the time . <P> Vanity Fair . Mabel Ballin plays " Becky Sharp " with all the vapid fascination of a nurse girl enlisting a park policeman for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair is rather gruesome . One can only hope that Thackeray is sufficiently diverted by his celestial activities to omit a mundane interlude for inspection of the ruin of his novel in the motion picture galleries .
