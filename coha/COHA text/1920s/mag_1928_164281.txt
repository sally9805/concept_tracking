The greatest Scandinavian man of letters was born , just a century ago , the son of a bankrupt merchant in the small Norwegian town of Skien . As a boy Henrik Ibsen was apprenticed to an apothecary and helped to grind powders , make pills and mix possets . Because he did not stick to that trade , but became a great poet and a greater dramatist , all Norway united , last week , to honor his birth-cen tenary with impressive ceremonies and revivals of his greatest plays at Oslo , Norwegian capital , and in Bergen , the sea port where he lived and labored for the theatre in his early years . <P> The U. S. was represented in Oslo by 75-year-old Robert Underwood Johnson , onetime editor of the Century Magazine , onetime U. S. Ambassador to Italy ( 1920-21 ) . He bore illuminated parchment scrolls of greeting from various literary societies and hobnobbed with 98 other delegates from 19 countries . All were bounteously entertained by King Haakon VII of Norway . <P> Between banquets and lectures , at Oslo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gala performances at the National Theatre of six Ibsen plays : 1 ) Brand ( 1866 ) , the tragic story of a clergyman who places duty to God majestically above earthly love but is killed by an earthly avalanche ; 2 ) The League of Youth ( 1869 ) , one of Ibsen 's few boisterous comedies ; 3 ) Ghosts ( 1881 ) , in which a son is smitten by Fate in the guise of inherited venereal disease ; 4 ) An Enemy of the People ( 1882 ) , wherein the honesty of one man makes him the enemy of ordinary folk ; 5 ) The Wild Duck ( 1884 ) , a play about a sensitive girl who commits suicide when she learns that she is illegitimate ; 6 ) Rosmersholm ( 1886 ) in which a husband and wife and " other woman " hound each other until they all commit suicide . <P> After this heroic dose of pills and possets for the intellect , the delegates climbed aboard a special train and sped across the Norwegian Alps to Bergen . <P> There at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gynt ( 1867 ) , the play which takes its name from a hero who typifies the convivial weaknesses which Ibsen thought that he detected in many of his countrymen . <P> The peculiar significance of Ibsen in Norway can not be realized unless it is remembered that he was of Danish , not Norwegian , stock and chose to pass much of his manhood and old age away from Norway on the Continent of Europe . Thus he came more readily to achieve international fame , but lost touch with Norwegians who were then flocking in rapturous admiration around a playwright-demagogue who is scarcely known outside of Norway , Bjornstjerne Bjornson , " The Old Bear . " <P> To this day nine Norwegians out of ten still emotionally prefer Bjornson to Ibsen , while recognizing with gratitude that the fame of Ibsen has " put Norway on the map , " for ignorant millions would otherwise scarcely differentiate it from Denmark or Sweden . Perhaps the most familiar tradition of Ibsen is that of an old man who would sit for hours at a bay window of the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes at the bodies of his countrymen but piercing their souls with uncanny insight . His reward is that the theatre-goers of today , who constitute for him " posterity , " have already witnessed a greater number of showings of each of his major plays than the sum total of productions of Abie 's Irish Rose .
