At that jungle-covered spot of northern South America , where Venezuela , British Guiana and Brazil touch each other angularly , is Mt . Roraima , famed among travelers and explorers . It is a huge wall of red rock that rises , like a ruddy tree trunk , 1,500 ft. sheer above the surrounding plateau and altogether some 8,500 ft. above sea level . It seems unscalable . <P> However , a party of explorers from the American Museum of Natural History , who were back in Manhattan last week pallid from malaria , recently reached the top by following a ledge* that ran thinly up Mt . Roraima from the Brazilian side . Atop Mt . Roraima they found themselves on a remarkably flat tableland , 12 miles square , something like the flat land of Arizona through which the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River cuts . <P> From flat Mt . Roraima the explorers-T . D. Carter , G. H. H. Tate and G. M. Tate ( younger brother of G. H. H. ) - leveled their binoculars across lower flat-topped mountains towards Brazil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent rain &; mist , water dropping in a vertical fall 2,000 feet . They saw water flowing south down rills , brooks , creeks , rivers to the Amazon and thence eastward to the Atlantic ; they saw dripping from jungle trees moisture that was to flow north through the muddy Orinoco and the cascading Essequibo rivers into the Caribbean . <P> Quaint birds , animals and reptiles moved about them-atop Mt . Roraima , and on the plateau below . Mr. Carter killed a jaguar as it was feeding on its kill , a colt . The elder Mr. Tate killed a poisonous bushmaster snake five feet long just after he had stepped across it in the dark . One of their 130 Arecuna Indian porters hacked with his machete at a 14-ft. anaconda until it was dead and ready for eating . ( Anaconda flesh tastes something like chicken . ) They snared birds , netted insects , disinterred ground plants , culled orchids from their treeholds , pounced on small beasts . Rare among their catches was a variety of the Thomas rat , second of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Museum . ) They also trapped five strange mice with sharp noses , beady eyes and long claws , more a digger than a gnawer type of creature . Altogether in their bales , sacks , boxes and cages the explorers brought back to the American Museum of Natural History , and last week were sorting , 1,260 birds , 350 mammals , innumerable plants . <P> <P> * Discovered first in 1884 , but rarely trod since .
