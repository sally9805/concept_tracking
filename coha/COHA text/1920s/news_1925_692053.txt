txt Secretary of the Treasury Mellon , appearing before the House Ways and Means Committee proposed tax reduction , totaling between $2-50,000,000 and $300.000,000 , giving assurance that this sum can safely be spared . He advocated fixing the maximum normal tax at f , ' " , and the maximum surtax at 20r-i ; urged repeal of the federal estate tax . T  --  ft tax and certain miscellaneous taxes . declared strongiy for repeal of the public.ty provision of the present law . and asked a constitutional amendment pronihdting the Issuance of tax exempt securities . This statement follows in part : " Probable receipts and expenditures car . be fairly accurately estimated for the fiscal . year ending June .7,0 , 1926 , and with somewhat les . certainty for the next fiscal year . In June , last , the President stated that the probable surplus for the current fiscal year would be *290,000,000 . AIMITT ? 10X211 . ? XPF : - . S ..

For example $10,000,000 will have to be added for pensions and 22,000,000 for contributions to the states for hard roads and additional amounts to customs and internal - revenue refunds . The prin , ipul item , however . of additional expenditure which must be made this year , for adjusted compensation .

The act further appropriated for January 1 . 1925. for this purpose .100,000.000 . In the appropriation bill-of the last session , $50.000,000 was arbitrarily taken as the amount needed to pity premiums due January I. 1926. though it was impossible then to estimate acre rate ' tl , r amounts necessary . From the applications now in and from those that can now reasonably he expected to be filed by January 1 . 1926 , these two appropriat , ons should total ts256.000,000 instead of $1 ; 50.000.000 . This w ill necessitate a supplemental appropriation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures as estimated June . REVENUE ENEETLESTIMAPIIEE " W e underestimated the enormous increase in taxable incomes through the slight reform carried in the 1924 act . A review of our estimates permits us to add over $190,000,000 of tax revenue to our expected receipts . Taking into account other adjustments in expenditures and receipts , it is now estimated that the surplus for 1926 will come close to $290,000,000 . " For 1927 the budget has not yet determined the ' total of expenditures which will be necessary to run the government . I think , however , that the surplus in 1927 , with revenue based , of course , upon the present tax bill , set ... el ' , be between $28a , eine , 000 and This ; it seems to me. is a figure which it is safe totake as the amount by which taxes can now be permanently reduced . " A reform in taxation such as a reduction of the high surtaxes increases the taxable incomes through stimulation of business and productive investment , so that what apparently would be a loss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut revenue beyond the reasonable requirements of the government . In this connection , remember that since the war period we have been living partially upon capital . I refer to the return of our investment in the War Finance Corp. , repayment of loans to railroads , the sale of surplus supplies , etc . As these sources give out , we will have to pay our current expenses out of current revenue . It seems to the Treasury that we should keep this figure of $250,000,000 to $300 , - 000,000 as our goal of tax reduction . itmsrutessimissr OF Eneerr " Estimates of probable receipts . from taxation are of course not always borne out by results . For instance , prosperity of corporations in one year is reflected irt the dividends received by their stockholders in the later years Mr. McCoy , government actuary , has his own method of figuring . I confess I do not always understand it , but he certainly obtains remarkably accurate results . All of the estimates are gathered together and at a conference , the differences are threshed out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the subject from a practical and two different theoretical viewpoints , I think we achieve as accurate a result as is obtainable . The suggestion has been made that we are retiring our public debt too rapidly . It is argued that the present generation should not pay but should pass the debt on to a later generation . Taking the people as a whole , there is nothing in this argument . The money represented by the debt was spent for the war. - The evidence of the debt , the bonds , are all held in this country . If the first generation passed on to the second generation the burden of paying the debt , at the same time the second generation must inherit the bonds representing the debt , so the second generation would receive both a liability and its equivalent asset . No net burden would pass . While taking the people as a whole it is immaterial when the debt is paid , still , as between different classes of people , the investing class holding the bonds and the producing class from whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may exist . We should not tax too heavily the producers to pay the security holders . It is for this reason that we have sought a balance between debt reduction and tax reduction . souncies or nr.irr mr-oticrioN " If we analyze the sources by which our debt has been reduced nearly $5,000,000,000 from its peak to June 30. 1925 , they are as follows : Over $1,033,000,000 , or 20% , has come from a decrease in the general fund balance ; $1,678,000,000 , or 33% , from the surplus ; $1,423,000.000 , or 23% , from the sinking fund , and the balance from miscellaneous sources , including foreign repayments . " The decrease in the general fund balance means that the Treasury has been able to reduce its cash in bank by over $1,000,000,000 . This shows economy in the operaLori of the Treasury , since so long as we are borrowing money we ought not to carry any more cash than we need . The present working balance , however , is as low as we can safely go . In September . for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This 20% factor of debt reduction will have no influence in the future . There are , however , certain factors which must continue the orderly retirement of the debt . Roughly $20,000,000.000 of war debt is represented one-half by money spent by America in the war and one-half by money loaned to the Allies . A sinking fund based on 2211. % of the $10,000. - 000,000 used domestically was established in 1919 and it was intended that the $10,000,000,000 loaned abroad should be taken care of by repayment of the loans by the foreign borrowers . Here we have a two-fold arrangeihent for retirement of the war debt . In the public debt structure one obligation has no distinction over another . Each is based solely on the credit of the United States irrespective of rate of interest , date , or maturity . It is one debt . EARNED INCOME On earned income , Secretary Mellon said : " In the 1924 act it . was declared that all income under $5,000 was earned and no income in excess of $10,000 could be considered earned . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many men do not earn the first $5,000 of then ? income and many others earn much more than $10,000 . We appreciate , however , the difficulty of a definition accurately to describe what income is earned and what not earned . Again if the surtaxes are placed at a normal figure this inequality in taxation is not so pronounced and may be ignored . " Secretary Mellon favored the retention of admission tax ; the retention of the automobile taxes so long as the federal government is contributing over $90,000,000 a year to roads over which these automobiles run and the repeal of the tax on artworks . Replying to quest-Pons , Mr. Mellon said he had figured the normal tax brackets should be reduced from 2% to 1 , - ss. % , from 4% to 3% and from 67 , to 5% respectively . Replying to Representative Garner the secretary said that the Treasury would have no serious objections to a plan to repeal the capital stock tax , at the same time increasing by the same amount the corporation tax , now 12%% . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Means Committee by President Simmons of the New York Stock Exchange . There is no hearing scheduled for today but on Wednesday the sections relating to Beard of Tax Appeals will be discussed by a representative of that board . " We come now to the other principal factor in debt reduction , that of surplus , which has accounted to date for over one-third of the reduction in our debt . It is proposed to exhaust this surplus by reducing taxes . This is sound policy . A surplus of government receipts over expenditures should be distributed just as the profits of any other . mutual organization are distributed , among its members  --  the taxpayers  --  through a reduction in their forced contributions to the state . " Of the three factors in the reduction of the debt , ' eduction in the general fund balance will have no effect in the future . It is intended that the surplus be exhausted by tax reduction . There remain only the sink , ing fund and foreign repayments . It is admitted the Congress has the legal authority to repudiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign repayments . It is denied that it has the moral authority . This government has yet to break faith with the investors in its securities . Money taken to pay the public debt is not lost . The time to pay your debts is when you can . TAX REFORMS " In determining what taxes should be first reduced , it is important to bear in mind the distinction between a reduction of taxes which reforms the tax system and -a reduction in taxes which simply reduces revenue . It has been the experience of - the Treasury that every time there has been a material reduction in surtaxes it has stimulated business and brought about an increase in taxable income which has made up a great part , if not all , of the loss in revenue from the higher incomes .
