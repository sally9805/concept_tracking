" By far the largest one , in fact an account receivable larger than any which has ever been known since the Chinese first invented an adding machine , he would find to be in excess of ten billion dollars . As nearly as Secretary Mellon 's secretaries can figure , it is $10,556,804,223.40 . Accrued interest is almost two billion more , making twelve .
