According to the Constitution , it is the duty of the President to administer and enforce the laws of the land , to advise the Congress on the state of the Union , etc . The Constitution does not require the President to be the great moral preceptor of the people . President Coolidge has taken unto himself this extra-legal duty , as has many another President . The late Theodore Roosevelt used to dispense moral pap while he was tossing the " big stick , " like a juggler chatting with his audience while his eggs are in the air . President Coolidge , however , in his speech on the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Trenton last week , confined himself to revolutionary history and morality . Excerpts : <P> Luxury .

Our people ought to desire to be prosperous , but it ought not to be their main desire . There are other things that they ought to want more . Prosperity is not a cause ; it is a result It is all summed up in a single word . It is character . " <P> Mind &; Soul . " Under our institutions the only way to perfect our government is to perfect the individual citizen . It is necessary to reach the mind and the soul of the individual . I know of no way that this can be done save through the influences of religion and education . " <P> If . " If the world had complete change of heart , complete moral disarmament , complete mutual understanding , complete sympathy , we would have little need of armaments and no need at all for international treaties limiting their use and size .
