George Wharton Pepper , Senator from Pennsylvania , presented a resolution " advising " the President to call a world conference which should be a spiritual successor of the Hague Conferences of 1894 and 1907 . It would discuss armament , law , dissociation of the present World Court from the League . <P> Before he could expound the wherefores of his resolution , senatorial fulminating began . Two Virginians thrust home as follows : <P> Mr. Swanson , ironically : " The Hague conferences were so effective in preventing war and so effective in producing disarmament that the Senator thinks they should be reconvened , having been so effective in this respect in the past . " <P> Mr. Glass , measuredly : " I just want to suggest to the Senator from Pennsylvania that it seems to me his reason in its last analysis means just this , that the United States having refused to associate with other nations of the world , is now proposing to extend to other nations of the world an invitation to associate with the United States .
