txt Some market students argue that a company earning $10 a share annually on its stock is entitled to sell at $100 a share . A company that can show $20 a share , $200 ; and $30 a share , $300 , and so on down the list . This claim few will dispute " provided such earnings can be maintained year in and year out . " These are prosperous times for a majority of the large corporations and earnings of many of them are equal to 10 ? 7. of their respective market valuations . Earnings may reach even higher figures before prosperity reaches its peak . But it must not be forgotten that in the next period of depression some companies that are earning $10 , $20 and $30 a share may not earn half of what they are earning now . Many companies are likely to report deficits after dividends . This has been the case in past periods of depression and the next is not likely to prove an exception to the rule . The earnings of many branches of industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches more uniform . The latter generally hold their stock market gains better than the corporations whose earnings are subject to v.ide fluctuations . There are many stocks selling between $200 and $300 a share that will suffer severe breaks shortly before or after prosperity reaches peak us they are now selling on a basis of " good times " earnings . But these same stocks within the next ten years will sell a great deal higher than present prices . The reason is that the country will continue to grow and industry will grow with it . Earnings of some companies ten years from now will be double what they are today and market prices of their respective stocks 1005 higher . But in making these calculations one must not forget the inevitable reactions which occur just as frequently as periods of prosperity . TO TARE PROFITS : ? ; : x-r The newspapers publish from time to time statements that the " large interests " are not taking profits this year , that they will not cash in until next year . The large interests do not usually advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MATCH ET People who keep in close touch with business and finance and trend of public sentiment , declare the recovery of the market was due to the fact that public confidence could not be shaken . The foundation for this public confidence lies largely in a conservative and constructive Administration . It is a sound business Administration working for the betterment of the people and as long as this condition lasts , there is little chance of a permanent decline in security values . The market will continue to have its reactions , reactions as severe as the recent one , perhaps , if prices of certain issues get beyond intrinsic values , but no permanent downward movement that would carry stocks below real values is looked for in the immediate future . As long as the people have money to invest , consuming power for all products will not diminish , provided nothing develops to shake confidence . The statement of Secretary Mellon assures some continuation of this confidence which has been the main factor in building up the present era of record breaking prosperity . CHANGING COLOR The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . I think we are on the eve of another upward swing . Everything favors it . Talk about a melon cutting . There have been none so luscious as the one from ' Washington from our Secretary of the Treasury . The Bear ? " But you were bearish only a week ago . There have been no change in conditions since . Everything stands as it was then , commercially , financially and every other way . " The Bull ? " Too true . But business and the public paid little attention to the recent slump in the market . Instead of reports of business unsettlement they continued to send in new high records in volume of business . ' When a slump of 20 to 85 points in a stock market ca n't make any impression on confidence , the best thing to do is to cover what you have sold short . " The Bear ? " But prices are too high right now . They ca n't hold this level . The people wo n't buy until they reach a more reasonable level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what turned the market . As long us bricklayers and plasterers are receiving $10 to $15 a day , and everyone is employed , the power to absorb securities will be with us . And remember what Mr. Mellon said about stocks not being too high compared with 1914 , that they were simply moving in sympathy with the trend of the purchasing power of the dollar . People who had an income of $2500 from their investments did not have to work ten years ago . That was sufficient for them to live on . Now , the cost of living is so high they have to go to work to make up the deficiency . And remember comparatively that few women enjoyed earned incomes ten years ago . Look around in your subway train in the rush hours and you will find almost as many women going or coming from work as men . And do n't forget that women are great spenders . All of this adds tremenduously to purchasing power . " The Bear ? " Your arguments sound good , but I base my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inevitable saturation point in automobiles , steel , copper and all other products . The market will discount this considerably in advance . " The Bull ? " I agree with you , but they tell us this is to be a long period of prosperity with the saturation point too far away to be given a thought at this time . " Trader who has been listening in , to broker ? " Bull seems to put up a pretty good argument . " Broker ? " Right you are , but you should have heard him put up his bear argument when he was short of the market a week ago . To my knowledge he has been bullish four times over the last six months and bearish just as often . " OUTING ON EACH DIVIDENDS Payment of back dividends on Willys-Overland prefered , American Chicle preferred and Fisk Tire preferred ! during the year has stimulated buying in other issues ! which have big totals of accrued dividends . These include Pierce Arrow preferred , American Agricultural Chemical ; preferred and Missouri Pacific preferred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation by statisticians who are flooded with enquiries from pros- , pective buyers . ONINIISTS come . Omnibus Corp . has - been active on the Curb the past few days . Reported good buying is probably based on possibility of Fifth Ave . Coach Co. securing bus routes in Borough of Manhattan and Bronx here . New York Transportation Co. owns Fifth Ave . Coach Co . Fifth Ave . Bus Securities Corp . owns 92% of New York Transportation Co. while Omnibus Corp . owns about 755 of Fifth Ave . Bus Securities Corp . stock . Thus if the operating Coach Co. should be successful in securing franchises for bus routes here , any increase ? earning power would be reflected down through the holding companies to the Omnibus Corp . If all bui routes applied for are granted to Coach Co. , it will take between $5,000.000 and $6,000,000 for purchase of ' new equipment . Thus present buying of Omnibus Corp . is probably for long pull results . Application will soon be made for fisting on the N. Y. Stock Exchange . 11. - Mt . T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. directors intiated a $4 annual dividend rate on the common this month though the matter may be put off until the political attitude of the new municipal government toward tractions becomes more clearly defined and action is taken on the application for bus routes . Under the Hyman regime it was customary to use against the tractions anything they might say or do , so that in recent months , particularly , traction officials have said and done as little as possible to attract attenion . This attitude is likely to continue until the incoming administration has an opportunity to take a more definite stand on traction issues . A business-like municipal administration is anticipated and at least something helpful to the traction companies is hoped for , a condition that did not exist under the Hylan regime . Outlook for B.-M . T. is better than for any other Tajor tracton company in the city . It earned $4.64 a share on 769,911 common shares in the year ended June 30 , lust z nd it seems likely to earn $6 in the present year .
