From Buenos Aires , Capital of the Argentine , from Montevideo , Capital of Uruguay , and occasionally from Rio de Janeiro , Capital of Brazil , came news of the Sao Paulo revolution ( TIME , July 14 ) . <P> It now appears that the revolution is aimed against Seor Arturo Bernardes , President of Brazil , and in part against Carlos da Campo , Governor of the State of Sao Paulo , by certain political enemies in Rio de Janeiro , who managed to win to their side important people in the town of Sao Paulo , who in turn managed to disaffect the State militia . Colonel Joao Francisco , famed Rio Grande leader , was said to be heading the uprising . <P> The week 's news was conspicuous for its lack of detail . This was mainly due to the strict censorship enforced by the Federal Government . No direct news from the rebel side was received . <P> The Federal Government consistently claimed that its troops were winning . First , that the rebels had been surrounded in their barracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federals were bombarding Sao Paulo and its fall was considered imminent . Third , that the revolt had warranted the employment on the spot of the General Staff of the Army , who were working out the final plans for ousting the rebels . Fourth , that the Federal troops , outside Sao Paulo , were endeavoring to force the surrender of the rebels without causing damage to the town . <P> On the other hand , indirect news of the rebels showed that the revolution was much larger and more serious than the Brazilian Government had cared to make known . Upward of 400 civilians were killed in Sao Paulo , exclusive of the losses of Federal and rebel troops .
