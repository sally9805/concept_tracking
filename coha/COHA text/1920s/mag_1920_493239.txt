The Week PRESIDENT WILSON 'S message is not a farewell . That will probably come later . It is in a minor key , and rather quietly suggests to Congress some of the less important things it can be expected to accomplish , considering its Repub. rlean composition . The President points out what Can be done at home before March 4th . We need a budget system , immediate tax revision , a less ex-Pensive government . More generally he sees " that the display of an immediate disposition on the part ? I. the Congress to remedy any unjustices or evils that at may have shown themselves in our own national life will afford the most effectual offset to the forces of chaOs and tyranny which are playing so disastrous a part in the fortunes of the free peo'Pies of more than one part of the world . " Outside f these domestic affairs , the President requests a t ? government loan to Armenia , and asks Congress give independence to the Philippine Islands . " , %Plicitly he asks for only these two expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' ague . But this faith , implicit in the beginning 4c,1 end of his message , is as strong in him as ever the faith in which I was bred , and which it is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day . " ARGENTINA 'S withdrawal followed the refusal of the Assembly to debate four radical amendments : the election of the Council by the Assembly ( vvhich is equivalent to a transfer of control from the victorious great Powers to the more or less neutral small Powers ) ; the admission of all recognized governments ; compulsory jurisdiction for the world court ; and a consultative vote for nations whose boundaries are undefined . What is the explanation of the abrupt withdrawal on behalf of what are apparently such disinterested ideals ? What has Argentina in mind that makes her so impatient at this early date ? We do not know . But we offer ? a guess . Mr. Harding takes office in March . The Assembly does not meet again until September . Between March and September the aggressive policy against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's program if accepted now would put Mexico in the League and bring Mr. Harding 's claims against Mexico before the World Court . THE interpretation put upon Article X by the Assembly 's Commission of Five does not so mud undermine or destroy it as show that not so much importance was attached to it by the Commission of Five as by the President . If " ' all it does is to condemn external aggression of the territorial integrity and political independence of any member of the League " and if it only " calls upon the Council to consider what can be done to resist such aggression , " then it adds nothing that is not to be found elsewhere in the Covenant . Mr. Doherty , a Canadian delegate , describes Article X as " nothing but a humbug " which " every one knows can not be enforced . " But according to the interpretation there is nothing to enforce . Mr. Balfour says : " Personally I am no lover of Article X. The true spirit of the Covenant resides in other artidles. do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it is clearly understood that it does n't matter then there is no objection to Article X. But is it clearly understood ? If it is , then the Senate can take note of the fact and centre its reservations on the specific task of refusing to guarantee the treaties . THE Commission for the Admission of New States to the League of Nations unanimously voted to make Austria a member , and the Assembly is fairly certain to ratify the decision . Austria has fulfilled by far the greater part of her duty under the Treaty by shrinking from the size of a world power to one on much the same scale as Switzerland . The first enemy state to be let into the League , she is scarcely a state at all . Only a few extremists , such as the New York Tribune , have succeeded in trumping up any objection to her admission . The Tribune is indignant at letting such a " wolf " into the world flock , but if it cares to examine this wolf at all closely it will find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to her neighbors , Serbia , Greece and Rumania , to have some teeth left , and their hatred and their claim that she is not carrying her burdens under the Treaty has kept Bulgaria out . The admission of Austria may seem important , but it means hardly more than that a starving beggar has been ' permitted to come in and warm himself by the fire of international comity . Whether or not he will be given anything to eat remains to be seen . THE acting President of Sinn Fein , the Reverend Michael O'Flanagan , has made this offer to Lloyd George on behalf of Ireland : " You state you are willing to make peace at once without waiting for Christmas . Ireland also is willing . What first step do you propose ? " The first step , the only possible and decent step , is for the British government to order the withdrawal of its troops from Ireland . Until this poisoned blade is taken from : he wound , it can not heal . " JAPAN , " said Viscount Ishii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Covenant was originally formulated to declare her firm belief that equality before the law ought to be assured to all men irrespective of nationality , race or ligion . " But just now , continued Viscount Ishii , " Japan refrains from making any concrete proposal to this assembly as to the question of equal opportunity and treatment , and will patiently bide her time until the opportune moment presents it self . " To members of a race that has run the world so long that it has forgotten what it means i to be nferior , this renunciation may seem the mere minimum required of common sense . Yet the Japanese are as proud a race as any , and where anything so deep as race pride is touched , their feelings are bound to be stronger even than on any material question . In the face of what must be strong pressure at home , the Japanese government deserves credit for what , besides being a sensible act , was surely a very difficult one . SECTION 301 of the Esch-Cummins Transportation act provides that railroads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences by conferences between representatives of each side . The railway unions wished to have this interpreted to mean that the National Adjustment Boards set up by the Railroad Administration should ibe the means of putting this provision into effect . They tried to have the roads join them in an attempt to get a ruling on this point , but when the railroads refused , they made the request for a ruling on their own initiative . And now the ruling has been made : the decision of the Railroad Labor Board is that it has no legal power to deal with the question . This is somewhat of a reversal , since on July 2 9 th Chairman Barton wrote to both parties that the Board would set 11P its own machinery if they did not come to an agreement as to how to carry out Section 301 . It is a defeat for the unions and the principle of free negotiation ; a victory for the railroads , who think it to their advantage to have compulsory arbitration . THE ruling also has its part in the nation-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. W. Atterbury , has made , as the basis of his objection to the union leaders ' plan for Adjustment Boards , the charge that this plan will lead to the domination of the roads by labor , and so through the Plumb Plan ' the closed shop and the One.Big-Union to disaster . When introduced into the discussion of so comPli ' cated a problem , the bogeys of labor domination and the I. W. W. can produce little but confusion and anger . FOR the second time since a strike was called ; five months ago , in the non-union coal fields Mingo County , West Virginia , Federal troops hate been called in to restore order . It will be remein ' bered that on May I9th several miners , the MaYor ; and seven private detectives were killed in a street , battle at Matewan , in the same coal fields . Eve ' since there has been a steady trickle of murdef5i Governor Cornwell of West Virginia puts the tots at so , the New York Herald at 37 , the New Vrl , r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? at only 16 . This part of the country has a long tradition of bloody feuds and quick triggers , and there is no doubt that many of the miners carry guns and use them . But the blame is overwhelmingly on the other side : on the coal operators who employ private battalions of armed guards and gunmen , and use them to evict striking miners from company houses without warrant and without due legal notice . These gunmen have in several eases shot union miners without provocation . It Is Homestead all over again , and until laws are Passed that effectively prevent private corporations from employing private armies to enforce their anti-union policies such civil war is bound to recur . EARLY in January Charles Merz will begin a trip through Syria , Mesopotamia , Persia , India , the Straits Settlements , China and Japan . He exPects to be absent about a year . fourth of Mr. H. N. Brailsford 's articles on Russia will appear in the next number .               @ @ @ @ @ @
