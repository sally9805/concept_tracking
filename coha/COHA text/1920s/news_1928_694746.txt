txt Independent Thought Preferred . THE TIMES 's editorial , " A Year for Independent Choice , " as usual " hits the nail on the head . " The Scripps-Howard " chain " is correct , as their policy seems to be to chain everybody 's judgment to their chariot of thought , whether good or poor . There still remain in this country a large number of men and women who do their own thinking , and they will not let a group of editors decide who shall be the President of our great land . About four years ago they sent a representative into Florida and he gave it the " once over " very hurriedly . His article was outclassed for correctness of detail and fact by the composition of an average schoolboy , yet the chain carried it to all parts of the country . " All the news that 's fit to print " certainly was not the slogan that controlled his pen or typewriter . H. H. JACKSON . Orlando , Ha. , Jan . Our League " Expenses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League 's Expense Than Any Other Nation Except Britain " refers only to the expenses of certain conferences and committees , and not to the League 's expense as a whole . It mentions the fact that our expense in connection with recent conferences amounted to $16,748 , which no doubt means the expenses of American members of such conferences , appointed by the President . The fact is that the cost of tho League proper ( Secretaria , meetings of the Council and Assembly , &c.); is a little over $ , 4,600,000 a year and Britain 's share is nearly $500,000 a year . Of this sum we pay nothing . Great aud rich nation as we are , we ought to be ashamed to permit the other nations to bear the burdens , to take the responsibility , to do the work in keeping the world at peace , while we enjoy that peace just as fully as they do . We can continue , if we will , to shirk the responsibility and yet enjoy all the benefits . GUBERNATORIAL PROMOTION Will Smith Be the Fourth State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Net , York Times : The mention of Al Smith , the foremost American Governor and the outstanding bidder for the Democratic nomination for President , suggests a glance at the sequential connection between these two offices . During more than half the time since Lincoln and more than two-thirds of the time since Grant 's Presidency the White House occupant has been an ex-Governor . After Grant none but an ex-Governor has been able ( or lucky ) to get a taste of two terms , the only Democratic incumbents being the two Eastern Governors who got two terms hi the larger office . Is there something in the experience acquired in winning and administering a Governorship that is necessary for two terms of the Presidency in these modern days ? Under ex-Governors during this period the shadow of the White House has been rather well removed from political scandal and economic corruption . Not so with the others . Grant was surrounded by official graft , Garfield heard rumblings , Taft 's Cabinet felt a jolt , and the courts are still trying to pass on what happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been of those who lacked the test of a Governorship . The teachings of our national history since the Civil War suggest the need of a constitutional requirement that only former Governors be eligible for the White House . If there have been three great Presidents since Lincoln they were three who came via the Governor 's mansion : Cleveland , Roosevelt and Wilson . If all these were not great , the number must be reduced , for there is no available substitute . In each of these three cases the man was outstanding as Governor before being nominated for the Presidency . Governors Cleveland , Roosevelt and Wilson all came to grips with rings and bosses who wanted to run their States . Ail became associated with reform . Especially in the case of the two Democrats did the higher nomination follow a State record of reform . All three were more or less spokesmen of protest , winning their first national elections more through personal embodiment of popular ideas than on the strength of platform issues . In 1884 it was the man for whom public office was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " square deal " ; in 1912 it was the expounder of the " new freedom " as against Wall Street dominance . In other words , Cleveland , Roosevelt and Wilson were their own platforms . So would be Al Smith . Smith 's record as Governor compares most favorably with those of these other three , whether as an efficient administrator , a successful director of constructive legislation , an effective leader of his own party , or a genius in handling opposition majorities . None of these powers , perhaps least of all the last , would lie dormant in the White House . Would Al Smith change this big three into a big four ? And will he get the chance ? H. C. NINON . Nashville , Tenn. , Jan. 25 , 1928 . AE AND IRISH CULTURE . Mr. Russell 's Views on Its Revival Are Disputed . I suppose it would not be entirely fair to George E. Russell to judge of his estimate of Irish culture from the limited references to his discourse in the reports of the American-lrish Historical Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a representation of how he expressed himself en Ireland 's cultural condition in the last century and at the present day , I must , in due humility , as one of the uninitiated in cultural things , record my sharp disagreement with his propositions . Ireland 's culture , as Irish culture , disappeared , some good judges say , when the Irish word ceased to be the vehicle of Irish thought expression . If this conclusion be correct then the school he represents , " the younger school of Irish writers , " as he calls it , can not be regarded as reviving Irish culture at all . Looking at the matter from another angle , and taking it that he and the young writers in English of Nvhom he speaks are reviving Irish culture , is it not oversweeping to say that " 2,000 years of Irish culture had disappeared in the last century " ? There was a literary movement in Ireland in the middle of the last century , led by Thomas Davis , as brilliant as this one he stands so high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Ireland in the last century , that of its cultural demise , according to Mr. Russell , as reported , had Petrie , O'Donovan , O'Curry , Ferguson , Moore , Stokes , Lecky , Griffin , Balfe , Glover and Herbert  --  great names that come to one without pondering the matter for a minute . 111 architecture , sculpture , bronze molding and painting , Mr. Russell knows that the last century left us as good a legacy as any one century that went before it . But Mr. Russell is a mystic , and perhaps his conception of culture is so mysterious to the ordinary man that he is justified from his viewpoint in thinking that there was never anything that he could regard as culture in modern Ireland till its well-spring bubbled up behind the stage of the Abbey Theatre , in the cooperative creameries or in the editorial room of .

S. KELLOGG . New Tork , - Jan. 31 , 1823 .. FOR LIGHT WINES AND BEER . Benefits to State and People seen In an Amended Dry Law . The Volstead act is the cause more lawbreaking than any other . law on the statute books . However .. more serious than the breaking of ' , that law is the fact that respect for law in general has been considerably lessened through the flagrant viola . ' tion and non-enforcement of this act . Spinoza says in his Treatise on Politics that " laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor are counted but a laughing-stock , and so far from such laws restraining the appetites and lusts of martkind , they rather heighten them . " How well the principle enunciated above applies to the Volstead act , few reasonable persons will question . The trouble is that most people confuse the salutary purposes of the prohibition amendment with the narrowminded and unreasonable law which was passed to enforce it . Whv can not the Volstead act be amended so as to make the alcoholic content in beer and light wines such a percentage as will not be , in fact , intoxicating to the average individual ? Until this is done , the cause of true prohibition will suffer and respect for all law will continue to diminish . The main obstacles in the way of the repeal or modification of the Volstead act are as follows : ( 1 ) The bootlegging interests , which derive enormous profits through the sale Of booze of more or less poisonous alcoholic content ; ( 2 ) organizations which derive their main revenue from contributions to spread the doctrine of prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real serivice to the community . Evidently it is useless to try to overcome the opposition of the first two groups . We must therefore ply our energies to get the support of the great number of decent citizens in the third group , in order to have passed a more reasonable and practicable law to effectually enfo. ae prohibition and not have one on the statute books which ineffectually and unreasonable attempt to enforce teetotalism . It would be far better to gather Into the coffers of the United swim Treasury hundreds of millions of dollars through an excise on beer and light wines than that far greater amounts should find their way Into the pockets of bootleggers and prohibition fakers through malenforcement of the present act . In the event of the collection of an excise tax which could be included in a law permitting the sale of beer and light wines of small alcoholic content , the legitimate business of the country would be relieved of a great portion of the taxes now imposed and individuals in every walk of life would he benefited through reduction of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dollar would be enhanced through the reduction of the income taxes on business organizations , which taxes are now added to the purchase price of the commodities sold . Common sense and intelligent selfinterest dictate that the present enforcement act should be repealed and a reasonably enforceable one substituted or that the present act should be modified so that the law on our statute hooks should command the respect and the observance of all decent citizens . SAMUEL S. LIPPERT . New York , Jan. 24 , 1928 DEALING WITH THE CLIENT . Insurance Companies Not Entirely , to Blame for ignoring Lawyers . ? Edit , ' of The Nctv Turk Thne3 : Having been a lawyer myself , I do not sympathize instinctively with insurance companies . In my time they knew a thing or two that was not in the Code of Civil Procedure ; no question of that . Just the same , they are not entirely to blame when they ignore the lawyer and go directly to the client to negotiate &; settlement . No doubt the insurance company , that tried to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be sure of that if we knew how much Mr. Sweet was suing for , and how badly his client was hurt by the falling ceiling . No doubt we would find no startling disproportion . But hi many cases there is an outrageous disproportion . Let me give you an instance  --  any New York property owner can give others . A woman fell on the stairs of an apartment house in which I had a proprietary interest . We learned of the accident when we were served in suits for $15,000 .. I went to see the woman , found she was not hurt at all , gave her $10 , gave her husband . $5 , took release from both  --  and that ' was the end . I had a financial interest in the house , so I scotched the case at once . I gave the lawyer too , afterward . In that case we had nu insurance , but we had property that could be liened . Where a man has insurance , any pretext does to start a suit against him because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance company that went unjustifiably behind Mr. Sweet 's back had , we may suppose , been made cynical by the incessant attacks of lawyers whose certificates were simply licenses to privateer . If insurance companies can not go directly to the client where such recourse is morally justified , they will simply step up their rates ; they will fire adjusters and put on actuaries , and pay the same dividends . And strike suits will be more frequent . The accident indemnity companies , in effect , insure the profits of negligence lawyers , and thus disincline them to reform their ways ; just as automobile insurance makes us careless with our cars , and life insurance lifts from us a wholesome anxiety for those dependent on us . We would not be very angry if insurers went roughly to work as vigilantes to stop car-stealing , or if they took their advertising money and used it to abolish grade crossings and generally to save us alive ; nor should we fly immediately into a rage when we see them cutting the ground from under the negligence lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold no brief tot the accident indemity company is particular , but I would like to hear the evidence before blaming them for breaking a rule of the negligence game . It is no secret to Mr. Sweet that there are lawyers who will magnify a $15 injury  --  or no injury at all -- into a $15,000 suit . THOMAS mcmorotOW , I Greenwich , , Conn. ?
