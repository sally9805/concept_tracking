Quivering Jewish ire last week faced suave Anglo-Saxon aplomb in the Casino at Deauville , France , focal point of international folly . <P> Said the man with the ire : " You the guy that edits The Boulevardier and responsible for the dirty cracks taken at me ? " <P> Said the man with aplomb , " Yes , I 'm the guy . What about it ? " <P> " Just that ! " shouted the man with the ire , planting his left fist on the other 's foppish jaw . <P> The Casino 's colorful clientele assembled to separate the pair . Ireful Charles A. Levine , famed passenger , was led away by his bejeweled protg Miss Mabel Boll . <P> Editor Erskine Gwynne , the man with aplomb , has a reputation for picaresque adventure . His encounter with Bride Peggy Hopkins Joyce ( TIME , May 7 ) called attention to the fact that he is the expatriate nephew of the late Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt , that his collegiate witticism undeniably sets the tone for his publishing venture , The Boulevardier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provides the Parisian public with reading matter substantially equivalent to an informal combination of Town Topics and The New Yorker . Aping particularly the spirit of the last-named , it is not written for the old lady in Choisy-le-Bec . In addition to a wealth of personal comment the August issue contains such artificial features as a travel directory entitled " How To Get Out of Here " and a blithe , suggestive account of a bogus " International Gigolos Convention . " <P> On page 25 appear facsimiles of the two trumped-up telegrams which presumably caused Airman Levine 's discomfiture . Purporting to have been sent to " Lady Lindy " Earhart , they read as follows : EARHART BURRY WALES ( DEFERRED ) CONGRATULATIONS LEVINE <P> MISS EARHART STULTZ GORDON BURRY BASIN WALES ( COLLECT ) IF YOU NEED IT ANY NEW SUITS SEE MY FRIENDS JULES ROSENWEIN AND MOE EINSTEIN PETTICOAT LANE STOP MENTION MY NAME STOP FIRST CLASS GOODS STOP YOU CANT GO WRONG STOP <P> CHARLES A LEVINE                  @ @ @
