Last week 's violent and sudden break in prices on the New York Stock Exchange , with unprecedented volume of transactions during the last hour of the trading week , brought to speculators ' memories the time-honored adage : " When a big market breaks badly on good news it is a bear market ; when a big market rises sharply on bad news it is a bull market . " <P> Friday 's nose-dive was nothing short of shocking to the most hardened ticker-tape readers . Saturday 's pace of selling was equally alarming , especially from 11 o'clock until noon . The ticker stamped out " Good Night " at 12:35 , despite use of the new abbreviated symbols which normally keep it within one minute of the execution of orders on the floor of the Exchange . In one hour 1,100,000 shares changed hands . <P> The items of good news to which the market reacted were : <P> 1 ) Increased car loadings . <P> 2 ) Best financial statements ever issued by the General Motors Corporation , the New York Central , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans . <P> 4 ) First dividend in fourteen years to New Haven Railroad stockholders . <P> 5 ) Increased bookings of U. S. Steel Corporation orders with an operating ratio of 90% of capacity . <P> 6 ) Indications of a general speeding up of automotive industry to catch spring trade . <P> Against these favorable influences were some unfavorable items : <P> 1 ) Spotty trade . <P> 2 ) Unsatisfactory corporate reports , generally . <P> 3 ) Further cut in oil prices . <P> 4 ) Increase of unemployment in large centres . <P> 5 ) Uncertainties in many commercial directions . <P> Two classic explanations were offered for last week 's break : <P> First : popular speculative Wall Street has got in the habit of judging the trade situation by the stock market rather than judging the stock market by the manifest trend of trade . Hence , confusion of cause and effect , resultant consciousness of error , hasty attempt at correction . <P> Second : deliberate initiation of liquidation by institutions and powerful individuals who can carry their stocks through a blow if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the level of stock prices is out of line . <P> Neither explanation admits the possibility of the existence of an underlying weakness of any degree of gravity . Obstinate gamblers for the rise may have barked their shins . Or that undefined but still not mythical group of forces known as " the large interests , " the " insiders " of popular legend may have put the brakes on inflation . The only disquieting symptom last week was the pace at the finish . It can not be accurately described for want of clear financial terminology . If stockbrokers had a sort of Beaufort 's scale , * such as mariners use to describe wind velocity , it might be said that the week passed from the strong wind of " weakness " through the gale of " heavy liquidation " to the storm of " drastic reaction . " But at no moment was hurricane force recorded . Hurricane weather , in finance , is panic , of which state the ticker pulse gave not a suggestion . <P> <P> * Series of numbers from 0 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate wind velocity from calm to hurricane , or from less than 2 miles per hour to more than 75 miles per hour .
