Two FLIGHTS UP-Mary Roberts Rine-hart-Doubleday Doran ( $2 . ) Connoisseurs of mystery stories-a great many of both have cropped up in the last decade - prefer them undiluted with the tender passion . Though Author Rinehart knows how to write a mystery story ( The Amazing Interlude , The Red Lamp ) , and her sons* know how to publish them , she indulges in dilution to the extent of a new volume self-labelled " a love story-with just enough mystery . " Mystery connoisseurs will be disappointed . Love-storyites will find in Holly a spineless heroine , in Warrington a blundering hero in spite of his burly good looks , and in Furness Brooks ( he paid dinner calls ) an unbelievable relic of the days before jazz . <P> <P> *Three Rinehart sons are at Doubleday Doran.
