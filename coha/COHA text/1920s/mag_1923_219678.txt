The plans of the Shipping Board for handling the 1,400 Government-owned merchant ships were finally made public .

" Nobody hates Government ownership and operation more than I do , " said Mr. Lasker , " but I and the Board have finally recommended , in view of the present situation , that we cut out doing business on cargo lines through agents and go direct on a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
