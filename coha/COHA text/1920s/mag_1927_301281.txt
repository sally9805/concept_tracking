His Majesty George V , King and Emperor , reputedly ordered conveyed to Conservative Premier Stanley Baldwin last week a very strong though private intimation that His Majesty disapproved the Cabinet 's sensational proposal to " reform " the House of Lords ( TIME , July 4 ) . The reform would limit the number of peers , and thus , by implication , abolish the sovereign 's present prerogative to create additional peers at pleasure . Last week not only the King but a very large number of the younger Conservative M. P. 's made known their opposition to the proposed bill which would vastly increase the power of the House of Lords . As a result the Cabinet met in secret session , to consider how the proposal-after having existed only a week-might best be scrapped . <P> Next morning Colonial Secretary Leopold Charles Maurice Stennett Amery announced to the House of Commons amid cries of " Hear ! Hear ! " that the bill will not be introduced in anything like its proposed form . Members of Parliament promptly dubbed it " dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their estates last week to champion the measure in the House of Lords were vexed - returned to their shires .
