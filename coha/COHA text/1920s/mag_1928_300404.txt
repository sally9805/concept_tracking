My Man . In 1921 Fannie Brice worked into her act in the Ziegfeld Follies a Channing Pollock translation of the French tune " Mon Homme . " She knew that if her man got another chance , he would go straight . " No matter what he is , " she sang , " I am his . . . " and the song , sung well enough to be effective even if it had not had any particular significance , moved her hearers to an extraordinary pitch of sentiment because they knew that her husband , Jules W. ( " Nicky " ) Arnstein , was serving sentence at the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth . Now , in her first picture , she sings " My Man " again and also her other famous songs , " I 'm an Indian " and " Second Hand Rose " ; she recites " Mrs. Cohen at the Beach . " The plot is what it has to be to give her a chance to do her stuff . As a sewing-machine girl in a costume factory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the annual picnic , sings for the famed theatrical producer when he sends for her . Her singing and acting under Archie Mayo 's directing make a trite story new and interesting , and give Warner Brothers a hit almost as potent as The Singing Fool . <P> Born Borach , daughter of a French Jew who ran saloons in Newark , Brooklyn and Manhattan , Fannie Brice was romantic partly because she was homely and awkward . When she got a job in a department store she pretended she was starving and her father was blind ; when the girls and the floor superintendent gave her presents and money , she laughed and said that she was only fooling . At Keeney 's Vaudeville House in Brooklyn when she was 13 she won $10 on amateur night singing " When You Know You 're Not Forgotten by the Girl You Ca n't Forget . " She danced in Cohan and Harris ' chorus ; in burlesque she sang some of Irving Berlin 's first songs ; when she was 17 Ziegfeld headlined her in the Follies of 1910 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress in Fanny . She had an operation on her hooked nose to make her better looking , but she said ; " I 'd rather not be beautiful . It 's hard to get a line on yourself if you 're beautiful . " One St. Patrick 's Day " Nicky " Arnstein , sought throughout the U. S. for his share in a $5,000,000 bond robbery , got into a cab at his front door and drove through a police parade to headquarters where he gave himself up . Fannie Brice paid for his defense . Although she owns a monkey , occasionally paints portraits , and likes to ride , she is one of the most original , unaffected , and forceful personalities in the show business . <P>
