Mrs. Woodrow Wilson approved last week the plans of a marble sarcophagus in which the remains of the President are to lie . <P> At present , Woodrow Wilson 's body lies beneath a six-inch slab of concrete and a three-inch slab of marble in one of eight catacombs in the crypt beneath Bethlehem Chapel of the unfinished Washington Cathedral . <P> For some time , Mrs. Wilson has been consulting with Cram &; Ferguson , architects of the Cathedral , on the design of the sarcophagus . Recently , on a motor trip through New England with her brother , she called on the architects at their Boston office and accepted the final plans-a very simple marble tomb with a crusader 's sword lying in relief upon its cover . <P> The sarchophagus is now under construction in Boston . When completed , it will be taken to Washington and erected in Bethlehem Chapel . It is expected that the President 's body will be moved to its new resting place in about a month .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
