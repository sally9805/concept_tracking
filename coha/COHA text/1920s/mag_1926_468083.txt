MID generous applause one of the religious weeklies remarked recently that Manhattan is an alien island off the eastern coast of the United States , rolling in wealth , bursting with pride and pooh-poohing the Ten Commandments . The remark is typical of much current comment . In many sections of the West and South the thought prevails that New York is overdoing it . New York is too big . New York is too rich . New York is too smug . New York is too wet . New York is too wild . New York is too flip . New York is too " European . " New York is too proud of its sky-line . Do not mistake this for mere envy . And do not believe that only on a few outlying frontiers is such a point of view expressed . Criticism of New York is both widespread and eloquent . The Iowa farmer rails at Wall Street . The Anti-Saloon League talks of treason . The Southern Democracy repeats over the dead body of the Madison Square Convention that it will take no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed by too many eastern triumphs , eggs the Pirates on to lick the Giants . The West Coast charges New York with attempting to throttle western trade . The Portland Chamber of Commerce accuses New York of attempting to block the development of every port except its own . A clergyman in Maryland sees Babylon outdistanced . The Pullman cars , the night-boats , and the Rotary Clubs are full of Middle Westerners discussing New York and thanking God they donot live there . The morals of Broadway and the ethics of Wall Street are under weekly fire in a hundred pulpits . A feeling prevails not only that New York has embraced ideas alien to the spirit of the fathers , but that New York is attempting to ram its theories down the national throat . " The West wants to know , " says the Methodist Board of Temperance , Prohibition and Public Morals , " if New York is a menace . " Echo , for the Methodist Board of Temperance , Prohibition and Public Morals , answers " yes . " " New York , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud affection which Westerners and Southerners have held for it these many years . " The idea is gaining ground that New York is " a foreign city , run by foreigners for foreigners and according to foreign ideas . " In New York the theaters are " specializing in profanity , blasphemy , and nakedness . " In New York the publishers are manufacturing " literary garbage " in the name of art . In New York the wits have discovered that it is easy to be humorous by classifying Westerners as " hicks " and Southerners as " yokels . " In New York things go from bad to worse , and " the great mass of ma-Americans " has found itself , at last , in a majority . It would not greatly disturb the Methodist Board of Temperance , Prohibition and Public Morals , one suspects , if , in return for a few hundred millions on account , New York were traded to the French Republic . Not all critics are so ardent . But in the farmer 's resentment against Wall Street , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety for Prohibition , no less than in an allegedly sharp disagreement as to public and private morals , and in the suspicion that New York is both needlessly self-satisfied and increasingly contemptuous of what is not its own , there is material which worries more than one observer . How wide is the gap between Manhattan Island and its hinterland ? Is New York seceding from the Union ? The most fundamental charge being brought by its critics against New York is the charge that here is an " alien " city , literally un-American and anti-American in its make-up . For this charge does not concern itself with any of the details of New York 's alleged hypocrisy , conceit , bare legs , hip-pocket flasks , and Continental morals ; it offers , instead , an hypothesis which would explain all of New York on the single central theory that the city has gone foreign . This is the conclusion at which the Methodist Board of Public Morals reluctantly arrives . It is a theory which has been argued not only by the clergy but the layman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only metropolis in the world , and the only metropolis in history , as far as he can recall , more than three-fourths of whose population is alien to that of the nation upon which it lives . How many old-fashioned Americans are there in New York ? Foreign stock furnishes 76.4 per cent of the city 's population . To this add the Negroes . " At the end of the computation , " Mr. Sullivan suggests , " one is justified in doubting whether as much as 10 per cent of New York 's population is American in the sense of possessing , in the form of a heritage , old American ideals , prejudices , and characteristics . " The country feels that its metropolis lacks " American ideals as an inheritance from white American ancestry . " It is this suspicion which " is atthe heart of the present American feeling about New York . " There is more than a little evidence that this is true . But true or not , it is worth noting that in no such feeling can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . For it would be difficult to prove that it is really the alien population of the city which actively and aggressively irks the provinces . What is the alien population of New York ? A vast , almost uncounted multitude of hard-working , voiceless , poverty-pinched men and women who sew caps , deliver ice , stitch pants , sometimes vote Socialist , more often vote for Coolidge , peddle groceries , and empty ash-cans . There are perhaps ten thousand New Yorkers of foreign birth or foreign extraction whose business it is to deliver milk . It would take a great stretch of the imagination to believe that it is their erotic foreign theories of art which are undermining the American theater . They probably have no erotic theories of art , and their theater is Coney Island . There are , again , perhaps twenty thousand " foreigners " in New York who make their living sewing buttons . Their lives , like countless other foreign lives in the metropolis , are first of all a grim race to meet rent , union dues , and doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people could conceivably break onto the first pages of the newspapers ? thereby to annoy Americans of native white ancestry in Detroit , Denver , or Savannah ? would be by inheriting an unexpected title from an uncle in Albania or by falling forty stories in an elevator shaft . The fact is that New York 's alien population is really hidden away from the rest of the country so completely that , if it were not for the census figures and the ruminations of New York 's interpreters , the rest of the country would scarcely know that it existed . It is not the tenement-huddled alien population of New York which imports Benedictine , bullies Congress , dances all night at cabarets , forecloses the mortgages on Iowa farms , pays twenty dollars for a pair of theater tickets in the hope of being horrified , sneers at the rustic West , and regards itself with deep-seated and abiding satisfaction . It may well be , as Mr. Sullivan has suggested , that the known preponderance of an alien population in New York does color the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the actual positive irritants in this relationship of New York and its hinterland are not to be found in Little Italy or Chinatown . To be irritating it is necessary first to fill and hold the country 's eye . Three great arteries penetrate the New York which actually commands the headlines and gives its critics in the West and South something to fume about . These arteries are Wall Street , Broadway , and Park Avenue . Wall Street has the international bankers Broadway has the cabarets , the bootleggers , the racing touts , the " wisecrackers , " and the sex shows . Park Avenue , as its critics see it , has the dollar-royalty which prides itself upon possessing the last word in sophistication , elegance , and culture . Much can be said of these three streets . Much has been said of them . Much is being said of them to-day with feeling . But one thing which it is difficult indeed to say of them is that they are not " American . " Granted that there are plenty of foreign names emblazoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue 's elevators , the fact remains that most of New York 's successful immigrants come not from Poland and Ukrainia , but from points west and south . For years , while the covered wagon has been headed west , individual aspirants for wealth and power have been forsaking it en route and coming east again . Thus a great number of those Wall Street bankers whom the Iowa farmers now denounce as lacking an American point of view are simply ex-Iowans . Both Wall Street and Park Avenue have drawn heavily upon the rest of the country for recruits . Even the stage , which such critics as the churchmen of the Methodist Board of Public Morals seem to think has especially fallen under foreign domination ? what with its attempts to outdo Paris in the matter of bare backs , plain talk , and erotic love themes ? still draws heavily upon the provinces for its producing personnel . Of the ten most active producers now operating in New York none is an " alien " and just one is a born New Yorker . The other nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syracuse , Cleveland , Buffalo , Hartford , Conn. , Paducah , Ky. , and Sandusky , Ohio . Both Moscow and the Quartier Latin are wholly absent from this list . Nor is that all . For it is to be noted that Broadway , Wall Street , and Park Avenue not only have their quota of the native-born but manage with amazing speed to assimilate their aliens . Mr. Rosencrantz , born in Galicia but now living in New York , has made a fortune ? let us say ? by patenting an invention which cuts one-quarter of a cent per yard from the cost of weaving woolen cloth . Does Mr. Rosenerantz , having thus arrived at leisure and great wealth , seek to re-create for himself , as far as possible , his native background in Galicia ? Does Mr. Rosencrantz search for a house with a Galician look about it , surround himself with old Galician friends , and give Galician dinners ? Mr. Rosencrantz does not . Mr. Rosencrantz buys the largest , most expensive , and most orthodox apartment obtainable on Park Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rosencrantz purchases a country place on the Long Island Riviera ; and if he observes that there is anything about his house which distinguishes it from the next ten houses , north and south , he chops it off . Faithfully , as each new iceless ice-box and each new rustless fly-screen takes its place upon the market , Mr. Rosencrantz buys it ; his house is American from the imitation-English shingles on its roof to the brass pipes in its laundry ; his Vermeer hangs in the right place on the wall ; his specially built-in radio cost seven thousand dollars ; his daughters go to boarding-schools ; his wife moans if she is one new play or one new watering-place in France behind the ladies of her set . Religiously does Mr. Rosencrantz comply with the ritual of American living . The man himself may be seen , sometimes , sitting at a window of the exclusive city club to which he has been admitted by special vote because he owns the land on which the building stands . There is a faraway look in his eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance item in the evening paper prompts it . Certain factory hands in a Passaic mill have gone on strike . They are Galicians from his own Galicia . And Mr. Rosencrantz , puffing a cigar and glancing at his watch to see if it is not time for someone to come and take him home , mutters : " Damned foreigners . . Bolshe-viki ! " IV Give the devil his due . It is only fair to Mr. Rosencrantz and his fellow-apartment-owners in the Belvedere Arms ? sixteen rooms , eight baths , servants ' wing and private organ ? to recognize that the New York of Park Avenue has more in common with the provinces than readily appears upon the surface of its busy life . Let us see . The first of the specific accusations brought against New York , aside from the general charge that it is " alien , " concerns its insubordination in the matter of the Volstead Act . New York is wet . That is an open secret . The West and South are dry . But is the West dry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South just mostly dry ? and wet in spots ? It is demonstrably true , I think , that New York is not the only large city in the United States where Prohibition is unpopular with many average people of white American ancestry on both sides . The newspaper polls which were taken early in the spring ( for all their margin of inaccuracy ) are evidence of that . So are the bills introduced by Congressmen who are anxious to oblige their home constituencies . Forty-two bills , as this is written , have been introduced in the present Congress calling for repeal or modification of the Volstead Act . Less than a third of these bills have been introduced by Congressmen from New York City . The bulk of them have come from delegates of such cities as Chicago , St. Louis , Philadelphia , and Baltimore . It seems reasonable to conclude , from the tally of straw votes , from the evidence of bills in Congress , and from the eloquent personal testimony of both wets and drys , that there are other cities than New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presumably not so much between New York and everybody else as it is between towns as towns and ( on the issue of hard liquor ) an evangelical countryside . Nor is that all . Of every seven corks which are still popped annually within the city limits of New York , it has been estimated that four are drawn not by and for the native population of the city , but expressly for the entertainment of its guests from out-of-town . This estimate is unreliable . To frequenters of night life in the Broadway cabarets it may seem , if anything , a little low . But low or high , it does suggest a fact with which eager critics do not always reckon . New York is not only a city but a national pastime . What is Manhattan Island , within the individual experience of most Westerners and Southerners who come to visit it , if not a place in which to negotiate a certain business deal and then make merry drinking things , eating things , seeing things , dancing things , and buying things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This might be the diary of an average visit : Mr. A. , of Saginaw , Mich. , registers at the Hotel Belmore , with wife , business partner B. , and Mrs. B. In a stay of four days the quartet manages to encompass two matinees , four evening shows ( by deliberate choice , the four which they have heard are " racy " ) , six cabarets , and one duty-call on their Aunt Fanny . They depart , having happily missed Aunt Fanny , with a record of having had personal first-hand contacts with one hotel clerk , two elevator-men , three bell-boys , two chambermaids , one barber , two hairdressers , six theater-ticket agents , eleven doormen , fourteen waiters , thirty-six taxi-drivers and one old friend from Ypsilanti . All of these people seem to be up at all hours of the night and to have nothing in particular to do except to help somebody else get somewhere in a tremendous hurry . And from this fact , Mr. and Mrs. A. and Mr. and Mrs. B. conclude , looking back on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where everybody is perpetually in a rush , but a place which is wholly , utterly , and completely devoid of all the elements of home life . V This is a sound observation as far as it goes. - But , obviously , it does not go far beyond the cabarets . Not all New Yorkers live in taxicabs . Mr. and Mrs. A. and Mr. and Mrs. B. owe it to themselves to pay New York another visit , of a different sort . They will find much that reassures them , much that compensates them for the loss of Main Street , and much that makes them feel at home . What is it that distinguishes Park Avenue from Main Street ? A great deal of scenery , of course : brick fronts , roofs ten stories above the street , canopies running to the curb , an avalanche of motor cars , theaters around the corner , opera at Thirty-ninth Street , contact with a lively modern world , doormen with little whistles . Certainly it is another scene ; but it is not necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different people . The New York of the three great avenues has its own individuality , but it preserves its points of contact with the continent behind it . For example : It is said of this New York that it is a sophisticated place , whereas Main Street ( bless its heart ) will bite on anything. ? Query : is there any city in America in which people fall over themselves more rapidly than people fall over themselves in New York , to buy tickets for a charity ball the purpose of which they do not know but attendance at which will permit them to gaze upon the Grand Duchess Feodorovna , third cousin to the late Tzar of Russia ? Main Street , perhaps , will bite on anything . So will New York . It is said of New York , again , that it has outgrown back-slapping and small-town oratory , whereas Main Street dotes on after-dinner bombast and being brotherly in public. ? Query : is there any other city in America except New York where an incoming Mayor is called upon to address an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought inhospitable not to welcome visiting celebrities by scattering paper in the streets , and where two solid columns of each morning 's papers could be filled , and sometimes are , with lists of " those attending " public dinners held the night before ? New York is rich in perorations . Welcoming Captain Fried of the S. S. Roosevelt after his rescue of a shipwrecked crew , the city chose to show its gratitude by delivering at Captain Fried no less than twenty-eight speeches all identical in content . Has Main Street ever shown more faith in the rich reward of talk ? Again , it is said of New York that it has a big-city tolerance which Main Street lacks ? for want of size , if nothing else . No doubt it is true that big-city life does offer refuge . But it is worth noting that New York still has its social castes , its well-paid gossips , and its organized exterminators of heresy who keep busy hunting heads . Even those small circles of free-thinkers which are tolerant on principle and rejoice in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and wider freedom have certain standards of admission . Pity the poor lamb , professing mid-Victorianism in everything from Mendelssohn to Jonah and the whale , who ventures into a company of liberated minds . Does the poor lamb still think that woman 's place is in the home , that McKinley was a statesman , that E. M. Hull is a realist , and that David Copperfield is a better novel than Sons and Lovers , of which he has not heard ? It is possible to think these things ; but it is not possible to think them ? or to think five thousand other things ? without being savagely attacked by onlookers whose professed creed in life is tolerance . Tolerance , in this case , simply means having as sharply defined a set of beliefs as anybody else and fighting like a tiger to impose these beliefs on anybody who dislikes them . This is fair enough , and strictly above-board . But it is not tolerance . Not by a jugful . VI We are speaking now of a New York which does not live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York which lives in apartment houses in half-sunny streets and talks slang which will be current in the Main Street drugstores in another month . And for all the sacrilege which it may involve we are suggesting that this New York is not otherworldly , but something of a one-horse town itself . Consider the tempo of its life . It is said of one-horse towns that they are easily fooled , loquacious , and intolerant upon occasion . It is also said of them that they lack poise and are forever rushing breathlessly from fad to fad . What is cited against them is not that their enthusiasms vary . That is normal enough to human life . They are laughed at rather because their enthusiasms vary capriciously , en masse and with no discoverable motive for a shift in loyalty . Thus , New York smiles because Main Street is now going in wholesale for Michael Arlen , whereas one year ago crossword puzzles were the rage , and one year before that , winds and dragons , and one year before that , If Winter Comes . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked , can possibly exist between these four enthusiasms ? And if it has taken Main Street four years to advance or decline from A. S. M. Hutchinson to Michael Arlen via crossword puzzles and Mah Jongg , where will Main Street be four years from now , and what in Heaven 's name will it have covered in the meantime ? I refer you for an answer to Mr. Gerald Carter . Mr. Carter is a broker , just an average New Yorker , a neighbor of Mr. Rosenerantz in Park Avenue , and at the moment when this inquiry is addressed to him is sitting down to dinner . Mr. Carter , in fact , is drinking bortch . He does not like bortch . He cordially detests it . But a company of Moscow actors is now playing to fashionable audiences in Fifty-ninth Street , there is a vogue for all things Russian , and bortch is Mr. Carter 's soup . Duncan Phyfe , meantime , is Mr. Carter 's chair . Mr. Carter does not like chairs by Duncan Phyfe . They make his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new wing of early American furniture , and in the scuffle Mr. Carter lost a friendly arm-chair . He has acquired , on his right , a dinner-guest . He does not like his dinner-guest . The man is plainly crazy . But he is the latest poet , general , or something of the sort to arrive from Poland or some other place , and at the moment is regarded as a modest catch for any dinner . Mr. Carter will take him to-night to hear Paul Robeson sing Negro spirituals . Mr. Carter does not like Negro spirituals . He does not like singing . And if he had to hear something sung it certainly would not be Negro spirituals . But if Mr. Carter does not take his guest to hear Paul Robeson sing tonight , Mrs. Carter , who also dislikes singing in general and Negro spirituals in particular , will not be taking advantage of the cultural opportunities of living in a large city . There will be time , afterwards , to drop in at the Palais d'Or . Mr. Carter does not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but he knows someone who has . Mr. Carter himself prefers the Terrace Garden . The tables are large and the head-waiter is a friend of But the Terrace Garden , it must be confessed , is old and out-of-date . It is almost three months old and almost two months out-of-date . The Palais d'Or is the latest thing in town . And Mr. Carter knows that if two weeks pass and he is still unable to agree with his friends that while the music is good the prices are outrageous , someone at the club will speak to him about it . . . . Of Mr. Carter 's evening it remains to be said that upon his return home he will enjoy a cigarette in a library one of whose top shelves shelters three crossword puzzle books and a set of Mali Jongg tiles . But Mr. Carter has forgotten that he ever wore out pencils on the one or hunted in the pockets of his smoking-jacket for missing pieces of the other . Main Street , curious place , can perhaps think back three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Park Avenue has too rich a past in sudden fads , and too troublesome a future . Of all fad-ridden cities which toss restlessly on their pillows because they do not know what will be either fashionably proper or fashionably improper in the morning , New York is the most amazing . Where will Main Street be , four years from now ? Just about six months behind New York , having tried , in getting there , one-eighteenth as many starts . VII Lights flicker on Manhattan Bridge . The bright eyes of a Bronx local sparkle suddenly as it takes the curve at Fourteenth Street , A tug whistles to a ferryboat for right of way , in the dark river below Vesey Street . Dusk falls , and two New Yorks go home to dinner . There is one New York which will eat in the drab rooms of the great steel barracks which house drab people living humdrum lives . Somebody will complain that the cod is burned , and somebody else will complain , in Yiddish or Italian , that his eyes ache from too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hot and a child may fret . The room will smell because the sun has not peeked into it since somebody built another barracks on the other side of the narrow alloy . A fat woman with her elbows pillowed on the window-sill will watch a shrill crowd in the street below , and nobody will suspect that the West worries because all the fine old things of the metropolis are now controlled by aliens . This is the foreign city . A second New York will ride uptown in limousines ? take the hus ? or come home on the 5:15 : to dinners at which the respective merits of goose-neck putters , congressmen , senators , Mexicans , five-tube sets , and semi-balloons are still discussed by patriots , man to man , and in the spirit of the fathers . All is not lost . Nor is secession near at hand . Courage , brothers on the Kansas prairie . We are with you !
