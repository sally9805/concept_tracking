txt Official investigation of James Cunningham 's story of the circumstances surrounding the killing of Clarence Peters by Walter S. Ward failed yesterday to establish any conclusive proof or disproof of his statement as a whole . In certain important details , however , his narrative was contradicted by other persons , or was found to lack corroboration after careful check had been made of persons and places he named . One of hies statements was denied by his own attorney , Maurice J. McCarthy of 27 William Street , who was retained yesterday following Cunningham 's arrest as a material witness on Thursday night . McCarthy - denied that Cunningham had been called on the telephone at 1:30 o'clock on the morning of May 16 to go to Stamford and take care of the second man said to have been shot by Ward . This statement was included in one of Cunningham 's three versions of the facts . Mr. McCarthy refused to say whether the wounded man had been taken to the home of Cunningham 's mother in the Bronx , as alleged in another statement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was denied by the prisoner 's mother , who said the wounded man was never taken to her home . Find No Clue in Stamford . A thorough inquiry among taxicab drivers and hospitals in Stamford . Conn. , conducted by Sheriff George J. Werner of Westechester . County , Pinkerton detectives employed ** District Attorney Frederick E. Weeks and the Stamford police failed to bring to light any substantiation whatsoever of Cunningham 's statement that . the wounded man was taken from New Rochelle  --  or from the Bronx  --  first to a Stamford drug store , then to a . doctor 's office , and then to a private hospital or sanitarium in Stamford . The official investigators were unable to get any information to show that a wounded man had been taken to Stamford or that such a person had been secretly treated by any physician or at any hospital or sanitarium there . The investigators were unable to locate the two men said by Cunningham to have accompanied Peters to meet Ward on the night the former sailor was shot .. These men he identified as Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter being variously given as Joe and Bill . According to Cunningham , Charley Rogers was identical , with the Charley Ross named in Ward 's story of the blackmail plot , and Jackson was the " Jack " in Ward 's version of the shooting . Cunningham said Jackson was the second man shot . and that he was taken to Stamford by Charley Rogers in a Hudson supper-six dark blue touring car . One Charley Rogers Is Pound . In Stamford the searchers found a Charles Rogers who once owned an automobile answering the description of that mentioned by Cunningham , but Sheriff Werner said this Charley Rogers was far from answering the description of Charley ' Rogers given by Cunningham . Whereas Cunningham 's Charley Rogers weighed 130 pounds , the Stamford Charley Rogers weighs 200 pounds . Sheriff Werner said nothing had been learned to connect the Stamford man with the Ward case . Despite his apparent elimination from the case , the Stamford Charley Rogers will be kept under surveillance , and he may be taken to White Plains today or later to see whether Cunningham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward also may be asked to confront this man to see if he can identify him with the Charley Ross he says was the ringleader of the gang that extorted $30.000 from him and if he was one ' of the participants in the pistol battle that Ward says took place on the lonely road near Kensico at 4 A. M. on May 16 . Ward and Cunningham also may be confronted with each other today . The authorities were unable to get any information ( or at least made none public ) to support Cunningham 's statement as to the motive of the killing . This was that Ward became unfuriated and began shooting when he realized that the blackmailers had tricked him to reveal a certain secret in the hearing of an attorney for his father . George S. Ward , President of the Ward Baking Company . According to Cunningham , the secret was that Ward was dividing with the gang the money he got from his father to keep the extortionists quiet about a , story concerning his father and a woman . Prisoner 's Credibility Attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story or Ward 's story regarding the time and Place of the shooting ' was the truth . Whereas Ward says that he shot Peters in self-defense in a road , many miles from his home at 4 o'clock on the morning of May 16 , and thinks he may have hit another of the blackmailers in a pistol battle , Cunningham says Ward shot two unarmed men in or near his home before midnight on the night of May 15 . Cunningham 's credibility ' was also attacked yesterday . District Attorney Weeks said Cunningham had been arrested several times , but had always " beaten his case . ' According to A. C. Dennison , chief house detective of the Hotel MeAlpin , where Cunningham was arrested , Cunningham is well known in different cities as a " hotel beat . " It was also pointed out that by his own admission Cunningham associated with shady characters , and had told conflicting stories about the Ward case . When District Attorney Weeks was asked whether he believed Cunningham 's final story , he said he did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew something about the case , and had not told the whole truth to the authorities . Sheriff-Werner said he expected to get exactly what Cunningham knows out of the prisoner today , when he will question him . Cunningham himself stuck to his revised story all day yesterday , according to the prosecutor , the Sheriff and Coroner Edward F. Fitzgerald , the Westchester County officials who have questioned him . He has refused to add anything to his final statement , In which he recanted his first story that he was an eyewitness to the shooting , but insisted that his story was true except for his absence from the scene . Cunningham Held Without Bail . Cunningham is still held without bail in the county jail at White Plains as a material witness . - He was allowed to see his mother and his attorney yesterday . The lawyer , Mr. McCarthy , who is said to be a cousin of Cunningham , said after interviewing his client and the officials , that he contemplated an appeal for a writ of habeas corpus to get Cunningham out of jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn today . Nothing has been learned so far , Mr. Weeks said , to cause him to order Ward 's rearrrest on the strength of Cunningham 's story . Ward is now at liberty on $56,000 : bail on a charge of manslaughter in the first degree , held for the Coroeer 's inquest . According to Mr. Weeks , there will be no inquest and the case will not be presented to the Grand Jury before Monday , if then . The authorities are still looking for another Charley Ross , who , with a man named Jack Barron , was reported to have been seen in a " big red car , " answering the description of the red Stutz mentioned by Ward , at Broadway and Fortieth Street within aa few days after the shooting . Both these mez have police records ands have served prison sentences . - Other Charley Rosses and Jacks are also being hunted , - as the authorities have not abandoned other theories to work solely on Cunningham 's story . The frequency ' with which men named Charley . Roza are found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underworld generally is explained by the fact that it is a " trick name , " which many men of foreign descent use instead of their own less handy names . The authorities are also running down various stories about Ward 's gambling propensities , both at the races and at cards . According to one of these stories , Ward - was in debt to a certain " bookie " in New York or Hoboken at the time of the shooting to the extent of 530,000 to $40,000 . These developments in the investigation , however , were secondary to the checking up of Cunningham 's story . As soon as the morning newspapers appeared in Stamford , the local police got busy rounding up taxicab drivers and owners of automobiles , and detectives were sent to question the managers of every hospital and sanitarium , public and private , within the jurisdiction . Detectives Visit An Hospitals : Chief of Police John B. Brennan and District Attorney M. S. Keneally of Stamford had charge of the local investigation . They instructed the detectives sent to hospitals not only to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the proprietors to Police Headquarters for questioning . The latter course was not necessary . It was reported that no wounded man had been treated at the public hospital in Stamford or at any of the six private institutions . " It is highly improbable that a wounded man would be treated in any of the private hospitals here , " said Chief Brennan . " We would have been notified at once . The patients in such institutions around here are for the most part those suffering from overwrought nerves , some mental disorder or in need of complete rest . The coming of a wounded man would be so unusual that I think we would have heard of it even if we had not been officially notified . The men who investigated today report ' that no wounded man was treated which I think is a correct report . " An official party from White Plains arrived at Stamford early in the morning to co-operate with the local police . It was headed by Sheriff Werner and included Raymond K. Hill fingerprint expert , of the Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Pinkerton men . Three Stamford detectives accompanied the Sheriff 's party on an Investigation lasting for four or five hours . The Stamford police produced Charles Rogers and three other men who had driven Hudson cars for hire , and Sheriff Werner and District Attorney Kenneally examined them at Police Headquarters . Rogers soon satisfied everybody that he was not the man mentioned by Cunningham . Rogers indignantly denied that he had anything to do with the Ward ' case or had taken a wounded man from New Rochelle to Stamford . He said he had sold his Hudson car about a year ago and was now employed as a private chauffeur . Other Chauffeurs Questioned . Questioned along the seCme lines , other drivers of Hudson cars all told the same story  --  they had driven " - no wounded stranger in May . Cunningham ' is alleged to have said the chauffeur who took Jackson to Stamford telephoned from a drug store upon his arrival . If the Cunningham story is true it would not have been possible for the wounded man to have reached Stamford much before midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to have telephoned from a drug store . There are no all-night drug stores in Stamford . They usually close at 11 o'clock unless some special occasion has kept the people out . While in - Stamford Sheriff Werner visited Dr. Daniel A. Hanrahan of 27 Broad Street , who , Cunningham said , was the doctor to whose office he and Charley Rogers took the wounded man after the shooting . Dr. Hanrahan indignantly denied that he had treated any such man or ' aided in his concealment from the authorities . Dr. Hanrahan lives in a frame house near the bridge over the Rippawan River With his brother , John T. Hanrahan , a notary public and former Treasurer of the town of Stamford , and his four sisters . There is no notary public sign . It is understood that Cunningham told the authorities that the doctor 's house he went to had a notary 's sign on it or a notary 's desk inside . Dr. Hanrahan 's breather , the notary public , however , added ' his own denials to Dr. Hanrahan 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other injuries in May or any other month that I can remember , " said Dr. Hanrahan . " Why , I have been told that I kept a wounded man - here two days . That story is utterly false and I am willing to have the house searched to prove the truth of what I say . " Cunningham is said to have told the authorities that after the wounded man had been kept for some time in Dr. Hanrahan 's house it was decided to move him . In the belief that he was dying , the story attributed to Cunningham went , it was suggested that the notary public brother be called in to take his last statement . Dr. Hanrahan and his brother denied this in chorus . Does Not Know Cunningham . " I 8 , m much at sea as to why my name was mentioned , " said the doctor . " I do not know Cunningham , and so far as I know I never heard of him before this case . I know none of the Wards , and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing I am certain and that is that persons and places are not being picked out haphazard . They are being picked by some one who-. knows this locality and its people with more than a mere acquaintance . Cunningham is evidently acquainted with Stamford . " You can not make my denial too emphatic . I treated no wounded man . I know no one connected with the case . I do not know the Wards and my brother was not called to take the statement of a wounded man . " Late last night Dr. Hanrahan said a reporter representing The New York American- had just called at the house and told him that Cunningham had insisted to the Sheriff that Joe Jackson was treated in Stamford by Dr. Hanrahan between midnight and 2 A. M. on day 16 . Dr. Hanrahan reiterated his denial of having treated Jackson or any one else for bullet wounds . He said that he had done no work for six years . The condition of his health , he said , requires him to go to bed at 9 o'clock every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to be dressing Jackson 's wounds . The Hanrahan family is one of the oldest and best known in Stamford . The father of the family , now dead , was known as " Honest Dan . " He established the feed store and acquired considerable property , Dr. Hanrahan is a graduate of Fordham University and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College . Mr. Hanrahan , the notary public , is active in politics . He called attention last night to the coincidence that Walter S. Ward 's wife was - Beryl Curtis before her marriage and that she was a , Stamford girl . Althou'h the Hanrahan family said they were puzzled how Cunningham learned their names , information reached the authorities from other Stamford residents that a man resembling Cunningham had been seen in Stamford between the time when the Ward case became public and the time when Cunningham - told his story to the authorities . It was also pointed out that Cunningham first came into the ease by writing an anonymous letter to The New York American in response to that newspaper 's offer of 41,000 reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter gave his own name as that of ' a man who knew much about the case , and told something of what he alleged he knew . Recants His Original Story . Then The American got intocommunication with h him . ' Upon his information The American published a story last Wednesday to the effect that Ward had shot Peters and a second man in the library Qt the Ward house , and that one of four bullets fired by Ward had neezil imbedded in the . woodwork of ti# library . It was after examination of house by the authorities revealed no 4ullet hole or any trace of repairs made to the woodwork that The American induced Cunningham to meet the Westchester authorities in a room at the Hotel Maelpin on Thursday night . Cunningham ' then recanted his original story under questioning by the authorities , and told the yarn that was investigated yesterday . The White Plains officials remained in Stamford trying to get some evidence to support Cunningham 's story until 1:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon . Then they returned to White Plains , where Sheriff Werner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . The Sheriff tried to persuade Cunningham to sign a waiver of his right not to be taken out of New York State and to accompany the party back to Stamford so that he could point out the persons and places he had named , but Cunningham refused . His lawyer , it was . said , advised him not to take the trip . When interviewed at his home in Rye , N. Y. , last night , Sheriff Werner was non-committal as to his belief in Cunningham 's story after his attempts to check it up in Stamford . The Sheriff made the following statement : Acting on information that we obtained from Cunningham , I made a trip to Stamford today , leaving at 9 A. M. and staying until 1:30 P. M. Cunningham said that Jackson was wounded and in a private sanitarium or hospital in Stamford . We also understood that he had taken Jackson to the home of some physician in Stamford that night . The first - thing we did was to round up all the taxi drivers and chauffeurs . I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we interviewed was a man named Charles Rogers . Cunningham mentioned a man named Charles Rogers in his statement as the man who drove Jackson from New Rochelle to Stamford . " I am satisfied that the Charles Rogers we saw this afternoon was not the man referred to by Cunningham . His Physical characteristics differ radically from the description of Charley Rogers given by Cunningham . We asked Rogers if he knew Cunningham . He said he did know ' a man in New York named ' Cunningham , but/ questioning proved that the man he knew and . our man were not the same . Expects to Get Pull Story . " I feel-sure Rogers is not the man . " Sheriff Werner said he was satisfied that neither Cunningham , Joe Jackson nor Charley Rogers had been in Dr. Hanrahan 's house on the night in question . Despite the discrepancies already found in Cunningham 's story , and . his refusal to give further details , Sheriff Werner said he expected to get the full story and the real truth out of the prisoner in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Pinkertons , said Cunningham 's information had not proved conclusive as yet . " We questioned him in White Plains today , " said Scott , " but we could not get any real information out of him . He would not say anything definite . He gave us no clues whatever by which we could locate the other two men he mentioned . Of course , his whole story irnegquidroense.careful checking , which is beUntil the check is completed , Scott said , he would not care to express an opinion of the value of Cunningham 's statement . Mr. Scott denied a report that Pinkertons were looking for a man known as Charley Ross and also known as " Pug " in connection with a fist fight between that man and Ward at the paddock of the Bowie , Md. race track some time ago . According to this story , Ward and " Pug , " who was a second rate prize fighter , semi-professional baseball player 5. nd general hanger-on of the sporting world , were thrown out of the paddock after they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore to continue their fight . Mr. Scott said he had never heard of the incident . A dispatch from Baltimear Jest night ; said that the Pinkerton detectives and  - -  other nersons assigned to the Bowie - khew nothing of the story . " A track detective said he did not know Ward , as he would if he were a heavy bettor at that track . Ward Seldom at Races Recently . Captain Duhain , in charge of the Pinkerton operatives doing - race track duty throughout the county , conferred with District Attorney Weeks in While Plains during the day . The detective told the prosecutor he had learned that Ward had not visited the race track more than once or twice this year , ' arid only on occasional Saturdays last ' year , although previously he had been a steady patron of the races and a heavy plunger . It was recalled that Cunningham in his original story said that he first met Ward at the track about WU years ago . According to the Pinkertons , they  --  verified Cunningham 's statement that ho was employed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race track in 1920 , but also found that he had been discharged by the Jockey Club , The Pinkertons said they found ? that he bad spied upon jockeys at Saratoga , and had acted as an agent provocateur , inducing jockeys to break the rules , so that he could inform on them . ' It was not learned whether the inieetitlgators had verified Cunningham 's statement that in an investigation for Corem od ore J. K. L. Ross , the Canadian horseman , he had reported Walter S. Ward to be associated with Arnold Rothstein , the gambler , and bet " smart money " with a " wise mob . " Mr. Rothstein could not be found by reporters . Commander Ross , in Ottawa , said Cunningham had worked for him as an investigator , but he had not heard from him for months . Val O'Farrell , head of the detective agency which bears his name , denied the statement attributed to Cunningham that the wounded man , Jackson , had been employed by him . He also denied he had ever worked in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beating Hotels . At the Thiele Detective Agency it was said a man named J. J : Cunningham worked there about four years ago ; being a capable " shadow . " It was learned elsewhere that Cunningham had been arrested in Syracuse in January . 1922 , on complaint of the Hotel Onondaga ; that in August , 1921 , the Hotel Emerson in Baltimore charged that he beat it out of $56 , and that the United States Hotel in Saratoga charged that he beat it out of $91.30 in September , 1921 . It was also said that the Breslin had lost $156 and the Pennsylvania- and Commodore had lost money because of Cunningham . " In Cunningham 's capacity as investigator for , Commodore Ross , " Mr. McCarthy , the lawyer , said last night . " he became acquainted with a. - certain set of racing men and gamblers , and in that way knew something about , the Ward-Peters affair . But there Is nothing in his statements to me . that would implicate him as a material witness . My client and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible.f* Cunningham 's mother , Mrs. Cunningham , of 2,134 Lafontaine Avenue , the Bronx , said at her home , , last night that her son 's stories of . the shooting were " nonsense .

" 1 Cunningham 's wife is expected to visit ' him at the jail today . e ' In New Rochelle Ward appeared worried and haggard , but Mrs. Ward was as cool and - smiling as ever . Ward left home at 9 A. M. in a Peerless touring car which he is now , using instead of the Peerless coupe that figured in his story of the shooting . He refused to discuss Cunningham 's story . Detectives were observed guarding. the Ward house last night . They stopped reporters and asked to see their credentials . At Police Headquarters . it -. was learned that Mrs. Ward - thought she had seen some suspicious looking charadters lurking about the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
