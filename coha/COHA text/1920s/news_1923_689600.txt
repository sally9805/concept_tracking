txt HIRAM JOHNSON was caught in a moment of " rare good humor " the other day . For some time his good humor will continue . He beckons to the " rank and file " in forty-eight States . Alike to Presidential preference primaries and conventions of " hand-picked " delegates he sounds his terrible approach . His posters blare from the walls of " every Republican club in Hudson County , " New Jersey . SANFIELD MACDONALD of Oregon has alread ? given him that State , Montana and California . Mr. JOHN DEVOY , who seldom permits himself to agree with anybody , heartily agrees with HIRAM , who " offers an American policy . " The conquering Californian , unwilling to deny himself to any of these United States , seems ready to act upon Mr. GEORGE HENRY PAYNE 'S thoughtful suggestion that " Senator JOHNSON might develop un " expected strength in certain parts " of New England . " Conditions have entirely changed since 1020 , and Mr. JOHNSON has changed into a reactionary . ' Then he was used by astute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he develops on his own hook will . be " unexpected . " It is right and necessary that he should go to Massachusetts and strive to collect a delegate or two . It ought not to be doubtful that , a mountain among mountains , he will loom over Vermont and rescue its helpless Republican voters from the machine that is seeking to impose ? Mr. CoottutiE upon them . He comes as an - emancipator to the " rank and file . " If they refuse to throw off their chains , It wo n't be , on account of ' insufficient clanking on his part . Already he has won a preliminary victory . He is going to issue his message at Chicago Nov. 27 , thus forestalling Mr. ' CooLmon and dimming the interest in his recommendations to Congress . The President can only recommend . Mr. JOHNSON always commands . There is but one speck in this ungarnered fruit . What will avail the unexpected strength in New England if the expected weakness continues in California ? In his June letter of disillusion Mr. JOHNSON poured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no illusions now about California . Really , C. K .. I doubt if I could carry it against HOOVER , HARDLNO or any other candidate . The old crew are in the saddle . For the first time since 1910 they have the State , all its offices , and an active , militant organization , both in publicity and otherwise , in the large counties . What friends we have in Los Angeles are discouraged , and not only that ; but they do not command the confidence of the general public . No newspaper can be counted on there , as we have learned to our cost . So you see we have our difficulties ahead of us . The difficulties have grown worse . The California Republican opponents of Mr. JOHNSON . are fighting him tooth and nail . Were his habitual wisdom and that of his counselors not known , he would seem to be much in the position of a man who is paying calls while his house is on fire . '             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
