Some 90 years ago , a man-child was born into the family of a New York state dairy farmer and christened Jason . As that boy grew , according to popular tales , he acquired an education by hard work , invented a mouse-trap and performed sundry undistinguished feats . " It was in the year 1857 that this same person came into the business world with his first name shortened to Jay , and in possession of the Rutland &; Washington R. R. He soon parted with this property at a profit and , in 1860 , went down to Manhattan . <P> In the remaining 32 years of his life he amassed a fortune of some 72,000,000 . Two-fisted and far from scrupulous , he turned to speculation in railroad stocks , buying and selling roads on a great scale . At one time , he was credited with controlling every important through railway route west and southwest of St. Louis except the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe and the Atlantic &; Pacific . He was credited with control , at one time or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas Pacific , the Denver Pacific , the Missouri Pacific , the Wabash , the International &; Great Northern , the St. Louis Southwestern , the Texas Pacific , the ron Mountain- together with the Western Union Telegraph Co . He bought arid sold and sometimes he ruined , but he always profited . After a time , he turned to more constructive practice , planned a great ocean-to-ocean railroad system- the Western Maryland , the Wabash , the St. Louis Southwestern , the Missouri Pacific . <P> Then , worn out with thunderous living , still in his fifties , he died . He left this system- under a trust designed to preserve it- and six children- George Jay , Edwin , Howard , Helen , Frank J. and Anna . Three of the sons married actresses and one daughter married a foreign nobleman . There have been three divorces in that generation . <P> George Jay , the eldest son , undertook to complete his father 's transcontinental system and " muffed it . " He started building the Western Pacific . He fought Harriman , Morgan and Kuhn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh for the Wabash at a great price . When the panic of 1907 came , several of the roads were in poor condition , went into bankruptcy and George Jay was obliged to go to his enemies for money . He lost control of the Missouri Pacific , of the Western Union Telegraph Co. , of the Denver &; Rio Grande . He lost the Western Pacific , the Texas Pacific . Meanwhile , his losses had aroused his brothers and sisters , who succeeded in ousting him from control of his father 's estate . The fight is still on , although George Jay died nearly two years ago . His brothers and sisters are trying to recover $30,000,000 , which they say he lost from the estate by mismanagement , from his ten children by two marriages . Of the seven older children by his first marriage- Kingdon , Jay , George Jay Jr. , Marjorie , Vivien , Edith , Gloria- three eloped , one married an English nobleman , and one the daughter of an Hawaiian princess . <P> The family has spread , but hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jay has slipped from their grasp . Last week , Edwin , second son of the great Jay , let it be known that even that had gone- control of the St. Louis Southwestern was sold to the Rock Island .
