At Chagrin Falls . Out from the mountainous , forested pit of Bellefonte , Pa. , Gethsemane of eastern airmail pilots , flew National Air Transport 's Thomas P. Nelson last week . As he headed west for Cleveland thick snow flurries hid him from the ground . At snow-blown Cleveland Pilot Nelson was late , by minutes , hours , days . Col. Lindbergh , onetime flying companion of the missing man , flew his own machine over the treacherous Alleghenies to join 25 other planes in a systematic search of northern Ohio . Presumption was that Nelson was forced down by ice forming on the wings of his plane . Wing ice changes the air foil to such an extent that the wing no longer exerts a lifting power in forward motion . This trouble and decreased visibility due to fog or snow will bring down the best of pilots . The airmail route between Cleveland and New York is considered the worst in the country , with few landing fields , rugged and forest-covered terrain . <P> Three days after the disappearance , a rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls , where the Alleghenies give their last , low roll towards the Great Plains . He had jumped just before crashing . The jump apparently stunned him . The half-open folds of his parachute quilted him too thinly . Unconscious , he froze to death , hard by the busy Cleveland to Pittsburgh motor road , the tenth mail flyer to die on the New York-Cleveland route . <P> High High Wind . Towering over Anacostia , D. C. to test a new climbing plane , the Navy 's high flyer Apollo Soucek , holder of the U. S. altitude record ( 39,140 ft. ) encountered a 60 m. p. h. wind at a height of six miles . Up and down he frisked to study its prevalent direction . It blew steadily from the west . Visionary . Apollo Soucek foresaw the day of multi-motored transports roaring out of the west at these heights , driven by this raging gale , across the continent in half the standard 30 hrs. now needed . <P> Glider Prize . The first U. S. person to glide ten hours in a motorless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steptoe Evans , founder-president of the National Glider Association , * made the offer at the association 's dinner in Manhattan last week . The association has a score of affiliated clubs with about 600 members . William Patterson MacCracken , resigned assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics , spoke of gliding as a cheapening , accelerating factor in the training of commercial pilots . <P> Hoppers . Unquenched by high percentage of failures , two flyers last week winner in the Oakland-Honolulu flight of 1927 ( TIME , Aug. 29 , 1927 ) , in a specially built plane will attempt to fly from Paris to New York solo . Capt . Lewis A. Yancey , Maine-to-Spain non-stopper ( TIME , July 22 ) , has in mind a west-east crossing with Emile H. Burgin . <P> *He is president of Detroit Aircraft Corp. , which embraces Lockheed Aircraft Co. , Ryan Aircraft Corp. , Grosse Ile Airport , Aircraft Development Corp. , Parks Air College , Eastman Aircraft Corp. , Winton Aviation Engine Co. , Blackburn Aeroplane Corp .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
