Fendler the Supreme Court in Manhattan last week awarded $781,891.10 , royalties due her from The Bird of Paradise , alleged plagiarism of her play In Hawaii .

She , one Ellen Delmour , 21 , " burleycue " chorine , was standing too close to the revolver whence came the report . A spark lit her flimsy dress . Her burns hurt , will not kill .                   @ @
