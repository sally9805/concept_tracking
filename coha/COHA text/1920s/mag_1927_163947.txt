Modestly , Bacteriologist James C. Small of the Philadelphia General Hospital told Director Wilmer Krusen of the Philadelphia Public Health Department that he had isolated a new , minute organism ( Streptococcus cardioarthritidis ) from the blood of rheumatic patients and had been able to build a serum that cured a few cases of rheumatism . Director Krusen was delighted , for the cause of rheumatism ( rheumatic fever ) is obscure . Doctors know as little about it as they do about cancer . Rheumatism does not kill so many people as does cancer . Yet it is responsible for one-fourth of all heart disease deaths . <P> The Philadelphia men are confident they have the remedy for rheumatism . But , proper scientists , they made their announcement cautiously : " We are making only modest claims as to the value of this new serum because it is still in the experimental stage , and too small a number of cures has been effected to evaluate properly its ultimate efficacy . We do not wish to arouse undue hopes in the minds of sufferers from acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there will be many disputes in the medical profession , both pro and con , as to the real merits of this discovery . Should confirmation be made that Dr. Small has isolated and identified the specific cause of this disease and has prepared a serum for its cure , we shall then have achieved a success rivaling no less a discovery than that of insulin for the treatment of diabetes .
