The Enemy . Two years ago in Manhattan , Playwright Charming Pollock offered theatre-goers a play whose purpose was to prove the too-often demonstrated assertion that War is Hell . Transposed now to the more extensive medium of the cinema , The Enemy monotonously but accurately hammers the nail of that assertion into the stout oak of the public intelligence . <P> The story is that of a young Austrian who is roused from his wedding breakfast by the call to arms . His bride waits for him , trying to find money with which to buy food for herself and her baby , her mind always a battlefield of fears and sorrows . At last the young lieutenant who is supposed to have been killed , reappears for a conclusion that weakens , somewhat , the effect of the picture 's sound and peaceful propaganda . <P> Brilliant direction by Fred Niblo does much to whip up a story that is pulling a heavy wagon of argument . But most of the credit for making The Enemy an engrossing and beautiful moving picture must go to Actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war has robbed . Now 29 , Actress Gish appeared on the stage for the first time when she was 4 years old at a salary of $10 weekly . Now she has $8000 a week , a police-dog , a canary , a gluttonous appetite for licorice candy , and a reputation for frail , goldenhaired beauty that has suggested , in a recent popular song , this recipe for exceptional loveliness : " Put Cleopatra into a dish , add a dash of Lillian Gish . " <P> The Gay Defender is none other than Richard Dix , wearing a warm coat of California tan . An inevitably charming and good-natured outlaw , he cracks his long whip , shoots , stabs as if he were playing the role of a contemporary gangster instead of Joaquin Murrietta whose career was a trail of blood , bullets , alcohol and love for a pure sweet girl through the days of ' 49 . There is no need to fear that Jake Hamby and his gang will be spry enough to catch and hang so gallant a jack , although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a technical term for those grotesque and abbreviated limbs on which stocking drummers display their flimsy wares . The drummer in this case is Madge Bellamy , and as such she is successful enough to surpass the sales records of her rival who is also her lover . Actress Bellamy , moreover , is herself a not unsatisfactory stuffing for cloaks , suits , stockings . <P> A Hero for a Night . This is one more airy and erratic farce which tries not very successfully to add to current aeronautical excitement . The plot concerns an easygoing taxicab driver and a thieving millionaire who head their plane for the Manhattan Stock Exchange and arrive , with surprising ease , in Russia . This funny &; heroic feat enables the taxicab driver to marry the millionaire 's daughter .
