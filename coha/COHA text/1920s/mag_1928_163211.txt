An error between 2.75% and 5.3% has existed in the House of Representatives since the census of 1920 . At its best , the House is never a perfect mirror of the U. S. voters , but even this ascertainable error in the House would , in an average mirror , be enough to make wise men look stupid , proud men look fools , honest men look knaves . Most knavish of all look the members of the House who have prevented a reapportionment of popular representation in the U. S. since 1920. * <P> Should a reapportionment of seats be made on the basis of the 1920 census without increasing the House membership above its present , cumbersome 435 , the following States would lose seats : Missouri , 2 ; Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Rhode Island , Vermont , Mississippi , Nebraska , one each . That is the 2.75% error . Should the estimated census of 1930 be used , 23 seats would be involved , or 5.3% of 435 . Losses then would be : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , two each ; Alabama , Kansas , Louisiana , Maine , Massachusetts , Nebraska , New York , North Dakota , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Vermont , Virginia , one each . <P> How and why majorities against reapportionment are mustered by the Southern Democrats it is easy to see . Seats gained on the 1930 basis would be : California , 6 ; Michigan , 4 ; Ohio , 3 ; New Jersey , Texas , 2 ; Arizona , Connecticut , <P> Florida , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Washington , one each . In addition of course , these states would gain ( and the others lose ) a like number of votes in the electoral college , which chooses the President of the U. S. <P> Connecticut 's patient Fenn got his 1930-basis reapportionment bill out on the House floor last week and it was debated for three hours . But the same old thing happened . The measure was sent back to committee , i.e. smothered to death . The mirror stays warped . <P> <P> * The constitution calls for reapportionment every ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1910 census .
