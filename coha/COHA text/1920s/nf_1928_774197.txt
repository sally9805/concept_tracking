txt p 300 application in 1926 for admission to the League , made known that she desired to be exempted from the possible military obligations of the Covenant , but the exemption was not allowed . The Scandinavian states desired a similar exemption in respect to the obligation to participate in the blockade measures of the League , but it was refused . ' Colombia desired to accede to the Covenant in such a way as to avoid recognition by her of the independence of Panama , which she had never admitted . After some discussion of the matter the Council authorized the Secretary-General to acknowledge the receipt of the Colombian proposal without expressing any opinion on the merits of the point raised . The question as to whether a state could be admitted subject to conditions not imposed on other members was raised in connection with a proposal that states having racial or linguistic minorities should be required to give guarantees for the protection of such minorities such as had been given by certain states like Poland and Czechoslovakia by means of special treaties . Doubt being felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly adopted a recommendation that thereafter such states applying for membership should enter into the obligation suggested . Finland in her application stated that she was prepared to give such an undertaking and was admitted in pursuance of this understanding.2 Footnote  | Loss of Membership . ? The membership of a state in the League may be terminated in three ways : first , by withdrawal after two years ' notice , provided all its international obligations and all its obligations under the Covenant have been fulfilled ( Covenant , Art . 1 ) . It is not clear to whom the notice shall be given or who is to determine whether the said obligations have been fulfilled , but it is presumably the Council and the Assembly . ' Second , a state which signifies its dissent to a duly adopted amendment to the Covenant , automatically ceases to be a member of the League ( Art . 26 ) . Third , any member which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared by a unanimous vote of the Council and the Assembly , not counting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member ( Art . 16 ) . Thus , the right of secession is recognized and the door left open for the voluntary dissolution of the League . The right of the League to rid itself of Covenant-breaking members is also , properly , reserved since the very foundation of the League consists of a series of covenants and hence there can be no place in it for members who refuse to perform their obligations thereunder . Objects and Purposes of the League . ? The general purposes for which the League was created are , as stated in the preamble to the Covenant : first , the promotion of international cooperation ; and , second , the achievement of international peace and security . The means by which these ends are to be accomplished , as also stated in the preamble , are : ( I ) by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war , ( 2 ) by the prescription of open , just , and honorable relations between nations , ( 3 ) by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another . Footnote  | Its powers , or rather those of its organs , are numerous , but they may be classified in a general way as follows : first , those which have to do with the execution of the treaties of peace ; 1 second , those which relate to measures for the prevention of war and the guaranteeing of the security of its members ; third , those which are designed to promote fair and humane conditions of labor throughout the world ; and fourth , those of a miscellaneous character , such as the registration of treaties , the collection and dissemination of information , the supervision of territories ; under mandate , and the exercise of a sort of trusteeship over the Saar Basin and the free city of Danzig . Footnote  | FORMS AND TYPES OF GOVERNMENT Footnote I. CLASSIFICATION The State and Government Distinguished . ? From an examination of types of states and unions of states we come now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that the state and its government are , strictly speaking , separate and distinct institutions . The state , as we have seen , is a politically organized community of people independent of external control or nearly so , and sovereign in respect to its internal affairs , or at least possessing so large an autonomy that for all practical purposes it may be regarded as a state . Government , on the other hand , is the organization through which the state manifests its will , issues its commands , and conducts its affairs . While , as pointed out in a previous chapter , all states are alike in their  | essence , that is , in respect to the component elements which enter into their make-up , and , in general , in respect to their ends and objects , and therefore do not readily lend themselves to differentiation and classification , governments , on the other hand , vary widely in respect to the form of their organization , frequently in respect to their spirit and methods , in respect to the mode in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the authority with which they are invested , the particular objects which they seek to accomplish , the relations between their legislative , executive , and judicial organs , and various other matters . Attempts to classify them have usually , therefore , been more successful than attempts at the classification of states , for the reason that satisfactory criteria can be found upon which various governments can be grouped into one class and others in a different class in such a manner that the distinction between the different classes subserves both practical and scientific ends . Criteria of Classification . ? As in the classification of states , the essential problem is to find the proper criteria . Naturally the political scientist , the jurist , the international lawyer , and the sociologist , each frequently approaching the subject from a different point of view and each emphasizing different characteristics of governments , are not always in agreement as to what these criteria should be . Political scientists themselves are not in accord in respect to the tests which should be adopted . Many classifications which have been proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because they were not based upon any consistent scientific principle ; others because the criterion adopted leads to classifications which are of little scientific or practical value . One difficulty , it may be observed , lies in the fact that in recent times a great variety of new forms of government have come into existence and these are constantly undergoing changes which differentiate them fundamentally from the old forms out of which they evolved . The result is that classifications made in one epoch and satisfactory enough at the time soon become out of date .  | II . MONARCHY , ARISTOCRACY , OLIGARCHY , AND DEMOCRACY Classification Based on the Number of Persons Who Exercise Sovereign Power . ? Adopting the same test that is employed in classifying states , namely , the number of persons in whom the supreme and final authority is vested , many writers , especially the older ones , have classified governments as monarchies , aristocracies , and democracies . In its widest sense any government in which the supreme and final authority is in the hands of a single person is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the nature and duration of his tenure . In this sense it is immaterial whether his office is conferred by election ( by parliament or people ) or is derived by hereditary succession , or whether he bears the title of emperor , king , czar , president , or dictator . It is the fact that the will of one man ultimately prevails in all matters of government which gives it the character of monarchy . ' As pointed out in a previous chapter , however , some writers consider monarchy to be a form of government in which the chief of state derives his office through inheritance , according to rules of hereditary succession which in practice vary in different states.2 It is this characteristic which distinguishes a monarchy from a republic , the latter being a form of government in which the head of the state is elective . Jellinek , as we have seen , defined monarchy as a government by a single physical will and he emphasized that its essential characteristic is the competence of the monarch to " express the highest power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his power being actually exercised by others , the government is in reality a republic , whatever may be Footnote  | the title of the chief of state , the source of his election , or the nature of his tenure . Thus , he says , France under the constitution of 1791 , although officially characterized as a monarchy , was in reality a republic with a hereditary chief of state . ' The same might be said of the British monarchy . Kinds of Monarchy . ? Considered from the standpoint of the source from which the monarch derives his office , monarchies may be classified as hereditary and elective , or they may be a combination of both . Most monarchies of the past and all of those which now exist were and are hereditary in character ; that is , the monarch inherits the crown according to a fixed rule of succession ; this may have been determined by the constitution or an act of parliament , or it may have been a rule of the particular dynastic house or family to which the monarch belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and partly by the other . The rules have varied in different states . As already stated , instances of so called " elective " monarchies have not been lacking in the past . ' The early Roman kings were elective and so were those of the ancient monarchy of Poland . The emperors of the Holy Roman Empire were chosen by a small college of electors , usually from the same family . During the Middle Ages elective monarchies were not uncommon , but they usually became hereditary in consequence of the practice of choosing the kings from a particular family . They were not always , however , chosen for life , a practice which Jellinek considered to be contrary to the nature of true monarchy . In early times monarchs were originally chosen or in some form accepted by the people , though the hereditary feature was so strong that Footnote  | the elective principle was gradually pushed into the background . ' Speaking of the election of the early English kings , Stubbs observed that " the king was in theory always elected and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages in accordance with the most ancient precedent . " 2 But , " he adds , " it is not less true that the succession was by constitutional practice restricted to one family , and that the rule of hereditary succession was never , except in great emergencies and in most trying times , set aside . " In a sense , of course , the English monarchy is still elective , since parliament claims and exercises the right to regulate the law of succession at its pleasure . ' In the case of several more recently created states , such as Belgium and some of the Balkan states , the first monarchs were chosen by election ; their successors inheriting their crowns by hereditary succession . So the new king of Norway was elected by the Norwegian parliament in 1905 , following a plebiscite which pronounced in his favor , but thereafter the crown will be transmitted by hereditary succession . In 1903 , after the assassination of the king of Serbia , his successor was chosen by the Serbian parliament . Absolute Monarchies . ? Considered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified as : ( a ) absolute , arbitrary , or despotic , and ( b ) constitutional , parliamentary , or limited . An absolute monarchy is one in which the monarch is not merely the titular head of the state but is actually the sovereign ; that is , his will is the law in respect to all matters Footnote  | upon which it is proclaimed . In short , he is bound by no will except his own . Under such a system the state and the government , legally speaking , are identical , the monarch being not only an organ of government , and the sole organ , but also the sovereign . The nature of his power was expressed by the Roman maxim quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem , and later by the French version of the same maxim qui veut le roi , si veut la loi . The boast attributed to Louis XIV , " I am the State " ( l'etat , c'est moi ) was a fairly accurate description of the role of a typical absolute monarch . Examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them survived to a date well on in the nineteenth and even the twentieth century . Among them were the Russian and Ottoman monarchies , and to a less degree those of Prussia , Austria , and Hungary . With the advancing tide of democracy , however , absolute monarchy has completely disappeared from the continent of Europe . In form it still survives in a few more or less backward states of Asia and Africa . Limited Monarchy . What is usually described as limited monarchy is one in which the power of the monarch is restricted by the prescriptions of a written constitution or by certain unwritten fundamental constitutional principles , such as the British monarchy . These constitutional rules or principles define in some degree the powers of the monarch , or limit what is called the " royal prerogative " and usually upon his accession to the throne he is required to take a solemn oath to respect and observe them . In some cases these constitutions , it is true , were not the work of national assemblies representing the people but were framed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution of 185o and the existing constitution of Italy , 1848 ) , but once promulgated it was understood that such of their prescriptions as placed limitations upon the rights and powers of the monarch were in the nature of a contract between him and the people and therefore binding upon him . All the surviving monarchies of Europe and some of those of Asia and  | Africa , fall within the class of limited monarchies . Those which belong to each class may be and have been subdivided into various types , but the lines of demarcation which separate them are mainly distinctions of degree or of historical development , and little or nothing would be gained by dwelling upon them ) . Aristocracy . ? Aristocracy is usually defined as a form of government in which political power is exercised by the few . Some writers , in the endeavor to be more exact , define it as government by a minority of the citizens . But as thus defined it is not necessarily government by a few , since the minority may be numerically a very large one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be so shadowy in fact that the distinction is not sufficient to distinguish the character of a government by the one from that of the other . In fact , in many states regarded as democratic , political power is exercised by a minority of the citizens . Formerly , women had no voice or share in the government , and this is still true in some states . In all countries minors are disfranchised ; in some illiterate persons are excluded from voting ; and in some soldiers , convicted criminals , bankrupts , paupers , and other classes are debarred . It would seem , therefore , to be more exact to define aristocracy as a form of government in which only a relatively small proportion of the citizens have a voice in the choosing of public officials and in determining public policies . It is not practicable to lay down any precise rule as to the size of the minority which would make the government aristocratic in character . The ancient Greeks conceived aristocracy to be government by the best . Whether they meant by the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and moral character or those who were superior to the rest by reason of their wealth or social status , is not clear . In either case it would normally be government by the few , though not necessarily so , since a condition of society is conceivable in which the Footnote  | best intellectually , morally , and economically would constitute a majority of the population . The late Professor Jellinek , who considered aristocracy to be a special form of a more general type which he called " republic , " emphasized the social aspect of aristocracy . Aristocracy he conceived to be a form of government in which some particular class played the dominant role . It might be a priestly , military , professional , or land-owning class or several or all of those combined . In any case , they constitute a fraction of the population , juridically distinct from the mass , by reason of certain privileges or rights which they enjoyed . Aristocracy in all its forms , he said , rests upon the existence of a preponderant social element , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , politically , exercises domination over the rest . ' Aristocracy as a form of government was very common in former times . Many governments popularly described as monarchies were in reality aristocracies . Jellinek recognized two general types : first , those in which the ruling class was entirely separated from the rest of the population so that it was impossible for an individual who did not belong to the ruling class to gain admission to it ; second , those in which there was nothing of a juridical nature to prevent a member of an inferior class from acquiring under certain conditions political privileges reserved for the dominant class . Examples of the first type were hereditary aristocracies ; of the second type were those based upon wealth , education , social prominence , etc . Rousseau , as is well known , classified aristocracies as natural , elective , and hereditary . ' By a " natural " aristocracy , he meant a government by those who by their natural ability as leaders , and by education and experience are best qualified to govern ; while by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are chosen by the whole mass . The " elected " aristocrats might or might not be at the same time the " natu-Footnote  | ral " aristocrats , depending upon the action of the electorate in making their choice . Oligarchy . ? The ancient Greeks carefully distinguished between aristocracy and oligarchy . Aristotle defined the latter as a government by the few in their own interests , or more correctly , government by the wealthy ; it was therefore a perverted form of aristocracy , which was government by the good or best people of the state . ' The late Professor Seeley called it a " deranged " or " diseased " form of aristocracy . ' Popular usage to-day , however , rarely distinguishes between aristocracy and oligarchy , the two terms usually being employed indiscriminately to describe any government in which only a small minority have the controlling voice . But a few writers still observe the distinction . Thus they say the government of Prussia was formerly an oligarchy rather than an aristocracy , but the difference hardly seems important.3 It was in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the other wealthy and bureaucratically trained classes , exercised the controlling power . Whether it was an oligarchy or an aristocracy is largely Footnote  | a matter of definition . This form of government , whether we call it aristocracy or oligarchy , in the sense of being government by a relatively small class , no longer survives in any European country , although , as will be pointed out in a later chapter , the upper legislative chambers in some states are still composed of hereditary elements , of members appointed by the crown , or of members elected by a restricted suffrage . The governments of such countries are therefore in part at least aristocratic . Democracy . ? Democracy has been variously conceived as both a political status , an ethical concept , and a social condition . Thus Giddings treats democracy as not only a form of government but also as a form of state , a form or condition of society , or a combination of all three . ' Some writers emphasize the distinction between political , economic ( or industrial ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things do not necessarily coincide in a given state . ' Thus a people may be democratic , socially speaking , but may have at the same time an undemocratic government , or vice versa . But the normal condition is the coincidence of the three ; that is , if society is democratic in its social and economic life , it will be democratic politically ; on the other hand , if it is sharply differentiated into social classes , it is likely to have a government based , in part at least , upon recognition of special privileges of the upper classes . Footnote  | Naturally , definitions of democracy as a form of government are multifarious , but like many definitions they are not exhaustive and do not admit of universal application . The ancient Greeks described democracy somewhat generally as government by the " many . " 1 Professor Seeley conceived it , in its modern sense , to mean " a government in which every one has a share " 2 ? a definition which would , if strictly interpreted , exclude from the category of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known in the past . Dicey defined it as a form of government in which " the governing body is a comparatively large fraction of the entire nation . " 3 Lord Bryce , whose knowledge of the forms and workings of democratic governments was perhaps greater than that of any other modern writer , stated that " the word democracy has been used ever since the time of Herodotus to denote that form of government in which the ruling power of a state is largely vested , not in any particular class or classes , but in the members of the community as a whole . " He added : " This means , in communities which act by voting , that rule belongs to the majority , as no other method has been found for determining peaceably and legally what is to be declared the will of a community which is not unanimous . " This definition Footnote  | of democracy as government by a majority of the people is perhaps as satisfactory as any that has been given , but , as Lord Bryce himself admitted , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact exclude from the suffrage the illiterate and non-property owning or non-taxpaying class , rule out states which certainly regard themselves as democratic . Would it not also eliminate states in which women are still unenfranchised ? Formerly the exclusion of women from voting was not considered to be inconsistent with political democracy , but to-day when in many states women enjoy equal political privileges with men . there is a large body of opinion in favor of the view that no state which denies them the right to vote , to sit in the legislature , and to hold office can justly claim to be considered as a true democracy . Where one of the legislative chambers of a state is elected by universal suffrage but the other is entirely non-elective or is chosen by a very restricted suffrage , may the government be properly regarded as democratic ? Or if both chambers are democratically elected but the head of the state is a hereditary king , or if the constitution confers the right of suffrage on the mass of the people but the majority do not in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference , or are prevented by intimidation from exercising it , as is alleged to be the case in certain Latin-American republics , can it be said that the governments of such states are truly democratic ? Kinds of Democracy ; the Pure Type . ? Democracies , like monarchies , are of several varieties . They are usually classified as ( a ) pure , or direct , and ( b ) representative , or indirect . A pure democracy , so called , is one in which the will of the state is formulated or expressed directly and immediately through the people in mass meeting or primary assembly , rather than through Footnote  | the medium of delegates or representatives chosen to act for them . Manifestly , a pure democracy is practicable only in small and relatively undeveloped communities where it is physically possible for the entire electorate to assemble in a given place and where the problems of government are few and simple . In large and complex societies , where the mass of citizens is too numerous to be convoked in a common assembly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous and complex , such a system of government is , for physical and other reasons , impossible . In the city states of ancient Greece and Rome , pure democracy was not impracticable and it was not uncommon , but in the highly complex and larger states of to-day it would , if attempted , break down in practice . The only surviving examples of pure democracies to-day are found in four of the smaller cantons of Switzerland ( Appenzell , Uri , Unterwalden , and Glarus ) where the voters , since the Middle Ages , have been accustomed to meet in assembly ( the Landesgemeinde ) ? a sort of " open-air parliament " ? for the purpose of electing their public officers , voting the taxes , and adopting legislative and administrative regulations . ) Until 1848 the same system prevailed in the cantons of Zug and Schweiz , but with the growth of population and the increasing complexity of the problems of government and legislation it was abandoned and a representative sy tem took its place . In time it will probably disappear for the ame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Th local town governments in some of the American states , notably those of New England , are sometimes cited as other examples of pure democracies . Formerly they functioned satisfactorily enough , but in the course of time new and changed conditions came into existence which have made the system less satisfactory . ' In states or local communities where the referendum and initia-Footnote  | tive have been introduced on a large scale , a modified or limited form of pure democracy undoubtedly exists . In some such states to-day it is possible for the people to initiate and adopt laws and constitutional amendments and determine questions of public policy directly themselves without the intervention or collaboration of representatives . In such communities the representative system is tending more and more to acquire the form of pure democracy although it will of course never be entirely or even largely superseded by the latter system . Representative Democracy . ? The second type of democracy ? representative government as it is usually styled ? is that form in which the will of the state is formulated and expressed through the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the people to act as their representatives . It is based on the idea that while the people can not be actually present in person at the seat of government they are considered to be present by proxy . ' Strictly speaking , a representative system of government need not necessarily be a democracy , if judged by modern standards , since the representatives may be chosen by a suffrage so restricted that it can not be justly regarded as democratic ; nevertheless , if democracy be interpreted in a broad sense , representative government is at the same time a form of democracy . ' Like the pure type of democracy , it attributes the ultimate source of authority to the people , but it differs from pure democracy in that it is constituted on the principle that the people are incapable of exercising in a satisfactory manner that authority directly themselves . In short , it rests upon the distinction between the possession of sovereignty and the exercise of it.3 As to the origin of this now almost universal system of govern-Footnote  | ment , there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some writers maintain that it had its beginnings in ancient times , notably in Switzerland , Germany , Holland , and even in Hungary ; others , that the modern system was merely a revival of the primitive Teutonic assembly of freemen . ' But the late Professor Henry J. Ford in his work on " Representative Government " ( 1924 ) concluded , after a careful study of the subject , that it hardly dates back of the middle of the nineteenth century . Although it originated in England in the seventeenth century and gained a foothold in Belgium in 183o when parliamentary institutions were established , the general movement for representative government began abruptly , he says , in the year 1848 in France and Italy.2 Since then it has spread in one form or another until it has become , as stated above , very nearly universal . Essentials of Representative Government . ? Strictly speaking , a representative government is one whose officials and agents are chosen by an electorate democratically constituted , who during their tenure of power reflect the will of the electorate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to this definition , a government by functionaries , whether legislative , executive , or judicial , who are appointed or selected by other proc sses than popular election , or who , if chosen by a democratically constituted electorate , do not in fact reflect the will of the maj rity of the electors or whose responsibility to the electorate is incapable of enforcement , is not truly representative . But judged by this rigorous test few , if any , existing governments could qualify as representative . Footnote  | In many states the head of the executive branch of the government is not chosen by popular vote ; in most of them the mass of executive and administrative officials , agents , and employes are selected by other methods than popular election ; in the majority of them the judges of the courts are appointed by the executive or elected by the legislature . Popular usage considers a representative government to be one in which the legislative branch at least is popularly elected . ' Thus in many of the most representative systems of Europe ( British , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parliament and local councils , no popularly elected officials or agents at all . In all such countries the selection by executive or legislative appointment of the mass of administrative agents and judicial magistrates is not regarded as at all inconsistent with the principle of representative government . Even in the United States and Switzerland , two of the most democratic republics , the principle of representative government is not understood to require the popular election of judges and administrative officials . Nor does it require the selection of even the members of legislative bodies by an unrestricted suffrage . As has already been pointed out , women were generally excluded from a share in the choice of all officials , legislative and otherwise , until very recently , and even now they are still excluded in a good many states which claim to have representative governments . Similarly , in some countries which are recognized as classic examples of democracy , legislative representatives in one or both chambers are chosen by electorates from which large classes of adults are excluded . The truth is , as Lord Bryce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the sense that they are carried on by a relatively small number of persons . ' This must necessarily be so . Representative government in the sense of government by functionaries all of whom are chosen by an unrestricted electorate , aside possibly from small and undeveloped communities , would be almost as impossible as the system of pure democracy itself . Republican Government . ? The term " representative " government is often used as synonymous with " republican " government . Thus Madison in The Federalist defined a republican form of government as one in which there was " a scheme of representation . " 2 It was , he said , " a government which derives all its powers , directly or indirectly , from the great body of the people and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure , for a limited period , or during good behavior . " The two " great points of difference , " said Madison , " between a republic and a democracy ( he was thinking of democracy in its " pure " form ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegated to a small number of citizens elected by the rest ; and , second , a republic is capable of embracing a larger population and of extending over a wider area of territory than is a democracy . In a democracy the p ple meet and exercise the government in person ; in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representative agents . ' 4 Madison rightly regarded hereditary tenures as inconsistent with modern notions of republican government , although he considered good behavior tenure for the judiciary at least admissible . It is also essential to the republican idea that the principle of representation shall be based upon a reasonably wide suffrage . A suffrage so restricted , for example , as that which existed in France under the restored monarchy ( 1814-1830 ) , when the number of voters did not exceed 300,000 out of a total population of about 30,000,000 , or in Belgium before 1893 , would hardly be considered consistent with republican government . Footnote  | Republics have been classified as aristocratic and democratic ; as monocratic and plutocratic ; 2 unlimited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocratic , and democratic ; as federal and confederate ; as centralized and unitary ; as hereditary and elective , etc . The term " republic " was formerly employed to describe certain forms of government which popular usage to-day would designate as monarchical or aristocratic . ' Thus Sparta , Athens , Rome , Carthage , the United Netherlands , Venice , and Poland have all been described by political writers as republics , though none of them possessed that full representative character which we to-day consider to be the distinguishing mark of a republic . Rome , for example , was organized on a military basis , Venice was an oligarchy of herditary nobles , Poland was a mixture of aristocracy and monarchy . France under the constitution of the year XII ( Tit . I , sec. i ) was styled a republic , though the chief of state bore the title and rank of emperor , and the crown was hereditary in the Napoleonic family . Other Classifications . ? Montesquieu classified governments as republics , monarchies , and despotisms . He defined a republican government as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Footnote  | people exercises supreme power ; a monarchy as one in which a single person governs by fixed and established laws ; a despotism as one in which a single person directs everything by his own will and caprice . ' The principle underlying this classification is partly numbers and partly the spirit and character of the government . Woolsey classified governments as monarchies , aristocracies , democracies , and " compound states . " 2 Other writers recognize only two forms , namely , monarchies and republics , the latter comprehending both aristocracies and democracies . ' The fault with most classifications of governments is , as was said of the classifications of states , that they do not rest upon any consistent scientific principle which will serve as a basis for the differentiation of governments with respect to their fundamental characteristics . No single classification can be of much value ; there must be as many classifications as there are points of view from which the government may be considered . The classification of governments as monarchies , aristocracies , and democracies has little scientific or practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea as to its real character . Many governments described as monarchial are in fact democracies , a'nd the distinction between aristocracies and democracies is often shadowy and largely a matter of definition . Such a classificatio would assign to the same category such widely different governments as those . of Great Britain on the one hand , and the former governments of Russia , Turkey , Prussia , and Austria on the other , while it would put into different classes the democracies of Great Britain and the United States . Footnote  | III . CABINET GOVERNMENT Professor Burgess 's Classification . ? Burgess adopts the following canons of distinction in classifying governmental forms : first , the identity or non-identity of the state with its government ; second , the nature of the official tenure , including the method of constituting the official relation ; third , the relation of the legislature to the executive ; and fourth , the concentration or distribution of governmental power . ' Upon the basis of the identity or non-identity of the state with the government , he classified them as primary or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mass meeting and enact the laws of the state and frame administrative regulations , is , of course , the nearest approach to what he called primary government . Where , on the other hand , the people have delegated to an organ or organs the power to act for it in matters of government , as is now the almost universal practice , we have representative government in some form , though not necessarily popular government . Considered from the standpoint of the nature and source of the official tenure , he classified governments as hereditary and elective . Such a classification is manifestly of little value , since there are no governments and never have been any which were either entirely hereditary or entirely elective . There are and have been many governments in which the chief of state held office by hereditary succession , and others in which he and other functionaries were elective , but none in which the governing class as a whole was either hereditary or elective . Footnote  | With respect to the relation of the executive to the legislature , governments may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " parliamentary , " and " responsible " are sometimes preferred ) , ' and what , for lack of a more suitable term , has been called presidential or congressional government . Cabinet Government Defined . ? Cabinet government is that system in which the real executive ? the cabinet or ministry is immediately and legally responsible to the legislature or one branch of it ( usually the more popular chamber ) for its political policies and acts , and mediately or ultimately responsible to the electorate ; while the titular or nominal executive ? the chief of state ? occupies a position of irresponsibility . The members of the ministry are usually members of the legislature and the leaders of the party in the majority , but whether they are members or not they usually have the privilege of occupying seats therein , of being heard , and of participating in the deliberations but without the right to vote unless they are members . ' It is also the practice ( sometimes it is so pro ided in the constitution ) that they may be subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in whi h they appear . In short , the ministerial office is not incompa ible with legislative mandate . On the contrary , the cabinet system normally presupposes the double char-Footnote  | acter of minister and member , and thus executive and legislative functions are " inextricably commingled . " " There is , " observes Courtenay Ilbert , " no such separation between the executive and legislative powers as that which forms the distinguishing mark of the American Constitution , " but the relation is one of intimacy and interdependence . Bagehot described the British cabinet as " a hyphen that joins , a buckle that fastens , the executive and legislative together . In another place he spoke of it as a committee of parliament chosen to rule the nation . ' It might be more accurately described as a committee of the party which has a majority in the House of Commons , ordinarily the minority party having no representation at all upon it . In this respect it differs from all other parliamentary committees . In its essence , says Lowell , it is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party in power . " 2 The nominal or titular executive , according to a legal fiction , is incapable of doing wrong , in a political sense , and is , as it were , under the guardianship of his ministers , who assume the responsibility for his official acts . Collectively they constitute the " government " ; they prepare , initiate , and urge the adoption by the legislature of all the more important legislative projects ; and from their seats in the legislature they defend their policies from attack , and when called upon must give an account of their official conduct . They are the heads of the great administrative departments and are , as stated above , usually the leaders of the majority party in the legislature . So long as their policies and official conduct command the support of the majority of the members of the legislature , or rather of that chamber to which they are responsible , they continue to hold the reins of office and govern the country . Footnote  | But as soon as the legislature clearly manifests its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of censure or by a refusal to pass the measures which it proposes or vote the sums of money which it asks , the ministry either resigns office in a body or it dissolves the chamber to which it owes responsibility , orders a new election , and appeals to the electorate to sustain it by returning a new legislature which is in sympathy with its policies and acts . If the results of the election are favorable to the ministry , it continues in office ; if adverse , it resigns as soon as the results are fully known or when the new legislature has assembled and by positive vote has made known its want of sympathy . Cabinet Government in Great Britain . ' ? In a typical cabinet system like that of Great Britain the ministry is usually taken wholly from the ranks of the party having a majority in the popular chamber , and thus possesses the character of homogeneity.2 In legal theory the prime minister is chosen by the nominal Footnote  | or titular executive , and he selects his colleagues , though where the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality chosen by the legislature and the designation by the chief of state of the prime minister is little more than a ceremonial function of investing him with the symbols of office . The number of ministers is rarely fixed either by law or by custom , and hence the size of the ministry is uncertain and variable , the exact number in any case being usually determined by the premier or by executive decree . The cabinet system originated in England and was the product of history rather than of invention . From England it spread little by little to Holland , France , Belgium , Rumania , Sweden , Footnote  | Norway , Denmark , Greece , and , in limited forms , to China and Japan , and the recently created new states of Europe , until it has become , says Esmein , " the principal system of government in the world . " 1 It made little headway in Germany , however , before the World War and none at all in Switzerland or the United States , and but little in Latin America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development in Great Britain , and there its workings have been attended with the most satisfactory results . Cabinet Government in the British Dominions . ? Not unnaturally the cabinet system of England was introduced in the British dominions , where it is " chiefly remarkable because of its close resemblance to the English model on which it is based . " ' It has not , however , worked with the same smoothness and facility as in the mother country from which it was imported . In some of the dominions , especially Australia , the system has been characterized by excessive instability . In the latter country , " ministry after ministry comes into office and disappears in the course of a few weeks or months . " 2 In Canada , however , the ministerial tenure has been longer and there has been consequently greater stability and continuity of policy . In most of the dominions " the inconsistent and stupid practice of requiring ministers after accepting office to vacate their seats , " prevails as it did in England until very recently , ' but in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the dominions , as in Great Britain , there is no uniform practice as to whether a defeated minority shall resign when the results of a disastrous election are known or whether they may wait until they are formally condemned by the newly elected legislature . As in Great Britain , the general rule is that the ministers may be turned out only by the lower house even where the upper house is popularly elected.4 Footnote  | The Cabinet System in Belgium . ? Among the cabinet systems of the Continent , that of Belgium most nearly resembles the British system , though the crown plays a more important role in that country than in England . The constitution expressly declares that no act of the king is valid unless it is countersigned by a minister who thereby assumes responsibility for it . The responsibility of ministers to the king is more real than in Great Britain , and he may direct and dismiss them with more freedom than the British sovereign mays As there are generally recognized parliamentary leaders , the king rarely has any real choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Belgium , as in Great Britain , ministers without portfolios are sometimes appointed as a means of introducing into the government eminent persons whose support and experience the government desires to avail itself of , yet who would hesitate to assume the burden of a cabinet portfolio . As in Great Britain , ministers are chosen not from the ranks of technical administrators , except the case of the minister of war , who is always a soldier and . rsually an active general , but from the members of parliament aard usually from the Chamber of Deputies rather than from the Senate . ' All Footnote  | ministers , whether members or not , have the entree into either chamber , where they have a right to be heard . The Cabinet System in France . ? The cabinet or parliamentary system of government was introduced in France by the Charter of 1814 , but it was a rather imperfect copy of the English model . While the king was declared to be irresponsible and the ministers responsible to the lower chamber , the dominating role which the restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was incompatible with the normal functioning of the parliamentary system . With the advent of the July monarchy in 183o and the shifting of the preponderance of power from the crown to the lower chamber of parliament , the . control of the latter body over the ministers became more effective and thus one of the conditions of the true parliamentary system came to prevail . In the language of M. Thiers , the king now reigned but did not govern . But from the first the French system differed from that of England , where this form of government has operated with the greatest success . In the first place , the existence of a multiple-party system under which no single political party usually had a majority in the Chamber of Deputies made it necessary that cabinets should be constituted on the coalition principle . Such cabinets are proverbially weak and consequently their tenure is usually very short , as compared with the tenure of British cabinets , the average being hardly more than eight months 1 and in recent years only three months . Nat-Footnote  | urally the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he is called ) is often attended with great difficulty and long delays , and the selection by him of his colleagues is usually an even more difficult task . ' Under such a system continuity of policy is necessarily difficult and frequently impossible . Other conditions and features of the French system differentiate it from that of Great Britain . French temperament is not especially favorable to the smooth working of the cabinet system . In Great Britain there is a disposition on the part of parliament to allow itself to be guided and directed by the ministry , the parliament contenting itself with the ultimate right of control . ' In France , on the contrary , the respective roles of parliament and ministry are reversed : the ministry instead of leading and guiding the parliament is itself controlled by the chambers even in respect to the details of administration and legislation and is frequently overthrown upon minor questions , notwithstanding the constitutional prescription that it shall be r sponsible only for its general policies . Through an excessive development of the practice of interpellations , ministers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimportant incidents , and are occasionally forced to resign on account of happenings which in England would not be regarded as meriting parliamentary discussion . This practice , which consumes a large part of the time of parliament and leads to the upsetting of ministries upon relatively unimportant questions , has been the object of much criticism by French writers , who charge that the existing Footnote  | French system is not the true parliamentary system but one which might more accurately be called deputantisme . ' In France , ministers are usually members of one or the other chamber , subject to the exception that occasionally the ministers of war and of marine are army or naval officers and not therefore members of parliament . Different from the British practice , ministers have the entree to both chambers , where they may be heard and interpellated , even when they are not members of either . As in Belgium and since 1919 in Great Britain , members who are appointed to ministerial positions are not required to submit to a new election . Between 1868 and 1914 no ministers without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War the earlier practice was revived . ' Undersecretaries Footnote  | of state who have charge of a portion of the administrative work of the department to which they are attached are frequently appointed , there being several such in the Viviani ministry of 1915 . In 1906 the practice was introduced of inviting them to attend the meetings of the council of ministers . Strictly speaking , they are not responsible to parliament , but in practice they resign with the ministries to which they are attached . There has been much discussion among the commentators on the French constitution as to whether the ministers are responsible to the Senate as well as to the Chamber of Deputies . On the one hand , it is argued on the basis of British and Belgian practice and upon French practice during the monarchy from 1814 to 1848 , that the ministry is responsible only to the Chamber of Deputies . Moreover , since the Senate can not be dissolved while the Chamber of Deputies may be , it would , it is pointed out , place the Senate in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow a ministry . ' On the other hand , the constitution declares in plain language that the ministry shall be responsible to the chambers , and not merely to one of them ; the Senate has equal powers of legislation with the Chambe of Deputies ; unlike the upper chambers in Great Britain and the old French monarchy the French Senate is elected and it may interpellate the ministers and vote orders of confidence or censure equally with the Chamber of Deputies . ' In practice ministries have on several occasions resigned in consequence of the hostile attitude or votes of the Senate , ' and it now seems definitely established that the senate may compel a ministry to resign . ' The responsi-Footnote  | bility of the ministry to both chambers and the necessity which the president is under of obtaining the consent of the Senate to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies undoubtedly increase the difficulties of cabinet government in France . In this connection it may be remarked that the practice of dissolution in France has fallen into desuetude . Exercised in 1877 by President MacMahon against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and exercised therefore in violation of the spirit if not the letter of the constitution ) , the French have come to regard it with a certain fear and as being inconsistent with the spirit of the republican regime . This represents a curious departure from the system of cabinet government in Great Britain , where dissolutions of the House of Commons and appeals to the electorate are not uncommon and where such a procedure is regarded as one of the most fundamental and essential features of responsible government . ' Cabinet Government in Italy . ? In Italy the conditions under which cabinet government is conducted are similar in many respects to those prevailing in France . As in France , the chambers are usually divided into a number of political groups or factions , each of which must be given representation in the cabinet , and each must be placated whenever it shows signs of disaffection . Cabinets formed after long and laborious negotiations , says Dupriez , sometimes go to pieces over the first question which provokes debate.2 The role of the chamber in determining the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England or France . The king enjoys a much larger freedom and discretion in choosing his ministers , and the constitution says he may dismiss them . It also declares that they are responsible , but unlike the French constitution it does not say that they are responsible to the chambers or to one of them , and they have , we are told , " obsequiously surrendered their powers of control , so that the responsibility Footnote  | is now due mainly to the king . " 1 The ministers are generally taken from the Chamber of Deputies , the premier practically always , ' but they have the entree to both houses and must be heard when they request it . The ministers of war and marine are usually army and navy officers respectively , and if not already senators , they are made such by royal appointment at the time they are chosen to the cabinet . Ministers without portfolio are sometimes appointed , and since 1888 each minister has had under his control an undersecretary , who may represent the minister in the chamber and defend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of the dictatorship of Mussolini , the responsibility of the ministers to parliament virtually ceased to exist . For a time after the World War a succession of weak , timid , and short-lived cabinets followed which were powerless to deal with the extraordinary situation then existing in Italy , in consequence of which the cabinet system virtually broke down . By a law passed in 1923 , it was provided that the political party which polled the largest vote for the Chamber of Deputies should have two thirds of the membership . This enables the Fascisti party to control the chamber even though it does not elect an actual majority of the membership . Still later a law was passed making the nisters responsible to the king rather than to the chamber , thus establishing fully Mussolini 's independence of parliament . Thy chamber has in fact been reduced to the role of a mere consultative body . Cabinet Government in Germany . ? In Germany , the cabinet system was unknown before the close of the World War , although it found a place in the constitution proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Social Footnote  | Democratic party after the founding of the Empire in 1871 . The imperial chancellor , the chief minister , and the other ministers who were associated with him not as his colleagues but as his subordinates and who were administrative functionaries taken from the ranks of the bureaucracy rather than from parliament , were responsible only to the emperor and could not be forced to resign by a hostile vote of the Reichstag . On several notable occasions the Reichstag by a large majority condemned the policy of the government and the Social Democrats demanded the resignation of the chancellor , but he usually replied that such a vote merely represented a difference of opinion between him and the Reichstag and could not be interpreted as a binding command to resign , that his responsibility was to the emperor alone and that he had no intention of resigning so long as he had the confidence of his Majesty . ' In consequence , the Reichstag was not able to exercise any effective control over the government aside from its control over appropriations , and under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited.2 It must be said , however , that apart from the Social Democrats the number of Germans who demanded a system of parliamentary responsibility was not large . Many German political writers and statesmen condemned the parliamentary system on the ground that it was a form of government by " fleeting majorities , " that it was not in accordance with German notions of strong Footnote  | personal government , and because they did not desire to be put in the position of seeming to imitate the English and French . ' With the accession of the Social Democrats to power at the close of the World War , however , the establishment of parliamentary responsible government was assured . ' Accordingly the new constitution ( 1919 ) provided not only that this system should be established for the Reich , but that each of the individual member states ( Lander ) should likewise be governed by a cabinet which must have the confidence of the representatives of the people ( Art . 17 ) . In short , having proscribed the system of personal government in the Reich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the states composing the Reich . The constitution expressly requires that the chancellor and the other ministers must possess the confidence of the Reichstag and must resign whenever that confidence is withdrawn by formal resolution . It requires all official acts of the president of the republic ( who is declared to be politically irresponsible to parliament ) to be countersigned either by the chancellor or some other minister who thereby assumes the Footnote  | responsibility to the Reichstag for his acts . The president is given the power to dissolve the Reichstag , but he is obliged to obtain the countersignature of a minister in order to do so , a requirement which may on occasion prove to be impossible . The German system is peculiar in that it distinguishes sharply between the role of the chancellor and that of the other ministers . The president appoints the chancellor and upon the proposal of the latter , he appoints and dismisses the other ministers . The chancellor is empowered to determine the general policy of the government , he countersigns the official acts of the president relating to matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies . The other ministers are declared to be responsible to the Reichstag for the policies of their particular departments and they countersign the acts of the president which relate to the policies of their respective departments . Thus a distinction is attempted to be made between what the French call " governing " and " administering " ; the chancellor is responsible for policies which fall within the former class ; the other ministers for policies of the latter character . The result is that the principle of collective responsibility does not exist even in respect to questions of general policy . ' This feature gives the German cabinet system a unique character and its practical working will be watched with much interest by students of political science . On account of the multiple-party system which exists in Germany , the task of constituting cabinets has not always been easy . In practice they are necessarily of the coalition type , the principal republican parties usually being represented by a number of members roughly in proportion to their strength in the Reichstag ? Footnote  | It is as yet too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system which has so recently been introduced . The Cabinet System in Other European States . ? The constitution of the new republic of Austria ( 1920 ) establishes a somewhat similar system of cabinet government . All official acts of the president of the republic are required to be countersigned by the chancellor or some other minister . The president is declared to be irresponsible to the legislature except for violation of the law , but the ministry as a whole or its individual members are declared to be responsible to the lower chamber and they are automatically removed from office by the adoption of a resolution of the chamber withdrawing its confidence . ' A feature which distinguishes the cabinet system of Austria from that of all other countries is found in the constitutional provision that the ministry shall be elected by the lower chamber instead of being appointed by the head of the state , 2 and that the ministers , although required to be eligible to seats in the lower chamber , are not required to be members . In Austria as in other parliamentary-governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cabinets shall be constituted on the coalition principle . The cabinet system of Poland is modeled to some extent on tha of France . Thus the lower chamber can be dissolved only with the consent of the senate , but with this difference , that the consent of three fifths of the senators is necessary instead of a majority of the senate as in France . In Yugoslavia the ministers are responsible to both the king and the parliament . The latter may be dissolved by the king only if the decree of dissolution is signed by all the ministers . In Czechoslovakia the president can dissolve parliament ( both houses ) only during the last six months of his term . The cabinet , however , is responsible only to the chamber of deputies . In Rumania the king has a larger Footnote  | control over the ministers than the head of the state usually has in parliamentary-governed countries . Recently he compelled the cabinet to resign and took a new ministry from the minority party . IV . PRESIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT Features of Presidential Government . What has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or parliamentary government , is that system in which the executive ( including both the head of the state and his ministers ) is constitutionally independent of the legislature in respect to the duration of his or their tenure and irresponsible to it for his or their political policies . In such a system the chief of state is not merely the titular executive but he is the real executive and actually exercises the powers which the constitution and laws confer upon him . He may and generally does act through the agency of ministers or " secretaries " ( as they are called in the United States ) , but they do not thereby assume the responsibility to the legislature for his acts . In legal theory , their acts are his acts ; they are chosen by him usually from the members of his own party , ' but they are not taken from the legislature and in fact they may belong to a political party which does not have a majority in either chamber of the legislature . Indeed they can not in the United States be members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the holding of ministerial office at the same time are constitutionally incompatible functions . They do not , therefore , unlike cabinets in countries where the parliamentary system prevails , prepare , introduce , and advocate , in the legislative chambers , the measures which they desire to have enacted into law , except in so far as they may do Footnote  | so through the agency of particular members of the legislature who may be in sympathy with such measures . They might be allowed the entree to the legislature with the right to be heard and to be interpellated , but in practice they are usually not ? never , in the United States . They are solely the ministers and servants of the chief executive who appoints them , and not of the legislature ; they are politically responsible only to him and he may dismiss them for any reason which may seem to him to be sufficient without regard to whether they have the confidence of the legislature or not . He and they are generally responsible to the legislature or one chamber of it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , but they are not responsible to the legislature for their political policies or acts . Votes of censure , condemnation , or want of confidence by the legislature have therefore no legal effect and they never think of resigning in consequence of such votes or of the refusal of the legislature to enact the measures or vote the appropriations which they advocate . The ministers are , as stated above , politically responsible only to the chief executive who appoints them , and he ( in case he is popularly elected ) is responsible only to the electorate . Since , under the presidential system , the chief executive and his cabinet may , and in the United States not infrequently do , belong to a political party which is in the minority in one or both chambers of the legislature , their responsibility to the legislature under suc circumstances would manifestly lead to the breakdown of th presidential system . The Presidential System in the United States . ? The presidential system finds its most conspicuous example in the United States , both in the national government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Latin-American states which have followed the North American model . In a modified form it existed in the former German Empire ( 1871-1919 ) , where , as stated above , the ministers were not taken from parliament but were the servants of the Emperor , where neither he nor they  | were responsible to parliament for their political acts or policies , and where the tenure of the latter was dependent entirely upon the pleasure of the emperor and not at all upon the will of parliament . In the United States , the term of the President is fixed by the constitution at four years , he is elected by the people , and his powers are prescribed by the constitution ; consequently he is independent of Congress in respect to his election , his powers , and the duration of his tenure . He may recommend for the consideration of Congress the enactment of particular laws which he favors or the appropriation of money for specified purposes ; he may veto bills passed by Congress , to which he objects , but neither he nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress to advocate their adoption , nor may he dissolve either house of Congress and order a new election . He is absolutely free in choosing the members of his cabinet and is not obliged to select men who have the confidence of the majority party which controls either one or both houses of Congress . Nor is he limited , as is the chief executive in parliamentary-governed countries , to choosing a principal minister who selects his colleagues . He chooses them all ; they are his subordinates , not his colleagues ; consequently his relation to them is very different from the relation of the prime minister in England , for example , to his associates . They are solely responsible to the President for their political acts and not to Congress , and they may be dismissed by the President for any reason which may seem to be sufficient or for no reason at all . ' The system of the United States therefore on its executive side is in large measure constitutionally autocratic and uncontrollable by Congress.2 Footnote  | The Presidential System in Latin America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following the pattern of the United States , has been introduced . In Argentina the constitution , however , requires that the acts of the president shall be countersigned by the ministers , who shall be individually responsible for the acts which they sign and jointly responsible for all acts agreed upon by each minister and his colleagues ( Arts . 87-88 ) . It also provides that the ministers may attend the sessions of congress and take part in the debates but shall have no vote ( Art . 92 ) . It will be noted that while the constitution proclaims the responsibility of the ministers , it does not indicate to whom they shall be responsible , whether to the congress or the president . The ministers are frequently interpellated in congress and in the session of January 29 , 1894 , an opposition member asserted that it belonged to congress at all times to require the ministers to attend and give explanations regarding their policies . Presidents and cabinets have sometimes resigned because of disagreements with the chamber of deputies , but opinion and general practice are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive of parliamentary majorities , as in the United States . ' The constitution of Brazil ( July 24 , 1891 ) is more exact and emphatic in respect to the relation between the president , his ministers , and the congress . It declares that the ministers may not appear in either chamber , that they may communicate with it only in writing or by conference with its committees , and that the shall not be responsible ( except for crimes defined by law ) eit r to the congress or the courts for the advice which they give the president.2 It further fixes the term of the president at four years and declares that he can be removed only by the process of Footnote  | impeachment . ' Only in one respect does the Brazilian system differ from that of the United States : the constitution requires that the acts of the president shall be countersigned by the ministers . ' But as in the United States this was not intended to imply the political responsibility of the ministers to either or both chambers of congress . Their political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' V. THE SWISS SYSTEM Characteristics of the Swiss System . ? A system of government which falls in a class by itself , which differs fundamentally from the presidential and cabinet types , but which combines certain features of both , is that of Switzerland . It is a system in which the government is carried on by an executive council or board ( seven members ) chosen by the legislature for the same term as its own and usually from its own membership . It bears some resemblance to the cabinet system in that this council is , in a sense , a committee of the legislature chosen by it to exercise the executive functions of the government , that each member is head of an administrative department , that the members may occupy seats in both chambers of the legislature , that they may make motions , be heard ( but may not vote ) and be interpellated regarding their official acts and policies , and that they are largely subject to the control of the legislature ( or rather the lower chamber ) and will ordinarily yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The council resembles a cabinet also in that it formulates and prepares drafts of all important legislative measures , including the budget , introduces them into the legislature , and advocates their enactment into law . Like the cabinet in England , in practice it plays the role of leader and guide , much more so than French ministries do.4 It differs from the cabinet in parlia- Footnote  | mentary-governed countries , however , in that it does not necessarily represent the majority political party or a bloc of parties in either chamber , that consequently it is not necessarily a homogeneous body , politically speaking , that the members of the council are not at the time of their election committed to any political program , that interpellations are not followed by votes of approbation or censure , and , most important of all , that the members of the council are not responsible to the legislature in the sense that they are bound to resign when they lose its confidence or when the measures or policies which they advocate are altered or rejected . Moreover , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , the power to dissolve the legislature , or one chamber of it , and appeal to the electorate when they believe that they rather than the legislature represent the popular will . ' VI . THE SOVIET SYSTEM OF RUSSIA Principal Features .  --  A recently established form of government which is distinctly sui genesis , not only from the point of view of the system of representation upon which it is based but also in respect to the relation between the executive and legislative powers , is that of the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic . Both the supreme legislative power and the constituent power are vested in the All-Russian Congress , representing the various soviets . When it is not in session , its powers are exercised by central executive committee of more than 300 members cho en by the congress . Owing to the large and unwieldy size of t e congress , the committee virtually exercises the legislative power of the congress and in practice it remains in session the year round even when the congress is sitting . It has thus Footnote  | become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to the supervision and ultimate control of the congress . The executive power , properly speaking , is entrusted to a council of people 's commissars , each of whom is the head of an administrative department or commissariat . They are chosen by the executive committee and are responsible individually and collectively to it for their acts and policies . The council is therefore analogous to a ministry in parliamentary-governed countries . On the whole , the Russian system is more closely akin to the cabinet or parliamentary system than to the presidential system , although it differs from them both in so many particulars that , like the Swiss system , it properly belongs in a class by itself . Aside from the fact that it is not , and does not pretend to be , a democracy and that it rests mainly upon a system of vocational rather than geographical representation , its most distinctive feature lies in the nonexistence of the principle of the separation of powers . VII . UNITARY AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS Unitary Government . ? Considered from the point of view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central and local authorities , governments may be classified as unitary ( or centralized ) and federal . Where the whole power of government is conferred by the constitution upon a single central organ or organs , from which the local governments derive whatever authority or autonomy they may possess , and indeed their very existence , we have a system of unitary government . It is characteristic of this form of government that there is no constitutional division or distribution of power between the central government of the state and the subordinate local governments . There is , in short , but one common source of authority and but one will exerted . For convenience of administration all unitary states are in fact subdivided into circumscriptions or districts ( provinces , departments , counties , communes , etc. ) , each of which has a certain sphere of autonomy and  | restricted powers of local government , but generally those local areas are created and altered at will not by the constitution but by the central government , and whatever autonomy or power of local government they may possess is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged or contracted at its will . They are , in short , merely parts of the central organization created by the latter to act as its agents for the purpose of local administration ; they are subject to its control and whatever autonomy or governmental competence may have been conceded to them exists by sufferance rather than by constitutional guarantee . The governments of Great Britain and most of the countries of continental Europe and of Asia belong to this class . In Great Britain the counties and cities in fact possess a considerable sphere of local autonomy and of self-government , but it is derived from ordinary acts of parliament ; it may be enlarged or restricted at the will of parliament , and many of the activities of the local government are subject to the control of the central authorities . ' On the Continent , the government of France is the outstanding example of a unitary government . The country is divided into territorial circumscriptions called " departments " and these are subdivided into cantons , arrondissements , and communes , each having its own organs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they possess is very restricted ; it is derived not from the constitution but from acts of parliament ; the local organizations are in large measure mere agents of the centra government , and the exercise of the powers of government left to them is subject to wide control by the central government even en those powers relate to matters of local administration . ' In the other countries of continental Europe ( except those in Footnote  | which the federal system has been established : Germany , Austria , and Switzerland ) the situation in this respect differs only in degree from that of France . Federal Government Explained . ? Federal government , as contradistinguished from unitary government , is a system in which the totality of governmental power is divided and distributed by the national constitution or the organic act of parliament creating it , between a central government and the governments of the individual states or other territorial subdivisions of which the federation is composed . These latter governments are not the creations of the central government of the union ; in most federal systems the reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been created by the constituent members through the act of federation ; they are something more than parts or agents of the central organization ; their sphere of autonomy is determined not by the central government but by the general constitution of the federation or , as in the British dominions , by an act of the imperial parliament which serves the purpose of a constitution . Consequently , they do not exist by the sufferance of the central government nor may their competence be restricted by it . Federal government may , therefore , be defined as a system of central and local government combined under a common sovereignty , both the central and local organizations being supreme within definite spheres , marked out for them by the general constitution or by the act of parliament which creates the system . It is dual government as contradistinguished from unitary government , and implies local self-government as opposed to centralized government . It represents a sort of compromise between unitary government and confederate government . The territorial areas of these local organizations are not therefore mere administrative districts , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , having their own constitutions and political systems . The central and local governments are not , however , totally separate and disconnected  | from each other in organization . Federal government is not , as is often loosely said , the central government alone , but it is a system composed of the central and local governments combined . The local governments are as much a part of the federal system as the central government is , although they are not the creations of or subject to the control of the central government . Distribution of Powers in the Federal System . ? The principle upon which the powers of government are distributed between the central and local governments in a federal system is that those affairs which are of common interest to the federation as a whole and which require uniformity of regulation should be placed under the control of the central government , while all matters not of common concern should be left to the care of the local governments . ' In short , there should be one government for national affairs and a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former , therefore , federal government resembles unitary government , while in respect to the latter it is more like confederate government . Opinions differ , however , as to what affairs require uniformity of regulation and what should be left to local regulation , and hence the line of demarcation between general and local matters is in practice drawn differently in different federal systems . In most states having the federal form of government , however , such affairs as foreign relations and international intercourse , war and peace , interstate and foreign commerce , coinage of money , patents and copyrights , have been placed under the control of the central government . In international relations the component members of the federal union ) are largely non-entities , but they have shown themselves able ii certain instances to interpose obstacles in the way of the succes ul prosecution of a common foreign policy by the central government . ' In the more recently established federal systems Footnote  |  of Europe the notion of what requires uniformity of regulation and what will permit of diversity of control is somewhat different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently the principle of distribution has been different . In these states many affairs are treated as being of general interest and hence requiring uniformity of regulation , which in the United States are left to local regulation . Thus , in Germany the whole body of civil , criminal , and commercial law and the law of procedure , as well as the law of marriage and divorce , is national , not local ; that is , instead of widely varying legal systems in these domains , there is a single uniform code for all the component parts of the federation . ' The evils that have arisen in the United States in consequence of the extraordinary variety of legislation , especially in respect to certain matters that are really national in scope rather than local , have recently aroused discussion in many quarters in favor of increasing the powers of the national government along various lines . Footnote  | Method of Distribution . ? Two methods have been followed in distributing the powers of government between the central and local organizations , where the federal system prevails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central government are specifically enumerated by the constitution or organic act of the federation . To the local governments are reserved all the remaining powers except such as may be specifically prohibited to them . The central government is thus an authority of delegated powers , while the local governments are authorities of residuary powers . In other words , the competence of the central government is positively determined by the constitution , while that of the local governments is negatively determined . The presumption of law in case of doubt , therefore , is against the existence of any power claimed by the central government and in favor of any power claimed by the local governments . In the federal system of Canada , however , a different principle of distribution prevails . There the local governments are authorities of enumerated powers , while the central government is one of both delegated and reserved powers . ' Whatever may be the method or principle of distribution , or the nature and extent of power delegated or reserved to either government , neither may enlarge its competence or redistribute the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been distributed by the Footnote  | constitution or organic act of the union . Only the sovereign itself can do that . Federal Control and Coercion . ? In some federal systems , however , the central government is given a limited control over the organization and acts of the local governments . Thus , in the United States it is made the duty of the national government to see that only republican governments shall be maintained by the individual states , from which it may be inferred that the national government may prohibit such local organizations as do not in its judgment conform to this requirement . Similarly the new German constitution ( Art . 17 ) requires that every state ( Land ) shall have a republican form of government , that is , one in which the representatives are elected by universal , equal , direct , and secret suffrage of both men and women , according to the principles of proportional representation , and also that it shall have the cabinet system . The same provision is found in the new constitution of Austria ( Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the power to disallow the acts of the provincial legislatures ; likewise in the federal republic of Venezuela the national government may veto the acts of the local legislatures . In Germany the central government may by the process of federal execution compel , by armed force if necessary , a delinquent or recalcitrant member of the Reich to perform the duties imposed upon it by the constitution ( Art . 48 ) .1 This right of federal coercion against the states for the non-performance of their constitutional obligations distinguishes the German federal system from that of the United States . In the latter country it is generally admitted that the national government has no such power and in practice it has never been attempted . This does not mean , however , that the national government can not employ force to protect the public property of the United States , Footnote  | to execute the provisions of the federal constitution , laws , and treaties , and to enforce the processes and decrees of the federal courts . The Supreme Court has said that the United States has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enforcement of its authority on every foot of the national territory . In case the authorities of a particular state interfere with or attempt to prevent such action , the force employed will necessarily be directed against them , but this is not the same thing as federal coercion or federal execution in the sense in which it is authorized by the German constitution . It was in pursuance of this right that President Lincoln justified his course in sending the armed forces into the southern states in 1861 . Local Execution of Federal Laws . ? In one other respect the federal system of the United States , Brazil , and most other countries which have it , differs from that of Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . In the first-mentioned group of countries the national government possesses its own officials and governmental machinery for enforcing its laws , collecting its revenues , and performing the other services with which it is charged . The constitution of Brazil ( Art . 7 , sec. 3 ) , expressly declares that the laws of the Union and the acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the country by federal officials . Nevertheless , it provides that the execution of federal laws may be intrusted to the governments of the states , with their consent . This devolution of authority may also occur in the United States , provided the state authorities so consent , but in practice it is rarely done . ' In Germany , Austria , and Switzerland , o the contrary , it is the practice to rely , in large measure , upon t e governments of the states ( Lander ) or cantons to carry into ex cution the laws enacted by the national legislature . In Footnote  | Germany the constitution ( Art . 14 ) declares that the laws of the Reich shall be executed by the state authorities , unless otherwise provided by law . Except for such matters as are committed exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Reich ( foreign affairs , national defense , coinage , customs , postal administration , and a few other matters ) , the Reich does not depend upon its own officials and agents but relies upon those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I I ) likewise provides that while federal legislation in respect to certain specified matters shall be executed by the federal authorities , the execution of federal laws relating to various other matters shall be intrusted to the state authorities . In Switzerland likewise a considerable part of the legislation enacted by the federal parliament is left to the cantonal governments to be executed , and certain federal taxes ( e.g. , the military exemption tax ) are collected by the cantonal authorities . ' Each system has its advantages and disadvantages . Reliance upon the state or local authorities avoids the duplication of administrative machinery , but it possesses the disadvantage which results from throwing upon the local governments responsibility for the execution of national laws and the defense of national policies to which they , supported as they often are by local public sentiment , may be opposed or as to the enforcement of which they may be indifferent . In order to insure that such legislation will be properly executed Ly the local governments , the federal systems of Germany , Austria , and Switzerland provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for federal coercion of the local governments , when they are charged with the execution of federal legislation . Thus , in Germany , the federal ministry is empowered to issue instructions to the state authorities as to how the federal laws shall be carried out and it may dispatch commissioners to the state governments to supervise the execution of those laws ( Art . 15 ) . The constitution of Austria ( Art . 15 ) likewise provides for federal supervision of the execution of national laws . Similarly , in Switzerland , the Footnote  | government of the confederation exercises supervision over the cantonal administration of various federal laws . ' Federal Intervention in Local Affairs . ? In most countries where the federal system is found the national government has a certain right of intervention in local affairs , especially for the preservation of internal order . In the United States the national government may intervene , by the use of armed force , if necessary , to suppress domestic violence in any state , provided application has been made for such aid by the legislature , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not in session . If the disturbance interferes with the operations of the national government , the processes of the federal courts , or with the movement of interstate commerce the President is not bound to wait for an application from the governor or the state legislature but may upon his own initiative send federal troops to the scene of the disturbance and prevent such interference , as President Cleveland did in the case of the Chicago strike in 1894.2 In Brazil the federal government is empowered to intervene in the affairs of the states to repel invasion , to maintain the republican form of government therein , to reestablish order and tranquillity ( upon request of the state governments ) , and to insure the execution of federal laws and the judgments of the federal courts . ' The constitution of the United States goes further and makes it the duty of the United States to intervene to protect the states against invasion , and to maintain the republican form of government . The constitution of the Swiss confederation ( Art . 3 ) makes it the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " sovereignty " of the cantons , in so far as they are recognized to be sovereign . Its right to intervene in the case of internal disturbances is affirmed by the constitution , and it is not necessary to wait for an appeal from the cantonal authorities ( Arts . 14-16 ) . There have been eleven cases of federal intervention in the cantons since 1848 , five of them being in the canton of Ticino . ' In Germany the constitution ( Art . 48 ) provides that if the public safety and order are materially disturbed or endangered the president of the republic may " take the necessary measures " to restore it , and if necessary he may intervene by force of arms . To this end he may temporarily suspend , wholly or in part , the liberties of the people as guaranteed by various articles of the constitution and proclaim the existence of martial law . VIII . OTHER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT Confederate Government . ? Confederate government may be defined as a system in which each member state of a confederation retains its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses , there being a common central organization only , or mainly , for their mutual support and defense . ' Whereas federal government is a dual system under a common sovereignty , in a confederacy ( the term " confederation " is sometimes preferred ) there are as many sovereignties as there are states forming the confederation . There is no such division of power between the confederation and the component member states as exists in a federal union . There may be a central government , but if so it is usually created by treaty or articles of agreement among the confederated states rather than by a constitution and it is merely the agent of the member states for the performance of a few services in their name . It usually lacks executive and judicial machinery and in the place of a lawmaking organ it has a congress or diet composed Footnote  | of delegates whose functions more nearly resemble those of diplomatic plenipotentiaries than legislators with lawmaking mandates . This congress may pass resolutions but ordinarily it has no real power of binding legislation . Such resolutions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather to the confederated states themselves , and reach the individuals for whom they are intended only mediately and indirectly , through the medium of the state organizations . A confederacy in reality has no citizens or subjects who owe it direct and immediate allegiance . Its competence generally includes only such matters as relate to foreign relations , defensive war , and possibly a few matters of an interstate character . Usually it possesses no power over the sources of its own revenue , but is dependent upon the voluntary contributions of the confederated states . Finally , it lacks stability and permanence , and its existence is precarious , since it belongs to the component members to withdraw from the confederation at will or refuse to be bound by its acts and resolutions . It is a transitory form of political organization which usually develops into the federal system or dissolves into its constituent elements . Bureaucratic Government . ? Some governments viewed from the standpoint of their spirit , their methods , and the professional character of their administrative personnel , have been described as " bureaucracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is carried on largely by ministerial bureaus and in which important policies are determined and decisions rendered by the administrative chiefs of such bureaus . In a wider sense , it means any government the administrative functionaries of which are professionally trained for the public service , and who generally enjoy permanency of tenure , promotion within the service being partly by seniority and partly by merit . In such a system the government service is a profession and offers a career to those who enter it . Usually there are developed among such a body of functionaries an esprit de corps and a spirit of discipline somewhat similar to those found in a regular army .  | Naturally also they tend to develop a spirit of caste and to become a class separate and apart from the non-official part of the population . Government as carried on by such a class is apt to be characterized by an excessive formalism and tends to overemphasize administrative routine rather than fundamental principles ? in short , it tends , as Burke remarked , to think more of form than of substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has seen in modern times , perhaps , was that which existed in Prussia from 1720 to 18o8 . A bureaucracy of a less absolute character was that which existed in France under Napoleon for a time after 18o8 . In varying degrees of development this form of government exists to-day in most of the states of Europe , especially in Germany and Austria , and to a less degree in England and France . Commonly thought of only in connection with monarchical states , its forms and methods , and to some extent its spirit , are nevertheless found in the governmental systems of many republican states as well . ' In France to-day one hears much complaint of what are in reality the methods of a bureaucracy . There the government of the country is , as stated above , extremely centralized , mainly in Paris , but also in the capitals of the departments . Inevitably there is an enormous congestion of administrative work in both the ministries and the prefectures . Thousands of questions pour in from all points of the Republic for decision or solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled by the local authorities who alone are really interested or affected . In the departments the communal budgets must be approved by the prefect . In some of the larger ones as many as 500 such budgets may be laid before him for his approval . Under such circumstances the decision in these and many other matters Footnote  | which require his approval , must in fact rest with administrative subordinates in the prefecture . The decision by the subordinate at the bottom of the hierarchy must be examined and passed upon by a succession of superiors up to the minister or the prefect . Naturally the machinery moves at a speed the slowness of which tries the patience of everybody concerned , and not infrequently years pass before the most trifling matters are finally disposed of . Reports , counter-reports , memoirs , recommendations , decisions follow one another in bewildering profusion until the papers and documents relating to a particular matter attain the height of a small mountain . ' Nevertheless , bureaucratic government in the wider sense referred to is not without its merits . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in which they are engaged . They possess the skill and capacity which are acquired from permanency of tenure and experience . It is consequently likely to be more efficient than the service of functionaries without training , who are appointed without regard to their ability to Footnote  | perform the work with which they are charged , and who soon retire and make room for others who are equally untrained . " It accumulates experience , " says Mill , " acquires well-tried and well-considered traditional maxims , and makes provision for appropriate practical knowledge in those who have the actual conduct of affairs . " 1 Popular Government . ? Contradistinguished from bureaucratic government is what is sometimes vaguely called popular government , that is , government by persons who are drawn at regular intervals from the ranks of the people , many of them by popular election , and who after a brief tenure return to private life . Generally they are without special training ; not infrequently they serve without pecuniary compensation ; and often they are during the term of their public service engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices are open to all without preliminary preparation or examination , few or no professional qualifications are required , and the official class never develops a caste system or loses touch with the people . It is more or less influenced by public opinion , and in the discharge of its duties is more often subject to legislative than administrative control . Individualistic and Paternalistic Government . ? Finally , from the point of view of their functions and sphere of activity , governments may be denominated as individualistic and paternal . A government of the former type is one whose activities are limited mainly to the simple police functions of maintaining the peace , order , and security of society , internal and external , and the protection of private rights . A paternal government is one whose functions are not limited merely to restraining wrongdoing and Footnote  | to protecting private rights , but which goes farther and undertakes to promote by various means the social well-being of the people . It undertakes to perform for society many services which might be performed as easily through private initiative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically done by the government than by private individuals . Such a government may own and operate various industries , engage in business enterprises , provide pensions for the old , the sick , and the infirm , and in other various ways care for the social interests of the people . IX . SUCCESSION OF GOVERNMENTAL FORMS Theories of Early Writers . ? No state has retained the same form of government throughout its whole history . Governments are constantly changing their forms so as to adapt themselves to the altered conditions of a new environment . Thus , Athens was first ruled by kings , then by an aristocracy , later by tyrants , then by a democracy , and finally again by kings . So Rome went through a cycle of political transformations . It began as a city kingdom , then it became a republic , and finally an empire ruled by Casar . The government of France within less than a century passed through the forms of an absolute monarchy , a republic , an empire , a kingdom , again a republic , again an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There existed in early times a popular belief that there was a natural order of political development through which all states must or would normally pass in the course of their history . Plato , for example , taught that the natural course of evolution was from aristocracy , the rule of the best , to timocracy , the rule of the military , then to oligarchy , then to the rule of the mob , and finally to tyranny . ' Aristotle , while differing from Plato as to the order of development , nevertheless believed that forms of government followed one another according to a regular order of succession . According to his rule the state ordinarily began as Footnote  | a hereditary monarchy , which in time passed into an aristocracy . The latter in the course of time became an oligarchy , the oligarchy became a tyranny , and the latter ultimately evolved into a democracy . Ordinarily after an unsatisfactory experience with democracy a monarchy would be reestablished , and the cycle thus begun again would be passed through as before . ' Polybius taught that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled , that is , the state began originally as a monarchy . Then followed a period when justice rather than physical power became the basis of the right to rule , during which time a form of government called by Polybius " royalty " ( Basileia ) prevailed . This form in time degenerated into tyranny , only to be overthrown eventually , and an aristocracy set up in its place . This in the course of time was succeeded by oligarchy , which in turn was overthrown by the people and a democracy was established . ' Machiavelli laid down almost the same rule regarding the order of natural succession in respect to the political forms of ancient states . The noted German scholar Schleiermacher maintained that political transformations are determined largely by the spread of political self-consciousness . At first , he said , political consciousness was not highly developed in any minds , though diffused equally among the masses . The democratic form of government naturally corresponded to this condition and was therefore the first state form . In the course of time a higher political consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the establishment of aristocracy . Finally the state consciousness concentrated itself in a single individual , and monarchy , the highest form of state , succeeded . ' There is a residuum of truth in the principle of Schleiermacher 's law , but the weight of opinion is against the order in which he conceived political consciousness to have spread . It is more reasonable to believe that Footnote  | it existed at first in but one or at best only a very few minds , and that it grew and spread slowly and became diffused throughout the mass of the population rather late in the life of the state . It seems more probable , therefore , that the order of succession was the reverse of that which Schleiermacher laid down ; that is , the state began with a monarchical form of organization , which in time became aristocratic , and finally , when political consciousness became general , the organization of the state became democratic . History , indeed , shows that this has generally been the order of development . ' Bluntschli , a critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded each other in the following order : first , theocracy ; second , monarchy ; third , aristocracy ; and fourth , democracy . Each of these forms not infrequently passed through several transformations . For example , monarchy began in its pure form , then it became aristocratic ( standisch ) in character , and finally , democratic . Republics likewise passed through monarchical , aristocratic , and democratic stages . ' Regarding the merits of the rule laid down by the early writers in respect to the succession of state forms , there can be but one conclusion , namely , that such changes do not follow each other in accordance with any law such as reigns in the physical world . History furnishes abundant evidence of this truth . For example , the early monarchies did not always pass into tyrannies , but often the latter resulted from strife among the leaders of an aristocracy . Not infrequently monarchies have been transformed into democracies , aristocracies into monarchies , and democracies into aristocracies . Bodin , in his treatise on the republic , gives numerous Footnote  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more often been succeeded by democracies than by aristocracies . During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in many states of Europe monarchical governments of an absolute type were erected upon the ruins of feudal aristocracies . A study of the subject , indeed , will show that the exceptions are more numerous than the rule . There are , of course , certain laws of political evolution , but no such sequence of succession as was described by the early writers . Not all states have passed through the same stages or undergone the same transformations . The changes that have occurred in some have been the result of internal revolution , in others the result of conscious adoption or imitation . Woolsey justly remarks that if there were such a law of succession as described by Polybius , it would afford a most hopeless prospect to the world.l It would , in short , mean the reign of fatalism and of death in the domain of politics . Footnote  | ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IN DIFFERENT FORMS AND TYPES OF GOVERNMENT Footnote T. MONARCHY Monarchy : Where Found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various forms and types of government , we come now to consider in the light of history and of 365  | experience the elements of strength and weakness of each . Of all the known types , the monarchial form is the oldest ; in the Middle Ages it was universal or very nearly so , and in one form or another it still survives in various countries of Europe , Asia , and Africa . ' The type of absolute monarchy has at last disappeared from Europe in the face of the irresistible march of democracy , but until recently it existed in varying degrees in several of the most important states of the continent . The late Professor Sidgwick declared that in the middle of the eighteenth century absolute monarchy was regarded as " the final form of government to which the long process of formation of orderly country-states had led up and by which the task of establishing and maintaining a civilized political order had been , on the whole , successfully accomplished , after other modes of political construction had failed to realize it . " 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a study devoted to the growth of the republican idea in Europe , published in 1911 , declared that the cause of republicanism had made no substantial progress in Europe since 187o . France , he pointed out , was then the only great European state which had adopted the republican form , and he added that her experience had not been such as to invite imitation . ' Republics , to be sure , Footnote  | had been set up in various countries of Europe , notably in the year 1848 , but they were all short-lived , the monarchies which they displaced having been quickly restored . On the whole , he thought the outlook for republicanism was not promising and he pointed out that in various countries such as Germany and Italy even the Social Democrats , the most advanced of political parties , were not anti-monarchical ? at least not militantly so ? but were content with demanding a more liberal suffrage and other democratic reforms which they regarded as more fundamental than the abolition of monarchy . Progress of Republicanism . ? Mr. Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , the position of the monarchies which had seemed so precarious in 1848 had been considerably strengthened by the general elevation in the intelligence , character , and ability of the monarchs who reigned in Europe at the time he wrote , as compared with that of the monarchs who afflicted Europe in the earlier part of the century . ' Sovereigns like Queen Victoria and Edward VII in England , Leopold II in Belgium , Christian IX in Denmark , Oscar II in Sweden , William I and William II in Germany , Francis Joseph in Austria-Hungary , and Victor Emmanuel II in Italy , commanded a popular respect and esteem in their respective countries which hardly existed before 1848 , when the general level of esteem of monarchs was uniformly low . The achievements of the monarchy in Germany and Italy in bringing about the national unification of those countries , and the extraordinary material progress which had taken place under monarchial rule in those and other European states , had also been a contributing factor to the general feeling of contentment with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1905 the people of Norway , a simple democratic people composed mostly of peasants , fishermen , shop-keepers , and sailors , deliberately chose the monarchial form in preference to a republic . There was a republican party in the country led by the novelist Bjornson , but they were divided in regard to the particular form which they wished , whether the American or the French . The argument that a monarchy would be more acceptable than a republic to both Germany and England , and the belief that the security and prestige of the country would be strengthened by the dynastic alliances which would result from the establishment of a monarchy , prevailed , and the republic was accordingly brushed aside . In 1911 the monarchy in Portugal was overthrown and a republic was established in its place , but republicanism made no further headway in Europe until after the World War , when Germany and Austria became republics and when most of the new states which came into existence ? and later also Greece ? adopted the republican form . The Russians abolished the monarchy but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a republic as the republican form is traditionally understood , and it is avowedly not a democracy . It may be noted , however , that Yugoslavia elected the monarchial form and Hungary , whose form has not yet been definitely determined , remains a monarchy though as yet without a king . Several of the older monarchies , such as Belgium and Rumania , revised their constitutions and introduced a larger element of democracy , but the monarchy in both countries was retained . Italy , although her system of government has undergone radical alterations in the hands of the Fascisti party , likewise continues a monarchy and there appears to be little or no disposition to displace it for the republican form . In Great Britain , the Scandinavian countries , Bulgaria , the Netherlands , and Spain the events of the World War effected no changes in the position of the monarchy and there is nothing to indicate that it will be displaced for the republican type in the near future . The result  | is that , leaving aside Russia and the petty protected states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . ' Monarchy has never gained a foothold in North America ( the French experiment in Mexico was a failure ) ; it has disappeared from South America , where it once existed in Brazil . In Asia it exists only in Japan , Siam , Persia , and a few petty states ; in Africa it survives in Abyssinia and Egypt . Elements of Strength . ? Bossuet in the eighteenth century eulogized the monarchial system of government as one which was not only recommended by the experience of history but one which , as stated above , was ordained by God . It was , he said , the most ancient , the most widely diffused , the best , and the most natural of all forms of government . All the world began with it and almost all the world had been preserved by it . It was not only natural but it was also the most dignified , and calculated to insure identity of interest between the ruler and the ruled , and the most conformable to that which God Himself had established . ' Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to be the nearest approach to a perfect form of political organization that could be devised by the ingenuity of man . Of its merits the English philosopher and historian David Hume wrote near the middle of the eighteenth century : " Though all kinds of government be improved on in modern times , yet monarchial government seems to have made the greatest advance to perfection . It may now be affirmed of civilized monarchies , what was formerly said of republics alone , that they are a government of laws , not of men . They are found susceptible of order , method , and constancy to a surprising degree . Property is there secure ; Footnote  | industry is encouraged ; the arts flourish ; and the prince lives among his subjects like a father among his children . " 1 And , he added , there are more " sources of degeneracy " to be found in free governments like England than in France , which was then , in Hume 's estimation , " the most perfect model of pure monarchy , " a judgment which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential elements of truth . ' A little later Turgot defended monarchy as a form of government which was peculiarly adapted to the promotion of the general happiness and welfare of mankind , since a monarch did not and could not have any interest in making bad laws or in governing his people except for their own good . ' Our estimate of the value of monarchy can not , however , be based upon the mere opinions of those who , like Turgot , were at the time its apologists or servants , or who , like Hume , wrote in an age when it was the almost universally accepted form of government and when it had few antagonists . It must be examined in the light of both reason and experience and on the basis of sound tests as to what constitutes good government . In passing judgment upon its merits it is also necessary to distinguish between the forms which monarchy may take or has taken in the past ; namely , the absolute type in which the monarch is the sole source of power and actually governs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the titular sovereign , restricted by constitutional limitations and actually governs through the agency of ministers who are responsible to the legislature or one chamber of it for their acts and policies . The first form of monarchy has been defended on the ground that it is a form of government which more than any other possesses the elements of strength , simplicity of organization , ability to act quickly , unity of counsel , continuity and consistency of policy , and a certain prestige in the conduct of foreign relations.4 It is also claimed that the laws in an abso-Footnote  | lute monarchy are more easily enforced because the monarch has a free hand to select skilled officials and he can therefore hold them to a stricter accountability than is possible in a democracy , where they are popularly elected for definite terms and can not be recalled or dismissed before the expiration of their fixed and limited terms . Finally , it is claimed that monarchial government is more conducive to social justice as among the different classes of society for the reason that the monarch , not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or classes , is likely to be impartial and even sympathetic toward the masses of his subjects . ' Even Rousseau , himself a radical democrat in his day , admitted that absolute monarchy was not without merits . " Where such a system prevails , " he said , " the will of the people and the will of the prince , the public force of the state , and the individual force of the government all respond to the same motive power ; all the springs of the machine are in the same hand , all look to the same end . There are no opposing movements which destroy each other and no sort of constitution can be imagined in which a slight effort produces greater action . " Rousseau went on to compare a skillful monarch governing his people throughout a vast state and making everything move while seeming himself immovable , to an engineer seated tranquilly on the shore of a sea and setting in motion without difficulty a huge vessel upon the waters . ' In the early stages of civilization monarchy is undoubtedly well adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed a high political consciousness and , who therefore lack the capacity themselves for participating actively in the management of the greatest number of nations . " " Principes g6n6raux de droit de politique , " etc. , p. 243 . Footnote  | public affairs . Perhaps no better form could be devised for disciplining uncivilized peoples , leading them out of barbarism , and inculcating in them habits of obedience . John Stuart Mill well remarked that " despotism is a legitimate mode of government for dealing with barbarians , provided the end be their improvement and the means be justified by actually effecting that end . " " Liberty , " he observed , " as a principle , has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion . Until then there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne , if they are so fortunate as to find one . " 1 The absolute monarchies of the medieval and early modern times justified their existence through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteenth centuries , " says Bryce , " saw many reforms in European countries which no force less than that of a strong monarchy could have carried through . " 2 Defects of Absolute Monarchy . ? But most of the claims that have been made for absolute monarchy have not stood the test of experience . In the last analysis it is a government constituted and administered by a single person according to his own sense of what is best and right for those over whom he reigns , and history abundantly confirms the truth of the assertion that such governments have more often been administered in the interests of the monarch himself than in the interests of his subjects . ' " It has long been a common form of speech , " said John Stuart Mill , " that if a good despot could be insured , despotic monarchy Footnote  | would be the best form of government . " i But , as he went on to remark , it is a most " pernicious misconception of what good government is . " Assuming for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual would never be abused , but on the contrary would insure an honest and intelligent administration of the government ; granting that good laws would be enacted and enforced , that equal justice would be dealt out to all , that the public revenues would be wisely expended ; in short , that the despotism were the wisest and most benevolent conceivable , there are still other considerations which render it far from being the ideal polity . Administrative efficiency is only one of the tests of a good government . No government which does not rest upon the affections of the people , which does not stimulate among them an interest in public affairs and create an active , intelligent , and alert citizenship , can be called ideal ; and , certainly , no government from which the participation of the people in some form is excluded will ever be able to produce such a body of citizens . ' Even if all the claims which have been put forward in defense of absolute monarchy were justified , this form of government still leaves too much to chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power by inheritance , there is no guarantee that a wise , capable , and benevolent person will succeed to the office . On the contrary , there is always the possibility that an imbecile or a fool rather than a sage or a statesman may succeed Footnote  | to the throne and be charged with governing and determining the destinies of millions of people . History affords numerous examples of immature , feeble-minded , and incompetent rulers succeeding to thrones under the operation of such a principle . France , for example , was governed for more than five hundred years by kings who had not reached the age of twenty-five years at the time of their accession to the throne , and for nearly one hundred years by kings who had not attained the age of twenty-one . ' Footnote  | Wise , capable , industrious , and benevolent kings have by no means been lacking , especially in the nineteenth century , but the number who have sympathized with and defended the interests of the masses as against those of the aristocratic classes has been still smaller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , if it credits some kings with conspicuous services to progress , tells us that since the end of the fifteenth century , when the principle of hereditary succession had become well settled , the number of capable sovereigns who honestly labored for the good of their subjects has been extremely small . " Spain , for example , for three centuries following the abdication of Charles V , had no reason , he added , to thank any of her kings , nor had Hungary , Poland , or Naples . ' Merits of Limited Monarchy . ? In the last analysis the merits and demerits of limited monarchy , ? if it be one in which the monarch is nothing more than the titular sovereign , the actual government being carried on merely in his name by ministers who represent the majority party in the legislature ( or one chamber of it ) and who are responsible to it for the manner in which they exercise their power , ? are mainly those which result Footnote  | from having a titular head of the state who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who acquires his office by right of hereditary succession . It is this latter feature , as has been pointed out above , which really distinguishes a monarchy from a republic . So far as the source of actual power and the processes of government are concerned , a monarchy may be as much a democracy as is a republic . This is true to-day of Great Britain , Belgium , and some other states which are officially classified as monarchies . In Great Britain , especially , the king is little more than the titular or ceremonial head of the state ; he is a sort of Merovingian roi-faineant ? subserving somewhat the same purpose that a cupola or an ornamental facade does to a building of which it is a part . He reigns but does not govern ; he has , as Bagehot remarked , the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn ? rights which may , in the hands of a strong , vigorous , highly respected monarch , be exercised with some effect . But after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final decision rests with the ministers ; it is for them to determine whether the opinion of the king ought to be respected or disregarded . To take a notable example , the influence of Queen Victoria of England was not without effect , especially in foreign affairs , and particularly during the later years of her life , but it was the result in large part of the respect due to her long experience , her advanced age , and her unblemished character . On the whole , her actual influence upon the policies of the government was not in proportion to the great industry and activity which she displayed . ' The same thing may be said of other monarchs in England and elsewhere where the pure type Footnote  | of responsible cabinet government prevails . In earlier times the reverence of the masses for a hereditary ruler more or less mystical and quasi-divine was a powerful bond of attachment and loyalty to the state . Bagehot , in his work on " The English Constitution " published in 1872 , considered this to be an important element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old Russia the almost superstitious veneration of the masses for the Czar produced the same result in an even larger degree . ' But with the general increase of political intelligence among the people of Great Britain and other countries where monarchy exists , the masses have lost much of their reverential spirit toward the wearer of the crown and consequently the value of the monarchy as a loyalty-inculcating institution has largely declined . Nevertheless , it must be admitted that in other respects it serves a useful purpose . Mr. Lowell has pointed out that the parliamentary system of Great Britain would be inconceivable without a titular figurehead occupying a position above the clash of parties and tumults of politics . If , he adds , " the English crown is no longer the motive power of the ship of state , it is the spar on which the sail is bent , and as such it is not only Footnote  | a useful but an essential part of the vessel . " t It is quite true that an elective presidential figurehead might subserve the same purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarchy is undoubtedly very popular , it is believed that the advantages of a system under which there is an orderly and uninterrupted succession to the office outweigh the disadvantages and inconveniences inseparable from the method of popular election . Besides , the probabilities are that the masses will have greater respect for a hereditary chief of state than for one who acquires his office as a result of party strife . In Great Britain and the dominions , it is almost universally admitted that the monarchy subserves a special purpose in holding together the different parts of the far-flung empire . This is conceded even by the leaders of the Labor party.2 Footnote  | II . ARISTOCRATIC GOVERNMENT Forms of Aristocracy Distinguished . ? In evaluating the strength and weakness of aristocratic government it is necessary to distinguish between the several forms in which it manifests itself or has manifested itself in the past . As pointed out in a preceding chapter , there have been aristocracies of birth or family ; aristocracies of wealth ; aristocracies of culture and education ; aristocracies of elder statesmen ; military and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Manifestly they do not all possess the same virtues or the same vices , nor the same elements of strength or of weakness . Whatever may be the method or basis of classification or the form which aristocracy may take , the general principle is the same ; namely , that aristocratic government is government by a comparatively small portion of the population . If as a form of government it meant what the etymological derivation of the word implies , it would , as De Parieu remarked , undoubtedly be the best kind of government in the world . ' Interpreted in the sense of government by the best , it is the government par excellence , the only government in fact which can be defended on sound and rational principles . Sir James Stephen remarked that the wise and good should govern in all countries ; but , as Seeley observed , if " good " is only a euphemistic name , meaning simply a quality possessed by the wealthy or well-born , then aristocracy is only a euphemistic Footnote  | name for oligarchy , which is itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Formerly aristocracy was one of the most respected , as it was one of the most widely distributed , of all forms of government ; but in recent years the name has come to have an unsavory if not a disreputable connotation . ' Ancient writers like Aristotle , as has been said , carefully distinguished between aristocracy , which they defined as government by the " best , " and oligarchy , which they described as government by a wealthy minority in their own interest . ' But to-day this distinction has largely disappeared , so that aristocracy connotes in the popular mind the same characteristics which the ancients associated with oligarchy . Strength of Aristocracy . ? One of the distinguishing characteristics of aristocracy is that it emphasizes quality rather than quantity , character rather than mere numbers.4 It assumes that some are better fitted to govern than others , attaches great weight to experience and training as political virtues , and seeks to reward special talent and attract it into the public service . It is preeminently conservative government ; it honors authority , especially when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special reverence for long-established custom and tradition . It strikes its roots deep in the past and distrusts innovation , especially when it involves the laying of violent hands upon institutions which have become venerable with age . Where it is associated with monarchy and democracy , it acts as a tempering and restraining element . It curbs the passions of democracy and holds in check the absolute tendencies of monarchy . ' In this sense it is , said Lord Brougham , a necessary part of a governmental system , since " nothing else can protect liberty from an arbitrary sovereign or from the more insupportable tyranny of Footnote  | the irresponsible multitude . " ' The very soul of it , said Montesquieu , is moderation founded on virtue . It possesses an inherent vigor , he declared , unknown to democracy . ' Napoleon has been quoted as saying that aristocracy was the sole support of monarchy , its lever , its resisting point ; that a state without it is a vessel without a rudder , a balloon in the air . ' Naturally jealous of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has every reason for refraining from an unwise and immoderate use of its power . Thus it avoids rash political experiments and advances only by cautious and measured step . ' If the principle of selection were always that of intrinsic worth , it is difficult to see what could be said against aristocratic government qua government . Considered from the standpoint of the quality of the government itself , without reference to its effect upon the masses who are excluded from participation in political affairs , government by the most capable few undoubtedly possesses distinct elements of strength and efficiency which are conspicuously absent from a system in which the untrained and uneducated masses hold the reins of power . John Stuart Mill remarked that " the governments which have been remarkable in history for sustained mental ability and vigor in the conduct of affairs have generally been aristocracies , " but he added that they had been " without exception aristocracies of public nine- Footnote  | tionaries ? that is , of men who have made public business an active profession and the principal occupation of their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness of aristocracy as a practical system of government lies in the difficulty of finding any sound and just principle of selection by which the fittest , politically speaking , may be segregated from the unfit , and , when this is done , of providing adequate security against the temptation of the former class to exercise their power in their own interest . It is now generally agreed that the most capable and fit of the population can not be selected by conferring the power to govern upon certain families and their descendants , for political capacity and honesty are qualities not always transmitted from father to son . Modern Defenders of Aristocracy . ? There were formerly , however , some highly respected writers who defended under certain limitations aristocracies constituted on the hereditary principle . Sir Henry Maine , for example , expressed the opinion that the chances of getting capable persons into the service of the state are as great under the principle of hereditary succession as under a system of popular election . ' " A man , " said Professor Seeley , " who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house of a statesman , may be presumed to have learnt something , if only some familiarity with public questions , some knowledge of forms of routine which others Footnote  | are likely to want ; and there is a fair probability that he may have acquired more , and a certain possibility that , as the younger Pitt , he may have acquired very much and also inherited very much . " 1 Lecky , in a defense of the English aristocracy , commenting on a saying of Benjamin Franklin that there was no more reason for hereditary legislators than for hereditary professors of mathematics , and that it was absurd to expect that the eldest son of a single family should always display exceptional or even average capacity , remarked : " But it is not absurd to expect that more than five hundred families , thrown into public life for the most part at a very early age , animated by all its traditions and ambitions , and placed under circumstances exceedingly favorable to the development of political talent , should produce a large amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful political life are not , like poetry or the higher forms of philosophy , qualities that are of a very rare and exceptional order . They are for the most part qualities of judgment , industry , tact , knowledge of men and of affairs , which can be attained to a high degree of perfection by men of no very extraordinary intellectual powers . . . . Few persons , I think , will dispute the high average capacity for government which the circumstances of the English aristocratic life tend to produce . " 2 Of the value of such an aristocracy to the state Lecky went on to say : " It is of no small importance that a nation should possess a class of men who have a large stake in the prosperity of the country , who possess a great position independent of politics , who represent very evidently the traditions and the continuity of political life , and who , whatever may be their faults , can at least be trusted to administer affairs with a complete personal integrity and honor . In the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so numerous in an extended empire , high rank and the manners that commonly accompany it are especially valuable , and their Footnote  | weight is not the least powerfully felt in dealing with democracies . " 1 Principles of Selection . ? But when all is said that can be said in favor of birth as the principle of selection , the fact remains , as Seeley readily admitted in his defense of the system , that it works for the false aristocracy as well as the true , and that the worst traits are transmitted as well as the best . The possession of property is an equally unsatisfactory test of political capacity , especially if it be inherited wealth . And so with all other tests which do not rest upon intrinsic merit . Yet the fact that no just or adequate tests can be found really proves nothing against aristocracy itself . The question of whether there ought to be a test by which to determine the fitness of men to exercise a share in the government , as Seeley observed , is not answered by showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not such a test.2 The trouble is not so much with aristocracy , as with the lack of a just and satisfactory selective test . Rousseau and Jefferson , both champions of democracy in their respective countries , emphasized the distinction between what Footnote  | they called natural aristocracies and artificial or " sham " aristocracies . Rousseau considered elective aristocracies to be the only natural ones , and these he pronounced the " best of all governments , " since they insured " probity , enlightenment , experience , and all the other guarantees that the government would be wisely administered . " In a word , he said , the best and most natural order is where the wisest govern the multitude , if there is any guarantee that the government will be conducted for the benefit of the people and not for themselves . ' Jefferson agreed with Rousseau in declaring all aristocracies based on wealth or birth to be " not only useless but also mischievous and dangerous , " though he was a strong defender of those based on " virtue and talent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believer in aristocratic government when the aristocracy was of the latter kind.3 " There is , " he said , " a natural aristocracy founded on talent and virtue which seems destined to govern all societies and all political forms , and the best government is that which provides most efficiently for the purity of the choosing of these natural aristocracies and their introduction into the government . " Artificial aristocracies have always been hated by the masses because they are constituted on the theory that some are born to rule and others to be their subjects , or because the rich are regarded as more qualified than the poor , merely by reason of their wealth . All of them , whether natural or artificial , are apt to be narrow and exclusive , and are inclined to arrogance and excessive conservatism which at times retards wholesome progress .4 Footnote  | We are entitled by deductions from history , says Woolsey , to lay down the principle that aristocracy is ordinarily capable of no long continuance , when it is the sole governing or by far the strongest power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the sense of being government by a small class , differentiated from the rest of the population by distinctions of birth and wealth , aristocratic government has virtually disappeared in all civilized states , although there still remain traces of it in states which have hereditary executives , where one of the legislative chambers contains hereditary or appointive elements , or where the suffrage is narrowly restricted by educational , property-owning , or other similar tests . Yet aristocracy in some form is a principle which all states have admitted and to some extent followed in practice . ' In all ancient states , democracies and aristocracies alike , large classes of persons were excluded from participation in public affairs . The laboring classes everywhere have been enfranchised only in comparatively recent years . In England , at the beginning of the eighteenth century one of the freest of states , the lower classes and a large proportion of the middle classes were excluded from all share in the government of the country . And the same was true to a less degree in America for a considerable period after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboring classes , yet practically all of them apply standards of fitness , even if they sometimes apply them indirectly and in a manner unconsciously . Lord Bryce emphasized that in fact all governments are aristocratic in a sense . No observer , he said , could fail to be impressed by the fact that the world is governed by an extremely small number of persons . " In all assemblies and groups and organized bodies of men , from a nation down to the committee of a club , directions and decisions rest in the Footnote  | hands of a small percentage , less and less in proportion to the larger size of the body , till in a great population it becomes an infinitesimally small proportion of the whole number . This is and always has been true of all forms of government , though in different degrees . " He cites the government of India as an excellent example of a government by " an enlightened , hardworking , disinterested , very small official class . " Even in large democratic countries like Great Britain and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determines policies is made by a very small percentage of the total population . ' III . DEMOCRATIC OR POPULAR GOVERNMENT Democratic Government Defined . ? Democratic or popular government , as was pointed out in a previous chapter , has been variously defined as a form of government in which every one has a share , as one in which the majority rules , one in which the mass of the adult male population has a voice , one in which public opinion controls , etc . Abraham Lincoln conceived democracy to be the government of the people , for the people , and by the people . In estimating the strength and weakness of this form of government we may disregard the shades of difference which characterize the various conceptions and proceed on the general assumption that a democratic government is one which is constituted and administered on the principle that every adult citizen ( the present-day conception would include women as well as men ) who is not regarded as unfit by reason of his having been convicted of crime , or in some countries because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the choice of those who make the laws by which he is governed , and that his voice should be equal in weight to that of every other elector . Footnote  | The governments of some states which are regarded as democratic do not come fully up to this standard ; some , on the other hand , go further and are organized on the principle that an illiterate citizen is qualified equally with a literate person to exercise a share in the government to which he is subject , and that this share can not be justly limited to the choosing merely of legislative representatives . In the states of the American Union , for example , voters have the right to nominate and choose many executive and administrative functionaries ( in most of the states also the judges of the courts ) , and in this and other countries where the principle of the referendum has been introduced , the voters have in addition an extensive power of direct legislation and determination of public policies . But whatever the differences of practice , they are largely differences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the principle that every honest , self-supporting adult citizen is qualified to participate in the business of government , and that on the whole he is as well qualified as any other of his fellow citizens . ' They rest , said Jefferson , on confidence in the self-governing capacity of the great mass of the people , and in the ability of the average man , or of average men , to select rulers who will govern in the interest of society . ' But there always have been and are still many who deny the soundness of this assumption.3 Footnote  | Elements of Strength of Democratic Government . ? In evaluating the advantages of democracy as a form of government we may disregard the uncritical opinions of those whose faith in the perfection of democracy is an obsession , ? almost a religion , ? who worship it blindly and deliberately close their eyes to the obvious defects which actual experience has shown it to possess . ' On the other hand , we need not consider seriously the equally uncritical and sweeping generalizations of men like Talleyrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; of Carlyle , who sneeringly referred to " the people as a certain number of millions , mostly fools " ; of H. G. Wells , who asserts that there is no case for the elective democratic government of modern states that can not be " knocked to pieces in five minutes " ; 2 of Ludovici , who asserts that democracy leads to death and aristocracy to life ; 3 etc . Our judgment should be based on the results of actual experience and as evidence of this upon the studies of scholars who have examined the history and workings of democracy and who have recorded the results of their investigation in scientific treatises . The test of the strength or weakness of a particular type of government lies partly in its efficiency , that is , in the degree to which it accomplishes the primary ends for which governments are established ; and partly in the educational , Footnote  | social , and civic effect which it produces upon the body of citizens over whom its authority is exercised . Judged on the basis of its character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are established , and doing them in a way which accords with the general will of the people , democratic government , it is claimed , is superior to all other types ? in fact it is the only type under which those who exercise public authority can be subjected to the control of those in whose interest they are chosen to govern , , being freely chosen by their fellow citizens , ordinarily for short terms , and accountable to them for the manner in which they exercise their trust , those who are called to govern will be the most representative , the most competent , and the most worthy of the public confidence ; whereas in a monarchy or an aristocracy those who govern may be appointed on the bases of widely different considerations . In short , it is claimed that popular election , popular control , and popular responsibility are more likely to insure a greater degree of efficiency than any other system of government . By no one was the strength of democratic government in its representative form so ably set forth as by John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which " the whole people , or some numerous portion of them , exercise the governing power through deputies periodically elected by themselves . " There is no difficulty in showing , he asserted , that the ideally best form of government is that in which the supreme controlling power in the last resort is vested in the entire aggregate of the community , every citizen not only having a voice in the exercise of that ultimate sovereignty , but being at least occasionally called on to take an actual part in the government , by the personal discharge of some public function , local or general . ' The only government , he continued , which can fully satisfy the exigencies of the social state is one in which the whole people participate , Footnote p 391 and the degree of participation should everywhere be as great as the general degree of improvement of the community will allow , and ultimately all should be admitted to a share in the sovereign power of the state . ' So far as the welfare of the community is concerned , the superiority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon two principles of as universal truth and applicability as any general proposition which can be laid down respecting human affairs . The first is , that the rights and interests of the individual can be safeguarded only when he is able to " stand up " for them himself ; the second is , that the general prosperity attains a higher degree and is more widely diffused in proportion to the amount and variety of the personal energies enlisted in promoting it.2 But the greatest glory of democracy in the opinion of its votaries does not flow so much from its own inherent excellence as a form of government , as from its influence in elevating the masses of the people , developing their faculties , stimulating interest among them in public affairs , and strengthening their patriotism by allowing them a share in its administration . ' " No man is free in the political acceptation of the word , " said Laveleye , " if he does not have some share in the government of his country , and he who is governed not by functionaries whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his consent , is a subject , not a citizen . " Lord Bryce pointed out that the manhood of the individual is dignified by his political enfranchisement and that he is usually raised to a higher level by the sense of duty which it throws upon him . ' Mill likewise very aptly re-Footnote  | marked that a man who has no vote in the government to which he is subject , and no prospect of obtaining one , either will be a malcontent or will feel as one whom the general affairs of society do not concern . For a government in which the masses have no share they do not feel the same readiness to make sacrifices . Democracy strengthens the love of country because the citizens feel that the government is their own creation and that magistrates are their servants rather than their masters . The French people , to quote Laveleye again , never began to love France until after the Revolution , when they were admitted to a share in its government , since which time they have adored it.1 Popular governments , resting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of equality , are also likely to be more immune from revolutionary disturbances than those in which the people have no right of participation . Thus De Tocqueville remarked that almost all revolutions which have changed the face of the world have had for their purpose the destruction of inequality . The same author , in his study of democracy in America , dwelt repeatedly upon the interest which the American people took in public affairs , their high state of intelligence in regard to political matters , and their natural patriotism.2 He pointed out that one of the great advantages of a democracy is that it serves as a sort of training school for citizenship . Mill likewise laid great stress upon the influence of democracy in elevating the character and political intelligence of the masses . The " most important point of excellence , " he said , " which any form of government can possess is to promote the virtue and intelligence of the people themselves , and the first consideration in judging of the merits of a particular form of government is how far they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The government which does this best , he continued , is likely to be the best in all other respects . Democratic government , more than any other , he thought , produced this result . Footnote  | Weaknesses of Democracy . ? Democratic government has always had its critics and even to-day when it has become very nearly universal , they are by no means lacking . In ancient and medieval times its very name connoted the idea of government by the irresponsible multitude . Aristotle classified it as a degenerate or perverted form of constitutional government . Treitschke mentions that in the Rathaus of Augsburg there are three allegorical paintings , one of which represents aristocracy in the guise of a solemn senate , another monarchy as a brooding despot receiving the humble homage of a gorgeous train of followers , and the third , democracy , as a drunken Cleon surrounded by a yelling mob . ' The last-mentioned picture represented , at the time it was made , the current conception of the character of democracy . Critics no longer regard it as so debased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first place , they assert that it attaches undue importance to quantity rather than quality . It makes the decision of the majority of the mass , even if a very small majority , the law , when the opinion of the minority , by reason of its superior intellectual , moral , and economic capacity , may be the wiser . It rests upon what is declared to be a false principle , namely that every man , whatever his real worth , is the equal of every other man so far as his capacity to participate in government is concerned , and consequently that no man 's vote should count for more than that of another man , in the choice of public officials and the determination of public policies.2 It either underestimates the value of special training and expert knowledge in the business of government , qualities which are considered essential in the field of private business , or makes it difficult to get experts into the public service . Yet , as the late Mr. Justice James Fitzjames Stephen once remarked , the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires an unusual amount of special Footnote  | knowledge and the steady restrained and calm exertion of a great variety of the highest talents which are to be found . ' Democracy , it is contended , means government , in large measure , by the ignorant , the untrained , and the unfit . It distrusts specialists and is inclined to regard government by them as inconsistent with true democracy . ' Mr. A. G. Sedgwick in a critical study of the weakness of American democracy , entitled " The Democratic Mistake " ( 1912 ) , points out , as other writers have done , that one L of its chief defects lies in the lack of adequate means for securing an enforceable responsibility ; that the prevailing belief that responsibility can be obtained by an attempt to make public officials responsible to the community through popular election , short tenures , and rotation in office , has not been justified by the facts ; that , on the contrary , the only effective method of securing real responsibility lies in security of tenure as is the practice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to him , constitutes the great " democratic mistake . " JBut Footnote  | democracies look with disfavor upon infrequent elections and long tenures because they are popularly believed to be undemocratic . Democracies are further criticized because they distrust natural leaders and are a prolific breeding ground for agitators , flatterers , bosses , and demagogues . ' Again they are said to be wasteful and extravagant ; they tend to level society down rather than up ; and they are indifferent to , if not actually hostile to , the advancement of education , science , literature , and art . ' Maine 's Estimate of Democracy . ? One of the most vigorous if not well-founded criticisms of democracy made in the nineteenth century was that of the English jurist , Sir Henry Maine , in his " Popular Government " published in 1886 . Maine , after a review of the history of popular government , concluded that " it affords little support for the assumption that it has an indefinitely long future before it . " Experience , he asserted , rather tends to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great fragility , " and that since its appearance in the world " all forms of government have become more insecure than they were before . " " Popular governments , " he declared , " have been repeatedly overturned by mobs and armies in combination ; of all governments they seem least likely to cope successfully with the greatest of all irreconcilables , the nationalists ; they imply a breaking up of political power into morsels and the giving to each person an infinitesimally small portion ; they rest upon universal suffrage , which is the natural basis of tyranny ; they Footnote  | are unfavorable to intellectual progress and the advance of scientific truth ; they lack stability ; and they are governments by the ignorant and unintelligent . " " Of all the forms of government , democracy , " he declared , " is by far the most difficult . " It is this difficulty that mainly accounts for its " ephemeral duration . " 1 The inherent difficulties of democratic government , he went on to say , are so great and manifold that in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were not aided by certain forces which are not exclusively associated with it , but of which it greatly stimulates the energy . The prejudices of the people are far stronger than those of the privileged classes ; they are far more vulgar and they are far more dangerous because their opinions are apt to run counter to scientific conclusions . ' Maine denied that there is any real connection between democracy and liberty , and asserted that in case there is and the choice has to be made between them , it is even better to remain a nation capable of displaying the virtues of a nation than to be free . ' " By a wise constitution , " said Maine , " democracy may be made as calm as the water in a great artificial reservoir ; but if there is a weak point anywhere in its structure , the mighty force which it controls will burst through it and spread destruction far and near . " C Becky 's Criticism . ? Another critic of democracy was the English historian Lecky , who in two volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government by the " poorest , the most ignorant , the most incapable , who are Footnote  | necessarily the most numerous . " The idea of government by such a class reverses , he declared , all the past experience of mankind . " In every field of human enterprise , in all the computations of life , by the inexorable law of nature , superiority lies with the few and not with the many , and success can be obtained by placing the guiding and controlling power mainly in their hands . " " Democracy insures neither better government nor greater liberty ; indeed , some of the strongest democratic tendencies are adverse to liberty . On the contrary , strong arguments may be adduced both from history and from the nature of things to show that democracy may often prove the direct opposite of liberty . " To place the chief power in the most ignorant classes is to place it in the hands of those who naturally care least for political liberty and who are most likely to follow with an absolute devotion some strong leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to liberty and have been its most ardent defenders , while democracy has often enough sought to dethrone it.2 Speaking of the United States , he declared , as De Tocqueville had done before him , that in hardly any other country does the best life and energy of the nation flow so habitually apart from politics , and is the best talent so rarely chosen to the public service . ' Likewise he adopted the view of De Tocqueville , Laveleye , Bluntschli , Maine , and Treitschke that democracy is unfavorable to the development of the higher forms of intellectual life , such as literature , art , and science ; in short , that democracy levels down quite as much as up . ' Speaking of the alleged equality upon which the American democracy rests , Maine declared that " there has hardly ever been a community in which the weak have been pushed so piteously to the wall ; in which those who have succeeded have so uniformly been the strong , and in which , in so short a time , there has arisen so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury . " i Laveleye , in his work entitled " Le Gouvernement dans la democratic , " likewise argued that democracy does not necessarily produce equality any more than it produces liberty , and that it is , besides , the enemy of both wealth and culture . Inequality of conditions and the struggle of classes , he declared , were responsible for the fall of the ancient democracies . If the people are ignorant and incapable , democracy must inevitably degenerate into anarchy and despotism , and both equality and liberty will be lost . ' These criticisms , especially those of Lecky , however , have been answered by various writers who have pointed out that some at least of the defects which they attributed to democracy are not caused by it but rather accompany it , and that democracy is not necessarily government by the ignorant and unfit . ' Treitschke 's Indictment . ? One of the most violent assaults made upon democracy as a form of government during the nineteenth century was that of the German historian Heinrich Treitschke , who was an almost blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pronounced to be an enlightened despotism . His prejudice against American democ-Footnote  | racy in particular was intense . From the technical standpoint the aristocracy of southern slaveholders prior to the Civil War was , he said , " infinitely superior to the democracy of the North , " which he regarded as a corrupt dollar-worshiping plutocracy , or oligarchy of the rich . ' In fact , he prophesied , the constitution of the United States was already " on a downward path . " 2 His estimate of the English , French , and Swiss democracies was hardly less severe . France was in fact " a complete plutocracy , an oligarchy of a few banking houses who avail themselves silently of democratic forms in order to exploit them for their own ends . " As to Switzerland , it was " undeniable that Swiss liberty is positively less than in Prussia . " The whole conception of democracy , resting as it does upon the principle of equality and the rule of the majority , is false , he said ; it tends to exploit the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incompetent , discourages brilliancy of intellect , fertilizes the soil for demagogues , and does little for the promotion of culture and the higher spiritual things of life . ' In view of Treitschke 's violent prejudices and his amazing ignorance of the history and experience of the democracies which he criticized , his opinions are entitled to little weight . Other Recent Critics . ? Among the more recent and more moderate critics of democracy may be mentioned the English Footnote
