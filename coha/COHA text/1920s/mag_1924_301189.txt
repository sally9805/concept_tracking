You Will Not Soon Forget John , Julia , Lily , Irene <P> The Story . A loverless woman discovers her hero at dead of night passionately embracing her sister who has had many lovers . Behind that climatical night was the history of many dark things . <P> Lily , sister of love , rosy , full-limbed but of infinitely more grace than the women of Rubens , had returned to the town in Ohio to bury her mother . The mother had died as bitter protest against the smoke and soot which factories shot upon her gardened mansion . Out of the factories had come human wretchedness . Into the wretchedness had gone Irene , sister of virtue , to find in Christian charity what Pagan love had denied her . To her goodness a giant had been drawn , a socialist Galahad . But when he had run from the bullets of the strikebreakers into the gardened mansion at dead of night , he had found , not Irene the good , but Lily the beautiful . At dawn , Lily returned to Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which began : " There are some things in this world which are impossible . " <P> Lily had made her home in Paris because she had , years ago , refused to marry her first lover , Governor of the State . She had refused to marry him , in spite of the unborn child , because she declined to be the slave of American convention . For was she not the daughter of Old John Shane , pioneer , who could " ride like hell " and in the same manner , fight and love ? <P> By the same token , Irene despised the flesh . Her father 's memory was an abomination-not less so since her sister was every inch his daughter . She made her prayers with the passion wherewith they loved . <P> And their mother ? She , indeed , was the mother of all good and of all evil . She defended the old regime against the new . She defended her children from themselves . She understood . <P> When the mother flings her last novel to the floor , turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy is that Lily-whether good or wicked-will flourish like the green bay tree . <P> The Significance . That Man is at once tragic and comic , sublime and ignoble , vastly individual yet universally interesting , are maxims of life , and stock for novelists . This book is least concerned with the first given maxim ; it would be a greater work if it dealt more with it . It reveals the second maxim subtly and upon the third , it is founded . There is no person created by Mr. Bromfield that is not poignantly individual , and even peculiar . The more his characters assert themselves and the older they grow , the more they intensify themselves . You have never seen John , Julia , Lily or Irene Shane before , but you will not soon forget them . They are alluring because they are alive . For instance , the development of Irene , from an innocent , sensitive child to the inhuman old maid , is surely one of the devilish tricks of life . <P> Unlike most young novelists , this one leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does not moralize , he offers you an experience .
