In Cleveland hotels last week , porters gathered up empty whiskey bottles , maids cleaned cigar stubs out of bathtubs , policemen went home to rest . The Prophets of the Grotto had left ( see MISCELLANY , p. 19 ) , and there were coming the Christian Endeavor young people , whose 31st international convention was immediately following that of the Prophets . <P> The Christian Endeavor movement among young people is comparatively recent . The late Rev. Francis E. Clark , who died last May , founded it Feb. 2 , 1881 , at his Williston Congregational Church in Portland , Me . Members were obliged to pledge themselves to attend weekly prayer meetings of their local society . So sound was Dr. Clark 's idea that 80 evangelical religious denominations have sponsored the movement . It has societies in 60 different countries ; has more than 3,500,000 members . Of these members 20,000 went to Cleveland last week. * <P> When they descended from their trains in the grimy , shacklike Union Depot they found one W. H. French , pullman conductor of South Euclid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed . It went : " Welcome to you , welcome to you ; Christian Endeavor , welcome to you ! " The visitors were glad . <P> In the convention sessions no matters of strong controversy came up . Christian Endeavor is too well organized for that . Young people join the societies because they sincerely believe in its simple principles . Two important matters the delegates decided on-one of rote , one of note . They re-elected as president Dr. Daniel Alfred Poling , pastor of Marble Collegiate Church , Manhattan ; and they changed the name of their organization from " United Society of Christian Endeavor " to " International Society of Christian Endeavor . " Union in their work they knew that they had accomplished . Henceforth they wished to emphasize its international aspect , influence . <P> <P> * The Epworth League , founded in 1889 , for Methodist young people , has similar aims . Its motto is " Look Up , Lift Up " ; its membership is 2,000,000.                @ @ @ @ @
