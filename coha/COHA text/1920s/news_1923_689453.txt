txt J. F. Hill , called in the Now England rail hearing by J .. 7 . Storrow , said in part : " We find New England 's handicap compared with road west of the Hudson is far less than Mr. Oldham 's ten cents per dollar of revenue . His comparison is wrong in excluding maintenance in which New England lines have substantial at : rantage over trunk lines . " Even if Mr. Oldham 's theory were substantiated by facts , conclusion that a'trunk line consolidation is necessary or desiruble by no means follows . Revision of joint rates is a more available method . " Declaring Mr. Oldham ignored dune it of Interest in equipment rents and joint facility milts , Mr. Hill stated the committee 's experts analysed operating cost of all New Englund roads , and operating costs of 30 roads rest of the Hudson in eastern rate territory . Operating cost per $1 of revenue in three years to June 30 , 1917 , for New Haven was 77.01 cents , Boston Main 81.64 , proposed New England system 77.90 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven 90.14 cents , Boston &; Maine 91.89 , propor ? : New England system 90.36 , other 30 roads 87.26 . " For three years prior to the war New England lines did net show a serious excess of cost over lines west of the Hudson River , being actually somewhat lower than Pennsylvania . If due allowance were made for effect of interest included in joint facility rents of New Haven , not properly to be considered an operating expense , and for items of interest in equpiment rents of New England lines , difference between New England lines and lines west of the Hudson for the three-year period would be not more than two cents . In 1922 cost for New England system is 8 cents more than average west of Hudson , but only 1.7 cents more than on the Pennsylvania . " Operating Cost of New England roads per unit of service are somewhat greater , and density of freight traffic much lower , than West of the Hudson . But revenue of New England lines , per unit of service , is higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England roads should go far toward realizing return on Property investment equal to that west of Hudson . " We see no reason to believe difference in cost will ever require a separate rate district with higher basis of rates in Now England than in rest of the eastern district . A New Englund system may be made to pay and New England is ready and determined to undertake the task . " BOSTON  --  W. A. Cole , counsel for Boston &; Maine . said before Commerce Commission , relative to railroad consolidation , in Washington last May President liustis stated his views . In brief they were : , " First ; that , while Boston &; Maine preferred to - be left alone to develop its own earning power , it recognized duty of the commission to propose a plan of consolidation , recognized that experience may show a road situated as is B. &; M. may not be able to realize full benefits of the act except through consolidation . " Second ; that if Boston &; Maine must be placed in sonic consolidation intent of the Transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an east and west system ? generally referred to as trunk line plan  --  rather than be grouped with New England roads into a single New England system . " Third ; that if there should be a New England system . it should comprise all roads within territory , except possibly Canadian lines in Maine . " Fourth ; that situation of New England roads warrants alternative plans With reasonable latitude for negotiation . " At the time these views were stated , Mr. Hustis said they must be regarded as personal , although be believed they were in harmony with views of directors of Boston &; Maine . Since that time his statement has been approved by board September 11 , and it is desired that this appear of record in this proceeding . "
