txt The movement to head off the nomination of William Gibbs for President was continued by the anti-qzmcq#Adoo leaders late today while the battle over the platform was stirring the great crowd of delegates and guests at the Auditorium . George E. Brennan , lcta of the Illinois Democrats , and Charles F. Murphy of Tammany Hall are standing firmly by their early decision to stop if enough delegates can be held In line . ' Thomas Taggart of Indiana , who wants to be elected United States Senator and ' thinks his chances are favorable if there is not a serious split that would dash hope of his getting Administration support , is reported less certain in his opposition , and possibly prepared to swing to if it appears that the latter is the best bet where the local Indiana situation is concerned . National Committeeman Fred Lynch , however , has lost control of the Minnesota delegates , and ten at least are outspoken tot . The Mississippi delegation is still held in line with a majority prepared to support Cox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Cox cause is hopeless is giving both the and antiqzmcq#Adoo forces much cause for concern . Postmaster General Burleson has taken over the leadership , so far as the practical politics of the situation is concerned . Uader his direction efforts are being made to obtain an agreement which would give the bulk of the delegates pledged to Attorney General Palmer , if the early balloting shows that Palmer is out of the race . It is predicted that nay lead Palmer in the early balloting , and that the Palmer strength may not exceed 270 at the start . Some of the Palmer supporters are prepared to grant more than 300 votes on the early balloting , but hold that he will begin to go down hill after reaching possibly 450 votes . May Swing to Dark Horse . There is some talk that the anti-qzmcq#Adoo leaders suddenly may swing their support to Ambassador John W. Davis , Chairman Cummings of the National Committee , or another dark horse , after the third or fourth ballot , if seems to be making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not look with favor on Bainbridge Colby . While Colby represents liberalism in their minds , the fear is expressed that he would not hold the Democratic ranks together " ? that the party would be torn by doubt and wonder at his nomination and be delivered into the hands of a group which might destroy its integrity and cause it to disintegrate . The tendency of both the and anti-qzmcq#Adoo forces is toward having the party 's nominee represent liberalism as opposed to the conservative form taken by the Republican platform and nominee . There is agreement on one thing , if on not other , and that is that a candidate who represents the liberal movement in the country would have the best chance to win in face of the situation created by the action of the Republican . Convention . Brennan , Murphy , Lynch , Taggart and others who do n't want have felt that Governor Cox would serve this object not only where the prohibition issue was concerned , but in connection with the labor vote . That tope has been about given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little enthusiasm for Cog 's nomination , and some predict that he never will get as many as 200 votes . Arguments for . In such a situation the forces find their greatest strength . They are putting before the delegates as the candidate who represents the liberal thought without , as In the case of Secretary of State Colby , making It possible to charge that the convention had in a sense reached out beyond its borders to take a man whose : chief claim to being a representative Democrat lay in the fact that he was taken into the official family at Washington by the President , Iand to the endless surprise of the coun .. try . , it is held , would get the majority of ' the labor vote , which will not go to Senator Harding , the Republican nominee , and also appear as a true and tried Democrat , who would under no circumstances permit the solidity of the party to ' disintegrate in favor ' of an out and out liberal . party ? mOvement . This argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of ' in the Minds Of . many delegates who shy at the name of ' Colby , Who express doubt at the ' ability of Davis to make a strong appeal . to the so-called . liberal voters , arid who express . wonder at . just What Chairman Cummings stands for Or'why ' he should inchosen as the party 's . . . . ... ... standard ' bearer .  --  ? The eleventh hour efforts ' to build ? up their fences ' are restricted . largely ' t.6 a. feW ? of . the leader* , ? as " nitsslonark work among . the . delegates themselves has been practically out of the question be . cause . of the ? desire of the delegates to be present at the Bryant fight nver.the platform . . - - . ..

It is pretty generally conceded by the leaders ' of all . elements licit no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lineup . New ' reek Delegates Spilt . One of the important bits of information which came from the leaders today was that the delegation from New York State had split and at least thirteen , and possibly as many as fifteen of the insurgents , headed by Assistant Secretary or the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mayor George H. Lunn of ? SchenfictadY , were openly . for . Charles F. Murphy appears to have the other delegates held in line , and ' the very fact that the insurgents have boldly announced their intention to repudiate the Tammany boss and vote as they see fit may help him in keeping his forces together . 8oMet of the anti-qzmcq#Adoo leaders hold that the form the insurgent movement has taken is in poor strategy from the viewpoint , and that unless the ex-Secretary can show well over a majority by the fourth or fifth ballot he never will get more than fifteen votes out of the New York delegation . Admittedly the weakness of the antiqzmcq#Adoo group is its inability to concentrate on seine candidate who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently has been eliminated from the fight and Palmer does not stir enthusiasm as a man about whom to rally . President Wilson , so far as it has been possible to ascertain , has withheld indorsement of any candidate or movement . It is the general belief among leaders here that if the President were to . select a candidate he would follow one of two courses  --  run hiMeelf or.nsune Secretary . Colby . The forces are not claiming the unqualified support of the White HOuSe . - It is ' Said that while satisfies We President 's wishes where the treaty of . peace is C.Oneetildd , ? he IS at odds with the President in regard to some economic subject , such as the course to ? be followed in paying off the war debt . If a deadlock develops it may mean the creation of , a situation . the President must let his wishes be known , indirectly at - least , if he desires the nomination of either or Colby . The convention has Shown an inclination to pay heed to the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a deadlock over the nomination by , word of how Mr. Wilson wanted things to go .
