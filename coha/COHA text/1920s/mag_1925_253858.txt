THE CRAZY FOOL-Donald Ogden Stewart-A &; C. Boni ( $2.00 ) . Since amused friends told Mr. Stewart he was a scream and should set up in the funny business , which he did with The Parody Outline of History ( 1921 ) , this is his fifth booby book . It concerns Charlie Hatch , who inherited his uncle 's insane asylum , organized it with conferences , buzzers and several Department Heads , " made good , " won Banker Pratt 's ravishing daughter and died a noble death just in time to avert a happy ending . Chuckle production , still profuse , rests chiefly on : 1 ) The incongruous appearance of old family bywords ; 2 ) cretinous actions by the characters ; 3 ) obtuse conversations as between one amiable dunderhead and another ; 4 ) childish horseplay with modern solemnities ; 5 ) feints at coy indelicacy . If the reader at times identifies the author with his hero , that is because , in the funny business , the last , not the first , 100 years are the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even clowning , and not take one 's work a trifle seriously .
