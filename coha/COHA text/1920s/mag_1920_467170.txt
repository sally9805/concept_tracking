THE English language is an Inn of Strange Meetings . Its doors stand open always , and it extends a warm re ? ception to travelers from foreign lands . Some of its guests are able to make themselves welcome , and they therefore settle down as regular boarders ; while others , finding themselves ill at ease , restless and useless , are to be considered as transients , lodgers for the night only . The demand for accommodation has been so persistent and so imperious that the hostelry has now to keep on enlarg ? ing itself to provide for the newcomers , often to the disgust of the older guests , swift to resent what they consider the intrusion of the vulgar herd ; and they have cried out indignantly , sometimes against the low-born native and some ? times against the undesirable alien . The vocables who vaunt their descent from the ancient and honorable Anglo-Saxon stock may be justified in their abhorrent contempt for uncouth plebeians , like gents and pants , and for inacceptable im ? migrants , like artiste and pianiste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental Oxford Dictionary de-dared that the English language has truly a " marvelous digestion and seems able to feed on almost any kind of nutri ? ment . Popular slang and old pedantries , the dreams of philosophers and the cant of thieves , puns and perversions , forgot ? ten fears and ancient superstitions , have all contributed to its vocabulary ; and some of our most respectable words have wild and strange histories ; and this gives us warrant to hope that what English has done in the past to nourish its vigor it will continue to do in the suture . " We need not be alarmed if , in this first quarter of the twentieth century , as in every quarter of every other century for now a thousand years or more , new words of all sorts and conditions are being added to the language , springing up spontaneously , often from seeds of doubtful origin . There are so many of these verbal novelties and they spread themselves so swiftly and so insidiously that very few of us are conscious of more than a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to use pep and jazz ; we have been taught to feel a hostile contempt for profiteers and for hyphenated citizens ; and we have been told what manner of man a drug-addict is and what manner of thing a fabricated ship . Whether these six new words are or are not going to be accepted into stand ? ard English and to be employed without the apology of quotation-marks can not be predicted by any one to-day . Their acceptance will depend on their utility , not on their regularity of construction or their legitimacy of descent . Dr. Henry Bradley , in his most instructive little book on the " Making of English , " took occasion more than once to empha ? size the fact that the " regard for cor ? rectness " is powerless " when it con ? flicts with the claims of convenience of expression . " If a new word is recognized as meeting a need of the language , as providing an easier or a more effective way of saying something that we want to say , then its future is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be unavailing . In a few years or in a few decades only students of the history of the language will re member that the then approved word had once been placed on the Index by the self-constituted defenders of the integrity of the language . The speech of the people belongs to the people as a whole ; and the word , the phrase , and the usage which the people persist in employing is certain sooner or later to be used even by the most fastidious of stylists . Where do all our new words come from , both the feeble vocables destined to an early death and the verbal entities lively enough to force themselves into the vocabulary ? Who makes them ? How are they made ? These are ques ? tions to which iL is often difficult to find an answer . Sometimes we know who made a word , why lie made it , where he made it , and when he made it Huxley manufactured agnostic , from a Greek root , intending it to be a more accurate description of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aptly and correctly formed ; it was needed ; it was immediately adopted both by his friends and his foes ; and from English it has made its way into most modern languages . But where did Jazz come from ? Who was responsible for this fit name for misfit music ? And when was it that some person or persons to us unknown had a happy inspiration and described syncopated measures as rag-time ? We can make a guess that pep is a curtailing of pepper and that boob is only a short ? ened booby ; but why is a recently in ? vented combination of ice-cream and fruit syrup known as a sundae ? And why is this name not more simply spelled either sunday or sundy ? Why was the armored tractor which helped power ? fully to win the war entitled a tank ? Here indeed is an instance of the way . in which an old word is sometimes ap ? plied to a new thing in spite of the fact that it is not at all a good name for this invention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquids ( which was the only meaning of tank five yearsago ) and a caterpillar tractor , steel-clad and bristling with guns ( which is what tank means to-day even though it re ? tains also its earlier significance ) . A score of years ago , during the war in South Africa , we were made familiar with the verb to commandeer , a needless novelty since the English language al ? ready had its exact equivalent in to requisition , and during the recent war were called upon to accept another new verb , to profiteer , framed on the model of commandeer ( perhaps with some mem ? ory also of privateer ) and almost as un ? necessary as commandeer , since we might have brought into general use the law-term to forestall . But forestall does not suggest all that we think we recognize in profiteer ; and a new word justifies its creation even when iL conveys only a slight difference in meaning . The insistent desire to save time and to shorten a polysyllable whenever this is possible has led the British to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substitute the movies for moving-pictures . These trun ? cated terms seem to have ousted their long - legged progenitors , partly , no doubt , because of the universal appeal of the photographic panorama ? the pressure to abbreviate a name being in proportion to the frequency of its use as well to its original prolixity . In like manner have we shortened taximeter cab to taxi ? just as our forefathers exercised the same privilege and cut cabriolet down to cab . It is amusing to note that these more leisurely ancestors of ours cur ? tailed cabriolet to preserve only cab whereas they beheaded periwig to pre ? serve only wig , while we ourselves seem almost as ready to chop the head off telephone and the tail off photograph . Rudyard Kipling , always fastidious in his use of English , has no hesitation - in. employing photos ( in Kim ) ; and the managers of the moving-picture theaters invite us to behold photo-plays , a violent barbarism of immediate utility . Kipling can not escape the ultimate responsibil ? ity for another abbreviated word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabulary of the so-called " silent drama . " His biting lyric on the " Vampire , " with its corroding characterization of its heroine-villainess as " a rag and a bone and a hank of hair " has brought about a belief that a vampire is always the female of the species ; and as a logical result of this unfounded opinion any fascinating adventuress trying to cajole an innocent hero is now entitled a vamp . What is even more picturesque is that this abbreviated noun has also become a verb : " She vamps him . " This is an excellent example of that striving for " elliptic brevity " which D oc ? tor Bradley has called a striking char ? acteristic of spoken English . And Doc ? tor Bradley has also pointed out that " the tendency to reduce the number of syllables in words wherever it was pos ? sible " can be discovered in our language as early as the fifteenth century . It is one of many forces forever at work to bestow on the English language the simplicity and the directness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eng ? lish-speaking peoples continually display in the other relations of life . When we feel that the undue length of a word unfits it for the swift transaction of business , we may now and again seek to find a short , sharp substitute , as when we say to wire instead of to telegraph . But more often than not the lengthy word is itself mercilessly abbreviated , as when advertisement is reduced to ad . Then we go a little farther and describe a two-line advertisement under the gen ? eral head of " Help Wanted " as a " want adlet . " And there are those who are willing to adventure themselves still further along this path of linguistic effi ? ciency and designate the advertising ex ? pert as an ad-smith , a novel locution ( still unknown to our kin across the sea ) which Mr. Howells immediately hailed as " delightful , " thereby vindicating his inexpugnable Americanism . True it is , he went on to remark , that " ad is a loathly little word , but we must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whichwe condensed from luncheon and which we promptly made to serve also as a verb . Doctor Bradley called attention to a device which has enriched English from time to time and which is not utilized in any other language , so far as I know . This is what is called " back-formation . " For example , the word groveling was misunderstood as a present participle and the verb to grovel was formed from it . So " the noun peddler is older than the verb to peddle or the adjective ped ? dling " ; and the noun editor seems to have been the parent of the verb ; to edit . In like manner the adjective swash ? buckling has been deduced from the noun swashbuckler . " Many of the words which have been formed by this proc ? ess , " so the learned but unpedantic linguist assured us , " are so happily ex ? pressive that the misunderstanding that has given rise to them must be accounted a fortunate accident . " It is evidence of his freedom from pedantry that Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from butler , to pant . from Ranting , the name of the Englishman who proposed a new method for reducing fat , and to maffick ? that is , to indulge in a riotous demon ? stration in the street , like that which took place in London in 1900 when there came the glad news of the relief of Mafeking , long beleaguered by the Boers . As Doctor Bradley passes no condemnatory verdict on these three British innovations , it is odd that he failed to mention a fourth which has won as wide an acceptance in the United States as in Great Britain ? to burgle , a verb back-formed from the noun burglar . In the devising of back-formations we Americans have not lagged behind our British cousins ; at least they have ac ? cused us of making the verb to collide out of the noun collision on the erroneous assumption that as elision was formed from elide , so collision must have been formed from a non - existent collide . Because this assumption was erroneous , William Cullen Bryant half a century ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of locutions which he did not desire to see in the pages of the very respectable evening paper he then edited . But if to edit had been made to order from editor , why should not collide be made from collision. ? Even a poet whose own English was pure and vigorous could not take up arms against a sea of verbal troubles and by opposing end them . Collide seems now to have lived down the scan ? dal about its unhappy past ; and so has talented , which Bryant also cast into outer darkness , probably because it seemed to imply a non-existent verb , to talent . He excluded from his paper an ? other back-formation , to donate from do ? nation ; but he failed to pronounce an edict of expulsion upon orate from ora ? tion . Possibly orate may not have reared its grisly head within range of the poet 's vision . Even now , orate is rarely used , although it has a distinct utility in that it suggests a false and flamboyant speech-making , quite different from the eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant would have said if he could have beard one of the most recent of American back ? formations ? the verb to be peeved , de ? rived from the adjective peevish ; but I make no doubt that Mr. Howells would welcome it as heartily as he did ad-smith . Assuredly " he was peeved " is a delight ? ful phrase , more subtly suggestive than " he was peevish , " and even a little dif ? ferentiated in meaning from its elder brother . There is , however , an American back-formation that I detest ? to enthuse . I do not know why I have so bristling a repugnance to this , as I am well aware that it is no worse made than to be peeved or to burgle ; but somehow it seems to me vulgar , and uncouth , bear ? ing the bend sinister of offensive ille ? gitimacy . To my mind it demands im ? mediate deportation as an undesirable citizen of the vocabulary . I know well enough that my prejudice is probably unduly exaggerated ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor Fell ; the reason why I can not tell . " A friendly British newspaper man who came over here during the war to report on what he called " New America , " found stimu ? lation in the " nuggety word-groupings which are the commonplaces in good American conversation " and which " are like flashes of crystal . " He noted that " Americans are never tired of bursting the bonds of convention , but when the less disciplined do this they are apt to emerge on a stage where freedom , though delightful , has its disadvantages . " Back-formations are generally caused by the desire to save time , to cut across lots . It is swifter to call a man a coke-fiend than to say that he was in the habit of taking cocaine . It is sharper to de ? clare that lie is an addict than to describe him as addicted to indulgence in danger ? ous drugs . Addict and coke are to be companioned with dope , a strange flower which bloomed in the American vocabu ? lary only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which , in the first two decades of the twentieth century , burgeoned exuberantly . As it happens , I can recall exactly when I first became acquainted with this lin ? guistic weed . In 1893 , at the Chicago Exhibition , I was told that the trained animals in the Hagenbach show were not doped . I immediately accepted dope as derived somehow from opium or opiate , although I am still at a loss to understand how it acquired its initial . In ensuing years I began to hear men assert that they felt dopy ? sluggish , as though they had taken an opiate . A little later the word took on an enlarged meaning , " I doped it out " ? that is to say , " I came to a conclusion . " After a while I noted that a person seeking in ? formation would ask to be supplied with the dope . When we went to war with Germany the American ambassador left Berlin carrying a small bag , which he held fast , because , as he explained , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write . Although back-formation has been at work in our language for several cen ? turies , it has been more active of late in the American variety of English than in the British , because we are more in ? clined to take short-cuts . Some of our back-formations are abhorrent and some are appealingly picturesque , even if they are also pert . " The American tongue , " we are told by the wandering Briton from whom I have already quoted , " is a potent and penetrating instrument , rich in new vibrations , full of joy as well as shocks for the unsuspecting visitor . " To be peered is a joy , even if to enthuse is a grief ; and it must be confessed that many of our local back-formations still smack of the street where they were born . Only one or two have been invited upstairs into the library for the use of men of letters . - Yet if the rest of them may have to linger long on the threshold , or even at last to be turned from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logic of our language , with its eager insistence on energetic efficiency . New words are derived from all sorts of sources . To bluff , for example , which began life as a necessary technical term in poker , spread into general use in the United States , crossed the western ocean and established itself in Great Britain , and has now crossed the English Channel and forced its admission into French and Italian and German . Per ? haps to pass the buck , having a similar origin , will in time attain to a similar world-wide acceptance . To spoof , a Briticism originating in the sporting circles of London , bids fair to be adopted in New York , although its attractiveness is as slight as its utility . Equally un ? necessary is forelady , which is intended to be a more elegant appellation for a forewoman and which seems to presage a companion foregentleman ? or would it be foregent ? In another new word which we owe also to the busy marts of trade we can note again the ability of our language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Wehave long been familiar with salesman and saleswoman ? even , alas ! with sales ? lady ; and the latest member of the family to whom we have been introduced Lo , salesperson , a name intended to apply to employee of either sex . These verbal novelties we have made out of our stock , so to speak ; and at the same time we have kept on taking over terms from other tongues , in accord with our ancient custom , as a result of which the words of foreign origin in our every ? day speech ? so a historian of our lan ? guage has asserted ? " far outnumber those of Old English origin . " And upon these alien vocables we have worked our will in our own fashion . We have taken two Latin words , per centunt , cut the second to get per cent. , and then melted them together with an English termination to give us percentage . We have taken risque and made it risky , and we are in the process of taking brusque and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since a foreign word which keeps its foreign pronunciation or its foreign spelling is always a menace to the purity of English . The alien words we admit to citizenship in our language ought always to renounce their foreign allegiance . A term from another tongue is more easily made to feel itself at home in our vocabulary when its spelling does not call attention to its original outland ? ishness . So it was that cafeteria and automat , as names for special kinds of restaurant , slipped into general use with ? out exciting general notice . The latest importation from France that I have had occasion to remark is no more than the conferring of a new mean ? ing upon an old word . In English to intrigue has always meant to plot sur ? reptitiously , whereas in French it was always used ( by extension ) to indicate the state of puzzled doubt in which we may find ourselves when we have reason to suspect a surreptitious plot ; and this secondary French meaning is now pass ? ing over into English , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our magazines , " she intrigued me , " meaning that she puzzled me , and not meaning that she involved me in an in ? trigue . This Gallic secondary meaning will probably force itself into our yield ? ing Anglo-Saxon , and we shall have hereafter the privilege of employing to intrigue in either of two different intents . I doubt if this will be to the profit of the language ; but protest is idle , since the fate of a novelty always depends upon its ultimate usefulness . It is both futile and foolish for the respecters of the ancient landmarks of language to deny that an old word can have any other than its original content . The real meaning of a word is what it means now to those who utter it and to those who hear it , and not what it meant to their mothers . " There are few true synonyms in literature , none per ? haps , " said Dr. Clifford Allbut in his illuminating Notes on the Composition of Scientific Papers , and he added that " words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry upon them also many changes and tinctures of past uses , which blend inevitably in our sentences . The word apostate , for example , means far more than an absentee or a dissenter , and a muscle is much more than a little mouse ; monks rarely live alone ; your anecdote is anything but clandestine ; rivals contend for other than water-rights ; and hypocrites are no longer con ? fined to the theater . " And we can not doubt that there were pedants who fore ? saw the impending degradation and the ultimate destruction of English if apos ? tate and muscle , anecdote , and rival were not each of them cribbed , cabined , and confined to the single meaning justified by their derivation . Perhaps I am playing the part of the pedant when I feel inclined to protest against the unidiomatic wording of the Covenant of the League of Nations . Apparently the phrasing of this agree ? ment was due to a drafting-clerk who had to think in two languages at once and who translated from French into English without due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was in fact Eng ? lish . In Article 1 it is prescribed that " declarations must be deposited with the secretariat , " when it would be purer English to specify the Secretary 's office . In Article 10 we are told that the Council shall advise upon certain matters , and the content makes it plain that the Coun ? cil is not to advise some other body but itself to take action ( and this is in accord with the meaning of aviser in French and not in accord with the mean ? ing of advise in English ) . In Article 37 we read that German nationals in certain territory transferred to Belgium will be entitled to opt for German nationality ? nationals being used for citizens and opt for choose . In Article 1 of the annex to the treaty of peace , permission is given to the French to exploit certain roads and railways , although exploit in English carries a somewhat sinister suggestion absent from the French exploiter . In the same article we find personnel , meaning the workmen . In Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is what we call a referendum ; and there is a mention of a gendarmerie , which is what we call a police-force . A little later in this docu ? ment we are told that a special conven ? tion will determine the conditions of pay ? ment of indemnities " to persons who have been evacuated . " By some of its advocates the Covenant of the League of Nations has been lik ? ened to the Constitution of the United States ; but it would be idle to deny that the new document is far inferior in its wording to the old instrument drawn up by our wise forefathers , shrewd and farseeing men who knew exactly what they wanted to say and who spared no pains to express this with the utmost concision consistent with the utmost clarity . They even went so far as to refer their draft to a special com ? mittee on style , with Gouverneur Morris as its chairman . It is greatly to be re ? gretted that those who were responsible for the Covenant did not follow the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
