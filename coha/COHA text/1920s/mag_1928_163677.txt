By decision of the Imperial Household Ministry a secret was revealed , last week , which had been successfully kept from the Japanese press and public for over a month . <P> Secret : On the island of Formosa one Cho Meika , a Korean youth of 21 , took a dose of poison , six weeks ago , and instantly thereafter threw a dagger at Prince <P> Kuni , august father of the Sublime Empress Nagako . <P> Poorly aimed , the dagger merely pinked his Highness ' chauffeur . Pouncing police not only collared would-be assassin Meika but efficiently forced down his throat a successful antidote to the poison he had taken . Today he is in Tokyo , alive and awaiting justice . <P> Bowed with shame Governor Mitsunosuke Kamiyama of Formosa resigned , last week , to expiate the stigma cast upon his administration . President Takeji Kawamura of the South Manchurian Railway Co. , laid down his duties as such last week , to pop into the vacated governorship .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
