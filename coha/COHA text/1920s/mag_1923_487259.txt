T WO sous , the cross of the Legion of Honor , and a wound badge were all he had in his pockets  --  and he hung himself on a war monument lately dedicated to the unknown dead by Premier Poincare . He , too , has joined the ranks of the unknown dead , and he chose a fitting place to end his life . If he had been an American he might well have chosen the steps of the office of the Veterans ' Bureau . The committee hearings degenerated into a contest in personal abuse , and the public , sickened , lost interest . The investigators and those whose conduct of office they had been investigating seemed to have forgotten the purpose of the bureau . We should hear fewer pleas for the miscellaneous bonus if ex-service men had any conviction-that we were really doing our part by the men who wereand are disabled . A general cynicism is natural , however , when it is discovered that the captain of a university football team is on the rolls of the disabled men receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day without a current passport and yet had no trouble from the immigration officials . He was Prince Youssopoff , and if he did not have a valid passport he had a slip of paper which , he said , was a diplomatic pass dating from the good old days of the Czar . As the Berengaria steamed down the harbor the prince could look across at the red roofs of Ellis Island . He probably did not know that several hundred compatriots of his were locked up in one room on that island waiting for Washington to decide whether they might be admitted or not  --  and had been waiting in that room , without toilet facilities and without screens , for weeks . But then , they were third-class passengers , peasant women and Jews , and he was a prince , and , if a murderer , a good counter-revolutionary . If Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams and Thomas Jefferson were alive to see that contrast in the republic they helped found , they might think another revolution necessary . C OMPTROLLER CRAIG 'S sentence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we said last week , to be the starting-point of an effort to take away from judges this medieval and autocratic power to try , convict , and punish according to their personal spleen or whim . Certainly all alleged contempt committed outside of the courtroom ought to be brought within the criminal law and made subject to trial by jury . The proposal to investigate the judicial record of Judge Mayer , or the assumption that this judgment was unusually unreasonable , is poppycock . Judge Mayer 's action can be matched with all too many others ; it has caused wide protest merely because Mr. Craig happens to be a victim of unusual prominence . Had he been John Doe or Richard Roe  --  as ordinarily  --  the New York newspapers would not be printing columns on the incident , nor would politicians be concerned . Their interest is not in justice but in personality . We are too much given to upholding archaic trumpery in our courts in order to preserve what we ridiculously call the majesty of the law . The majesty of fiddlesticks ! Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual sanctity ; it is justifiable when the community interests urgently require it and the common will upholds it , but it is never anything but a pitiful compromise  --  a necessary , unmajestic evil . It is time to introduce common sense into our court proceedings , to cease to regard our judges as sacred cows . The - right of trial by jury was supposedly won 700 years ago at Runnymede , but there are still some glaring exceptions . Decency and democrac3 ; demh.njl that.ve gather them in. making a great ** irpe speech in the case of Comptroller Craig , tliey LYa=no:4 &50:usly; indifferent , with a few honorable exceptions , to the fact that thirty-two men have spent five or more years in federal prisons  --  and are still there  --  for exercising this constitutional right during the war . We agree with Ralph Chaplin that the defenders of our liberties in connection with these men have been too humble . We should cease to petition President Coolidge , and instead demand the vindication of our fundamental law by the release of these men . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill should be introduced in Congress to- end this monstrous injustice . To talk about the majesty of the law in the face of such defilement of it is the most hypocritical buffoonery . It is time that every man in public life be called upon to take a stand on this question . Those who fail to demand unequivocally an end to this barbarism and illegality ought never to be permitted to utter the word freedom again without having it thrown back in their teeth . UDGE ALTON B. PARKER , president of the National Civic Federation , is at it again  --  this time with an impassioned defense of the " capitalist press . " We commented last week upon Senator B. K. Wheeler 's able reply to Judge Parker 's attack upon the Senator 's favorable report upon conditions in Soviet Russia . Senator Wheeler said : " I feel that my opinions are based on facts and not on the mendacious propaganda that fills the capitalist press and which you so smugly indorse in your letter . " Judge Parker replied that his sources were the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Coolidge  --  which we are sure Senator Wheeler would not doubt  --  and continued : You insinuate that the " capitalist press " is our sole source of information . Your meaning is clouded . . . . You know very well that the press of our country , including nearly all the great newspapers , has freely published all the interesting and important official Soviet documents they , could get hold of . . . . Even the papers most violently accused of being against the soviets , like the New York Times , have .. . taken the lead in that direction . And more of the same . Judge Parker seems to regard the New York Times as a model of newspaper fairness . There is an obvious test to apply . How much of Judge Parker 's attacks on Senator Wheeler did it print , and how much of Senator Wheeler 's reply ? After a careful search of a file of the Times and consultation of its index department we find that on October 31 it printed seven inches of the Parker attack ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on November 24 it printed six inches of Parker 's reply to the reply it had not printed . Could bias go further ? I T is encouraging to learn that - Circuit Judge Harry I Fisher has granted a writ of mandamus compelling the city of Chicago to issue a license to Mrs. Helen G. Carpenter to establish a birth-control clinic . The city authorities , be it said to their shame , refused such a license , and plan , it is said , to appeal from the decision . In the absence of a law in Illinois against spreading birth-control information , Judge Fisher ruled that such propaganda was not immoral or contrary to public policy . .1-le said : It is earnestly , cout , ndEld that 4nowl4dge of methods of contraception 5 ; v ?

The feap of tckult7iriglpre*a.r4iicy ' - is said to be a great totalitp. tiiis-were true , it would be sad to contemplate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of November 14 we commented upon SecreI tary Hoover 's speech on superpower before the chairmen of the public-service commissions of eleven States , saying that his ideas were excellent from the engineering standpoint but socially shortsighted because he proposed to turn great possibilities over to private companies for exploitation , and the economic saving would go not to consumers but to stockholders in corporations . Mr. Hoover 's secretary writes to say : I beg to inform you that at no place has Mr. Hoover ever suggested that the ' savings from superpower development should be turned over to the power companies . If you will take the trouble to read his address in full you will observe that the entire statement is directed toward savings for the consumer . Any tyro in public regulation knows that its very essence is to secure just such savings for the consumer . If we were in error in assuming from Mr. Hoover 's words that he was thinking of private rather than government development of superpower , then we owe him an apology . But the stress that he placed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that he could have in mind only private ownership . If Mr. Hoover stands for private ownership , but thinks that nevertheless the economic saving can be preserved to the consumer through " public regulation , " then we differ with him . The most that such control has usually accomplished has been to mitigate outrageous gouging . A greater saving may result from private than from public ownership , but only an uncertain part of it goes to the consumer . W HEN is Mr. Hughes going to recall from Brazil Admiral Vogelgesang and his " diplomatic mission " of thirty-eight naval officers ? Dr. Samuel Guy Inman reports in the useful weekly News Bulletin of the Foreign Policy Association that he found in South America that it was having - " an exceedingly bad effect . " " In Argentina , " he added , Naval officers and others again and again told me that no other construction could be put on our sending the naval mission to Brazil than that this country desired to sell war material not only to Brazil but to other South American countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil 's navy meant that Argentina and other countries would increase theirs . The expected has happened . Argentina , which , as Dr. Inman reports , boasted at Santiago that she had not spent any money on armaments since 1911 , and that she had two school teachers to every soldier , has just voted $98,000,000 for military purposes to meet the Brazilian expansion . And for this terrible business South America holds us and our naval mission responsible . N the day the Court of the Canton of Vaux took up the case of the assassination of Vaslav Vorovski , So-viet envoy to the second Lausanne conference , by Maurice Conradi , a Swiss engineer , and his accomplice , Paul Polon-nine , the curtain was rung up on one of the most amazing farces in the history of jurisprudence . The seventeen-page acte d'accusation presented by the state prosecutor read , according to the correspondent of the London Daily Herald , more like a newspaper article excusing the prisoner than an indictment . He was commended for his " valiant con-duct " during the Russian civil war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisitioned  --  nationalized if you will , " and that " it is said that his uncle had been shot and an aunt had been massacred . " The fact of the killing seemed not to be in dispute . The murder was forgotten while the court became the scene for denouncing the Bolsheviki . Mlle. Edith Conradi , cousin of the prisoner , " simply dressed in a dark-blue costume with a black hat , told of her pitiful experiences . " M. Croisier declared that " if Conradi had asked him for money to assist him in committing the murder he would willingly have provided it . " Polonnine asserted he was ready to continue the fight against the " Reds , " even on terrorist lines . The defense made the point that the Bolsheviki had perpetrated many assassinations , and personified Conradi as " liberator of the world 's conscience . " The jury voted five to four for conviction , but the Swiss law requires a majority of six , and so the verdict stood that to kill a Soviet official is not murder . T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States to lecture . Germany has too often sent to this country representatives of a past with which Americans have little sympathy . Professor SchulzeGaevernitz has long fought for liberalism in Germany , in his sympathetic studies of contemporary England and in his advocacy of a peaceful policy of free trade , as a popular lecturer at Freiburg University and as a member of the Reichstag . During the war he courageously opposed the Belgian deportations and was singled out for abuse by Ludendorff . Since the war he has continued to plead , from his post on the edge of the Black Forest , for sanity . He is a worthy successor to Count Harry Kessler , a true people 's ambassador . ICHOLAS I , the " Iron " Czar of Russia , feared attempts upon his life . In 1835 , before going to meet Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia , he composed a letter of instructions for his son , who later became Alexander II , the grandfather of the last czar . That letter became historic in the Romanoff family , and its doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in ready denunciation of the bolshevism which we refuse to recognize , the nature of that czarism with which we maintained such cordial relations . For in-stance : When everything shall be brought in order command the Council to be summoned to you , and declare that you absolutely require the preservation in everything of the existing state of affairs , without the smallest infringement . . . . At the beginning , when entering into affairs , ask how things were being done before you and do not change in anything , either persons or methods . .. and then , Rule . Be gracious and confiding to the troops and take care of them , but do not allow in the service what was not permitted formerly . Guard your sisters ; love them tenderly ; do your best for their future fate , uniting as far as possible their weal with the advantage of the state , of which they are the property . Never give the Poles their own way ; strengthen what has been begun , and try to complete the difficult task of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measures that have been taken . Go forward boldly . Great is the God of Russia . A NOTHER proverb has been disproved . More than a few do die ; now and then one even resigns . Of 435 candidates elected to the House of Representatives a year ago fifteen have already died . Three , moreover , have re-signed . Of ninety-six Senators elected or remaining for this Congress , three have died since election . Law-making seems to belong among the extra-hazardous callings like mining , aviation , and housebreaking ; we advise life insurance companies to accept no Congressman-elect as a risk . We have been wondering why we wait a year after the people have expressed their divine will before putting it into effect . Perhaps the above statistics contain the solution of the mystery . There are even cynics who insist that a longer interval , say five years , between election and the convocation of Congress , might offer a still greater advantage . T HE award of the Nobel Prize for literature to William Butler Yeats must be a source of genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Benavente , a mediocrity for whom international trumpets have been blown ; neither is he a writer whose works have the sort of actuante that commends them to the attention of the cultured crowd . He is a poet , primarily and even in his plays a lyrical poet . Nor are his strains loud and superficially compelling on the one hand , nor sophisticatedly and calculatedly original on the other . His idiom and his music are his own . But they are always the idiom and the music of essential poetry . That he is , by the consent of the judicious , the chief living poet of the Irish nation may have had something to do with the award . We prefer to believe that it was given out of a genuine appreciation of those murmuring and undeviatingly exquisite strains , that noble if not always full-bodied imagination , that deep , instinctive vision of the arts that compared them to venerable things God gave to men before he gave them wheat . T HE career of Dr. John Clifford , who has just died at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , shows that it is possible , even in these days , for a minister of religion to be a zealous champion of progressive political and social causes without falling short in any of his spiritual functions . Mr. Lloyd George once described him as the best fighting man the English Free Churches had turned out since Oliver Cromwell . In election campaigns the organizers of the Liberal Party would sometimes receive , from all parts of the country , more requests for the services of Dr. Clifford as a platform speaker than for those of any but the most popular of politicians . He led , in particular , the " passive-resistance " movement of those Nonconformists who refused to pay the local taxes imposed by the Balfour Government for the support of schools which gave a religious teaching according to the doctrines of the Established Church . But Dr. Clifford 's labors in the public field did not prevent him from ministering for over fifty years to the spiritual needs of a large London congregation , and during the whole of this period not a jarring note disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave school at the age of eleven , to work in a lace factory sometimes for sixteen or even twenty hours at a stretch , he never lost his sympathy with the victims of the industrial system , and his Liberalism was far removed from that of the laisser faire school . It was characteristic of him that one of his last public utterances was an impassioned protest against the contempt for idealism expressed in Lord Birkenhead 's rectoral address .
