Tim human machine is the oldest machine in industry , and in its fundamentals it is doubtless the same now as Then it was first put to work . The men of Menton , the Palaeolithic CroMagnons , with their flint blades and drills , their ingenious many-barbed hone harpoons , their needles and chisels ; the Egyptians who cut and hauled and lifted huge stones into the enduring pyramids ? all these human machines ingested and acquired energy from proteins and fats and carbohydrates , just as we do to-day . They , like us , inhaled oxygen and exhaled carbon dioxide ; they , too , needed vitamines , although they did not know it . Theirhearts beat then as ours do now ; they , too , possessed a blood-pressure , and varied it according to the needs of their organs ; their glands secreted ; their brains directed their muscles ; they spurted or loafed on their jobs ; they were ambitious or indifferent ; they labored and slept ; they loved and hated ; they sickened and died ? as do the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiological and psychological processes , it is a curious fact that , although in the recent centuries mankind has learned much about the parts of the human body and how they work , singly and in correlation , advance has been far less in exact knowledge of how the machine as a whole behaves . We know more about hygiene and sanitation than did our forefathers ; but of the best methods of getting the most out of our biological machinery we still know far too little . And this lack is especially striking when we put our machines into factories . The case is very different with the industrial machines of wood , of brass , of bronze , of iron or steel . One need not here dwell upon the obvious , which is almost miraculous . New ways of doing the old things have been devised , and new things to do . Each year millions of dollars are expended in improving the old and constructing the new , and searching after ways of performing industrial operations more cheaply and more effectively . These industrial machines have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialize its work ; they even surpass their makers in power to do specific things . Yet the human machine is lord of them all . When it ceases to work they stand idle . It is not strange that industry has been slow in learning and introducing ways of improving the efficiency of its workers . In the past , here and there , small attempts were made to solve the problem ; but they were not deep , and did not indicate how big and hard and important the problem was . And then the war came , with its unprecedented demands upon human energy , and the physiologists and psychologists began to investigate , ? in England , in America , in France , ? to find out how human beings in the factory actually work and how their efficiency may be increased . The seven years of continuous research that have now elapsed , coupled with what came before , have accomplished much . It has become clear that industry in the past has muddled through this part of its job , and that now the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . A great step i industrial progress will be taken whei we learn the human machine adequatel ; and learn how to use it . The human machine differs Iron other industrial machines in several im portant particulars . In the first place , it can perform a great variety of work . Then , too , it has a large capacity for training . But , with all its possible work and possible train . ing , most human machines possess in. nate qualities , difficult to analyze , but becoming less and less difficult to de . tect , by which they can do certain kinds of work more readily than otter kinds ; and thus the possibility arises of classifying the workers and assigning them to appropriate jobs . In the RI this has usually been a rather hap. hazard affair . The employment alter , or his representative , looked the applicant over , asked him a few guess tions , and ' sized him up ' ; but to ? elay , from careful study of the various mu . pations and their specific requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , computing and other machine operators , toolmakers , in. spectors of various manufactured prod . nets , moulders , mechanical engineers , salesmen , telephone operators , clerical workers , and others . Such tests en . deavor to determine , and express in mathematical terms , the fitness of the applicant for the specific work in ( pies . tion . The validity of many of them has been demonstrated by rigid trials They are constantly being improved and added to . No tests are infallible : but there can be no question of the superiority of a test that has been in. telligently devised , wisely given , and successfully employed in numerous cases , over the old method of ' hire and fire . ' Vocational guidance , by means of such tests , is gradually overcomug skepticism , prejudice , and opposition , and is aiding innumerable human beings to find their proper setting . Another peculiarity of the human machine is that it can not work long before becoming fatigued . Fatigue is usually manifested by certain characteristic feelings ? a disinclination to t continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to work more slowly . If the person refuses to be t guided by these feelings , the original pace may be kept up for a considerable time ; but , if he yields to them , the pace slackens , and gradually less is ac-c complished . Sooner or later he must yield to them , unless his machinery is ; to be seriously injured . Thus , fatigue is a signal of ultimate danger to the 5 mechanism . Biologists have devoted years to the investigation of fatigue , the ways in which it manifests itself , its causes , and means for its detection and alleviation . A few years ago an ingenious German doctor thought that he had found the secret , by the discovery of a fatigue is toxin , ? like bacterial toxins , ? whirls produces its own antitoxin . This anti ' toxin was claimed to do wondrous things when taken internally , in tablet ' form , or even when sprayed by an atomizer into the air of a schoolroom ? and , if a schoolroom , why not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the discoverer pro-. lected himself by patents in Washing-Ion and elsewhere ; but , unfortunately , the laboratories do not confirm the claims of the Patent Office . With continued investigation the problem of fatigue still eludes the searcher . As each new effort is made to soh e it , what appeared simple years ago t seems only to increase in complexity . I , am inclined now to believe that there is ' , I nothing specific about the condition which , for convenience , we call fatigue ; that it has no single , or even simple , causative factors ; but that the fatigued body is in a very different chemical , and perhaps physical , state from that of the unfatigued body , and that to restore the non-fatigued condition there are needed profound chemical , and perhaps physical , changes . As to the manifestations of fatigue , and tests for its presence , we are almost equally in the dark . It is simple enough under the easily controlled conditions of a laboratory , where one can take apart a living mechanism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progressively diminishing working capacity of active cells . A muscle fatigues rapidly ; a nerve-ending fatigues rapidly ; a nerve-fibre resists fatigue . But with the fatigue of the body as a whole , the problem of its analysis becomes infinitely more intricate . There are certain differences in the chemical activities of the resting and the working body ; but definite amounts of chemical change have not been correlated with definite amounts of work accomplished . The same is true of physical changes . Studies of the mental capacities of individuals in the fresh and the fatigued state have been legion ; but different investigators have obtained such different results , and a positive finding by one has been contradicted so often by a negative finding by another , that the subject is now a maze of bewildering uncertainty . But , notwithstanding the difficulties , ? which will , of course , not be forever insurmountable , ? there are indirect ways of demonstrating objectively the fatigue of the human body . Compare , for example , its diurnal curve of work with that of a machine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is turned on and the pace is set , the work goes on uniformly from hour to hour ; the output of each succeeding hour , and of the final hour of the spell or the day , 56 THE PHYSIOLOGIST IN INDUSTRY is no greater and no less than that of the first hour ; in other words , the diurnal curve of work is a horizontal line , neither rising nor falling from beginning to end . With the human machine the form of the curve depends on the nature of the operation . It can not always be plotted . For example , I have no means of expressing graphically my own curve in writing this article for the Atlantic , although Trollope , with his two hundred and fifty words every quarter-hour , rain or shine , might possibly have clone so for Barchester Towers . But where , as in many factory operations , the day 's work consists of a series of similar neuromuscular actions , repeated over and over again , perhaps hundreds and thousands of times , and the product can be measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotting the diurnal curve of the individual is a simple matter . If the operation is what may be called a ' machine ' operation , where the pace is set by the lifeless mechanism and the living being is merely an accessory , he , too , can work along a horizontal line . But , if it is a physiolog ical ' operation , when the worker is free , within limits , to choose his own pace , and when he so uses his forces that , as he leaves the factory at night , he can honestly feel that he has accomplished a real day 's labor , his curve of work from hour to hour reflects his physiological state . As physiological states differ , curves of work differ ; nevertheless , certain curves are habitual . Such , for example , is the diurnal curve of many operators performing dexterous handwork in a certain American brass-factory , which maintained a ten-hour day of two shifts , equal in length and separated by an hour for luncheon . The day 's work began well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . But it was surpassed during the second hour by nine per cent , and a still higher figure , the maximum of the day , was reached during the third hour of the morning . Then the work fell off , slightly during the fourth , more rapidly during the fifth , hour ; and when the workers went to their luncheon , they were accost . plishing scarcely more than at the beginning of the morning spell . Their curve of work for the forenoon thus showed a rise up to the day 's maximum , followed by a fall . These two phases , which are very common , are usually ascribed , the first to the favorable action of practice , the second to the unfavorable action of fatigue . Since , however , practice and fatigue are two antagonistic factors , continually present , it might be more correct to say that the rise of the cane represents the preponderant action of practice , the fall the preponderant tic . tion of fatigue . The luncheon hour gave an opportu. nity for the workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovering from their fatigue , they were losing the beneficial effect of practice . The curve of the afternoon spell repeated the main features of that of the morning , rising at first and then falling ; but each hour , except the first , was characterized byless production than the corresponding hour of the forenoon ; while the final , and tenth , hour was marked by a great fall of the curve , representing the least work of the day . Thus , if we are to judge from the output , not only was fatigue indicated in the latter part of each spell of five hours , but there appeared greater fatigue in the afternoon as compared with the morning , and the greatest fatigue of the whole day in the final hour of work . In those operations of this factory which made special demands on the muscles of the workers , and where fatigue might perhaps be expected to be more pronounced than in dexterous operations , the fall in both spells was greater , and the terminal lowest point was lower , than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final hour of muscular work amounted to only sixtyi three per cent of that of the maximum . The luncheon hour was characterized by a marked recovery of working power ? an excellent demonstration of the restorative action of food . This same factory , which was en , gaged during the war in the manufacture of explosive shells , maintained at ; the time a night-shift of twelve hours , ' and the curve of the night-workers was also plotted . It , too , revealed practice and fatigue effects during both spells , but its most striking feature was a tremendous and sharp fall at the end of the shift , between 5 and 6.40 A.M. , almost no production , indeed , occurring ; during the final forty minutes . The output of the human machine , unlike that of the non-living mechan ' ism , is increased by occasional rests . Tine benefits of the luncheon hour are ; obvious ; but many facts demonstrate ; that other resting periods are not , in the end , mere lost time . The big burly ; stupid Schmidt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled by his foreman to sit down and rest for a it few minutes after every ten or twenty pigs , and his day 's record of loading was increased from twelve and one-half to forty-seven tons , the accomplishment giving a great boost to the so-called scientific management ' of his day . It must be allowed , in this instance , that other factors besides periodic rests may have contributed to Schmidt 's achievement . By introducing a ten-minute recess into the forenoon and the afternoon spell of a ten-hour day , ex- perienged American munition-workers increased their average day 's total output in different operations by one , three , eight , eighteen , and even twenty-six per cent . Both American and British observers report other instances of the improvement following the adoption of enforced brief resting-periods . It is not only the school child who benefits from recesses : it is the adult as well . The human machine abhors monotony , as nature abhors a vacuum . It must have change . If it has been sitting , it most stand ; if standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance and take food and read newspapers ? anything that will turn nerve and blood-currents into new channels ; that will make overactive cells rest , and torpid cells active . The English cup of tea might be established in our American factories with profit . The most advantageous number and duration of industrial recesses and the ways in which workers should use them probably differ in different occupations and with different workers . However these details may be decided in individual cases , observations seem to justify the general conclusions , that no one may be expected to work advantageously for a period of five continuous hours without a break , and that systematic recesses are superior to those that are taken voluntarily . The working of the human machine is affected by various physical factors in its environment . One of these is air , and the modern science of ventilation shows what qualities good air possesses . In extreme cases air may be rendered impure by poisonous chemical substances produced in manufacturing operations , which men and women can not long breathe without detriment . But under ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chemical contamination , but to a rise of temperature , a rise of humidity , and a lack of motion . The human motor , like other motors , generates much heat , and must be continually air-cooled if its temperature is not to rise to a detrimental degree . I once placed a healthy young man in a chamber large enough to enable him to sit comfortably , and supplied him with abundant , but still , air at an average temperature of one hundred and two degrees , Fahrenheit , and an average relative humidity of ninety-one per cent . In two hours his bodily temperature had risen from ninety-eight and six tenths to one hundred and four and four tenths degrees . At the end of a three hours ' inspection of the various processes in one of our leading steel plants I found that my own temperature had risen from normal to one hundred and two degrees . Exposure to air of a high temperature and high humidity is debilitating . Professor Scott and I observed that the muscles of animals which had been subjected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-one degrees , and an average relative humidity of ninety per cent , were capable of performing only seventy-six per cent of the work of other animals living at sixty-nine degrees of temperature and fifty-two per cent of humidity . In certain Welsh factories manufacturing tin-plate , the amount of production was observed to show a seasonal variation , being greatest in the cool winter months and least in the summer ; but the summer reduction was markedly less in those factories which were equipped with good ventilating systems . In an American automobile factory , sixty-eight departments were found to have undesirable physical conditions . The records here revealed that the requests of the operators for trans fer from one job to another were most numerous , and the labor turnover was greatest , in connection with those operations that were characterized by heat , smoke , fumes , and other features of bad air . The number of daily absences from work in this air was exceeded only in those operations that involved excessive noise . The number of headaches reported to the company 's hospital , while greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less where bad lighting occurred . Thus the human machine is affected en . favorably by certain physical features in its environment . To secure its high . est efficiency these should be eliminated . IV The human machine is quite capable of wasting its forces . To sit instead of stand is often allowed by the nature of the job , and is physiologically econom. ical ; but sitting in a strained position is not economical . There is always a best bodily position for each worker for his occupation at the moment , and it should be discovered and established To adapt chair and bench to his needs is a simple help toward the efficiency of his mechanism . A change of bodih position is often economical . As I write these pages , I usually stand at a high desk ; but occasionally I sit or move about . The human machine , too , often wastes energy by making needless , re ? productive motions . These may he due to the placing of the working-materials in an inconvenient position . A bricklayer , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure of less energy for each square yard , if his bricks are not thrown indiscrinu. nately on the platform on which he is standing , ? an arrangement which cessitates his stooping over to pick up each brick , ? but are piled on a bench at the height of his wall and convenient to his hand . Even when working-materials have been most advantageously placed , the worker often ? perhaps it may be , aid , usually ? makes needless motions . How to reduce these to the least possible number , to confine his movements as far as possible to those that are actually productive , has been the endeavor of time-and-motion study ' for nearly fifty years , ever since Frederick Taylor began to tamper with the traditional tactics of the steel fackory . The simplest method of disi covering unnecessary motions is just i seeing them ; but it does not take the discoverer very far , and it may lead tine astray . Observation and comparii son of the ways of the best workers in performing the same operation ; analyI sis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the stop-watch in measuring the duration of the parts and the whole , were early employed with advantage . But more scientific methods were demanded , and the increasing complexity of the aids to analysis may be best indicated by a list of the varieties of their apparatus arranged in chronological and neologi ieal order : kymograph , cinematograph , cyclegraph , stereocyclegraph , stereochronocyclegraph , and **26;342;TOOLONG . I trust that the reader will not be I repelled by these names . Chemistry can do worse . The man of science is rarely a linguist , and the language of science can be far from mellifluous . It is not necessary to explain these instru1 meats . Suffice it to say that they have all been employed in recording the motions made by the fingers , hands , arms , or other parts of human machines , in a great variety of industrial / operations , for the purpose of enabling an observer to follow through a com- plea motion ? human motions are usually complex ? from beginning to end , and to consider how it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how the machine may be taught to confine itself to those that are really essential to the end in view . The graphic curve made by one of these instruments from an untrained worker may appear , for all the world , like a seismographic record of a terrestrial disturbance ; yet a few weeks of training and practice in more economical methods may change it into a graceful succession of a few rhythmic lines , representative of a few effective neuromuscular efforts . The usual result of time-and-motion study has been to increase the output of the worker . Thus , by elimination and combination , the traditional eighteen motions made by the mason in laying a brick were reduced to one and three quarters ; and , instead of one hundred and twenty , he could lay three hundred and fifty bricks in the hour ; four hundred dozen pieces of cotton cloth were folded , each with ten or twelve motions , where formerly twenty to thirty motions were required for each of one hundred and fifty dozen pieces ; a girl was able to wrap with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had previously wrapped in forty , seconds ; a clerk , whose motions were reduced from thirteen to six , was able to open two hundred , instead of one hundred , letters in an hour ; and numerous similar examples might be cited . Even when output is merely maintained and not increased by the modified method , there is an advantage , in a lessened expenditure of energy . There are dangers in the elimination of unnecessary motions . There is the danger of excessive speed and drive and over-fatigue . There is the danger of spoiled work . There is the danger of assuming that the fewest motions neces- 60 THE PHYSIOLOGIST IN INDUSTRY sadly constitute the most effective method . There is the danger of assuming that all workers can most profitably perform a given operation in exactly the same manner . There is the danger of crushing initiative . But all these may be avoided by an intelligent , sympathetic director , who realizes that a misuse of the newer method will , in the end , defeat the object of improving the efficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will greatly aid this object . V A paramount distinction of the human machine , in comparison with machines of metal , is that it is the seat of instincts and emotions , and its reaction toward the call of its work is modified by them . During the war American munition factories displayed patriotic posters on their walls , and records of their previous week 's high production , and invited stirring speakers to give five-minute talks to their workers , in order to stimulate a still greater output . I once watched a lively game of football between teams of healthy , ruddy , English munition girls during the noon hour , and I could not doubt that the afternoon work of both players and lookers-on was bettered by it . There is , no doubt , a swirl of conflicting emotions within a striking workman 's body , when the pleading of his wife and children for food turns him toward the factory , and at its door he is greeted by the call of ' scab ' from his fellows . A worker may have ambition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of his union may induce him to stereotype his production at the level of the mass ; but , if the temporary stoppage of the machinery threatens a loss of his piece-wages for the day , he may spurt to more than double his usual pace . It was the cus tom in a certain American factory to stop work for a quarter of an hour every Thursday , to distribute the weekly pay-envelopes . This markedly increased the output ? in one opera . tion thirty-nine per cent ? either before or after the interruption . The tradition of the least work and the largest pay may be strong with the worker . The labor turnover in the de . partment of a hated foreman is apt to be large . Suspicion and distrust of employers , whether justified or not , are often habitual . In the many phases of what has unfortunately been named welfare work , ' some workers find real mental and physical blessings , while others see only paternalism , an invasion of private rights , and diabolical de . vices for drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tools as he does himself . One may be a dull plodder , capable or incapable ; another may be emotionally unstable , ' quick to respond to good and to bad influences . Instincts are mainsprings of human industrial action , and a sagacious one . lyst has classified them into instincts of workmanship , ownership , self-asser. tion , submissiveness , curiosity , play , pugnacity , sex , the parent , and the herd . Wisely directed , they may be . come forceful aids to efficiency : led astray , they may disorganize and oh struct . It is probable that emotional instability is one of the potent factors in the industrial unrest that has foils lowed the war . VI These peculiarities of the human at . chine , which I have been picturing , are not merely academic matters , of physiological and psychological interest only : they throw light upon some of the vital problems of labor . What , for example , should he the length of the working day ?  --  a mooted question for more than a hundred i. years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and English humanitarians contended that a man 's factory was not his castle , into which the king could not enter . It is a fact beyond doubt that , from the stand . point of accomplishment by the human machine and its conservation , the day should tend toward brevity rather than length . It is , indeed , true that , if large production in a brief time is the object sought , it is physically possible to quicken the pace , drive the machine dreadfully , and force it to turn out more goods . So can a flivver be rushed at a reckless rate ; but the wise rarely - drive it so . Most employers of labor naturally desire a continued large production . A few examples may be cited to show how , i this has been obtained in specific in , stances . In 1900 the famous Zeiss ' Optical Works of Jena reduced its t . vorking-clay from nine to eight hours , without lowering its rate of piece ' wages , with a resulting increase of 16.2 per cent in the hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings of its men . The shortening of the day of the bitumous coal-miners in Illinois , from ten o eight hours , was followed by an indease of the average amount of coal nined daily by each man from 2.72 to S.16 tons . At the Engis Chemical : Perks , in Belgium , it was found that he same workers at the same furnaces rich the same tools and raw material traduced in seven and one-half hours is much as I hey had been producing in en hours . The employees in an Engis ) ) hoot-and-shoe factory maintained it forty-eight weekly hours their former nit put of fifty-five and one-half hours  - -  an achievement that could hardly be : scribed solely to the free cup of tea trovided by the company at ten in the norning and three in the afternoon . During the war some carefully con- trolled measurements were made of the relation between actual working hours and the output of workers engaged in various occupations involved in the manufacture of fuses for explosive shells . When the weekly hours of men sizing fuse-bodies were reduced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased nineteen per cent ; when the hours of women turning fuse-bodies were reduced from 66 to 47.5 , there was an increase of total output of thirteen per cent ; and when the hours of women milling screw-threads were cut from 64.9 to 48.1 , total output fell by the trifling amount of one per cent . It is significant that , of all these three operations , that of sizing fuse-bodies , in which there was the greatest improvement in production , was the one in which the physiological element was most prominent , while in that of milling screw-threads , with its slight loss , the pace of the worker was largely dependent upon that of her milling machine . Here are two authentic instances of what happened when overtime was added to a customary day 's work . While the employees of the Zeiss Optical Works were still doing their regular nine hours , one hour was added , in view of the coining Christmas rush of trade . There was an immediate increase in production , and hopes were high ; but within a month hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a level not determinable , the latter to that of the original nine-hour day . So , too , the British tin-plate millmen , who , when transferred from eight-hour to six-hour shifts , increased their hourly output markedly , dropped again to their previous record on a return to the longer hours . These instances suffice to illustrate the peculiar ways of the human machine in its relation to length of labor . With a machine of soulless steel , decreased hours mean decreased produc- 62 THE PHYSIOLOGIST IN INDUSTRY tion ; with a machine of flesh and blood , decreased hours , within limits , mean increased production . It is difficult to make people believe this seeming paradox . Long hours maintained by a worker mean , in the end , one of two things : either a slow pace , or over-fatigue of his organism . If a slow pace occurs , the object of long hours is defeated . If over-fatigue occurs ? but , first , let us see what over-fatigue involves . It was shown in the laboratory long ago that fatigue does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , ? twice the work , twice the fatigue , ? but that additional work imposed upon an already fatigued individual is disproportionately more fatiguing , and a disproportionately longer time is then required for recuperation . The human machine is , it is true , constructed with a large margin of safety , and can often endure for a considerable time more than the usual calls on its working capacity . But , if over-fatigue occurs , the certain result of a maintenance of long hours is the laying aside of the machine . Yet change of personnel , labor turnover , is one of the most costly features of industrial administration . These fundamental physiological facts are overlooked too often by employers of labor , especially when emergencies arise . Then the first thought is for more working hours . A rush of orders , perishable fruit , too few hands ? familiar situations met by familiar procedures . Great Britain made the time-honored mistake in dealing with her factory workers in the early days of the war , when she imposed long hours , overtime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the greatest possible quantity of munitions in the shortest possible time . I think that I am not claiming too much credit for my professional brothers when I say that it was largely the physiologists who convinced th British Government of the fatal erro of its ways , and brought about return to a more rational way of utili zing the vast possibilities of its humar machines . When we turn from the general cos elusion that the working-day of tie human machine should tend toward brevity rather than length , and face the question of its actual duration , our difficulties increase . I can not coned e that a twelve-hour day of continuous labor continuously repeated can ever be physiologically economical . Nor can I conceive that a six-hour day would nor make excessive physiological demands upon those who are physiologicalk fitted to maintain their places in Indus . try . Vernon , an English physiologist of wide experience in the study of factory laborers , and of wide knowledge of the present status of industrial physiology , has suggested as a tentative schen , : that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the working-day or the textile worker , whose occupation is largely connected with machine opera . tions , might be fixed at nine or ten hours ; that of the worker who combines manual skill and strength with mm chinery , at eight hours ; and that of such a manual laborer as the coal . miner , at seven hours . Whether this be accepted or not , I think it is fair to maintain that , in endeavoring to decide upon the proper length of the day , consideration should be given , first , to the physiological aspect of the matter . The integrity of the physiological mechanism should first be assured . It results from this that , from the physiological point of view alone , the endeavor to establish a working-day of universal applicability , appropriate to all occupations and all individuals , is an unscientific procedure . Whether it might seem best , from the economic and the sociological stand . points , to equalize the dissimilar physiological days , is hardly a question for the physiologist . VII It was Dr. Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedation from happiness . In its long t artery , industry has been guilty of many deviations from nature . To me here is always something uncanny in ' he sight of men flocking to the faccries when darkness is coming on . I ' , rave never known a night-watchman , ho was habitually jovial . It is true that an appreciable part of the work of die world is performed at night ; and ! . i , et nature seems never to have ini ended man to make of himself a nocI urnal animal . His bodily temperature , ! ! - diich has its source in the chemical lunges within his 1 issues , falls steadily hrough the night , and reaches its arrest ebb in the early morning hours ; , and even the night-watchman , who has i. pent years in his lonely service , can not ! torn the clinical thermometer to be-ha ? e differently . Exact measurements of the output of hay-workers and of night-workers on similar jobs show that the latter habitnily produce less ? two , six , ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat groups under observation . Where , corkers shift every fortnight from clay Ito night , and again from night to day , the depressing effect of the night 's labor is more evident in the second week of the night-shift than in the first , and is yen carried over into the subsequent i rst week of the day-shift . I have already mentioned the enormous fall during the morning hours in be output of men working through a web &hour; night . These are the least 5 : , roductive hours of all . The early , , , , , torning is the time when nature asrts herself . Of a squad of seventy- four of these men tinder the scrutiny of an observer , two thirds were found sleeping at different times between 3.30 and 6.30 A.M. Operations that required twelve seconds for performance in the evening , when the gang was fresh , now required more than seventeen seconds . Continuous night-workers lose more time from their work than continuous day-workers . Night-workers are less strong muscularly than day-workers ; but we do not yet know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night into day . The attempt to turn night into day is , however , essentially unphysiological . The human machine rebels against it , even if the human will may not . VIII The considerable body of knowledge concerning the ways of the industrial worker , which has now been accumulated , and from which I have drawn freely in the present paper , has been contributed by several countries , and the greatest advance has been since the Great War began to make its excessive demands upon human energies . The unparalleled call for munitions of all kinds early began to draw tense the nerves of Englishmen , and to make them wonder whether industry could carry on to the end . This doubt , too , was expressed later by a clear-thinking Frenchman , who wrote : ' A nation finds itself to-day in danger of defeat , not because it does not know how to fight , but because it does not know how to manufacture . ' In 1915 , Mr. Lloyd George , then Minister of Munitions , was induced to appoint a **26;370;TOOLONG Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both employers and employees , and public servants ; and a systematic scientific investigation of many of the urgent problems was begun , leading to numerous valuable reports and recommendations . Toward the close of the war the Committee was replaced by another body , the Indus .. trial Fatigue Research Board , also under government auspices and with similar functions , at whose head was Professor Sherrington , Oxford physiologist , eminent for his investigations into the nervous system , and now advanced to knighthood and the presidency of the Royal Society . In 1921 there was incorporated a third body , the National Institute of Industrial Psychology , founded for the application of psychology and physiology to Industry and Commerce , ' whose director is Dr. Myers , for many years Director of the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory . These bodies , led by Great Britain 's leading men of science , have been ably assisted by men prominent in British industry ; money has been contributed ; skilled investigators have been employed ; the factories of the United Kingdom have been widely opened for study ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1917 the United States Public Health Service recognized the industrial stress of the war , and with the aid of American men of science organized an intensive and comparative investigation of two of the leading factories , which were busy with war industries , and together were employing nearly fifty-thousand workers . The main report of this research has been published , and subsidiary reports either have been already issued or are still in progress . In the United States , too , contributions have come from private and from university laboratories , and from the laboratories of certain fact , ries where the counsels of men of wic vision prevail . France also has , in Paris , its invest gative body , the Institut Lannelongth Spain has , in Barcelona , its Institu d'OrientaciO Professional . Even befor the enemy had left Belgium , plans In the some-time reestablishment of he industries were beginning to be formed and a commission was sent to tlii country and England to learn of tit methods of industrial organization use and in prospect . Italy , Sweden Canada , and Japan are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ways of looking at the industrial worker . In all of these activities , whether investigative or informational , there have been , as in all things seien. tific , free international cooperation and exchange . But achievement imposes obligation . Finality is never reached in scientific research . The investigator is lost ste closes his mind to change . No scienet except that of the charlatan , springs full-armed from any head . The prop . ress that has been made has been gran . fying , but the most gratifying feature of it all is the vision that it brings of future progress . Of all biological or . ganisms , the human body is the most difficult to investigate ; yet I am col. dent that at last we have found the right path to the way of the worker ; that in a few years the fashion in which the employer deals with his living ma. chines will be fundamentally changed ; and that again it will be shown , as it has been shown so many times m hu . man affairs , that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
