The new Earl of Oxford and Asquith , Julian Edward George , now a child of eleven years , sat round-eyed and attentive in a gallery overlooking a huge , oblong , Gothic room . Below , the House of Commons was somberly proceeding to honor the little boy 's grandfather , great onetime Prime Minister Asquith ( 1908-16 ) , the Earl of Oxford and Asquith , who had just died . <P> The child sat mouse-still . Possibly he was awed by the nearby presence of his widowed " grandmama , ' ' famed Margot Asquith . Perhaps , on the other hand , he was now and then whisperingly reminded not to squirm by his mother . She is Mrs. Raymond Asquith , widow of the late statesman 's eldest son , who was killed in action in 1916 . Whether she whispered or " Margot " frowned , the eleven-year-old heir &; Earl listened with exemplary gravity , last week , while Prime Minister Baldwin and onetime Prime Ministers Lloyd George &; Ramsay MacDonald declaimed funereally from the floor of the House . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legend that the new little Earl is a descendant of " Little Jack Horner " on his mother 's side . She was Miss Katharine Horner , and her paternal progenitor was that James ( " Jack " ) Horner who was Steward to the rich Abbot of Glastonbury in the days of Henry VIII . <P> Amid troublous times the Abbot secreted certain valuable deeds in a vast meat pie . Treacherous Steward " Jack " Horner filched and stole them out . Later this bold deed was totally emasculated in a nursery rhyme : <P> Little Jack Horner <P> Sat in a corner Eating a Christmas pie . <P> He stuck in his thumb <P> And pulled out a plum Then cried " What a good boy am I ! " <P> Today the property of Wells Manor , Glastonbury , believed to have been mentioned in the deeds stolen by " Jack " Horner , is still owned by the Horner family . <P> Of the Parliamentary tributes paid , last week , to the late Herbert Henry Asquith , Earl of Oxford and Asquith , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Laborite who had fought Liberal Prime Minister Asquith , Mr. MacDonald said : " He was the last of what Victorians meant by great parliamentarians-men of leisure and culture , formality and dignity , learning and catholicity . . . . He was a sturdy champion whose mellow mind and rich , sonorous oratory so often lulled our watchful intelligence to sleep . We gave him our applause forgetful of the gulfs that separated us and of all the challenges that would presently be thrown by us at him when the magic of his oratory ceased to operate . " <P> Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin concluded the ceremonies in the Commons by moving adjournment for one day . <P> Throughout the week , interest focused on David Lloyd George , now Liberal leader , but long estranged from Asquith . What would he say ? Would he conceal his pleasure at being left alive to dominate alone throughout the Liberal sphere ?
