Headliner last week at the Keith Vaudeville Palace , Manhattan , was Emma Calv , billed " The Beloved Diva " and " The World 's Greatest Carmen , " serving on the same bill with such as Stan Kavanagh ( Austrian juggler ) , Naughton &; Gold ( funny ones ) , B. A. Rolfe ( Mighty Melodist of the Trumpet ) , Frank Evers &; Greta ( tightrope dancers ) . <P> The Palace entertained strangers at her 14 performances : some who remembered the Cavalleria at the Metropolitan Opera 34 years ago when Calve made her debut ; some who had seen her first Carmen , a slim , sensual hoyden who attracted 15 sold-out houses in a single season . No words were too dear for her then . The late Henry Theophilus Finck of the New York Evening Post has said : " She had everything in her favor that a fairy could possibly bestow on an operatic artist : a beautiful and amazingly expressive face ; a voluptuous figure , with a rare grace of movement ; a voice which , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensuously , as Patti 's and infinitely more soulful ; a skill for acting realistically which amounted to genius , often making one forget the superlative beauty of her voice ; and the supreme gift of magnetism . " Henry Edward Krehbiel , his rival on the Tribune , accorded her " the most sensational triumph ever achieved by any opera or singer . " In Europe it was the same . She sang for the Tsar , for the Sultan , for the Empress Eugenie , the Kings of Sweden and Greece . Queen Victoria entertained her at Windsor and Balmoral , had a marble bust made by her own royal order so that the Great Calve should be remembered at Windsor for all time . <P> Few were prepared last week for the wide woman draped in metal cloth who fluttered on at the Palace , bowed low as if for great applause , smiling . Now , at 62 , there was little voice , little vitality for a Troubadour song , for d'Hardelet 's " Lesson of the Fan , " for " Swanee River " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and music by herself , dedicated to Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh . " L'amour est une oiseau rebelle . . . . " The customers at the Palace sat alert for the " Habanera " of the World 's Greatest Carmen , but the high comb would not stay in the thin bobbed hair , and the flaming shawl was strangely dull . True there was a hint of the old gestures , the old fire , but the Palace audience could not remember , saved their applause for Naughton &; Gold , funny indeed , for the triple-tonguing of Trumpeter Rolfe and his slapstick jazz players . <P> Madame Calv will now tour on the Keith circuit .
