The Chilean Naval Ministry at Santiago announced , last week , withholding all details , that the transport Anagamos sank with the loss of 291 lives , after running upon a rock near Point Nordhuila , and that Captain Corbeta Ismael Suarez not only did not leave his ship but committed suicide upon the bridge . <P> A survivor , Jos Aguila , babbled : " lost our rudder and were dashed between two great rocks . . . waves 30 feet high . . . every lifeboat sank ... we fought for bits of floating timber ... I was knocked senseless and flung by the waves stark naked on the beach . ... I and a few others were saved only because God is great ! "
