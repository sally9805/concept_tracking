The stubborn , powerful intrusion of an extraneous issue into piddling proceedings of the Ninth Assembly of the League of Nations , last week , spurred flagging interest and set in the spotlight of world fame a new figure : Hermann Mller , the socialist , the dry , spectacled , sohoolteacherish Chancellor of the German Republic ( TIME , June 25 et seq . ) . <P> Herr Mller came to Geneva last fortnight with the avowed purpose of forcing League statesmen out into the open with respect to Germany 's long unheeded demands for speedy evacuation of the Rhineland by France and her Allies . Properly speaking , this matter is no concern of the League , but of the Conference of Ambassadors at Paris . However , the veteran , major League statesman , M. Aristide Briand , French Foreign Minister , is also President of the Conference of Ambassadors . Therefore Hermann Mller was knocking at the door of Headquarters , last week in Geneva , when he strolled down the Lake to Aristide Briand 's hotel ( always the Bergues ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowed the Ninth Assembly . <P> Eventually the German wrung from the Frenchman a promise to convene a " Rhineland Conference " of the interested powers at Geneva , within a few days . Cautious M. Briand warned that the " conference " must not be considered more than a " petite reunion " ; but no phraseology could conceal that it would mark the first real coming-to-grips between Germany and the Allies upon one of the most vital post-War issues . <P> Interest mounted still higher , when Chancellor Mller intimated in the strongest terms that he does not propose to barter important financial considerations for immediate evacuation of the Rhineland ; but rather to demand , under a slightly ambiguous clause of the Versailles Treaty , that occupation shall either cease without compensation as a matter of moral right , or give way to a temporary policing of the Rhineland by a Commission made up of representatives of the Neutral Nations . <P> While keeping the iron of this project hot and ready to strike , pedantic Hermann Mller found time to favor the Assembly with an address in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one really disarmed state in Europe and that " the League of Nations may count itself a failure , if it does not bring other nations to disarm . " <P> Leagophiles Salon . The Villa Bartheloni in Geneva , once sacred to Mrs. Woodrow Wilson , is occupied this September by a tall , gracious woman who presided last week over a sort of international salon of Leagophiles , particularly U. S. Leagophiles . <P> The lady of the salon is Mrs. Florence Guertin Tuttle , widow of a Manhattan &; Brooklyn coal tycoon , and chairman of the Greater New York division of the League of Nations Non-Partisan Association . She it is who blandishes and argues into Leagophilia as many potent Manhattan males as possible and whole flocks of females-particularly Junior Leaguers , who may later influence potent husbands .
