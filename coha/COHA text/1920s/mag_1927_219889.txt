The Oklahoma Senate , officially but not individually , declined to continue the embarrassment of Governor Henry Simpson Johnston when it voted , 26 to 23 , to table a resolution demanding the dismissal of Mrs. O. O. Hammonds , executive secretary and confidential adviser of the Governor ( TIME , March 7 ) . Talk , however , still comes out of Oklahoma concerning the Governor 's matronly secretary with whom he is said to plumb spiritualism , occultism , Rosicrusianism . The latest report is that she calls the Democratic State Chairman her errand boy . Meanwhile her husband , Dr. Hammonds , churchgoer from Okmulgee , enjoys pay as State Commissioner of Health .
