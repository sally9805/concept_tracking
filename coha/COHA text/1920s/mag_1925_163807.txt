Not in bell trousers or raccoon coat , not in three-cornered hat or prismatic necktie , but like a well-dressed politician in spats , Mr. Nicholas Longworth received a solemn delegation of men , all of whom he acknowledged as his brothers . They brought him a little wooden thing . Mr. Longworth smirked appreciatively and thrust out a hand interlocking his fingers with theirs in a way that is not to be described in public . Then one of his four brothers gave vent to speech : <P> " It is a pleasure and an honor to the fraternity to present to you this gavel . It is not intrinsically a treasure nor is it a battle axe to rule the unruly . Rather , it is a symbol of the devotion , respect and affection of Dekes throughout the United States for a great Deke and gallant gentleman who is assuming the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives . It is an expression of our confidence in the worthiness with which the office of Speaker will be administered in the 69th Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a man , now and forever . " <P> *Delta Kappa Epsilon , a national fraternity with chapters at many colleges in the U. S. and Canada .
