The clearing where it stands is not large . You may see the great trees that mark its farther boundary a few hundred feet ahead . The high jungle wall con ? tinues all around in a sweeping curve until it comes back on either hand to where you stand and meets above the path . The sun is here . It stamps out broken patterns on the pounded brown earth between the many trees that have been left . The little houses cluster half in shadow , half in sun . They are part of the forest . They would be tiny anywhere , but here against the jungle they seem like playthings . Yet they arc singularly fitting . No human thing could rival the trees . It would be a vain impertinence . The huts are con ? tent to belong . No house is quite like its neighbor . Each roof slopes sharply , but some touch the ground on either side , while others stop at straight walls that rise many feet from the earth . The roofs are made of a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cornered by stout uprights hewn laboriously from some orange-tinted tree , and are sealed with a close wattle of the same palm branches as the roof-thatch . Here the dried fronds are skill ? fully woven into a tight basketry . Each house has a single entrance ? a breast-high doorway . Usually the panels that surround the door are carved in exquisite relief to resemble the lovely curves the vines make among the trees . The roofs of some houses extend a yard or so be ? yond the door and make a porch where the old men sit for their long palavers . One house in the clearing is always larger than the others . It is built more sturdily , and the carvings that decorate it are more beautifully executed . This is the headman 's hut . He has con ? structed his own mansion , helped by no one outside of his own family . The headman can do such things ? that is why he is ruler of his town ? he is better than his fellows . Not far away from the granmaa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This second but is not nicely built . It wants mending near the corners and the thatch is threadbare and loose with long weathering . This is where the witch-man lives . Drums , pots , strange sticks , and white patches on the ground where the milk of the pimpa-toti stone has spilled tell you the house is his . Small wonder it is untidy . The witch-men have more vital concerns than house ? keeping ; they are wise in curious and more important ways ; it would be absurd if they wasted themselves on common ? place things . Inside the huts the heat is stifling . The doors are always kept tight shut and there is no other way for cool air to enter . But who would not prefer this slight discomfort to the unpleasantness of wild boars , jaguars , and a dozen other dangers that wander at night ? Besides , a house is primarily a place to store possessions . No one would think of wasting time indoors , day or night , that could be lived out under the canopy of sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? where little fires burn under big round sheets of iron on which the cassava cakes are baked . Here they sit all day long , nursing their babes , pounding rice . grinding flour , sweating agreeably . In the shade of the banana and bread-fruit trees that grow before the shed brown babies kick glee ? fully in the brown earth . They always rose and fled with blood-curdling yells when my wife and I , cork-helmeted outland baakraa , made our appearance unannounced . The babies had never seen such extraordinary and unpleasant apparitions before . Though of course one is wise in many things and walks and runs and eats anything at one year old , one is emphatically not familiar with the indecency of a traveler 's wife who wears trousers ! The traveler himself , with a glaring helmet and heavy knee boots , is nearly as alarming . He carries a little black instrument which he points with , no doubt , the fiercest designs upon fragile baby-spirits . The instrument is a bade raa camera , but that , if one only knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers and fathers of the village , with a few exceptions , seem untroubled , so the childrens ' fear soon merges into gaping curiosity . The women in the cook-shed go on with their work even though many of them have never seen white strangers before . We are expected . The tom-toms that drummed last night across the jungle warned all the villages of our coming . Long before our canoe reached the mud slope at the foot of the path to the town , these women and their men knew who we were and what was our strange and unprofitable business . The witch-men had broadcast in an hour of moonlight the news of our destination , what we wore and looked like . The entire dis ? trict knew our boatmen 's names . The whole tribe had been assured we came on a harmless mission . When we arrived in person we were visual curiosities only . We had long since ceased to be news . Bushnegro journalism shames the most valiant efforts of European and Ameri ? can press services . Within a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two thousand square miles of the impassable land . At last the headman rises from a Iow stool before his house and comes for ? ward , followed by several young men of the town . The granman is past middle years but he is erect and strong . His legs are con ? spicuously slender , but his back and arms and shoulders are magnificently developed . The young men are like him in this . It is because the Bushnegroes seldom walk . There are no paths ex ? cept the river path . In a canoe the legs do nothing while the arms and shoulders force the paddles into the stream . The headman wears nothing but a loincloth , made of patches of vari-colored calico sewed so as to juxtapose the brightest tints . His sable-brown body glistenswith clean good health . His chin is darkened with a meager frizzled beard , his graying hair is cut close to the scalp . His eyes are appraising and wise , but very gentle . His smile is welcoming . He greets the travelers as uncle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows . The young men are quietly cordial . They are mildly curious , but they do not really care one way or the other about us or our business . They have often seen white people at the big city down the river . They know outlanders are an unimportant lot who think they will die if they leave their hats off . Some of these young men are the granman 's sons . But they arc not members of their father 's family . The discovery was made in West Africa during the dawn of time that a strong man with strong sons provides a danger which may disrupt a whole society . The negroes ' philosophy teaches them that though a man may seek power in the jungle , he can never achieve it . The gods will soon be angry at the im ? pertinence and the ambitious one will die . But when widespread quarrels grow out of man 's ambition many inno ? cent ones also die , and afterwards still more souls are weary and go away , for in time of war the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tending . Then there is no food for a whole season . Nothing will have been gained and much will have been lost . Nature makes sure there will be no lasting hierarchy of a rivaling power . All this was foreseen and the social order formed accordingly . The wise men and women of the Bushnegroes of long ages ago formed laws that erect an impassable wall against the will-to ? power of men . They know that the strongest ambition is built of perishable stuff . No man will strive very hard to gather things and powers unto himself if he knows the whole structure of his effort will crumble away when he dies . Accomplishment is satisfying for a period ? but the effort falls at the prospect of utter vanity . Kings conquer for their princes , for in them they foresee eternity . The Suriname Bushnegroes believe this is true , so they have destroyed the danger of kings by divorcing the father from his children . The " matriarchal system , " as our awkward phrase has it , accom ? plishes this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society suffer in any way . The forest negro has , however , no dread of greatness if it be greatness of the spirit and the mind . Their systems allow for this sort , because the negro of the woods is wise enough to know that the thirst for the quiet supremacies of knowledge depends not at all upon the hope for the physical perpetuity which comes through sons . The works of the mind have public immortality , but it is otherwise with the deeds of warriors . The term " matriarchal system " is apt to be misleading . It is indeed if it carries the suggestion that women are the heads of Bushnegro society . They are not . Men hold all public offices , such as they are , and a man is head of the family , the clan , and the tribe . Women are simply the channels of inheritance . There lies the difference between the Bushnegro system and ours . The Bush ? negro recognizes the female as the via ? duct of life ? just as we do . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not entirely easy for us to understand . Monogamy is considered disgraceful . It is proof of incapacity . Each man may have many wives . The total of brides is limited only by the number a man is able to support ? and , still more , by the attractiveness of the gentleman himself . There is no coercion in Bush ? negro affairs of the heart . Marriage , however , does not relate a woman to her husband . Her only relatives are the people of her own family . A household which includes a man and his four wives is not one family . It is simply the temporary association of representatives of five families . Each wife 's children belong to her family ? the father hasno " legal " control over them whatso ? ever . Atoto , whom I know , is a Bushnegro . He respects and loves his father , but he is not related to him by any other ties . The head of Atoto 's family is his maternal grand-uncle ? his grand ? mother 's eldest brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chief of the family . Atoto , as is true of all Bushuegro sons , is an end-product of his family . The name will not continue through him . If only sons are born of a solitary Bushnegro daugh ? ter , the line ceases . But if there are many daughters and each gives birth to girl children , the family will continue forever . In that case , the headship of the family will fall to the oldest daugh ? ter 's eldest son . He is " uncle " ? tic , in the Bushnegro tongue . Men , as I have said , are the heads of Bushnegro society so far as each genera ? tion is concerned . A man is also chief of the village . Only with death does the great check upon the dynastic impulse of male rulers make itself felt . Yappi , as it happens , is head of his family and chief of his village as well , though this does not necessarily follow . When he dies his sons may in time be headmen of their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exert any influence over any of Yappi 's offspring from other mothers . The Bushnegro matriarchal system does seem rather difficult . But ? and I should no doubt be stoned for this ? it is really quite simple . We are ac ? customed to think in terms of father-and ? son primogeniture . The Bushnegroes think in terms of mother-and-daughter primogeniture . With us girl children are the end-products of the family . The name does not continue through them . Completely reverse this , and the Bushnegro system becomes intelligible . Marriage among the Bushnegroes is not an elaborate performance . Neither is divorce . Each young Saramacca takes his first wife when he is still in his teens , just as soon , in fact , as he shows he is able to support a bride and pro ? spective offspring . No festival of any kind marks the occasion . The pro ? posed arrangement is just discussed at some length by both families and , when the consent of the girl 's family is secured , she simply takes her possessions and herself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lodging in the new but which her man has built . The neighbors and relatives of youth and maiden wish both parties well ? if they happen to think of it ? but no one is impressed . This is not an especially momentous event . Marriage is quite a common occurrence . Besides , until children come , the balance of family power will not have been varied a particle , and the family is the only thing in which the village is communally concerned . Sometimes a girl child is betrothed to a man by her family when she is still an infant . The prospective husband then is supposed to pay the family for her support until the time of her puberty has passed . The girl is expected to stay virgin until her husband is ready to take her . If she does not , the husband quickly ascertains who her lover has been , and promptly submits a bill . The seducer is forced to square the disap ? pointed husband to the uttermost far ? thing he has spent upon the girl during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wed her , though she is the deciding factor in this . She need n't have him if she does n't want him . Bushnegro girls usually marry for the first time when they are fifteen or six ? teen , but this first love is by no means the last . The Bushnegroes consider women as the fickle sex and have pa ? tiently provided for their whims . Or , perhaps the matriarchs themselves crea ? ted the system . A woman may leave her husband at any time if she has what public opinion admits to be a fair excuse . If her husband is lazy , a poor provider , or simply dull , that is ample reason for him to be deserted . This last reason isquite seriously balanced and allowed . If the woman falls in love with another man , public opinion does not accept that as a sound reason for her to quit her lawful groom , unless , mayhap , the lover is obviously more attractive than the husband . That is a different mat ? ter , the village readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either locks her front door or moves . In the first case the husband no longer has right of entry to his wife 's abode . The house where she lives is and has always been her house . It belongs to her family . The husband heretofore has come and gone freely , but now that he is barred he may no longer trespass , even though he has erected the but with his own hands for the use of the bride ! But the husband still has his own house which he has used during the marital period as a storehouse for his most treasured possessions . It is his haven . I was allowed to inspect one husband 's house . A middle-aged Bushnegro at one of the small jungle towns which we visited ? Biri-Pudu-Madu , on the upper Suri ? name ? took a fancy to us . He was deeply interested in the curiosity I displayed in the town and its people and put himself out to show me every ? thing . My wife ? hereinafter to be known by her rightful name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inspection . But at length our guide began to eye her distrustfully . We stood near a shabby little but in the sun at the far end of the village . He stopped doubtfully , looked at the house , then at Margaret , then at me , shifting his bare feet in a slow waltz of indecision . In a moment he saw his opportunity . Margaret was distracted temporarily by the person of an in ? finitesimally small naked brown baby that stood in the hot sand and wailed shrieks of indignation and disgust at her white-skinned countenance . My friend seized me by the arm and with an alarmed glance over one shoulder at Margaret , pushed me through the door way of the hut . He was too late . Margaret had seen and in all innocence tried to follow . But her path was firmly barred . The pantomime of se ? crecy had been played in an effort to avoid the appearance of discourtesy . Now there was no escape , the Bush ? negro made himself plain . He glared indignantly and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then as man to man he showed me his possessions , a faded tintype of him ? self taken in Paramaribo and some exquisite figure carvings he had made and kept private from all the world of women . I doubt if even men bad looked on these particular things before . My host , with the bashfulness of the true artist , dared show me , the foreign critic , sculptures he feared to show his neighbors . I would take my opinions away with me . The others would stay and discourse endlessly ? and painfully perhaps . Villages are bad places for the fine arts ? though this particular artist emphatically need not have been ashamed of his creations . Every husband in Biri-Pudu-Madu , and in all the other Bushnegro villages , in fact , has an empty , " men only " house like this . In times of domestic strife it is a refuge . It is a castle for ill humors and masculine meditations . Privacy is a doubly blessed thing in the perpetual warmth and freedom of a palm-thatehed jungle town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill that want and when a wife divorces her man his but is ready for him . Somewhat sadly he lets fresh air in , gives it a cursory dusting , and settles back into the ways of bachelordom . But this . sequence of events occurs only , of course , if the man in question has only one wife . If he has several the discontented lady must perforce move from the common house and either go back to her own family or on to the but of the man she has selectedfor her next husband . Then the de ? serted groom is only saddened at the public stain upon his abilities and at ? tractiveness . He is not inconvenienced ? but if possible he finds another wife the same afternoon to mitigate the disgrace . We witnessed an example of this reckless activity . One morning Nacoe , one of our boatmen , appeared as usual , but his customary good spirits did not accompany him . His brown , puckered face was a tragic mask of anger and distress . Through our interpreter and guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our immediate sympathy , however , flowed into the wrong channel . No , Nacoe 's wife was not dead ? but gone before . Early that same morning she had left Nacoe 's house and moved to the house of another husband . Nacoe was sorrowed . We must not misunderstand . The lady in question had seemed superfluous for some time past and , so far as that was concerned , Nacoe was delighted to be rid of her . But really l It was most unjust . Nacoe 's neighbors might so easily get the wrong impression . Would we mind if he took the day off ? At dusk Nacoe appeared again , this time smiling and laughing at any prov ? ocation , as was his wont . To a lifted eyebrow he nodded . Yes , his house ? hold was complete . He had found and married another woman ? one far more charming than the deserter . The neigh ? bors ' mean gossiping was choked ? Nacoe 's head was high again . Each woman 's children go with her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family disapproves of her new choice . Then the children are taken into custody by the family , and the mother loses her control of them . It is a casual custom , apparently , yet absolute fidelity is insisted upon by both parties to a match while the arrangement is in force . Taken all in all , a Bushnegro family is an entirely agreeable affair . The system is perfectly moral , for morality anywhere is no more than a standard . This is the Bushnegro stand ? ard . Missionaries who have attempted to introduce monogamy among the Bushnegroes have precipitated violent promiscuity , disease , and race suicide ? with a sudden trend toward degeneracy ? a thing unknown to " uncivilized " Bushnegroes . I have rather over-stressed divorce ? though I have not exaggerated . Easy divorce is , it is true , provided for by Buslmegro law and defended by frequent usage . But in practice it is not unusual to find a man and his wives who have lived together in perfect amity for many years ? and no old people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , final attachments are often formed which last till death ; though more commonly the old women grow weary of many men and in the twilight go hack to their own and to the concerns of what is more per ? manent than states or passions or tears ? the family . It is the only true unit in Bushnegro life , for the family is anchored in the heart . non/ it emerges the clan and from clans , the tribe , but the two last count for little , though they may last a thousand years . They are simply necessary machines , perpetual , but un ? attended ; they do not truly penetrate to the soul of any hour . VI Old people are held in great respect . Their age has brought them wisdom . The children and grandchildren compete to serve and please them . It is not because of favors hoped from these old people after they are dead . One may be sure of them , for love and kindliness never end . Bitterness stops only with death . Affection for the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has grown out of a long gratitude . In the jungle life depends upon the precious wis ? dom of the old . For there are no books . These old ones hold justice in their hands . The consciousness of right and wrong , though common to all , abides especially with them . When a small disorder occurs , it is the business of the community , and espe ? cially of the old , to settle it at once , before the trouble becomes serious Suppose a wife leaves her husband and he objects to some detail of the parting ? the night following the event all the village gathers in the firelight before the granman 's house to hear the pleas of both . Cracoe 's wife has gone to another man . Everyone knows that , but now Cracoe 's opportunity has come to give the inside history of the event . He seizes it vehemently , with fine verbal dramatics , swinging his brown arms in the red stain of the firelight to emphasize his plea . Cracue calls the whole town to witness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . He is handsome , strong . He has many Dutch guilders and much raw gold in his own house to meet any demands his wives may make on him . But , Cracoe admits with a sigh and lowered tone there is no ac ? counting for the vagaries of women . What must be , must be , no doubt . However ? and here he grows loud again ? woe it entirely necessary for the deserting wife to take away with her the best and only iron cooking pot in the whole household of Cracue ? Cracoe sits down , looking as self-righteous as possible . The granman of the town and all the rest , young and old alike , have listened attentively . Now they ask questions . At last every conceivable argument and evidence has been heard upon both sides , and a decision is handed down . The wife must return the pot immediately or her new husband will have to pay for it . The granman and his elders are the official channels of justice . Upon them rests the responsibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village sit not far behind the men in the more dis ? tant glow from the fire in mid-clearing and occasionally a murmur comes from their ranks . It dies down quickly , but observers notice that these murmurs are invariably followed by a right-about change of tune on the part of the granman and his aides . This is the matriarchal way . All races are accustomed to invisi ? ble powers in the shelter of masculine thrones . The Bushnegroes have merely systematized that authority , and done it painlessly , so to speak . Sometimes Bushnegroes commit minor thefts . Occasionally one man cheats another in the barter of timber , or , in fulfilling a commission down-river for a neighbor , carelessly keeps the change . Affairs of this sort are settled in the clearing . The decisions are invariably just . A Bushnegro , no matter on which side of a question he stands , dares not lie . His sense of justice and truth is so profoundly a part of him that he is as ready as his enemy to accuse himself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical reason for this apparent moral perfection . If a Bushnegro de ? ceives in anything , the ancestor spirits of his family will know be is unworthy and cease their favors . And , still more im ? portant , there are a thousand , thousand gods and demons in the jungle who will war against the evil one until he dies . They are the good spirits , not had spirits . They have a negative effec ? tiveness . The malefactor , until the hour of his misdeed , knows he has survived amid the countless dangers of the forest only through the help of these friendly gods . The knowledge of their kind presence has bolstered waning courage a million times and warded off disaster as often . But when a man sins , he knows he stands alone against the unseen world . The good spirits of tree and rapid and rain will leave him because of his bad deed . Good and evil can not mix . So it is that to ally oneself with lies is to enlist in the army of disaster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first and most common is to insist that the de ? fendant pay the plaintiff in good Dutch schreng and bankonoto the full sum set by the council as the cash worth of the damage done . The settlement is made with as good grace as the temperament of the individual permits and the matter ends . But if one individual offends many times there is a second and last punish ? ment . The recidivist is cast out . He must leave his village , his wives , and his family and go alone forever , stripped of gods and guns , into the jungle . Even his people disown him . He has shamed them . When , in the pallid forest twi ? light of the day after the last palaver , the turn of the path hides the unhappy sin ? ner , he has ceased to be . He is forgotten as the dead never are ; no one ever sees or thinks of him again ; no rumor of him comes ; the black throat of the jungle has swallowed him . Justice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
