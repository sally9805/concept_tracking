THIS MAY or may not be the season for coming into town in order to buy the boys ' clothes for the new school season , but something is bringing the " nice " people the people who do not believe in doing things smartly  --  into the city . At least we saw three old right-hand drive Pierce Arrows with no accelerators last week in half an hour 's astute observation . These old busses are the last word in mellowness . Usually the former coachman drives them . AS WE go to press , the main dining-room of the Brevoort which Mr. Buckner padlocked so long ago reopens , refurbished , redecorated , and rejoicing . Thus can it be said that all the nuisances which Mr. Buckner commits are gradually forgotten in the misty vastnesses of time . Shakespeare said that the good that men do lives after them . Perhaps , then , a hundred years from now , when all the evil has been forgotten , some earnest historian will discover the unfortunate enforcement agent to have been in reality a high-minded idealist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Buckner , by the way , the speak-casks , as they get more and more firmly on their feet , are harking back to some of the charming old-time conventions . The brass rail and the sawdust have been familiar for the last few years , but some of the more elab orate conventions have been lacking . The other evening , however , when a paunchy and florid barkeep filled the order for straight gin for an over-intoxicated individual , he put in water . " And , " he winked , " we do n't charge for it , either . " CONSIDERING the beauty still to be met with in various parts of Manhattan Island , it is difficult to believe that America , as the papers put it , has really been drained of loveliness by the Atlantic City Beauty Contest . Thank Heaven , in this field , at least , the amateur still holds her own . SEVERAL years of miserable ex-perience with paper towels , blotting-those which should he rubbed and rubbing those which should he blotted , leads to our weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public , advertise and manufacture a paper towel with which the hands and face can be dried . A towel of this nature would sweep the country in no time . BIT said with regret that Canal 2C20 , the number which used to tell us the time , has gone out of business . Western Union , whose number it was , gives as its excuse for discontinuing the service the fact that 25,000 people called daily to ask the time and that the practice interfered with receiving telegrams over the telephone . Twenty-five thousand people a day at five cents a call makes $456,250 a year . The decision is puzzling . THIS RAISES the thought that in the last few years institutions , public utilities , and corporations have adopted the irritating practice of taking advantage of the public during times of crises and of keeping the advantage afterward . A prime example is prohibition as an emergency measure . And during the war the Telephone Company took occasion to stop giving the time because the Belgians were eating black bread or something . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting over the pay-as-you-enter nuisance . But the time , the time ! If there is a revenue of half a million involved , surely the Telephone Company could afford to put somebody at a desk somewhere with a lot of telephones and a good big clock . Bells and Oil IF THE fifty-three Rockefeller 1 hells of the Park Avenue Baptist Church , the largest of which weighs ten tons , peal a bit timidly into the great chasm of Park Avenue just now , John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , is not to blame . He did his best . Last year Mr. Rockefeller imported from Belgium Anton Brees , gay young carilloneur from the Cathedral of Antwerp . There was something delightful about the artistic whole-heartedness with which the ringer of bells in dreamy , mystic Flanders tackled the mighty city of New York . His first request was that RISKING L1FE AND LIMB TO SECURE OIL FOR ACTORS HAIR AN ENGRAVING WITH A MESSAGE BY JOHN HELD JR ? ? all traffic on Park Avenue be stopped while he played his chimes . Now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the church 's trustees . They tend toward steel , oil , and pig iron . A great city can not stop its traffic on account of bells , even though they be made of pig iron , they gently explained to Mr. Brees . Also , would he please play things more familiar to Americans ? Tinkling little airs which ring from the cathedrals of Holland and Belgium mystified the good people of New York . Mr. Brees vowed he would not change his programs . Furthermore , he declared he wanted a new apartment with private bath . He was tired of living in the Y. M. C. A. " A bath ! " exclaimed the trustees of the Park Avenue Baptist Church . In consternation they summoned Mr. Rockefeller . The latter was pained . Was n't Mr. Brees making five times what he made in Belgium ? Mr. Brees admitted he was , then added , with Flemish shrewdness , meeting the oil magnate on his own ground , " I 've been told I should save half my salary . " " Did you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And scored too , for Anton Brees did not have one . All morning they argued ; then , to his secretary 's astonishment , Mr. Rockefeller ordered lunch served them in his office . Following which they argued all afternoon . Now the Flemish hell-ringer has gone back to Antwerp , where cathedrals boast Rubenses and baths are unknown . Percival Price , twenty-oneyear-old Canadian , has taken hisplace . The new artist 's music is as yet a bit timid , but this winter he is being sent abroad to study under Josef Denyn , who for thirty-seven years has played the incomparable seventeenth century Hemony bells which hang in the Cathedral of Malines . More Hunting News NEWS from the few fox-hunting communities near New York  --  there are only five of them  --  is on the increase . We spoke last week of the beginning of the hunting season in October , while in fact the Millbrook Hunt in the country behind Poughkeepsie held its fall meet last week . Its country , as it happens , is almost all grass , which allows hunting almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until the farmers give the signal . For the most part , fox hunting is a ticklish business in this modern country . In England the farmer hears the hounds , jumps on the old gray mare , and joins in with a whoop ; but in America he is only too likely to growl ominously and reach for his shotgun . Of all the hunts , the Essex , we hear , has solved the problem most satisfactorily . The Monmouth Country Hunt at Red Bank and the Fairfield and Westchester Hunt at Greenwich , Connecticut , do n't attempt to solve it , but substitute drag hunts for fax hunts , dragging an aniseed bag over the property of the less surly and letting the hounds chase the bag . Meadow Brook , too , has a drag , but it also enjoys real fox hunting , in spite of the plethora of hard roads that cross its country , in spite of crowds of following automobiles , and in spite of a reputation for being swell . VERY so often we hear some vis- , iting Englishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Peapack , New Jersey , can you get fox hunting in the old tradition . The beautiful Peapack Valley some ten miles beyond Bernardsville on the Lackawanna ) , is not yet tourist-ridden and the hard-surfaced roads are few . The Hunt is much less known than Meadow Brook and is consequently free from sightseers . The foxes are plentiful , the country is open and clean , and the farmers are for the most part benevolent . Moreover , the hunting authorities manage to chuck the farmer under the chin and keep him in a good humor , by delighting him with the annual Far Hills Fair and Horse Show . It takes place this Friday and Saturday , by the way , and is very much worth seeing . Challengers THE Anglo-Argentines who have come to play a game or two of polo with us are not to be misled by the idea of having a good time or of seeing New York , we gather , but instead spend all of their spare time talking to their beloved ponies or to any one who will listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in very strict training , and although they go about to the Ford Johnsons ' , the Mil-burns ' , the Phippses ' , et al. , they discreetly keep their heads , drink little or none at all , and are home early after a bedtime inspection of their mounts . They live at the Rumson Country Club when in Jersey , at the Meaelow Brook when on Long Island and are the guests of John W. Converse when in Philadelphia . These South American super-cowboys come from ranches even larger than our own old-time Texas ranges and are accustomed to riding from dawn till dusk across one long , straightaway cow pasture . Manuel Andrada , for instance , the most Latin of the Argentinians despite his six feet two , is a dark , heavy-set man who knows little English but much polo , and who ca n't remember when he first rode a horse . The saddle was his cradle . Ostrich chasing on horseback was his first nursery game and pelota and polo soon followed . AND Jack Nelson , the man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million acres there are in his estancias . Nelson is of Irish descent and a Dublin University graduate . Lewis Lacey , although Canadian-born , has spent most of his life in South America . C. N. Land , of English extraction , who has played polo on the Riviera and in Spain as well as in the Argentine , and Pena , the substitute player , make up the other members of the visiting team . They are all from Buenos Aires , where it is summer in winter and winter in summer , but they feel very much at home here and say that playing conditions and methods in the United States are more similar to their own than those of any other country . These gentlemen , who breed horses and cattle as a business , consider that raising the pony is more than half the fun of polo . They breed their own mounts on their own ranches , use these mounts for one match or one season , and then sell the ponies , sometimes for as much as $35,000 each , always sure of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supplying the world with polo ponies . Among our own American teams , in the last Internationals , two years ago , at least fourteen of the ponies were Argentine mounts  --  and as large a proportion of the English ponies were from South America . Beatrice , the hay mare ridden by Laddie Sanborne during recent matches , got much publicity as the British horse that won a D.S.O. , but it is of even more interest to polo payers to learn now that Beatrice was bred in the Argentine . APROPOS polo , the Meadow Brook colors , as every one knows , are blue and white . But we venture the guess that few people know the amusing and humble origin of both the colors and the name . In the first place , there is no such place as Meadow Brook . East Meadow is the name of the place on Long Island which was chosen as a site for the club . During its organization , the late Belmont Purdy and a friend who was also a founder of the club , happened to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manhattan Beach Hotel , they watched a bellboy take down from its pole a flag with the letters M.B.H. on a soft blue ground . " What are you going to do with that ? " they asked him . It was faded , he explained , and was to be discarded . They hurried in to see the manager and after a few minutes the flag was theirs . " M.B.H. ? Meadow Brook Hunt , " they improvised . For colors what better than its white and soft faded blue ? For a long time the original flag flew over the white wooden clubhouse in East Meadow . Septuagenary T T IS related that George Bernard I Shaw , a few days after his seventieth birthday , was roped into a drawing-room party of a rather highbrow nature , at which the special attraction was a violinist . Said the hostess to Mr. Shaw , after the violinist had rendered one or two numbett : " Well , Mr. Shaw , what do you think of my discovery ? " Replied Mr. Shaw : " I find in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause . Then , " But , Mr. Shaw , Paderewski is not a violinist . " " Exactly ! " snapped G. B. S. Last Words ALTHOUGH women have been mentioned in this respect , it now appears that the record for gaining the last word goes to a Broadway trolley conductor . He had listened to a loud tirade against his refusal to stop at an odd-numbered street and was silent until the irate lady was well off his car at Fifty-second Street , still scolding . Then he turned to the inside of the car , made a bow and called out clearly : " Ladies and Gentlemen , I have the honor to announce that the next stop will be at Fiftieth Street . " Ambitious Plans THE Museum of the City of TH York , which inhabits the old and charming Gracie Mansion , set apart in a little park overlooking the East River at Eighty-eighth Street , is having its face lifted . When Mr. Henry Collins Brown , who rescued it from disuse , departed for the excellent purpose of devoting all his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assumed by Hardinge Scholle , with whom museums are a career and who has worked with both the Metropolitan Museum and the Chicago Art Institute . Mr. Scholle is a young man of taste and decision . He has already relegated to burglar-proof storerooms the extraneous , sometimes charming , often incongruous , knickknacks which formerly filled Gracie Mansion . " A museum without a show-case , " Mr. Scholle intends making the house . Furthermore , a responsive city will straightway restore to its original condition the former home of Archibald Gracie , adding balustrades to both roof and porch top , like those shown in an old print of the house . Inside , woodwork and original mantels fortunately remain intact . New floors , reproductions of old lighting fixtures , hangings , carpets  --  all the paraphernalia of living in the early nineteenth century  --  will he added , making the rambling frame house in the sleepy East River sunshine once more a typical New York home of the 1810 period , in detail more minute than the Metropolitan 's American Wing . THE house , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the municipal imagination by using it for tools . To accommodate Henry Collins Brown 's collection of " Valentine 's Manual " prints it was later assigned to the Museum of the City of New York . Not being fireproof , however ( a fact which handicapped Mr. Brown ) , the building offers no solution for the Museum 's permanent residence . Mr. Scholle , who is just back from abroad where he studied the great municipal museums of England , France , and Germany , aspires to a second Carnavalet , which would of course necessitate a large building and modern equipment . Should this be forthcoming , however , Gracie Mansion will still be kept as an auxiliary  --  a remote place in which to wander when one tires of city noises and the twentieth century . Meanwhile , the Museum of the City of New York is to have an exhibition in the early winter , which will endeavor to sketch its ultimate plan . Lexington and Fifty-eighth ANOTHER phenomenon of shift- ' 1 ing " centers " and changing districts seems worth recording . Apparently an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the upper East Side , with the corner drug stores at Lexington Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street as a Times Square kind of hub . Here are heard the whisky voices of the ladies of the chorus , and here , within a block of the B.M.T. , the I.R.T. , the Third Avenue " L " and three surface lines , are ensconced the newest and best exdowed of New York 's experimental theatres , and the oldest and most time-honored third-rate-show rehearsal halls and vaudevilles . The Robert Milton-John Murray Anderson School of the Theatre in East Fifty-eighth Street  --  where more Hispano-Suizas , Mercedes , Minervas and Daimlers are said to park , during an hour , than at any other given spot ? delivering or calling for debutantes who are learning to act , sing , or design  --  is across the street from ancient and dusty Vienna Hall , where German yodeling was heard a generation ago and where , between German-Jewish weddings , rehearsals now shatter the quiet both day and night . And east of Lexington Avenue is the new home of Richard Boleslavsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , it has new quarters both grand and spacious , and Boleslaysky is opening this year with a smart musical comedy , " The Straw Hat , " translated from the French of Labiche . THE Laboratory Theatre occupies 1 . a portion of the old Terrace Gardens building , but the remainder of the structure still retains its former name and reputation . Balls are said to be given there which make the Webster Hall affairs resemble Methodist strawberry festivals . Opposite this building is Proctor 's , with good old-fashioned vaudeville . And of course the painted ladies , acrobats , and comedians loll at the stage door and are mightily scornful of their intellectual neighbor across the way . Next to Proctor 's is Palm Gardens , another famous old dance hall , now used for rehearsals , evidently , " The Miracle " being in travail there at present . All this within a block of Park Avenue and the overpowering Ritz Tower . One of Two AFTER almost sixty years of slowly declining grandeur , the old Park Avenue Hotel , at Thirty-second Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelson , a wholesale milliner , is to put up a twenty-five story building in its place and hope that it will not be another pileof-boxes building . Since the modern city rose and the business men abandoned the old hotels for such princely edifices as the Pennsylvania and the Commodore , many jokes have been cracked  --  with some justice  --  at the expense of the old Park Avenue . The days when it used to be the place to eat are buried . Nowadays , the lobby looks like the lobby of the hotel in Gainsville , Georgia . /THERE was a time when the beau-I tifuI court in the heart of the hotel , with its flower beds and fountains , cool air and atmosphere of spaciousness and leisureliness attracted almost every dinner party of consequence in New York . The walls are not too high to shut out all the sky . With all its fine hotels , New York has no place to equal that court for summer dinners . There is no the place to eat just now . Given a matchless cuisine , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing fountain and the long galleries down which to walk in new gowns , given an obsequious headwaiter and little tables among the neglected flower-beds , and the Park Avenue might have stepped into the breach without much trouble and enjoyed a period of rejuvenation . But apparently the management was not ambitious . We are told that when the big building at One Park Avenue , across the way , was first opened , many of those working there came briskly across the street and tried the hotel for lunch . But not for long . The staff and the waiters , some of whom had been there thirty years , seemed nonplused by the strange faces . BE THAT as it may , the life of the old hotel is about done . Now people are asking where the existing patrons of the place will lodge themselves in future . Some of them have lived there forty years . The answer , of course , is the Murray Hill Hotel , which to date remains unperturbed by the uproar of the age , and despite the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is trying to overshadow it a block or so away . That is , unless  --  like old Dan who died of a broken heart when Kitty , the mare , passed on  --  the Murray Hill crumbles away out of pure discouragement at the loss of its companion . Those two old hostelries , the Murray Hill and the Park Avenue , have stood in company on their respective corners for so long that to see one without the other will seem very odd . On the Air WITH the Radio World 's Fair WIT the New Madison Square Garden ; with thirty thousand dollars ' worth of decorations and a million and a half dollars represented in exhibited apparatus spread over eighty thousand square feet of show space ; with Mrs. Lotta Harrauff of Princeton , Illinois , presiding as the Radio Queen and resting on her literary laurels as author of an inspiring essay on what radio means to womanhood ; with three hundred booths , all in different decorative schemes showing all the old as well as all the new radio equipment from hundreds of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miniature coffins ; with Governor Al and the Lord Mayor Walker pressing official buttons and talking official words into official microphones ; with Bernays Johnson cooking eggs in a wireless kitchen over cakes of ice ; with a hundred million dollars ' worth of radio business being transacted between manufacturers , dealers , and jobbers from every part of America and Europe ; with three hundred thousand radio enthusiasts filling the space between the exhibits ; with every effort being made to find and present a silver trophy to " the perfect radio voice " ; and with programs including everything from Massenet to the Carola Cash Register Cantata being broadcast as far as the Mozambique Channel  --  the week has been fully as significant as any we have had recently . Addendum PROOF sheets on this week 's " Prop file " reveal the fact that our favorite story on Big Bill is omitted from the chronicle . It was during a match a year or so ago at Chevy Chase . The noted champion had been running into very poor luck all morning and things seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped up to Mr. Tilden , between sets , and asked him anxiously , " Will you please tell me when Mr. William Tilden , the great champion , is going to begin to play tennis ?
