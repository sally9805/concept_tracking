txt The thirteenth allied conference , which opened in London a week ago , ended today in what in some quarters is described as a breakdown , in others as an agreement among the delegates to disagree , and in others as the cmenme of a nerind of reflection . Premier Poincare returns to Paris Wednesday morning to consult with his Cabinet , and the same day Premier Lloyd George starts on his holiday . The rock upon which the conference has- thus ignominiously come to grief with nothing definitely accomplished was M. Poincare 's refusal to accept any solution of the German Moratorium question short of ' new guarantees of whit the French call a protective and what the British- and most ? - ofthe. other. : .. delegates cell . a. - L punitjveltifil ? &; &E`p`E'; Speaking ** was in , one . ktfelerding the tering of the Versaill treatY : ? bee qtieletinn of -a moretoritied now refits With the Reparation Commission , which , according to the view held in London all along , is the only body competent to deal with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began with s. morning meeting of the Allied Council at Downing Street . In a final effort to avoid an appearance of a breakdown Signor Schanzer , the Italian Foreign Minister , proposed an adjournment of the discussion until each Governme* had completed its negotiations with , the United States concerning funding arrangements for its American debt . This would have involved granting a moratorium to Germany until the Council could meet again . M. Poinc , are took the attitude that France would never assent to that unless she received from Germany additional " gages and guarantees . " Mr. Lloyd George replied that England was satisfied with the guarantees the Committee on Guarantees had already succeeded in imposing on the Germans and regarded the French proposals as absolutely prejudicial from an econoiniea ! standpoint to the allied position . A complete deadlock ensued and the Council agreed to disagree . While presumably the question of a moratorium now reverts to the Reparation Commission , which is empowered by the Treaty of Versailles to deal with it , the action which France will take remains to be seen . Signor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed its arrangements with the United States , and so knew . its precise economic oeition. was made during the discussions which took place Sunday among MM . Folmar &; Theunis ( the Belgian Premier ) and Schanzer : The failure of the allied experts ' committee to reach an agreement on Saturday was then known to them , and Signor . Schanzer evidently supposed that his idea was acceptable to both the French and Italians , as he made a trip out to Chequers to lay the proposal before Mr. Lloyd George . Consequently when the heads ; of the delegations , including Baron Hayashi , the Japanese Ambassador . met this morning at Downing Street , there seemed hopes of the Council ending in a reasonable compromise . Mr. Lloyd George opened the proceedings by referring to the bitter criticism the French press had aimed at him for going to Chequers for the week-. end . He pointed out that he had not done so without consulting the other members of the council and he laid stress on the fact that in-England there is a strong feeling against transacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had thought that the Experts ' Committee would do their work all the better for not being hurried , and he was sure that in heavy conference such as the present one the delegates themselves were often better for twenty-four hours for reflection . The council then turned to the Schanzer proposal , and M. Poincare stated that France would accept it provided no moratorium was granted to Germany in the interim . The other delegates expressed the view that such a condition was impracticable , and Senor Schanzer made a special plea to M. Poincare to agree to a moratorium for at most two months . The French Premier , however , was firm and declared emphatically that his Government would not . accept unconditionally a moratorium of any kind . Mr. Lloyd George intervened and pointed out that there was no necessity for deciding this moratorium question at that meeting . The British Government was quite willing to leave the decision to the Reparation Commission . That was the body set up by the Treaty of Versailles to deal with precisely that kind of difference of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its authority . He repeated the proposals which the British Government wished to lay before , the Council : First , to adopt the Italian suggestion of adjournment of the discussion till the latter end of the year ; secondly , to leave the moratorium to the decision of the Reparation Commission ; thirdly . to agree to immediate application of the guarantees already laid down by the Committee on Guarantees , and , fourthly , that Great Britain would agree to make no claim until after the adjourned meeting of the Council upon the Allies in respect to either the interest or capital of the debts they owe her . Rejected by . French Premier , This program was accepted and approved by all the delegates except M. gave first " gauges and guarantees . " She could not look upon . the guarantees to which Mr. Lloyd George had referred as sufficient , as they were not fresh ones , but had already been accepted by the Germans . In reply Mr. Lloyd George said he . could not assent to adjournment of the Council without the grant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Reparation Commission not to declare a moratorium , although the very meeting of , the Allied Council was evidence that it was recognized that Germany could noj , onger make immediate payments . The British Government , Mr. Lloyd George continued , had always held that the question of a moratorium should be handled by the Reparation Commission and that the Allies should not hold a meeting until the recommendations of that commission were avail ' tile . The British Government was satisfied that the guarantees imposed by the Guarantees Committee were quite adequate for their purpose and was opposed to M. Poincare 's fresh ones , not through any tenderness to Germany but because it was convinced they would defeat their own object . Mr. Lloyd George then instanced the proposal to impose control over Germany 's mines and forests . German miners . he argued . must be employed to work German mines , but would German miners work as well under foreign as under German managers . As for the forests , it would be an impossible task for the Allies to make arrangements to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the difficulties which the Central German Government already had in its relations with them . The Berlin Government already found it difficult to induce the States to accept the guarantees imposed by the Comimttee on Guarantees , and any extension of foreign interference with the economic machinery of Germany must react very seriously on that country 's political and economic it s ua on . decided on ' an agreed policy satisfactory to all within a quarter of an hour . The sole stone of stumbling was M. Poincare and we doubt whether even he would persist in that bad role if his hands were not so much tied by his own past attitude and by the mass of legends and make-believes which the-Paris press has forced upon French opinion and to which French politicians appear bound to conform . " M. Poincare 's final stand oriethe point of control of German mines and forests is attributed in some quarters to the fact that , having abandoned most of the fourteen points which he came to set forth , it would have been political suicide for him to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , made a tactical blunder when on Friday M. Poincare acquiesced in the adverse ' expert reports passed on his other proposed protective guarantees by not agreeing to the French scheme for control of the German mines and forests . By so doing , it is contended , Mr. Lloyd George would have helped M. Poincare to save his face , and would have secured what was after all the main object of British policy , the grant of a moratorium to Germany . According to this view the British lost a substantial gain for a shadowy advantage , for from the British standpoint a moratorium would be of benefit to all concerned , and the disadvantages of allied control of the German mines and forests , upon which Mr. Lloyd George laid so much stress , remain to be proved . The experts who examined this particular point were by no means unanimous and the discussions were unconvincing . although in the end the Expert.Committee did finally draw up a majority report against the French scheme .

Premier Poincare is not bound by any conclusion of the London conference , according to the official claim here .

This eventuality could take place if the , Belgian representativee joined the British and Italian members in the voting . REPARATION BOARD WAITS .

PARIS , Aug. ** was expected , the Renaration Commission unanimously decided to suspend any , decision on granting a moratorium to Germany until after the London conference had , concluded its labors .

If the question is left to the commismission. as Mr. Lloyd George has today proposed , the situation will become somewhat acute for the Belgian representative , for it will be his vote which will have to decide whether or not a moratorium should be granted . Today the French are hopeful that during the next twenty-four hours events will turn in such a way , as to bring Belgium to their side , and if they do they will have a majority of the commission , as though the voting will be two against two . The vote of the French President , M. Dubois , carries most weight . But unless he is sure of Belgian support , Mt Poincard is very unlikely to consent to the matter being left for the commission 's decision . Here every one is heartily tired of the continued deadlock and what appears to be hairsplitting differences , and M. Poincare would undoubtedly be severely blamed if his visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though the French are tired of being ruled by Lloyd George , as they put it , they are not ready for a break yet arid are for the most part sincerely anxious that matters should be patched up yet awhile . But the conclusion they inevitably come to in the same way as was clone in London yesterday by MM . Poincare , Theunis and Schanzer , is that there is no way out of the present difference unless America comes in . According to a French correspendent ein London ; among the proposals made yesterday by Signor Schanzer-on behalf of - his colleagues to Mr. Lloyd ' George for the present abandonment of the conference was that it should be resummoned in November . " and as at that - time the American elections will have ' been held insistence should be made ' that the United States be represented : " Another suggestion ' was that the question of reparations be then discussed along with the question of interallied debts . These suggestions Mr. Lloyd George refused to accept and would go no further than the suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reparation Commission . It was for that reason , Mr. Lloyd George concluded , that the British Government felt compelled to take a firm stand . It wanted to lay down conditions for future payments from Germany . These , it believed , would be considerable . Moreover , it wished to arrive as quickly as possible at conditions which would enable Germany to raise an international loan , for out of this immediate and substantial reparations payments should be available , . So the British held the view that to break up the German economic machinery would be to go backward . Therefore Lloyd George held no agreement was possible ,  --  and , failing agreement , the British Government stood by the Treaty of Versailles . He must suggest that the question of the ' moratorium be referred to the Reparation Commission under Article 234 of the treaty . If no agreement could be reached there , then he proposed that the entire subject be remitted to the League of Nations under Articles 13 and 14 of the Covenant . Neither of these proposals managed to win assent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing for the Council to do but agree to disagree . Other delegates fell in with this , M. Poincare pointing out that he must now consult with his Government on the new situation . I The Council then adjourned , but in the afternoon , when it had met- again to consider the question of Austria , Sir Robert Horne reported that the experts had been unanimous in recommendations concerning the Clearing House payments /debts to allied nationals ) , ? 2,000,000 of which are due from Germany tomorrow . The experts considered that Germany should be required to pay this sum within four weeks , and that after that each Government should make its own arrangements with the Germans for further payments on that account subject to the approval of the Reparation Commission . All the members of the Council agreed to ' this proposal , MM . Poincare and Theunis pointing out that they did so , although it involved real sacrifice to France and Belgium , for the sake of allied unity . In authoritative quarters , today 's ending of the conference is unsatisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that M. Poincare stated he would return to Paris to consult his Government . Explanations of Poincare Stand . The Daily Chronicle , representing the official view here , says ; " The French are very much in the position of the juryman who explained a jury 's failure to find a verdict by the unreasonable obstinacy of the other eleven men . The French press talks fiercely about this country 's attitude , but the cold fact is that on nearly every material issue it is France , and not Great Britain , which is standing alone . Had there been no French factor Un the conference , the other Allies could have Poincare , in announcing this evening thefailure of the conference . It was carefully-explained by M. Poincare that " a rupture " had not taken place . and that the four powers could continue to act together to enforce the Versailles Treaty , but that upon the moratorium question and productive guarantees the British and French Governments unhapPoincare .
