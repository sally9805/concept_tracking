A SOVIET is a caucus of comrades , such as the sailors in a ship or the teachers in a college , who after hanging the captain or kicking out the president and trustees , assume joint control of the fabric in which they find themselves lodged , and declare it to be their property by right of eminent domain and of actual possession . In theory theirs is a spontaneous union and a spiritual bond . An unquestioning unanimity , childlike and brotherly , animates everybody ; and it is no accident that the Soviet bears a Russian name , for there could hardly be elsewhere such a casual and affectionate way of superposing , as in children 's games , a spiritual harmony upon spiritual chaos . Here is the perfect ideal of a free society : that each member should be an absolute spirit , grounded in itself and responsible to itself only , and yet that somehow it should transcend its isolation and feel the exhilaration of living and thinking in unison with a legion of kindred spirits , each no less free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the thing is extremely old ; if not as old as spirit ? for spirit in its depths as well as in its heights is essentially solitary ? yet at least as old as play . How were ships invented or colleges first conceived ? A boy may have gone wading for pleasure , alone or with an adventurous friend ; and amid their splashing experiments with logs and rafts they may have gradually learned to become boatmen , fishermen , pirates , colonists , and merchants . An old man may have loved conning his adventures and maxims to himself , or decorating and sharpening them for the  | benefit of the gaping bystanders ; or he may have compared notes with an old crony , or wrought up his rival fancy to telling taller stories or giving more persuasive counsels : whence academies and parliaments . Very ponderous political and moral mechanisms may thus arise in play and be nothing but Soviets ossified . Sporting clubs and mystical sects have always been perfect Soviets in their beginnings ; and if the great religions have a different character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do not represent merely the devotional overflow or speculative margin of human wisdom , but profess seriously to adjust the individual to the forces that control his life : they come in the name of the Lord , with wrath in their voices and promises in their hands . Whenever a Soviet does the same , and would impose its authority by force or by eloquent dogmas , it evidently forfeits the spiritual spontaneity which I was assigning to it : it becomes an institution like any other , one more of those material dominations and powers amongst which spirit must thread its way . Least subject of human things to this fatality would seem to be aesthetic feeling and aesthetic invention . What could be more spontaneous and uncontrollable than living intuition , and at the same time more innocent ' ? Aestheticism is a refined sensuality , the gift of finding an immediate joy in the obvious ; and the field of the aesthetically obvious is infinitely extensible : every caprice or marvel of form , natural or unnatural , is waiting in the limbo of essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light . This field also contains all possible intensities , all the varieties of depth , of pleasure or horror , of which any one can be directly sensible . The immediate is shallow only in the sense of being all apparent , all light and fleeting actuality , without any hint or question of causes . It may seem silly or unreal to the working intellect ; and yet if intuition be vain , what shall rescue existence from vanity ' ? Essence , whether aesthetic or logical , has no need of being true of matter : it has a sufficient truth or reality in itself ; and unearthliness in it may go as far as it will , the farther the better , as we see in music and in spiritual religion , provided the organ that breeds these original intuitions is not unhinged . Exuberance of fancy , as in the Elizabethan age , is then a sign of manly vigour , health liberally enjoyed , and the fruition of many subtle harmonies , not only in the ear but in the blood .  | To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things in human terms has always been the impulse of dogmatic reason , following in the wake of animal sense and of dramatic fancy ; but the pure aesthete exists by renouncing that troubled ambition , laughing at opinion , and hugging his naked images for their own sake , in their innocent immediacy . What could be simpler or more legitimate ? Yet this has never been the practice of artists . Works of art are not aesthetically richer than natural things : far otherwise . Works of art are causes of wonder , interest , and admiration ; but a person who looks for beauty primarily in the arts can not have loved nature , and will never understand the piety of art . Artists are craftsmen working under the patronage of industry , religion , custom , sentiment , or pride . They are not aesthetes ; yet if they are to excel in their crafts they must have a good eye and a deft hand , gifts which will carry with them much aesthetic sensibility ; hence a particular aesthetic bias , partly personal , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost without knowing it , they will subject everything to special optical or manual rhythms , and will impose a thousand technical tricks , distortions , or inventions upon their subject-matter . Hence their schools or personal styles ? just the element in their work which the idle aesthetic critic abstracts and perhaps exalts into their sole virtue : for the aesthete is a sort of intellectual voluptuary who thinks that everything is made , or ought to be made , simply for his contemplative satisfaction . And the aesthetic soul in the artists themselves takes this view , especially in musicians and painters , whose work has no immediate practical function ; to them the patronage of industry , religion , and custom , or the duty of following natural models , may come to seem a monstrous imposition . Like the mutinous sailors or the rebellious professors , they may proclaim the independence of the spiritual quality , the free imaginative element , in their works ; this , they may say , makes the true professional link between them , the artistic essence of their art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic Soviet . Why not ? The chief difficulties which might beset a Soviet of sailors or teachers , or even of artistic craftsmen , are vain and harmless in the impalpable realms of intuition . In politics or industry impulses may conflict , and dangers may have to be faced from without , so that your Soviet would quickly come to grief if it did  | not begin by resigning all power into the hands of a leader . As sight requires a lens to focus and redistribute the interfused rays of light , so government requires a governor in whose brain and heart all interests may be synthesized and all actions co-ordinated . But for intuition the only lens needed is that which nature creates in each living organism : the rest ? academies , precepts , public opinion ? is so much dead lumber . Aesthetic values are essentially individual and occasional , and the greatness of masterpieces remains purely nominal until intuition in somebody recognizes and confirms it . It is the pupil 's hand and the observer 's eye that puts some living form , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old designs . Moreover , in these free activities , nobody seriously suffers even if the worst comes to the worst . Let a painter stop painting , or compose things that nobody cares for , and who will perceive his loss ' ? The brotherhood of aesthetes is not one of blood or interest , but of pure affinity : the aesthetic Soviet can accordingly break up harmlessly at any moment , until perhaps each artist becomes an only brother to himself ; and even within the commonwealth of his own works and moods there need be no forced unanimity . Each of his intuitions will be sufficiently justified if it consecrates the vital harmony of the moment that produced it . But in this case , we might ask , why set up an aesthetic Soviet at all , and not be satisfied with a happy anarchy , here where anarchy is innocent ' ? Fish , I would reply , swim in a pathless medium , yet they habitually swim in schools . The same thing happens to free and emancipated spirits ? aesthetes , poets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . Their occasional cold contacts , in chasing the same seasonable bait , are slimy , offish , and spiteful ; yet an uncomprehended compulsion draws them about into common feeding-grounds and currents , as if the movement and example of some unintentional leader were a signal requisite to give them direction and to awaken the darting impulse in their dark bosoms . Such is the helplessly gregarious nature of man even in his spiritual visions and most private flights . The truth and beauty which we profess to love would leave us profoundly disconsolate , if we could not dance before them holding hands and assuring ourselves , by saying so in chorus , that this beauty is really beautiful and this truth really true .  | In thus faltering and seeming to renounce its integrity , spirit confesses and discovers its origin . For it is absolute and free only transcendentally , that is , from its own point of view , when in the act of living it takes its existence and impulses for granted , and from that watch-tower surveys and judges all things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passive picture created by its own ingenious evolving thought . But all this , considered soberly and biographically , is so much egotistic illusion . In reality , spirit is never absolute or free ; down to its inmost depths it expresses the life of some material organism , formed and buffeted by circumstances . Beauty ? as the pure aesthetes have discovered ? is not intrinsic to any form : it comes to bathe that form , and to shine forth from it , only by virtue of a secret attraction , agitation , wonder , and joy which that stimulus happens to cause ? not always but on occasion ? in our animal hearts . Even truth would be an unmeaning word and a nightmare to the spirit ? as in fact it becomes in transcendental philosophy ? if no threatening and mothering nature existed outside : intuition might grow more or less vivid , its field might seem more or less complex and organized , but no actual view could ever suspect the existence of any other view , or appeal to it . A construction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor would a tragedy contradict a comedy , or another tragedy , nor would any part of discourse correct any other part of it , unless these various essences were understood to describe the same series of events , stumblingly enacted or brutally endured by living animals , and not in the least created by the intuition which may eventually review them in perspective . Pure spirit is not social : the pressing occasions for conflict or cooperation must first be impressed upon it from without or from below . Spiritual unanimity would be utterly inexplicable , as it would be perfectly idle and undiscoverable , if spirits were free and absolute , invisibly fluttering through heavenly spaces . These considerations are not so speculative as they sound : they touch the fate of any Soviet . A Soviet requires that the spontaneous impulses of its members should be specific and that they should be unanimous . But how did these impulses ever come to be unanimous or to be specific ? Evidently by force of animal necessity and of natural circumstances , Before children can conspire in  | inventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born contemporary brats ; they must have had neighbourly parents and a common playground . Before sailors or teachers can form a Soviet , there must have been a ship or a college to bring them together , to give them a common task , and to turn them into comrades . A common competence or a common hatred or hope is first bred by the very institutions on which it reacts , and can not long survive them . All nature is one great institution , of which animal bodies and human customs are in their day constituent parts : the freest spirit alive is a cub in that litter . Institutions do not originate in the sentiments which they produce ; these sentiments , whether pious , aesthetic , or rebellious , always presuppose these very institutions . There may have been passions and plans in the minds of the founders too , or of the bystanders who insensibly , by their actions and interactions , allowed these institutions to arise ; but such original sentiments , if not irrelevant to the result , would be those natural to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise or opposition of the lazy majority constructed some novel engine , like a college or a ship , which they foresaw might hold together , and might acquire social uses ; for any mechanism , if it can take root , will compel all adjacent mechanisms to adjust themselves to it . The ship and the college , if launched at the right moment , will attract vagrant souls , and turn them into sailors and students ; and these novel employments will generate the moral bonds , the comradeship or the grievances , on which a Soviet may be based . The possibility of friendship among men hangs on such accidental heritages and contacts , on the fact of possessing common instruments and functions . These the Soviet inherits gratis , but they are its very life . Merchandise and travellers must continue to flow to the ship , parents must continue to send their sons to the college , if the fervent brotherhood of colleagues or mariners is to endure . No Soviet of professors could stand the strain of lecturing only to one another , or each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wafted by a puff of socialism , simply to keep the sailors sailors , and spiritually one . How many of us have wished that there might be a monastery for free-thinkers ! But the thing is impossible . A religious Soviet presupposes a fixed dogma , a common moral burden , an epidemic inspiration ,  | Aesthetic intuition and aesthetic invention are in the same parlous case . It is not enough that some image should arise possessing for the moment an inevitable interest and expressiveness , such as spontaneous ideas borrow from the effort of attention which fixes their floating form ; if the image has no other significance , it will fade rapidly or will soon come to seem trivial and ugly , like those verses which a poet composes with rapture in a sort of dream , and which the next day , when he rereads them , he puts in the fire . A workman can hardly be true to a merely aesthetic fancy ; it melts into something different ; often it has sickened him before his apprentices have had time to adopt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arts . Spontaneous preferences are seldom so deeply rooted in sense or instinct as to be unalterable ; fashion easily reverses them , and even while they prevail they commonly borrow their specious rightness from underlying moral compulsions . After all , on what can imagination feed save on such objects as happen to meet the senses , on the example of other artists , or on the public enthusiasms of the hour ? Personal tricks of intuition will come to modify these themes , harmonizing them with one another and with the temperament of the artist ; but pure taste is not creative , it contains no principle of initial choice , no radical motifs . ' Were the artist a free and absolute aesthete , equally solicited by the plethora of all possible forms , whither should his poor wits turn ? I am afraid he would be condemned to eternal impotence , and would die like Buridan 's ass without being able to choose among those equidistant allurements . But nature luckily breaks the spell , accident has loaded the dice ; and if a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he can not abstract from the human nature within himself . He is animal before he is spiritual , imitative before he is inventive , and in his very inventions he merely turns over and ruminates the pabulum which fortune has thrust upon him . And as nature supplies his initial notions , so she also steadies his hand , and lends depth to his final allegiances . Certainly every aesthetic fashion has its intrinsic charm , felt when some wayward impulse conceives that particular effect , and prefers it . But why that effect rather than another ? For some humble non-aesthetic reason : familiarity , facility , contrast , affinity , chance . The spark  | of spirit requires the contact of material forces not only to kindle it but to give it direction , and fashions become styles only when they are anchored in necessity . What , for instance , could be more intensely and exclusively aesthetic than stained glass ? Yet the art of making it did not arise until non-aesthetic motives were found for it in civil life . It was akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblazonings , memorials , perpetual illustrations of sacred history , festive , dramatic , omnimodal expressions of worship . But soon , when learning became classical , chivalry reticent , and religion puritan , it was in vain for stained glass to retain all its splendour : this very splendour became odious or contemptible ; it corrupted the light ; it confused the eye ; it seemed garish and barbaric , like peasants ' finery . Glaziers were reduced to imitating the effects of paintings on canvas : for their own incomparable art they lost all skill , respect , or enthusiasm . The truth is that the aesthete is essentially an amateur , a poetic spirit listening rather than composing . But in the modern world , where nobody knows where he belongs , it has occurred to him to pose as an artist . In this pretension he shows some democratic shyness . He would blush to confess himself a mere aesthete , coming to be ministered to and not to minister ; he wishes to prove that he has a public function , and to justify his existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary . At the same time , in this very pretension , he shows some democratic conceit ; for he assumes that he is innately competent to do anything that he may fancy , and to do it much better than the poor slaves of training and routine . This is improbable : and in fact the most interesting work done by the aesthetic Soviet is that of old regimental artists who have passed to the revolutionary camp , and who can laugh at their own experiments and revert from them , on occasion , to traditional ways . Such reversion is no recantation . Pure creation , absolute music , has always been the aesthetic essence of the arts : the more completely intuition can transmute and etherealize its materials , the greater its spiritual force . But this creation can not be creation out of nothing ; and here , I think , is the canker in the rose of the aesthetic Soviet , the reason why it seems sometimes to have lost the  | modesty and grace of the garden , and to have become a monstrous orchid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservatory . Intuition is an animal function ; its life comes of employing and if possible unifying the natural movements of the soul and summing them up in some luminous image . The image may be as sublimated as you will , it must not be irrelevant ; the supreme is simple but not arbitrary . In proportion as the interests of the soul are not engaged , the soul will ignore that image , and the image will wither ; the art which embodies it will have but a slender and unsavoury present , and no future . The prophets of the aesthetic Soviet announce that art must be emancipated from nature , and appreciation of art from literature . This is possible ( though by no means exclusively right ) if by literature we understand romantic history or fiction , and by nature visual appearances ; but there is a mother-nature deeply hidden from the eye , and there is a moral world of which literature is the verbal expression ; and from these no human art can be emancipated . All values are natural in their origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very casual and volatile pleasure may touch the moral world only by its innocence , in that it gives vent to some passing impulse , as laughter does , without doing any harm ; but only the most superficial aesthetic effects can be put under that category . An adult work of art , since it has some material permanence , touches other moments beyond that in which it was begotten : it appeals to a moral constituency . If it is to be permanently esteemed it must continue to enrich the sympathetic observer with some emotion which exalts him , or with some perception which he is glad to renew . Otherwise the work abdicates that aesthetic quality which was its original essence , and says nothing to intuition . In its survival , it becomes a moral nonentity ? as indeed all works of art become with time , when the spirit that informed them is obsolete . A monument without aesthetic fecundity encumbers the earth like the stick of a rocket , after its momentary flare has been lost in the intense inane . We must expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but these artists will lose nothing by occasionally joining an aesthetic Soviet for a sort of holiday or carnival . They will return to their workshops greatly refreshed ; for after all the irresponsible aesthetes are the children of light . They have dis- covered afresh how mighty is any technical medium , and how varied are the methods of pure composition : none compulsory and none illegitimate , if only they minister to the life which intuition draws from nature , but enjoys for its own sake .  |
