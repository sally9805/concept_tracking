txt Controller Berry has stood pat on the major recommendations of Charles Edward Smith of St. Louis , his transit expert , it was learned yesterday , and will recommend the inclusion of a seven-cent cash fare as part of his transit plan at his meeting with his Advisory Committee in his office in the Municipal Building today . General Berry , it was learned , has reviltd the Smith report , eliminating some of those parts of it which have been characterized as transit company propaganda , such as Mr. Smith 's assertion that the Hylan five-cent fare policy was really responsible for the Malbone Street subway disaster in 1918 . He has , however , accepted most of Mr. Smith 's recommendations , including operation of a unified system by the existing companies , inclusion of the elevated and surface lines and an increased fare , starting at 7 cents ' cash or four tickets for 25 cents and increasing or decreasing on a sliding scale to make the system self-supporting . ? Approves Preferential Plan . Another recommendation of Mr. Smith , which General Berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the B. M. T. and Interborough preferentials to amortize their interest in their subway lines at an agreed valuation . The preferential of the New York Rapid Transit Corporation , the B. M. T. subsidiary operating its rapid transit line , is $3,500,000 a year , and the Interborough preferential is $6,335,000 a year . Mr. Smith recommended the use of portions of these preferentials " and an additional amount if necessary as payment for ther amortization of the existing railroad . " General Berry , it was said , has changed this recommendation slightly to make it read such portions " as may be agreed upon , " eliminating the phrase " additional amount if necessary . " Virtually all the other recommendations of Mr. Smith have been accepted tentatively by General Berry as the basis for the formulation of a plan for submission to the Board of Estimate after conference with his advisory committee , which consists of Jesse I. Straus of R. H. Macy &; Co. , General George A. Wingate , Surrogate of Kings County , and Elisha Walker , President of Blair &; Co. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased fare have been inclined to criticize General Berry somewhat for naming Mr. Walker on his advisory committee . Mr. Walker is a director of the Chase National Bank , of which Albert H. Wiggin , Chairman of the Finance Committee of the B. M. T. Board of Directors , is President . Gerhard M. Dahl , Chairman of the Board of Directors of the B. M. T. , was formerly a Vice President of the Chase National Bank . and Mr. Wiggin , Mr. Dahl and Thomas L. Chadbourne , i the largest owners of B. M. T. stockl and generally accepted as being in control of the company , all belong , it was said , to what is known as the Chase National Bank group . General Berry said that he believed that he and his advisory committee could consider the Smith recommendations and decide upon a plan after two or three meetings . Other persons interested in transit were inclined to believe that the Controller was too optimistic and that it would be much longer than that before they could agree on and formulate a plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who submitted a five-cent fare plan , denied that any differences of opinion concerning his plan had developed in the Transit Commission or the Board . of Estimate , there is reason to believe , according to other well-informed public . officials , that if such differences had not actually developed they were likely to in the near future . Differences Are.Foreseen . Belief was expressed - that Governor Smith , who has avoided comment on the transit situation recently , would ultimately have to act as an arbiter and try ' to bring about an agreement for the adoption of some plan by the Transit Commission and the Board of Estimate , if any plan is to get through . As viewed by a city official thoroughly conversant with transit matters , the situation at present is about as follows : Mr. Untermyer has presented a plan , calling for the recapture of the B. M. T. subway system and the.Interborough east side subway and their combination with the new city subway system to be operated under Public control at a five-cent fare . John F. Gilchrist , Chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations as the first step toward making them effective , is perhaps the closest personal friend of the Governor . Mr. Smith , transit adviser of Controller Berry , another very close friend of Governor Smith , recommended an increased fare , unification of all transit lines , including elevated and surface lines as well as subways , and the operation of this new unified system by the existing transit companies . General Berry seemingly intends to support these recommendations , although he has not yet done so officially . Governor Smith line been advised in advance of the preparation of both plans , if not by conversation in Person with Mr. Untermyer and General Berry by other friends in this city who keep in close touch with the transit situation . It has been a matter of frequent report that Mr. Chadbourne , with Mr. Dahl , the largest individual owner of B. M. T. stock was a supporter of Governor Smith for the Democratic nomination for President . Mr. Chadbourne , of course , desires an increased fare . Mayor Walker has said repeatedly that he would not consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friends of Governor Smith here have no desire to inject the increased fare issue on the eve of the Governor 's campaign for the Presidential nomination or , in the event of his nomination . on the eve of the Presidential election . Would Welcome Delay . Some of Governor Smith 's friends , it was raid , would welcome a postponement of any further quarrel over tratwit until after the Democratic National Convention at least . How the Governor feels about this , no one pretends to know . It was learned on excellent authority that reports that he had remonstrated with Mr. Untermyer over certain provisions of the latter 's plan were untrue . Reports in evening newspapers that the Transit Commission had decided to drop the proposed Board of Transit Control from Mr. tinter:ewer 's plan were declared by him to be untrue . The commission could not drop this board out of its plan , which is provided for by the statute directing the commission to prepare a plan . What the commission could drop is the method of selecting this board , the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination of various civic organizations . This part of the Untermyer plan has met with strong objection on the part of the City Administration and , it is said , from Governor Smith . Friction Is Denied . " There is no basis for the report that any friction or difference of opinion has developed or is likely to develop between the Transit Commission or the Board of Estimate or myself over the form of control or any other subject , so far as I know , " Mr. Untermyer said . " The question has not even been discussed . " I have-at no time been insistent about the precise form of control or of choosing the directors , so long as the management is stable , reasonably continuous and removed from the lvicissitudes and influences of politics . Ott that We are all agreed . My main insistence has been throughout , and will be , on immediate recapture , improved service and the maintenance of the five-cent fare . " Earlier in the day Mr. Untermyer , ' when asked whether there was not some way of reconciling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly regarding the disposition of the surface lines , said : " Possibly , as indicated on page 60 ** my report , as follows : ' If it should hereafter be found desirable to include the surface lines in a more 1comprehensive unification and they ' can agree among themselves on a reasonable price , there is no reason why that proposition should not re , ceive independent consideration on its merits . It is not practicable at this time . ' " But there are so many powerful and far-reaching interested influences of which we do not know and which can not be uncovered working for an increased fare among the tens of thousands of security holders of the surface car companies that the outlook is not as encouraging as I would like . " At the moment we are engaged in an effort to unify the rapid transit lines . That is the most urgent need . To that end we have always been willing to take over the B. M. T. elevated lines at a fair price , although they are this year 5688,000 short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company has refused to consider any proposal that does not include its losing surface car lines . " For that same purpose the offer has been made to the R. T. to include the Manhattan elevated , notwithstanding its heavy losses . The opposition of the Manhattan stockholders to accepting 70 for their stock , in a 3 per cent city bond , although they lost about 85.000.000 this year . is an indication of the difficulty of dealing with these companies . Up to the Surface Lines , He Says . " If the surface lines would get together among themselves and fix a price on their properties , having regard to their situation . at which the city could afford to take over these properties , there might be some hope ? after we have concluded the unification of the Rapid Transit lines . " It is quite hoepless for the city authorities to make any such effort . If they can between themselves scale down their fixed charges so as to make the surface car systems as a while self-supporting on the ' oasis of their present net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something might hereafter be done . " Meantime the advocates of a higher fare seem widely at variance as to what fare is needed . Mr. Smuth says ** cents would suffice . whilst the leading journalistic champion of higher fares . which has editorial ability of a high order and great influence among the thinking people of the city and which does not hesitate to indulge in personal abuse of everyone who dares to differ on this point , insists in this morning 's editorial , that a ride costs 8 cents . On its plan and on its method of going about it my opinion is that it would cost 10 cents or more . No one would be able to judge how much more until after the event and after the effect of bus operation on the surface lines in known  --  when it would be too late to retrace our steps . " May I suggest also that the discussion is not promoted by characterizing the city authorities and their representatives as Shyloelts ' or by referring to their poitn of view as the ' 5-cent lunacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith in his report . " Mayor to Make Inspection Tour . That Mayor Walker intends to back the Untermyer plan or some modification of it was indicated yesterday whe nit was learned that he intended to inspect tomorrow with Mr. Untermyer and John H. Delaney , Chairman of the Board of Transportation , the most important junction Points and points of congestion on the unified system proposed by Mr. Untermyer , to get an idea of the physical layout of the system . This inspection trip will be made by automobile and the Mayor will get from it an idea of the layout of the new subway system , now under construction . as well as of the existing rapid transit lines . Later it is proposed to make a similar trip entirely by subway . Although Mayor Walker and Controller Berry are expected to differ sharply on the adoption of a transit plan ; it was indicates during the day that they would be tougether in urging the voters of the State to adopt the proposed constitutional amendment to empower the city to borrow $300,000,000 outside its debt limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph A. Fitzgerald , who has had much experience in Democratic State campaigns . would have charge of the campaign to brin gabout the adoption of this amendment .
