For at least half a millennium no one has thought of Chinamen or Chinawomen as pioneers . They have chosen not the virile and womanly covered wagon , but the sendentary and exquisite silken robe . Today China has only one Daniel Boone - the great Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang . Last week he lectured Chinafolk severely for their timid sit-by-the-hearthishness and failure to pioneer . " Is it any wonder , " he roared , " that we are laughed at by imperialist countries , who treat us contemptuously , as though we were their little grandsons ? They do not even esteem us as much as their cats and dogs ! " <P> On his large feet Marshal Feng stands a full , ' massive six feet tall . He towered Gargantuanly , last week , during his address to slender , slant-eyed students of both sexes at the New Nationalist University in Nanking . The students barkened breathlessly , not only because Feng is China 's heroic Daniel Boone , but because he is also War Minister of the new Chinese Nationalist State and moreover absolute master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , Dec. 3 ) . <P> " I am told , " cried Feng sarcastically , " that when men in Honan desire to move to the adjoining province of Shensi in search of livelihood , their wives seize their gowns and sob , ' Ai-ya , my loved one , why will you go to that far-away place ? ' <P> " If we continue as spineless as this , <P> what is to become of us ? Other people 's <P> women spread their sails and travel ten <P> thousand miles to accomplish their pur-j pose . And we ? We progress not a single inch in anything ! " <P> Though his student audience began to mutter at such blanket flaying of all Chinese , forthright , Marshal Feng pressed straight on with his speech , smashing home each point with a sounding fist blow upon the rostrum . <P> " Here in the South we are overpopulated but in the Northwest are great spaces where one may travel for days and hardly meet a fellow traveler . There are wide stretches of fertile land around Ninghsia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dynasty ( 206 B.C.-221 A.D. ) , which are now desolate . But in various sections of this area one may find foreigners entrenched-little , independent kingdoms with their own police , schools , hospitals and wide roads of their own construction . <P> " Who established these little kingdoms ? <P> Let me tell you : it was foreign missionaries and merchants . They have broken much land , and often those in charge of such little kingdoms are only two or three foreign women ! <P> " Now , think of it ! The women of other countries dare the danger of the long journey to these far lands without a tremor , while , needless to say , our women sit idly at home , not so much as stepping outside their own front door . Even our men do not dare take one step toward an ambition to make a new home in distant parts . <P> " Shame upon China 's cowards ! We must have pioneers ! " <P> From almost any other Chinaman such words would have provoked a student riot . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer stuff . He has never worn a silken robe that she could cling to , nor has she ever tried to restrain his bold and virile Daniel Booning . He leads and she presides over his private army-a band of 150,000 pioneering soldiers , each one of whom knows a trade .
