What Makes a First-Pa g6 ' Story ? A Theory Based on the Ten Big News Stories of 1925 FOR the better part of a generation newspaper editors have been quoting Dana to their cub reporters : " If a dog bites a man , that is n't news . But if a man bites a dog , that is news . " All things come to him who waits . After three decades it finally came to pass that in the year 1925 a man did bite a dog . The man 's name was Frank Digger , the dog was a bulldog , and the scene of the encounter was in Pittsburgh . The incident was promptly telegraphed around the country , but rather generally ignored . After the world had waited thirty years for a man to bite a dog , no presses stopped , no sirens shrieked , and neither man nor beast was pictured in the papers . The trouble with man biting dog , from the point of view of first-page headlines , is that it really does n't make a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound enough when it defines news as an interruption of routine and a departure from the expected : for by these tokens an event separates itself from the whole mass of possible truth and becomes capable of news-reporting . But this does not determine emphasis . Over the flood of news thus made available , the editors comb for those particular items which they believe worth playing up on their first pages . And the process by which these items are selected is an important social process . For in large measure it determines what people will read and sometimes think about , and with what degree of interest . Yet this process , though it is tied up intimately with the manufacture of opinion , has had precious little study. , . Much more has been written about Cxsar 's bridges and the eyes of flies . What is it that makes a first-page story for the papers ? II For the sake of applying the case method at least in rudimentary form , rather than starting from a point in space , I have attempted to list the ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the New York Times index , the files of a half-dozen papers in different sections of the country and the suggestions of three news editors of metropolitan newspapers . The results are as follows : None of my editors disagrees and the record itself leaves little room for doubt , as to the biggest single news story of 1925 : that story was the story of the " evolution trial " at Dayton , Tennessee . The nine other stories on the list , with no attempt to rank them in order , follow : The Shenandoah disaster Floyd Collins entombed at Cave City Gunnar Kasson 's race to Nome The coal strike The Caillaux mission The Rhinelander case Gerald Chapman Amundsen 's attempted dash to the Pole Colonel Mitchell 's attack on the Army A second ten might read like this : The Karolyi case Red Grange Locarno Tammany 's defeat of Hylan Paavo Nurmi The oil reserves The fight over Charles B. Warren The eclipse of the sun The Italian debt negotiations The PN-9 ? No. 1 , disabled off Hawaii III Now if it is assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believe that both the average editor and the average reader will find that they include his favorites ) , what is there that they show about the editor 's choice of his big stories ? What is the greatest common divisor divisible into these varied happenings ? Obviously it is no matter of taste or ethics ; obviously it is no matter of ultimate importance to the human race ; obviously it is no matter of final termination of the event itself in some easily classifiable conclusion . For both lists , in the light of any of these attempts at measurement , are a mere jumble . The one certain thing which can be said of each of them is that in the last analysis each item represents a fight . Sometimes the fight is open and avowed : as in Gerald Chapman 's fight for life , Colonel Mitchell 's onslaught on the army , and the war over wages in the coal fields . Sometimes the fight is less explicitly : acknowledged : as when M. Caillaux trades polite proposals with the American debt commissioners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man than of man versus nature : as in the Shenan- doah , ' s struggle with a thunder-storm and Gunnar KassOn 's battle with an Arctic gale . Sometimes , as in the Scopes trial at Dayton , the fight is so much of a fight , and the blows struck echo with so much fury , that nothing save the fight survives the issue in the news . The nature of the fight may vary ; but some sort of fight is present in each instance : even , in some degree , in the story of the sun 's We begin , then , with a fight . It is a second characteristic of the bulk of these twenty stories that the fight is personal . We encounter , here , an essential contradiction . It is my impression that for the press the greatest of all stories , while always partaking in some form of a struggle , are impersonal struggles , elemental struggles , catastrophic struggles . Thus , for example , the outbreak of war in Europe , the sinking of the Titanic , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think ? and it may be true either because elemental and catastrophic forces are infrequently in conflict , or because we prefer not to take note of them as such ? that in the ordinary run of news stories the fight tends always to be a combat between personal antagonists . Thus it happens , for example , that each one of the ten stories in the first list above , with the possible exception of the coal strike , and each one of the ten stories in the second list , with the exceptions of VI line deleted either a personal hero or a personal villain . news story as the story of a personal fight between Mitchell , Caillaux , Karolyi , Collins , Chapman , well identified antagonists ; we can add , I think , this Nurmi , Red Grange , Warren : these are names other qualification : that into the best story enters which have twinkled in the bright lights of the the element of suspense . headlines . How true this is , a comparison of two stories in Perhaps it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first story is the Floyd Collins story .

The race to Nome became a great three ; for that was the final chapter in North Car story when we knew that Gunnar Kasson drove the olina . Nevertheless , this grim story was ignored dogs ; the Scopes trial at Dayton reached its throughout the country . It was never really in the heights only when it had become a bitter per- headlines , and in no metropolitan newspaper did sonal brawl between Bryan and Clarence Dar- it receive , from first to last , so much as six precious row . inches of newsprint . The Collins story , on the other hand , ran on for almost endless pages and into almost endless detail . What , possibly , can account for this amazing difference in emphasis ? One factor we have touched upon : the greater interest in the story of one man as against the story of a crowd of men . A second factor lies in the essential character of news as Dana 's definition sums it up : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of a mine disaster , " happening every day " ; Collins was the average man who risked death of his own accord . But there is also this additional factor : the Carolina story was over in three days , and from the start only one end to it seemed possible ; the Collins story ran on for fifteen days before it was even discovered whether the man was dead or living , and in that space of time the reporters had him many times saved and many times despaired of . In short , the reporters wrote a thriller , and there is no formula for stirring interest which is surer fire . In some form and at some point the element of suspense enters into every great news story : suspense as to the story 's end in life or death , in victory or defeat , in honor or demotion . Gunner Kasson , Caillaux and a coal strike ? the PN-9 , Colonel Mitchell and a battle for the oil reserves : each time interest lies not only in an event which has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to come . The best news story , like the most successful fiction in the magazines , leaves its reader counting hours for the next edition . VII We arrive , then , at this point : that the great first-page story , as it is reflected in the news of 1925 , is the story of a personal fight between well identified antagonists which involves the element of suspense . This definition is broad enough . Yet some light , I think , its does throw upon certain phases of the relationship between press and public . 1 . It is charged by the public against the press that the press is wilfully destructive : that it will print anything derogatory to any man on its first page , and anything commendatory to him on page twenty . Thus , for example , the case of William Brassfield , a Negro arrested in New York City for the murder of a Miss Florence Kane . Brassfield 's arrest was first-page news . The New York Times , for instance , carried the story there , with two full columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exonerated . What happened ? The Times buried this second piece of news on page twenty-one , with three inches of type and a microscopic headline . Was the Times out to do Brassfield as much harm as possible ? I doubt it . The trouble with Brassfield 's exoneration was this : with no fight and no suspense it did not make a story . Do not look to the press for exonerations . Look to it for stories . 2 : It is charged by the public against the press // that there is a touch-and-go quality in the emphasis which the press attaches to its news , utterly destructive to the making of any picture of reality upon which men can act . M. Caillaux 's visit ends : immediately the American press , which has been spreading the French debt lavishly over its first pages , drops the French debt as if it were a hot potato . Yet plainly the French debt has not ceased miraculously to exist ; all of the problems in its payment are still present , still ebbing and . flowing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press flashing like a drunken searchlight in the dark , for the creation of an intelligent opinion in America regarding French obligations ? ? Such criticism ignores one point . Caillaux is gone ; for the first page , that ends it . A personal fight which is no longer personal and no longer a fight , is no longer a story . 3 . Finally , it is charged by the public against the press that its dominating interest is in sex and crime . I think this is to misread motives . The dominating interest of the press seems so often to be in sex and crime because sex and crime , by the standards we have been discussing , so often furnish the best story . For here , compact and vivid , is the personal fight with the well-identified antagonists and the stage set for suspense . And-if theology and religion envy sex and crime , and sigh for first-page space , all that theology and religion need to do is to produce a good personal encounter . Witness Dayton , Tennessee . The quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same great mechanism of news gathering which was put at work in Dayton can be put at work and has been put at work to report prizefights , execu-. tions , Republican conventions and Rhinelander divorce trials . Eagerly , with the same elaborate planning , the same remarkable economy in time , the same outlay in money and the same energy and talent of many men , the press turns from a Leopold and Loeb to the excommunication of a Bishop .
