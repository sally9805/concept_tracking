Tiring of that , they held a brief debate at the lake 's edge as to whether the ice was strong enough for skating . . Some one gave a rash dare and the perilous game of follow my leader was on . The lake is about ninety yards across , and the , boys had slid more than two-thirds of the way when the ice crackled and then broke under them . They plunged into the freezing water so close together that they hampered each other 's efforts to scramble out .. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice , but time and again it broke in their fingers .

He was so near exhaustion by then that he had to abandon the at-tempt Pagan had stripped in the meantime and took up the task , diving into the six feet of icy water in his shirt and underclothing . He got hold of Hauck 's body , but his numbed fingers could not keep their grip and the body slipped away . Fagan was so tired when he came to the surface that he had to be helped out and was unable to stand . Meantime , some one had sent a fire alarm .
