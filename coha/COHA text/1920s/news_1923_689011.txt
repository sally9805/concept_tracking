txt As President HARD His Object nco- 's speech to his Attained associates in . the-OrSuccessfullyder of the Mystic - Shrine w a s well adapted to his auditors and the occasion , it can be called an excellent piece of oratory . He told his brethren what they liked to hear , and , as all- he said would have to be approved by anybody not an out-and-put villain , no critic could charge Win with having sacrificed truth i in ' his desire to . pfease . What might be charged le that his speech , boiled , down to its bare bones . amounted to little or nothing more than the assertion that good secret societies are good and bad ones bad , but that is about what would happen to most speeches at like gatherings , if subjected to the same cruel process , and the Pres.-iderit did take the ' trouble to give his truism a happier form when he said that " secret fraternity is one ' thing ; secret conspiracy is quite another . " What he did not take up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question why fraternity needs to be secret when all its objects are admirable . Therein he was wise , for consideration of that problem would have carried . hfin far into psychology , and probably would have required discussion of certain - human characteristics that reveal the carrying over into adult age of traits which theoretically should , but in reality do not , disappear with childhood or adolescence . An inveterate " joiner " like the President could not be expected to see in " joining " device by means of which men unable otherwise to differentiate themselves from the . common mass can acquire distinction and , ' not . ' infrequently , . resonant titles . Uniforms and regalia , too , appeal to a taste , so ' ancient and so widespread that to treat it disrespectfully would be wrong , even though it does have an element of the amusing . While the PresiAn Omission dent was speaking Easy with such feeling . Supply of fraternities that to are conspiracies . why did he not name the fraternity which , as everybody who heard him knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , would have broken the established usage of such occasions , and would have given some offense to thousands of people claiming to be Americans , but they are people whose disapprobation is an honor , and as what the President did say was quite enough to lose for him and his party the Ku Klux vote , no further harm , from the politician 's point of view , would have been done . While the Klansmen can buy the tolerance , or even the approval , - of not a ? few country parsons by making church contributions of $50 cr $100 , it would have been ? well for the President to speak out , to name names , and to give to the fraternity justly described by him as destructive a rap that would have been felt through even its thick hide . It deserves such treatment at least as much as did the two brothers whose exploits as " joiners " he so humorously described . By the way , how many present day residents of Marion remember the two brothers and can tell an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mayor HmAsi puts His Absurdity out for the considHas Its eration of the Side . pubSerious lic a long eulogy of Eommissioner HIRBHFISLD 'S condemnation of the Amer , lean histories used in our city schools , and to the eulogy he adds an impassioned plea that the great wrong which these books are doing may cease . The chances are that he believes in the truth of his charges against , the " needy scribes " who have sold their pens to foreign financiers , and for pay are corrupting the minds of our children and preparing them for a return of the United States to the status of a British colony . That only makes the situation the more serious . It is possible , of course , to see this as merely funny , but it is not all a joke , even a sorry one : real harm . and a lot of itean be done by the spreading of these notions with such solemnity among the ignorant thousands with whom the Mayor 's high position gives weight to his accusations . For one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very class for .. which those spools can do most  --  the very class for ' which they must do much if the social structure is not to be endangered . . If the school superintendents and princiPals and teachers hive lent themselves for tire to the execution of a plot so wicked  --  and they must have done so if what the Mayor says . is . trueHthen the schools ' have no present . exCnse for , existence and should be swept away in preparation for replacing , them with others under . a wholly different management from the Board of Education down to the kindergarten instructors . They are all guilty  --  or all innocent . As so often , it is the Mayor on one side and the newspapers of the city on the other . He is used to that , and in one way does n't mind the segregation . In another way , however , it enrages him , as is shown by the almost insane wildness of the crimes he sees the press perpetrating daily . CommissionIt Will Count er ENRIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supererogation. personal par ticipation i n the capture of a gunman who had been trying to kill a detective will do more in the way of increasing or confirming the public 's estimate of him as a good policeman than would a hundred letters of commendation from his official superior . To be sure , the Commissioner only did what any other member of his force would have been censured for not doing ? what more than one of them does every day in the ordinary performance . of his duty . What makes the difference is that he risked his life with no more of present obligation to do so than tests upon every citizen who sees a policeman in need of help , and we all know that the average citizen 's tendency almost always is to do nothing at such times except to keep out of trouble and danger . The Commissioner was not content with giving orders when chance brought . him near a battle with a man with a ready pistol . He jumped into the fight with all the courage and zest of his younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still could do police work with the best of them . This may not have been entirely wise , but nobody will mind that . It will create for the Commissioner a large fund of public admiration and goodwill ? a valuable thing for any man , in or out of office .
