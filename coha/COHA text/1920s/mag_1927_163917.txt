An astute observer once remarked : " No man is a hero to his valet . " Disillusioned feminists have substituted the word " wife " for " valet . " Not so Nathalie Sedgwick Colby , who last week uttered an enthusiasm : " He is my husband ; he is far too colossal a person to be encompassed in any single book . " <P> The colossal husband in this case is Bainbridge Colby , Manhattan lawyer . In fact , history might have neglected Mr. Colby , had he not been needed by certain bigwigs . Mark Twain used him as a lawyer ; Theodore Roosevelt needed him as Presidential booster in 1912 ; Woodrow Wilson made him Secretary of State for the final year , after two others had been tried and found disagreeable . Perhaps Mr. Colby used to say to his wife : " Now if I had been President Wilson . . . . " <P> Mrs. Colby had reason to talk of herself as well as her husband last week . She had published a novel with a political twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the characters . Hence , her " colossal " and emphatic reply , to which she added : <P> " I had expected his dignity and power would " protect him from such ridiculous inference . Nothing in the book represents any person or persons I know . " <P> Wives of lawyers and mothers of three daughters do not , as a rule , write novels , so Mrs. Colby proceeded to tell a bit about herself and her work : " This is my first novel . . . . How did I come to write it ? Oh , I do n't think I can tell you that . You see , I believe these things just come out of the subconscious mind . ... I write in longhand and I am so messy about it that each chapter has to be re-written a dozen times . I do n't think I could use a typewriter- the hammering would distract my mind . " ' <P> Undistracted , Mrs. Colby has another novel , Back Stream , coming off the presses later this year ; she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colby - Harcourt , Brace ( $2 ) .
