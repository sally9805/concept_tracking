Sick monkeys squatted in their cages at the Harvard Medical School laboratories last week and languidly , fruitlessly scratched at their flealess bodies . By &; by a man , monstrously big to them and brightly white in his laboratory gown , loomed before their cages . They stared at him , unblinking . He reached into a cage ; a monkey side-hopped away ; but the man caught him . He tried to bite the huge , imprisoning hand ; the man fubbed his face away . Then there was the prick of a hollow needle through the monkey 's skin ; the monkey squeaked and hissed , his mouth wide open ; blood ran out through the needle into a container the big human held . <P> When only a little blood , a harmless loss to the monkey , had flowed out , the man withdrew his needle , went to another monkey , and so to the rest ; then away . The monkeys crouched in their cages , amazed , confused , ignorant that they suffered from infantile paralysis , ignorant that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paralysis Commission had just recently learned how to mix monkey serum with human serum in order to cure infantile paralysis . <P> Infantile paralysis , so far as is known , occurs only in man and he is the sole source of infection . People catch it by breathing air infected by diseased people . Monkeys may be infected in the laboratory . That fact has been valuable in studying the disease ( no one yet knows what germ ' causes it ) and in getting a new source of serum . <P> The disease usually starts with malaise , headache , chills , sore muscles . But many other diseases show the same symptoms ( influenza , for example ) . After the acute stage a paralysis usually develops , most often in the legs . That is the first definite and sure sign of infantile paralysis ( poliomyelitis ) . In epidemics , such the one that terrorized New York City in 1916 , 30 out of 100 infected children may die. * Ordinarily the death rate is four out of 100 . Paralysis has until recently persisted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotted away . Sometimes it was ( and is ) possible to re-educate the paralyzed muscles by long , tedious and intelligent exercise . <P> Bacteriologists recently discovered that blood serum taken from a person convalescing from infantile paralysis can , if injected soon enough , prevent or at least minimize the paralysis . Convalescent serum , however , is scarce . The Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission , which is doing the most extensive work on the subject in this country , has been obliged to ask cripples for ounces of their blood . The serum derived therefrom was sufficient for doles to only the most promising cases . The new monkey- &-man; serum , of course , amplifies the supply . <P> <P> *98% of infantile paralysis cases occur in children under 15.
