. The right and duty of the Italian Senate to sit as the High Court of Justice on impeachment cases was perverted , last week , by a decree of the Cabinet-in which Dictator Mussolini holds seven portfolios. * <P> Hereafter not the whole Senate but a committee of 50 , elected by a majority vote , will constitute the Court . Since there are only some two score anti-Fascist Senators , the Fascist majority in the Senate will hereafter completely dominate the sole tribunal before which Il Duce might conceivably be impeached . <P> . Promulgated by Signor Mussolini for the adoption of his Cabinet was a decree which would compel Italian cinema exhibitors : 1 ) To devote 10% of their total projection time to domestic feature films " if available " ; and 2 ) To pay in rental for these Italian films 26 per cent of their net receipts-thus creating a forced subsidy of the fledgling Italian film industry . <P> <P> *Prime Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , War , Marine , Aviation , Interior , Labor .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
