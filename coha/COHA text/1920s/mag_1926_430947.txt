" W0HELO ! " is what the Camp Fire Girls say when they ceremonially greet each other . Split into three even parts , the word stands for work , health , and love . Shut your eves for a minute , you mother of a new baby girl , you mothers of toddling daughters of two , and four , and six , and ask yourselves what three better things you could want your child to have than those three . Work . Health . Love . If she grows to womanhood knowing all those , trying to develop in understanding and practical demonstration of her three key words , she will run a high chance of being happy . And that 's what we want the children to be , after all ? happy . One mother worries about languages for her little girl , another about dancing or travel , a third about money or social position . But they all want one thing . They want her to be a real person , admired , powerful , educated , able to shape her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , doubt , they save pennies and swallow snubs , they drop old friends and cultivate new ones , pay teachers and dentists and tutors , all for the children 's happiness , and sometimes they even cheat and lie and steal , and go to jail because they did n't care what risks they ran as long as they could secure a bright future for the adored son or daughter ! The tragedy is that these mothers never seem to learn the simple truth that you ca n't buy children 's destinies at the shops , and put them away in boxes on upper shelves . We ca n't teach our children anything ? all teachers know that . Not to brush their teeth or say their prayers , not the ninetimes table nor the capital of Denmark , not nice speech , not nice manners , music , gentleness , honesty ? nothing ! All we can do is draw their attention to what we want them to do and be , and hope and pray that some day ? somehow ? there will be a sudden flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden desire for what is intelligent , and good , and admirable , and desirable . And until that comes , we accomplish exactly nothing . They will obey about the lump sugar while we watch , and snatch it the instant we turn our backs . They will say " Six times five are thirty " until they grow absent-minded and say instead " Six times thirty are five . " They will answer " Yes , Mother ? No . Mother , " in the right places , and when we ask them what the fundamental virtues are , they will begin dutifully , " Pride , covetousness ? " until we stop them and start them off on " Faith , hope , and charity . " " Jimmy , do n't you know that to steal is a terrible thing ? " " Yes . Mother . " " And do n't you know that to take money out of even your mother 's purse is badbad ? bad ? Do n't you know that hundreds of men are in prison , now , this moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Yes , Mother . " " Will you promise me that you will never ? never ? never as long as you live touch anything that does n't belong to you again ? " " Yes , Mother . Mother , did Dad get my tennis racket fixed ? " That is about as deep as mere mouthmorality goes with Jimmy . He 's not interested . He 's merely repeating . And that is why I am all enthusiasm for the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts and the Camp Fire Girls . They have picked and selected and segregated from our civilization those things that they think fine and desirable , and like brave and honorable little pioneers , they have carried them away from the old stupid country , to a newer , cleaner , happier world that is all their own . Work , health , and love , say the Camp Fire Girls , are the things worth having . And under the banner of work , health , and love , what have n't these glorious American girls of ours drawn into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , names , and customs they i have built a great club , a club that promises to grow to be as wide and high and strong and deep as their own growing , widening , deepening personalities . They bring work , health and i love to all that they do ? to tramping , fishing , swimming , camping , riding , to all sorts of games , tennis , hockey , archery , to woodcraft and water-craft , to cooking , sewing , singing , books and plays , to schools and studies ? in short , they do exactly what in our wildest and most daring prayers for them we ask that they some day may do ; they find their own bodies , their own minds , and through these their own souls . AND what fun they have doing it ! What adventures in sunshine and green woods . on snowy hills and in blue waters , what friendships and opportunities , in all the service and excitement and experience of real community life . For a girl 's first duty , when she joins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover whether or not she is brave , healthy and true , whether she is independent or timid , sensible or silly , superfluous or indispensable . Rapidly , almost painlessly , she discovers these and a thousand other things ; not by the old stupid system of listening in dreamy boredom to a teacher only half-heard and half-believed , but by wholesome and memorable contrast of her own nature with a score of other girl-natures . She sees fineness , generosity , valor , gentleness , cleverness ? in a word , she sees " goodness " admired . There is no talk of her mother 's social position or her father 's automobile at the Camp Fire . There is talk of honors , honors that the poorest and simplest girl can win as fast as ? and perhaps faster than ? she can . She begins to wish , with all the desperate fervor i of the early teens , that she could do something they would admire ? swim , build fires , study birds , pitch a tent , bandage a wound . And perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a human being , a person , no longer dependent upon the family 's reputation for her failures and successes . And that moment is a turning point in all our lives , although some persons do not reach it until they are fifty , and some never recognize it at all . The shy , sensitive , timid girl , the talkative , i over-confident girl , the proud , snobbish girl , the feather-brained girl , the unsocial , the toosocial , the hard and unmanageable type , the yielding type ? the Camp Fire gets them all . If a girl does n't like the Camp Fire , and does n't get anything out of it , it only means that of all the girls in town she is the one who needs a treatment of work , health , and love most . Its effect , and its actual life as an organization , have long since made themselves felt in hundreds of communities . School programs and civic programs are beginning to depend  | upon it , and many an honor has been won in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the playground , with benefits to all concerned . For Camp Fire Girls are deeply concerned with the care of children and the sick . with the problem of the alien-born , with just those languages , arts , and sciences that are lying around in ' the neighborhood for them to pick up . What a dream the whole amazing development would have seemed to the working women of twenty short years past . " We 're not really alive , you and I , " a girl who worked beside me in a big office said somewhat sadly many years ago . " Do you realize that ? That 's why we get so blue and discouraged . Perhaps that 's why you hear some of the girls in this place saying that they ca n't stand it any longer . We 're young . And we 're just ? not alive ! " " We are alive , of course . But it 's only that we ca n't do what we want to do , " I offered . " Oh , it goes deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we eat lunches out of baskets , we go home on the crowded street-cars , we press our dresses for tomorrow , and brush our hair , and go to bed . And tomorrow we begin all over again . That 's , " said this girl passionately , " that 's not living . We might just as well be dead ! " Why , I ? " she began again suddenly , resting her arms on the workroom table where we had spread our lunches . " I could be doing such I glorious things ! I 'm twenty . I could he taking walks , camping , swimming , riding , boating ! I could be in theatricals , making costumes , painting sets . I could be dancing , learning new songs , reading new books , cooking new foods . I could be somebody , " she stammered , laying her bright head on the table , and bursting into sudden tears . " It 's all out there in the world ? all the fun ! Forests , brush fires , tents , moonlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we ca n't ? we ca n't get at it . We 'll grow old here , filing papers and copying orders , and nobody will care ! " THE horror of it , the truth of it , struck to my heart like a knife . To this day I remember that hour , a whole quarter of a century ago now , as one of the few truly daunted times of my whole life . It did seem that we were shut in a trap , the unnoted and unimportant little cogs in a big machine , destined to be overworked and underpaid for the rest of our lives . A terrible feeling that , in youth . The feeling that life is n't fair , and that the sweet ? the happy ? years are slipping by , are being eaten up in uninteresting duties , in dull drudgery , and that nobody cares . What if you never dance or swim or sing , little clerk in a big , impersonal office ? the world seems to ask . What if nobody ever knows how pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would bring to a camp in the big woods , or to charades in somebody 's wide attic ? who cares ? Some girls , twenty years ago , used to get bitter about it , sharp-voiced , jealous , silent , drawing more and more into themselves , resentful and cold . Some went the other way , of course , and got some of the fun ? for a while . Not an entirely desirable sort of fun , even at best , but theater tickets and suppers enough , and coats with fur collars . And some prayed about it and cried about it , looking wistfully out into the sunshine where the luckier girls played , and whispered to their wet pillows : " Oh , God , please ? some day ? let me have just a little of it ? the swimming , the tennis and boating , the camping and dancing and singing ? the friends . " For that 's what we all want , after all , if it must be packed into one word . We want friends . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . The richest and most beautiful girl in the world is a pauper until she has exactly that ? friends . And the poorest girl is n't really poor while every one in her circle loves her , while laughter and affection and welcome meet her on all sides , while loving  | eyes watch for her in the shabby rooms at night , and loving voices praise her . " Friends , " we would have said , summing up the real need of our lives , ' and a chance to do ? to do things with them . To have fun ! To be able to afford good times . " For you must understand , you more fortunate girls of today , that there was a time , not so long ago , when the rich girls really did have most of the good times , and the poor girls were at a disadvantage that was n't all imaginary . Life was very hard for poor girls then . There were a great many innocent and delightful things that they simply could n't have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . They did n't know as much about themselves as girls do today , and the long office hours ? often from eight to six ? made them nervous and ill , upset stomach and nerves . Most of them lived in a sort of purgatory of indigestion , chills , headaches , backaches , chronic fatigue , and boredness and depression . Girls were bilious , they had bad skins , they fainted , they cried . They went home at night too tired to do anything but make a light meal of pork chops , cucumber salad , fried potatoes , hot rolls , coffee , and lemon meringue pie , and crawled into bed . They were sensitive ; they imagined that they were unpopular . Some were enormously fat , and laughed at ; some were lean and spotty and dyspeptic and ills tempered . Nowadays girls are not like that ? at least Camp Fire Girls are not . By the time they are I ready to go into business they have had actual years of experience in the fine art of living sensibly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airs of heaven blowing over them , not one , but a hundred , nights . They have rubbed off the stupid , limiting corners of their characters against a score of enlightening , wholesome friendships . They have learned to respect useful labor , in any and all forms . And above all , they have friends . Real friends , tried and sure , girls of their own type , who are beginning their lives in the bigger world , too , and bringing the pledge of early Camp Fire days to the real business of living . How many of you mothers , who indulgently and amusedly think that the whole thing is rather charming and unimportant little-girl foolishness , could live up to their pledge ? How many of you know it at all ? This is the pledge : " Seek beauty ; give service ; pursue knowledge ; be trustworthy ; hold on to health ; glorify work , and be happy . " The world would be a different place if a few of us older women borrowed that standard from the Camp Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to live by it . THINK , for example , of the five women you know most intimately , married women with homes and children . How many of them know that health and trustworthiness and work and service are the most wonderful things in life ? How many of them would understand a talk I heard once between two Camp Fire Girls , years ago , when I was the proud guardian of a group of them ? One was our leader ; a handsome , sweet , wholesome , unusually intelligent girl , whose ceremonial dress was beautiful with honors , who wore chains with actual hundreds of eloquent beads describing her active , happy years in the club . The other was a nervous , suspicious , sensitive beginner , just making her wampum head-band , just aspiring to first honors . But what a singing voice she had , and how she played the violin ! We three were washing dishes in camp . I ca n't do anything ! " said the newcomer despairingly . " I get nervous , and forget words , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other girl , Kadee-ah , eyed her thoughtfully . Not gigglingly , nor hysterically , nor indifferently , but with real sisterly concern . " We all make mistakes at first , " she offered .  | And she added : " The only hopeless girls are the ones who come in knowing everything . They 're the ones that never get anywhere ! ! " Just to have one girl of sixteen know that much of eternal truth is to justify the existence of the Camp Fire . But as a matter of fact hundreds of them begin to glimpse it , to glimpse those secrets that so many of us learn only too late , and at so terrible a cost . In short , I see in this Camp Fire movement a wonderful and an inspiring thing , an international movement the value of whose ' effect is absolutely incalculable . There is something at once noble and touching and heroic about it . It is as if our girls said something like this to us , their mothers and aunts and seniors generally : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false ideals ; you would have prisoned our bodies in tight stays and high heels and dragging skirts , and our souls in the realm of poetry books , and painting on satin , and fussing with White Mountain frosting and puff paste . You would have made us think that there was no need to bring knowledge or intelligence to wifehood , and that motherhood was an accident to be devoutly dreaded . You taught us that headaches and backaches and bad skins and clogged systems and nerves were all part of our natural inheritance . You set us the example of despising housework , of doing only as little office work as sufficed to hold our jobs , of fearing and hating other women , and of leaving all the glorious work of the world to servants ? if we were lucky enough to get them . " Now we 've going out to find something better , to find freedom and self-expression , all the beauty and rapture of the woods and fields and beaches , everything that we 've always known was awaiting us ? big things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful and all good ! " WELL , perhaps they do n't exactly say that . Young persons are strangely generous to the generation that went before ; they seem inclined to give us the credit for being almost as wonderfully wise and right as we think we are , in the first place . And in the second , they are n't deeply interested in us . But if it did come into their heads to address us in this way , they would not be very far from the facts . We have n't built a particularly firm foundation under their feet , nor set them an example of wisdom and fellowship . They see us leading chaotic and ill-regulated lives , harrassed by debt and discontent , by chronic poor health and social uneasiness ; they see our despair when a third-rate cook leaves us , our placid contempt for system and budget , our mean little subterfuges and pretences , at card1 table and tea-table and telephone ; they hear us say " I wish , " a thousand times for every once " I will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that they have found their own way out ? They will make better women than we did , saner and wiser and happier . They 'll tell their children and grandchildren of the funny things we did , like staying indoors , and eating rich meals three times a day , dyeing our hair and our cheeks , our lips and our finger-nails , leaving the most wonderful hours of our children 's lives to servants , riding in closed cars the miles we might have walked , watching the ocean rather than plunging into it , because of the permanent wave in our hair . And the children of 1950 will say incredulously : " We ca n't believe it ! " For what they make themselves , as little girls , will not stop short with girlhood . The work , the health , the love of today will be the heritage of their children , and their children 's children . It is our privilege to realize the big thing that they are doing , and to help them . Sometimes they need sympathy , encouragement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is our share . Sometimes they need our big estates , our beaches and our forests to play in ; sometimes they need town  | halls and school houses , permits , understanding interest from press and public . These we can give . And in giving them we do what the Camp Fire Girls pledge themselves to do when they rise in the ranks , and reach the " Fire Maker 's Desire . " This is what they say : " I will tend , As my fathers have tended And my father 's fathers Since time began , The fire that is called The love of man for man , The love of man for God .  |
