Last week , Death came to Willard L. Metcalf , famed artist . He succumbed to a heart attack while sitting at breakfast in his Manhattan studio . <P> Willard Metcalf , 66 , was born in Lowell , Mass. , apprenticed when 17 to a wood-engraver , later to one George L. Brown , landscape artist of South Boston , in whose service he got up at six o'clock , walked ten miles to work , swept out the studio , built the fire . Saving his pennies , he got together enough to go to Paris where , it is said , he lived on " three cents a day " studying under Boulanger and Lefebvre . Occasionally he sold a picture . In 1888 , one of his paintings was hung in the Salon . Tired of his poverty , he left Paris , became a magazine illustrator in Manhattan- an occupation which brought him fame and plenty of money . When he was 40 , he renounced illustrating , went to Maine and spent a year in solitude , painting continually . <P> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought not less than $2,000 . His Benediction- the painting of an old New England meetinghouse at Kennebunkport , Me. , standing , proud and sombre , in the moon 's white downpour- sold for $13,000 . Always it was the New England scene that attracted him- meagre pastures fenced with stones , the delicate austerity of brown fields , sparse uplands , the monotones of spring and fall , the blue , flinty shadows of snow . His painting , like his life , was in the best U. S. tradition .
