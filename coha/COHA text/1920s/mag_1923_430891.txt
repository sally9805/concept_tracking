The dress of nations is the outcome of widely varying influences climate , history , occupations . Even patriotic crises , wars , and religious movements have left their impress . Today , alack ! garments reflecting tradition and embracing native crafts are passing . Except in primitive lands and remote provinces , the styles worn by men and women of all classes are dictated , for the most part , by fashion and convention , whereas in more pictorial times decorative dress was a matter of racial pride and glory . Gaiety of line and color have yielded little by little to the demands of modern life . Nevertheless , a wanderer in Continental Europe to-day , seeking communities where national dress still prevails , would find his pilgrimage not in vain . Nowhere was greater variety of costume evolved than in old-time Sweden , for its character differed not only in the provinces but in parishes and villages . In scattered districts one may even now discover dress that reflects the original type . The garments worn by men are more influenced by changing conditions than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical skill and charm of color in the making of costume that exists throughout other Swedish crafts . In olden days the elders of a parish ? kept a watchful eye on all that pertained to native costume , and issued edicts governing its design . Fines were levied for wearing broader heels than custom called for , and in other ways traditions affecting sartorial details were safeguarded . The province of Dalecarlia presents the best opportunity to study costume peculiar to Sweden . The women do luxurious embroidery on linen ,  | and when girls are to be married they always present to their future husbands a " bridegroom 's shirt . " Mothers start their daughters upon the important task of making this garment when they are still very young , so that there shall be plenty of time to create a gorgeous article of apparel . If one were to " tread on the tail " of one of these Swedish marriage shirts , it would be at the risk of spoiling a real work of art . Button , button , who 's got the button is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes there are buttons , big and little , all of silver or silver gilt . These originated in medieval times , when buttons in the shape of bells adorned bodices and jackets . " The quicker the bride runs , the greater the honor in which she shall be held " is an old Scandinavian proverb . Now it is no little thing to run when dressed for a Swedish wedding . The bridal crown of silver may weigh two pounds , not to mention other silver ornaments . The central figure of the wedding party clanks like a veritable knight in armor . She is a flashing picture of color , rich embroidery , and shining silver . Carl Larsson , whose home in Sunborn , Dalecarlia , was patterned after ancient manor houses of Sweden , left many paintings and drawings giving a true impression of his people and their dress . Anders Zorn , whose reputation as a painter and etcher was worldwide , also commemorated on canvas the vivid beauty of the costumes worn by his countrymen . In Norway , land of fjords , mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen except on holidays and at weddings , and then only  | among the farmer folk . However , up in the mountains , in the region of Saetersdalen , travelers , to their delight , find everything much as it was three hundred years ago . Perhaps it is because tourists so rarely go into this northern district that the picturesque quality of life there still remains unspoiled . The people of Saetersdalen are light-hearted and simple of habit . They revel in dresses set off with embroidery and silver . Peasant craftsmen have worked out old Norse designs , recalling Viking days . A Saetersdalen woman cares so much for her dress that , though she wears it to work , she removes it when she gets to the fields , and does her digging and plowing in a gray under-dress . Brides wear a red cap with silver spangles . The sleeves are of violet , underneath is a white blouse and a green belt profusely stitched in silk and wool . She , like the Swedish brides , jingles as she moves , because of the multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wedding festivities , which often last for days . The painting on the cover of this number of The Mentor shows one of these glistening wedding costumes on a fair young Norwegian bride . Exceedingly attractive is the costume of the peasantry in Finland . The skirts and blouses worn by women when bent upon daily duties are individualized by bands of embroidery ; the headdress , also the shoes , reflects Oriental beginnings , for the origin of the Finnish race is traced to Eastern tribes . The Finns are inordinately fond of outdoor life ? of sunlight , and meadows  | bright with flowers . Their clothes express this love of freedom and color , and also reveal the industry of the women at their looms and with their needles , which they diligently ply during the long days and nights of the winter time . Russia is so vast , with such a variety of physical types , that the student of costume must necessarily limit somewhat his range of investigation . Crossing from the southern peninsula of Finland to Petrograd , the traveler is confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type ? the isvoschik , or cab driver , " a pure Slav , with thick , coarse hair cropped low in his neck and a hat with squat crown crushed down to his ears . His broad face appears from under the curled-up brim with a calm serenity which is not without its measure of cunning . He sits his box in the cab rank , stoical but alert . His long blue armyak is generously gathered at the line where the skirt joins the body . This ample garment , peculiar to Russian cabmen of all degrees , is so padded from shoulder to hip as to render corpulent the leanest of cabbies . A tinseled belt satisfies his native fondness for decoration . " Costume in that part of southern Russia called the Ukraine has unique appeal . Says a writer familiar with the country : " The essential characteristics of Ukrainian dress are its freedom from exaggeration , and  | its intricate ornament . Notwithstanding the invasions of machine-made materials , the Ukrainian still sticks to his hand-made cloths . " In Kieff , a principal province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark colors predominate . Floral motives are much used , especially on linen , The men 's dress is quite simple , usually a white shirt , much embroidered , and wide linen trousers , with an overcoat of homespun cloth , drawn in at the waist . The women , in their bright skirts decorated with elaborate needlework and contrasting bands of color , wear waists of white linen , also embroidered . The girls dress their hair in plaits coiled around the head , and add a wreath of fresh flowers . A married woman always covers her head with a cap . A housewife performs most of her tasks in the open , for the Ukrainian loves the world out of doors . Along the shores of the Volga River , which separates western from eastern Russia , costumes are a perennial interest to the stranger . There is no better place to observe the varying developments of tribal dress than at the worldfamed fair of Nizhni Novgorod . Here are merchants from Bokhara and Turkestan , from the tundras and cities of Siberia , from the Caucasus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; above all , the Tatars are in evidence . During the middle of August , when the trading is heaviest , this meeting place of nations and international exchange offers a panorama of na- tional costume unsurpassed in Europe . In the wake of Oriental exodus from southern Europe was left a kind of mantle with short sleeves , still worn by Hungarian men and called sziir . Counterparts of these jackets have been discovered on a Persian stone relief . As in other Slavic countries , the women 's costumes in Hungary are elaborately embellished with needlework . The apron is a feature on which special care is expended . Frequently it is black with a fine border in primary colors . There is no gayer sight in the world than a highroad in Hungary on Sunday morning , or a marriage feast . Scarlet jackets for women are the vogue , and much white is also worn . In the southern basin of the Rhine , within the borders of the Grand Duchy of Hesse , the costume of the inhabitants has been little affected by the passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , youths and maidens deck themselves in a manner reminiscent of their forebears . A farmer 's daughter arrayed literally in all her glory is on her way to market . She wears a black silk hood with broad bow ends coquettishly spread beneath her chin . A short sleeveless jacket is buttoned over a white blouse , and skirts upon skirts give her a decidedly stand-outish effect . Above all or , rather , beneath all ? is displayed the distinguishing note of the Hessian girls ' dress : silken garter ends , bravely adorned with flowers . Shoes with large silver buckles complete a thoroughly smart outfit . A charming model painted by Alma Erdmann represents a Saxon beauty in the accepted costume of her country . How winning the smile , how pretty the poise of the head graced by a black beribboned cap ! What good things she will bring home in the bag of braided straw ! She carries the family umbrella of dark blue with striped border . The strong men of the Tyrol fit well into their environment . To see them early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , is an experience not to be forgotten , especially when the sun is just touching the peaks of the snow-capped mountains . Franz Defregger , himself a Tyrolean ,  | often painted the people native to these mountain farms , and their attractive daughters , whose dark beauty is well set off by the frame of broad shade hats . Of all the Continental countries that invite tourists , none surpasses Switzerland in the charm of its peasantry and their time-honored observances . Within a few years a movement has been started by well-todo Swiss women to encourage the revival of national dress . Costumes originating in bygone centuries had gradually been discarded , except in the Rhone Valley and in a few cantons where it was worn on holidays only . The Swiss artist Ernest Bielier returned to his native land , after a successful career abroad , to assist in this costume propaganda . He now gives most of his time to painting pictures of his countrymen and women in the dress of their ancestors . The reproduction of " The Little Red Horse " shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black silk cap of a design familiar in her native cane  | ton , an orange-colored neckerchief and a dark blue dress . The baby is all dressed up in a white knitted cap and a fascinating frock with knitted and embroidered sleeves . The red horse is a favorite Swiss toy . The women of Switzerland show a preference for knitted decorations , in contrast to the embroidery and lace popularly used in other lands . An imposing headdress worn by young Swiss women is a reminder of Roman occupation centuries ago . It resembles the helmet of a Roman soldier in its high crest-like shape . This and other historic Swiss headdresses are shown in a decorative panel from the brush of Ernest Bielier . In the mountains one often sees a goatherd with his flock . He always wears a colored skull cap ; the color varies according to the province , or canton . A leather shoulder strap supports a pouch that holds salt for the goats . National dress still prevails in many regions of France . N:specially proud of their linen and lace caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their caps you shall know them . " Coarse dark blue or brown cloth is a favorite material for dresses , and velvet is also used . Always the women knit , both for the men and themselves . The shoes , usually of wood , do nothing to add to the grace of the wearer 's feet , but , like many other elements of costume seen in Europe and elsewhere , the sabot is the product of local conditions . The wooden shoe is a better protection than one made of leather in wet fields and on tide-washed shores , such as those of France , Belgium , and Holland . The dress of the seafaring Dutch is not unlike that of their Brittany  | and Normandy brothers . In the gravure section of this issue are reproduced a number of delightful pictures by the American painter George Wharton Edwards . As an artist and author who knows Holland well , we are indebted to Mr. Edwards for information concerning Dutch fashions . The country , first settled by Germanic peoples , later came under the influence of Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen of Roman and Spanish domination in dress and decoration . The best that remains in Holland of ancient costume is to be found on the island of Marken , and in Friesland and Zeeland , though it is not entirely abandoned in other sections . Two circumstances in particular have had much to do with the regrettable disappearance of the costume native to Dutch provinces : when the young men enter military service and don the uniform , they seldom , if ever , go back to the old dress ; country girls going out to service in the large centers adopt prosaic  | " city clothes . " The people of Marken , on their comparatively inaccessible island , cling to old customs . The men affect a divided skirt ending at the knee , which is possibly of Oriental origin , or possibly medieval German . A blue shirt is worn with this , and the ever-present pair of silver buttons fasten the collar . The women wear silk or woolen skirts over numerous petticoats , and a white laced bodice . Their hair is cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the face , and when they grow old these ( it is whispered ) are replaced by false curls . Their sleeves are knitted , as in Switzerland . One of the most interesting features of Dutch costume is the headdress of the women of Friesland . Every province has its distinguishing forms . Frieslanders wear plates of pure beaten gold , fitting the head closely , beneath an immaculate cap . The twisted ends at the front gradually evolved into the spiral ornaments which are seen to-day fastened at either side of the forehead . Carefully wrought silver belt clasps , for both men and women , and buttons and other ornaments of silver and gold are especially popular in Holland , and are willed as legacies from one generation to another . Spain and Portugal still retain traditional costumes , some of them derived from the Romans , others from the Moors . In the north of Spain colors are subdued , or if bright ones are used they are combined with black or dark brown . The mountaineers about Segovia wear sandals , with legs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , and a wide-brimmed felt hat over the inevitable handkerchief bound round the head . A staff frequently completes this austere but natty attire . A familiar figure in Spanish streets  | j. is the night watchman , the sereno , whowalks abroad with a heavy striped blanket about throat and shoulders . He carries a spear and lantern , and , around his waist , a huge leather beltwith rows of pockets filled with keys the keys to the doors of householders on his beat . As for young bloods who consider themselves " mirrors of fashion in the mold of form , " they appear on Spanish streets in the north with hair banged and brushed forward over the ears , in imitation of the bullfighters . Their hats are flatbrimmed , their short coats are of black velvet , and red sashes bind their narrow hips .  | The lean brown women of northern Spain , in their low-toned dress and head covering , are as typical of the country as the flashing senoritas of the south . Yet it is these southern women that travelers love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beautiful as we have dreamed them to be , nor do they wear the mantilla and full satin skirt every day , as painters and writers would have us believe . But at fiesta and feria , how rich the shawls , how entrancing the lace head scarf of white or black , how effective the fan and the comb and the camellias ! Certain annual festivals observed by highborn Spaniards are made the occasion for rarely beautiful costuming descended from grandees of other days . The Andalusian muchacha perhaps she is one of several dark-eyed girls dancing at a spring fair ? " poses in a flounced skirt that springs like a bell over lacy petticoats . The long fringe of her red and white or blue-green shawl drips from shoulder and dress . She carries a flower in her mouth ; in her hair is a mammoth comb . Her partner is a slim youth , tight-trousered , short jacketed , belted high with a bright sash . " To a still greater extent than in Spain the Portuguese peasantry commonly wear the dress that custom and necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothills of North Portugal , according to an American woman who has traveled extensively in this beautiful realm beside the sea , " are the handsomest in the country . Their costume can be surpassed nowhere in Portugal , or out of it , for the manner of its wearing , for its colors and weaving . Here is a blond goddess with Diana limbs . Her chemise is of lawn , the skirt , ample as her stride , is of wool grown on her own hillside , spun on her own spindles ; on the yoke of her black velvet apron her initals are embroidered . Her breast is weighted with golden ornaments , and she wears long earrings . " In Italy many peasant costumes have passed away with the times that produced them , but enough remain to reward one bent on pursuit . Changes in dress are mainly due to the development of railway communications , and to emigration .  | One also sees wonderful gold and silver button clasps and earrings , to say nothing of necklaces and other jewelry , for the Italian loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward off the " evil eye " if one does not wear it ? From childhood , Italian peasants wear certain kinds of jewelry calculated to protect them against misfortune . In the Abruzzi district one may still find native costumes in profusion . In their variety they are significant of both the temperament and climate of the region . Somber and severe where the climate is vigorous ; gay near the sea . Red is the prevailing color throughout Italy in one form or another . Servia can show costumes as colorful and original as those of the Ukrainians . Rumanian women are so expert with the needle that their designs are copied wherever fashion reigns . In Dalmatia , costumes of centuries-old pattern are still preserved . Dalmatian men , reversing the traditions of sex , do fine embroidery in gold and proudly wear jackets that demonstrate their industry and ability . Within the borders of what was once called Montenegro national dress is still worn in town and country . Before political changes , brought about by the Great War , even the king appeared in the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An Albanian calls himself " Son of the Mountain Eagle , " and well deserves the name , for always has he lived among barren crags , holding his independence and racial habits against the inroads of Turk and Greek . To his western neighbor he has passed on the long pla ited skirt which the sturdylimbed sons of Greece have adopted for both ceremonial and working costume . The most significant feature of Albanian apparel is the shortsleeved jacket of black , which for five centuries has been worn by the stalwarts of this rugged land as a constant reminder of the death of their national hero , Scanderbeg , who in the fifteenth century fought through twenty-five campaigns against the Turks , and freed his country from the oppressor . The Albanian women , in their almost purely Oriental costume , make an annual offering of flowers at the Castle of Scodra , in memory of the " Dragon of Albania . " Here , near the eastern frontier of Europe , the wanderer ends his pilgrimage .  |          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
