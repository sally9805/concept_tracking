Previous to this declaration Senator Smoot , Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , who with other Republican leaders has been studying economic and political questions since Congress adjourned , estimated that the surplus would reach as high as 8600,000,000 . If this figure was reached , he said . Congress would be justified in reducing taxes $500.000.000 , with special relief being afforded to corporations and those paying the medium surtaxes .

Whatever the Administration proposes will be done with caution , with the possibility of a recession in business in view . The President does not believe there will be a drop in business which would wipe out the surplus now indicated . He recalled , however . that Garrard B. Winston , former Under-Secretary of the Treasury , told him before leaving the Treasury that a 10 per cent , recession in the business of the country would wipe out all the surplus in prospect .

" I can not foresee at this time why the tax cut should not go as high as $500,000,000 , " said Senator Smoot . " Of course , that prediction is based on the belief that the surplus will not be less than $600,000,000 . If there is a falling off in business the reduction will be less , but the surplus at this time appears to justify a reduction within my figure .
