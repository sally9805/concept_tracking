Revolutionary soldiers drag their commander , Li Yuan-hung out from under his wife 's bed . The year is 1911 . Li protests . He is loyal to the Manchu Emperor . No ! He will not lead the soldiers as a unit in the great revolution ! ! But then , on second thought , he does . <P> The year is 1916 and Li , now in his second term as vice president of the Chinese Republic , takes the last hurdle to power , when death comes to President Yuan Shinkai . <P> Now , however , the era of coups d ' tat by Chinese military leaders is dawning and ' President Li is illegally deposed in 1917 . <P> Li is restored to his constitutional office in 1922 , but now the coups d ' tat are merging into civil war , and Li , the last constitutional President of China , is deposed again in 1923 . <P> He lives on quietly in Tientsin , forgotten , until last week , when death came .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
