Ten thousand feet above Chicago , Jack Cope stepped out the cabin door of his airplane , counted 28 before he pulled the parachute cord , landed buoyantly among a golf foursome . In the 13 seconds before the parachute opened he had fallen 3,400 feet , a new sheer drop record . <P> Sergeant Boes , army flier , once descended 2,200 feet before pulling the cord . Dropper Cope modestly attributed his record to confusion . He had intended to count only to 20.
