The second of the Michigan criminal syndicalism trials opened with the selection of a jury to try Charles F. Ruthenberg , former Secretary of the recently dissolved Communist Party . The defense attorneys , led by Frank P. Walsh , former joint chairman ( with ex-President Taft ) of the War Labor Board , and defender of William Z. Foster , devoted most of their attention to questioning prospective jurymen in regard to their prejudices against Karl Marx , internationalism , the Soviet Government of Russia , organized labor , strikes and kindred topics . <P> The fact that the Department of Justice used agents provacateurs to trap the Communists was one of the sensational revelations of the Foster trial . The State revealed the identity of another " under cover " man from the Department by adding the name of Louis Lobel to the list of witnesses against Ruthenberg .
