separation of the Church and the State . This separation has become an arrogant ideal , whereas it should be the confession of man 's failure . If Church and State mean anything at all , their divorce is that of spirit and body , of thought and deed . To make of this a social goal is to crown chaos . Religion and politics must form a whole , if either is to be a part of health . The peace that is gained by disestablishing their union is the peace of death . Europe glories in this euthanasia . It goes farther : it divorces actual from formal government ; subtly in such lands as France , graciously in Great Britain , crudely in Italy and Spain . Spirit goes one way , mind goes another , body goes a third . Spirit is disembodied ; body is lightless . . . . Pick out your own proof of the death in Europe . . . . The life of western man as an organic Body reaches fullness in what we call the Middle Ages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean world is here made integral of a Whole which each man shares . Aristotle , Plato , Plotinus , the Prophets , the Patrists , the knights , the monks , are men who builded it ? and all men live it . Pope Gregory VII , who declared Rome 's unitary lordship , makes for it a heart . Aquinas gives it logic and a mind . Dante and Wolfram ' and Petrarch sing its ultimate song . Its flaws are fatal , and we shall understand them when we consider what it meant by Knowledge and by action . But its splendor is immortal ; for it is the first conscious attempt of occidental man to create with all the man and with all men an embodied spiritual Whole . Its symbol is the Mediterranean Sea which motheyed it : the sunlit , bounded , middle water . Now , at its height , it begins to die . And the symbol of its death is the Atlantic . In no true sense was America discovered by Columbus . He , Vasco da Gama , and the explorers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . They discovered the Ocean . The ' Way found by Columbus is the antithesis of the Latin Sea : it is uncharted , it leads to limitless lands . Its unboundedness is the symbol of that old symbol 's ' - passing . Men 's thoughts and ' dreams had bridged the Mediterranean . For ages , east and west , south and north , the littorals had mingled . Europe came of this . Now , parabola-wise , men 's dreams move to the Ocean and Europe begins to die . The conquest of world power , by arms and science ; the political crumbling of the Catholic State ; the religious vagrancies that follow Luther ? all the modern shift ! . in value and in power , are traits of Europe 's dis7. location . And they are traits , as well , of the new  --  Way ? the Atlantic . A body breaks . Potent but no more intact , its energy flows outward .

And the old Mediterranean dies . Into the At " lantic flows its death : the new search of man , the new earth-wise boundlessness . Beyond the symbolic Ocean there will be found- a land , misnamed at first , misjudged , not yet revealed : America . WALDO FRANK , Lady , Save Those Mineral Salts ! HITE-COATED , efficient , glib , the demonstrator for the Club Aluminum Utensil Company , makers of " heavy molded aluminum cooking utensils which enable housewives to prepare food without loss of food elements " was entertaining fifteen Washington citizens at dinner . The price of the dinner was our presence in the kitchen of one of the group while the meal was being cooked , and our close attention to Mr. Jackson as he moved among his pots and pans , demon.strating the alleged superiority of his brand of kitchen utensils ( price $192.20 for the complete set ) over any other brand now in use . Later we were to have a forty-minute talk by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polite reception to an agent who would call at each of our homes the next day to take orders . ( If you do n't care for the entire set , madam , we can give you the essential pieces for $166.75 , or three saucepans for $19. ) 1 The author of " P. 7.114 " While we dined at the expense of the Club Aluminum Company , thousands of other persons in cities from coast to coast were being similarly entertained . The company , organized in Illinois in 1923 , has found that the advertising method of free demonstration meals pays well . Witness its financial report in an October number of the Coal ; mercial and Financial Chronicle : " Net profits of the company for the current fiscal year will probably reach $1,500,000 after charges and taxes , accord ' ing to President William A. Burnette . Mr. 130. : nate estimates that for the quarter ending SePtenv ber 30 , 1927 , a gain of 70 percent over the NC responding quarter of 1926 will be reported . Th , t gain follows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales for 1926 over sales for 1925 , which in tor " ' - reported a 386 percent gain over 1924 . " This for r vertising method is also probably responsible-fo the fact that Club Aluminum is about six times as expensive as other utensils of aluminum , enamel , some composition . competing manufacturers of expensive kitchen equipment , are combining psychology and super-salesmanship in a drive on American housewives , upsetting family budgets , but netting the manufacturers millions in profits . They have found women encouragingly open to the argument that by using a particular brand of cooking utensils they can improve the health of their families . The arguments are backed up by much pseudo-scientific talk of conservation of soluble mineral salts , vitamins and what not , usually a badly warped version of the latest findings of home economics experts . Unless the , housewife remembers her high-school and col- lege chemistry and is acquainted with recent scientific research on food preparation , she accepts the extravagant claims at face value , discards her old cooking utensils in which she could accomplish the same results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money which she would do better to spend on good food . The nation-wide selling campaign of the Club Aluminum Company of Chicago , probably the most successful of these drives , is a typical example of the misstatements of scientific facts , the exaggerated claims , made by many manufacturers . As Mr. Jackson bustled around the stove discussing conservation of mineral salts and vitamins by " waterless " cooking in extra-heavy aluminum , some of us recalled how aluminum was introduced over twenty years ago . Boys worked their way through college by selling combination egg poach- ers , steamers and custard pans in vacation time . They spread their wares out on the floor of the Main Street front porch or living-room , and the housewife , buying it because it was light weight and easy to cleati , added considerably to the fortunes of Mr. Andrew Mellon . There was no talk of Mineral salts . Now she is being told that she must discard her ordinary aluminum . utensils , just as she discarded copper or enamel ones , and stock her kitchen with Club Aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other brand . Mr. Jackson 's salesmanship , as he demonstrated how to cook a complete dinner in Club Aluminum , Was superb , but a trifle misleading as to facts . He held out a closed kettle . He invited us to sniff , and defied us to tell from the odor what was cooking inside . There was no odor . Carrots are odorless no matter what they are cooked in , so I guessed carrots . " Good guess , " said Mr. Jackson brightly . " But .. 4,11 wager you ca n't smell them . Vegetables cooked n Club Aluminum without water never have any Anything can be cooked without water in t.n'e , , se utensils , except possibly rice and coffee . LINote : Call Mr. Jackson 's attention to a recent = stliy b I Simpson go and E. G. Halliday of the 3.7 end versity of Chica on the necessity for using 14ter in cooking cabbage , cauliflower and the group of vegetables containing sulphur compounds . Just think , ladies and gentlemen , " continued Mr. Jackson with growing enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to health , which you have been throwing down the kitchen sink , because you cooked vegetables in ordinary utensils which required added water . Is it any wonder that your children have pale cheeks , that your own teeth decay and your hair falls out , that thousands of our young men were rejected in the draft as physically unfit , when you consider the mineral salts that have been thrown down American sinks ! " Now remember , ladies and gentlemen , these carrots are going to taste better than any carrots you have ever eaten . That is because they are cooked without water . This is made possible by the use of our heavy aluminum utensils , from which none of the steam carrying these valuable mineral salts can escape . " The idea of mineral salts escaping in steam was vaguely disturbing , but being , as it were , a guest , I could not call Mr. Jackson 's attention to a statement remembered from a well known textbook on general chemistry by McPherson and Henderson , or similar statements in any elementary chemistry textbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , being non-volatile , remains in the container in which the water is being boiled . " It would also have been ungracious to remind him that the up-to-date housewife saves the water in which vegetables have been cooked to use in soups or gravies , and so conserves those mineral salts with whose loss Mr. Jackson was so concerned ; or that the Bureau of Home Economics of the Department of Agriculture has developed a method of panning vegetables in an ordinary utensil by which they can be cooked with little or no added water . By the time we sat down to eat the dinner cooked in Club Aluminum , we had been told so many tirnes that the carrots and potatoes would have " an entirely different flavor " that we were convinced it was so . Came then Mr. Gettam , rotund and rosy from eating food cooked in Club Aluminum , to give his talk on the superiority of his merchandise and further pseudo-scientific explanations of how We would endanger our health by failing to invest in a complete set . Mr. Gettam was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happier citizens , rosy-checked kiddies ; all , all a result of waterless cooking in Club Aluminum . The name of the company , he said , came from its motto , " Come , La Us Build . " His first point was indeed telling . " Ladies and gentlemen , food cooked in Club Aluminum needs no stirring . Why , I have gone into kitchens where I found the kitchen spoon literally half ground away by incessant stirring . Think what that means ! You have fed half of that spoon to your family in their daily food ! " His second point was that Club Aluminum is the only make containing no copper and thus " no clangerous foods . " My grandmother 's kitchen was stocked almost entirely with shining copper . As I remember , her ' family was in good health . Grandmother knew nothing about " balanced rations " or vitamins , but she served an ample variety of food three times a ' day . She threw away a few mineral salts , but the family thrived , proving the statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home economics workers in educational institutions that a varied ration will preserve health in a normal , healthy person , even though a few soluble mineral salts arc wasted . Testimonials aplenty had Mr. Gettam for the alleged superior virtues of his product . The most touching one was from a wealthy banker , who had come to him with tears in his eyes to report that happiness and romance had been restored in his family since he stocked his kitchen with a complete set of Club Aluminum . Previously , it seemed , his wife had become a nervous wreck trying to keep servants in the kitchen . Club Aluminum was installed ; the distracted wife then found cooking such a simple matter that she promptly dismissed cook and kitchen maids , and prepared all the meals herself . Happiness and tranquillity are now in that home . The prize exhibit was a set of charts displayed by Mr. Gettam . These contained some truly amazing statements . Mr. Gettam is a salesman , not a scientist , and , fortunately for him , there were no scientists in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged to have specific effects upon the human system , and " usually thrown away in the ordinary method of cooking , but preserved by the use of Club Aluminum . " Here are a few of them : Oxygen ? aids respiratory tract . Hydrogen ? guards against T. B. Fluorine and nitrogen ? beautify skin and hair . Phosphorus and manganese ? nerve tonics . Carbon ? needed for active brain , active liver , supple muscles . Chlorine and magnesium ? flush the system , prevent toxemia . Of the minerals listed on Mr. Gettam 's chart , only four ? iron , iodine , calcium and phosphorus ? have been shown by scientific research to influence specific bodily processes , and only four of the sixteen " elements " named need concern the housewife in her choice and preparation of food . Dr. Mary Swartz Rose of Columbia University , in her book on " The Foundations of Nutrition , " says on this subject : Practically we shall find that if the requirements for calcium , phosphorus , and iron ( in some regions , iodine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral elements being inadequately furnished , since the foods which supply the former will at the same time provide many of the latter . // Mr. Gettam , glancing at the husbands who had accompanied wives to the free demonstration dinner , admitted that the initial cost of Club Aluminum utensils might seem a trifle high at first glance , but assured them that it would soon be offset by resulting savings . In fact , a set paid ' actual dividends on the original investment . The savings were indicated on Chart 3 : $12 a year on gas , $7.50 a year on coffee , $5.20 a year on cooking fats , $20.80 a year on meat ( " no shrinkage " ) as absolute minimum amounts . One guest - rudely suggested that the saving on meats was entirely possible : judging from the scientifically cooked lamb served at the dinner , the family would eat less of it . Dozens of sets of this costly aluminum are being sold each week in Washington alone . It is ? a fad for society people to give " aluminum luncheons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so successful has . this expensive advertising method been that other companies are adopting it . The chief ambition of the Club Aluminum Comm pany now is to install a set of its utensils in the White House . Mr. Gettam , making preliminary arrangements for our demonstration dinner , confided that any lady who gained him a hearing ? by Mrs. Coolidge would receive a handsome premium . Looking over his price list , I warned ' him that he had better keep it out of Mr. Coolidge 's sight . There are , of course , certain arguments for Club Aluminum , as there are for all the other varieties of modern kitchen ' equipment now on the market . - It is said to last a lifetime , and is so heavy that one set ought to serve the second and third generations ? It saves gas . But the extravagant claims advanced i by its promoters , the contention that " waterless cooking , now advocated for certain meats and vege ' tables , can be used in preparing a wide variety ( ji foods and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatly contradictory to the latest find ' ings of food experts . Katherine A. Fisher , of New York , director of a large experimental food-prePr aration laboratory , recently declared that eXper " mcnts with every weight of utensil now available had proved that only spinach , carrots , and potat00 : in their jackets can be cooked without added water ! : and that perfect cooking with a minimum of water to prevent burning can be done " in almost any good utensil . " The Bureau of Home Economics of the DeParit ' . ment of Agriculture emphasized the value of ing without added water , or in a minimum amount , in a recent statement on vegetable cookery , ming up experiments in its own laboratories . . " declared , however : Newer devices are being put on the market which will accomplish this result . Most of them are accoritl pinned by directions which would seem to indicate that the results can be obtained only in these sPe air devices . In most cases similar results may be ' to twined by the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same result as the more expensive pieces of equipment . Housewives all over the.country are sending letters to Dr. Louise Stanley , Chief of the Bureau , asking anxiously about the effect of certain kinds of utensils on healthfulness of food , agitatedly inquiring what foods contain fluorine , silicon , and other minerals listed on Chart 6 of the Club Aluminum Company . One of these women , torn between the desire to give her family the alleged advantages of food cooked in Club Aluminum and horror at its exorbitant price and the equally exorbitant prices of many new " scientific cookery " devices , recently received a letter from Dr. Stanley which sums up the argument against needless ex-penditures : Our recent bulletins Dr. Stanley wrote emphasi : : , e a well balanced diet made up of five groups of foods . Some of these should be served raw-and some cooked in a variety of ways . So long as this is done , the kind of cooking utensil used , provided it is in good condition and properly used , is not going to have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will , of course , be possible to make more and more definite statements about the influence of various types of cooking utensils on food values . At present , however , comparatively little research has been done on this question and there is no foundation for many of the claims made by salesmen of certain utensils , either for their own products or against those manufactured by rival concerns . In short , you need have no fear about injury to health from the use of cooking utensils ordinarily found in the American kitchen today , provided you eat a well balanced diet . The conclusion of home economics experts , then , after careful tests , is that there is nothing you can do in a heavy aluminum saucepan of the Club Aluminum type , price $8.50 , that you can not do with reaSortable precautions in utensils found in the average kitchen , many of them bought at bargain sales for $1.48 . But ? it pays to advertise ! 1 CATHERINE HACKETT . 1Note : How well it has paid the Club Aluminum Utensil Com- Noy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eoMmercial and Financial Chronicle , as follows : EARNINGs -- -YEARS ENDED JUNE , 30 .

Moody and Sankey HE suggestive combination of Moody and Sankey was first heard by me when , as a small boy , I was given a bunch of tickets , of various attractive colors , to leave in couples at the houses of our neighbOrs . They admitted persons to different parts of the tabernacle which had been erected for the meetings which were being held by the great revivalists in Boston ; and distinctions had to be observed ? two green on the floor for the Mocks ; two yellow in the balcony for the Nawns ( Roman Catholics ) ; two red on the stage for the Hunts . But wherever the seats were , the cards of admission were accepted as gratefully as tickets to a world series ball game would be today . My father was , I suppose , on the committee of distribution ; at any rate , his constant supply of tickets gave our family a prestige in the neighborhood to which our strict morals and evangelical habits had not hitherto entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the practice of family prayers , which previously I had had to defend as a harmless peculiarity , took on justification , since it was obviously connected with admission on favorable terms to a place where everyone wanted to go . Of course , all this , as I realized later , was the result of Moody 's expert salesmanship . Salvation was free ? yes , but he somehow got the crowd going as if the supply were limited ; and the sign Standing Room Only might at any moment be replaced by the refrain , " Too Late ! Too Late ! Ye can not enter now . " It was something of a humiliation to me that I was not allowed to occupy one of the places in the tabernacle . I - was too young to be converted ; my presence was superfluous ? indeed , it deprived some more adult sinner of the opportunity to be saved . But one afternoon a ticket was re-. turned ; I was fetched out of school , and , clothed as for the Lord 's day , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here becomes confused with later impressions of Moody and Sankey. - I am not sure whether it is from this occasion that I remember the short , stocky man with no neck and graying beard who talked racily about the woman who had lost the piece of silver ? quite as good a piece of drama as " Gammer Gurton 's Needle " ? or the tall , stout , bald man with burnsides who sang so pathetically about ; The Ninety and Nine that safely lay Ill the shelter of the fold ; But one was out on the hills away , Far away from the gates of gold . But I can recall perfectly as of this occasion the sense of horror of a young Bostonian when the short fat man announced : " Prayer will be offered by the Reverend Philip Brook . " Mr. Gamaliel Bradford , - whose recent book ( " D. L. Moody , A Worker in Souls . " New York , Doran ) brings these famous personalities once more before us , does not appeal to me as an ideal biographer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Paul . Mr. Bradford holds closely to his method of character study , presenting Moody as a convert , a believer , a preaCher , a reviYalist , a tnan , a man of business and a worker in souls . He leaves one with a sense that he is struggling to do
