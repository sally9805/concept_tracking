" <P> When the long official envelope reached President Ignatz Moscicki at Spala , where he had gone for a brief vacation , it appeared to cause surprise , consternation . Soon the flustered President sped to Warsaw , consulted earnestly with the real master of Poland , Marshal Josef Pilsudski , who insists upon remaining technically War Minister , though actually Dictator . Emerging from this conference , poor puppet President Moscicki intimated that the Marshal had again refused to accept the Prime Ministry himself and saw no reason for accepting the resignation of M.

Stanislaw Patek , now Polish Minister at Moscow , Minister of Education Kazimierz Switalski , and Director Goretzki of the Agricultural Bank .
