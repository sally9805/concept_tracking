What constitutes religious news , according to modern journalistic standards ? Usually one of two types of happenings : 1 ) controversial topics ; or 2 ) scandal , both of which to some degree offend . <P> Last week , editors thought they saw a good , noncontroversial , non-scandalous religious news story . The elements of the story : the National Broadcasting Company ( which always is " decent to newspaper people " ) ; the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America ( newspaper people must be decent to it ) ; Dr. Samuel Parkes Cadman ( a newspaper columnist himself ) ; Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise ( not averse to newspaper publicity ) , and many a Catholic , Jewish , Protestant layman whose name was not announced . For the greater honor &; glory of God , these various factors would work in non-sectarian unison . The Federal Council announced that Dr. Cadman 's sermons would be made audible over a hebdomadal hookup of 40 radio stations . <P> Editors headlined Dr. Cadman as world 's first " radio pastor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As many a radiowner knows , Dr. Cadman preached from the Bedford ( Brooklyn ) branch of the Y. M. C. A. Sunday afternoons , last year , over an 18-station web . And his new and exciting title of " radio pastor " further lost significance when it became known that Rabbi Wise also would preach , that Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick &; Dr. Daniel Alfred Poling , able Manhattan divines , might soon be given microphonal pulpits by the National Broadcasting Co. , sponsored by the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America . <P> Facts , melted down , consisted of this information : the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America supposedly aided by members of the three main religious groups , is collaborating with the National Broadcasting Company to hold every Sunday afternoon a 90-minute religious program on a hookup of 40 or more stations .
