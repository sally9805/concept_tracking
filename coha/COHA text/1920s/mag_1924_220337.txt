The Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan , is at least realizing what is self-evident to every visitor from Toledo and Akron : that the structure which now houses the " greatest opera company in the world " is woefully inadequate- a small , dingy , undistinguished , badly-located building . Otto H. Kahn , khan of music-patrons , said as much . " The Metropolitan is antiquated . It has no room for the thousands who can not pay high prices of admission . It is in a congested district of the city . We should have a modern , more beautiful , more commodious structure , located in an other section . . . . Will we ever get or build a new Metropolitan ? . . . Well , I 'll talk to the other Directors about it . "
