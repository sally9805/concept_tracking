The bill is generally supported by the West and South , admittedly with the backing of the Ku Klux Klan ; by organized labor which desires to lessen competition with cheap European labor ; and by those portions of the conservative press which see American institutions menaced by " hordes " of Italian , Jewish , Polish and southwestern European races , difficult to assimilate due to radical divergences of creed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foes . The bill is opposed by " liberals " who are disgusted with the Ku Klux and claptrap Nordic propaganda ; by professional " friends of every country but their own " ; by the foreign language press ; by the big transatlantic shipping companies with a heavy immigrant trade ; by large Eastern employers of labor ; by immigrant lobbies in New York and Washington ; and by many members of the Roman Catholic faith , who are alarmed by Ku Klux linking of " Nordic supremacy " with the Protestant religion or are influenced by the consideration that the immigrant races most affected ( Poles and Italians ) are Catholics . <P> Significance . Economically , the measure amounts to a high tariff on foreign labor . Its first effect would be to raise the commodity value of labor throughout the country . Eventually , it might increase the birthrate of the dwindling American-born population , by providing superior economic opportunities for the presumptive heirs of the national estate .                   @ @
