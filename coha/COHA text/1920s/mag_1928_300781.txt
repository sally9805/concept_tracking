( Old Gold ) in particular has been illustrating its extensive advertisements with photographs of famed persons choosing Old Golds while blindfolded from among other brands . Reed Institute laboratory tests by one Louis Goodman , graduate student , however , show that only once in nine times on the average does one recognize his favorite cigaret whether he is blindfolded or not . <P> They can not differentiate between two cigarets nor between straight Turkish or domestic tobaccos .

However , it does not account for the actual distaste that the smoker of one brand has for another until several days ' smoking makes him used to the new . <P> Reed Institute , comparatively little known east of the Rockies , was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its faculty 32 . Its endowment now is nearly $2,000,000.
