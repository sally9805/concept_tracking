Steaming in through San Francisco 's Golden Gate , last week , came the President McKinley , bearing a petite , blue-eyed German Fraulein of twenty-two . Resting an elbow on the ship 's rail and cuddling her small chin in a pensive palm , she gazed at Las Papas , those twin , majestic mountains called " The Breasts . " Then , having admired the view , Fraulein Clarenore Stinnes coolly turned to confront excited reporters . <P> Yes , she was the daughter of the late Hugo Stinnes . No , he had never claimed to be " The Richest Man in the World . " Well , perhaps he had been the richest man in Germany , for a time , while the mark was falling , and he was building great pyramided super-trusts . What ? Fraulein Stinnes shrugged . Why trouble to rehearse the details of her father 's death and the titanic business crash which her brothers were powerless to avert . Clarenore Stinnes is 22 , lives in the present , is rich . <P> She preferred to answer questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and about the handsome , strapping Swedish cinema camera man who is motoring with her , Herr C. A. Soederstroem . <P> Soon Californians heard how Fraulein Stinnes had set out from Berlin , last May , with two Adler cars , four mechanics and Herr Soederstroem . By way of the Balkans , Turkey , Persia and the Caucasus they drove to Moscow and thence to Irkutsk , Siberia , where the four mechanics refused to press on and returned by rail to Berlin . Not thus craven was Herr Soederstroem . He stuck with Fraulein Stinnes at Irkutsk for almost three months , while they waited for Lake Baikal to freeze , then drove across and on to Mongolia , China , Japan and the President McKinley . <P> " Once , at Urga , Mongolia , " said Frau lein Stinnes , " we had to pay 140 marks ( $336 ) for 106 litres of gasoline ( 28 gallons ) . " From San Francisco petite Motorist Stinnes proposed to sail for Valparaiso , Chile , whence she will motor northward to Washington , D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The films I am taking we shall sell , " said Cinema Swede Soederstroem , " and Fraulein Stinnes is writing a book .
