Even before election , correspondents were eyeing friends and associates of Mr. Hoover in order to foresee his Cabinet . After the election , thousands of speculative words were penned . No one knew , but a good many thought he would retain Secretaries Mellon ( Treasury ) Davis ( War ) and New ( Postmaster-General ) . And nearly everyone thought that the next Attorney-General would not be the incumbent who is Mr. Coolidge 's good friend , John Garibaldi Sargent ; but would be Mr. Hoover 's good friend William J. ( " Wild Bill " ) Donovan , * who is now assistant to Mr. Sargent .

Ambassador to Mexico , and brightest jewel in the Coolidge foreign policy . <P> For Secretary of Agriculture , no man seemed more logical or deserving than James W.

A poet , Joyce Kilmer , had followed him jubilantly unto death . " Hard boiled ' ' they called him and terribly " Wild . "
