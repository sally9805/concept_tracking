txt Except to a limited extent price advances put into effect by U. S. Steel Corp . and other large steel producers in past several weeks will have no effect on earnings of these . companies for the current quarter . Higher prices will begin to show in first quarter , 1928. profits and if maintained will show still more in second quarter results . U. S. Steel 's earnings for the October-December quarter are expected to show a decline as compared with the three months ended September 30. but shrinkage probably will not be as marked as would seem indicated by conditions that prevailed in the steel industry during the period . Gross earnings in the third quarter were $41.373,831 and net for stock $21,585,425. leaving a balance for common equal to $2.14 a share on the 7.116,235 shares . Fourth quarter gross earnings may be estimated at around $38. - 000.000 , which would be about sufficient to cover charges and pay preferred and common dividends . Earnings of $1.75 a common share ( the amount of the dividend ) for the quarter would make net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and balance available for common of close to $8.50 a share . This would compare with $116.667,404 net for stock in 1926 , with share earnings of $17.99 on the 5,083,025 common shares outstanding at the close of last year . Net profits in 1925 were $90,602,652 and balance for the common $12.86 a share . Although " official " quotations for steel kept declining until recently , lower prices probably will not be responsible for the expected fourth quarter decline in earnings . The Dow . Jones &; Co. average price of eight important steel products declined from $49.55 on July 1 to $49.21 on October 1 and to $48.76 in December . Nevertheless , the official quotations or : which these averages are based merely recognized , during the period , concessions that had been general in the trade for months . In fact the present average is higher than the average of actual prices prevailing a few months , ago . And current quotations are being held . Factors making for lower U. S. Steel earnings were slight decline in average operations , from close to 70.7. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and diminished receipts of transportation subsidiaries due to cessation of iron ore movement in November . It is also probable that plants will close down partially over the holiday , as is usual , this affecting production and profits . There are fairly definite indications of dammed-up demand waiting the enci of the inventory-taking period , in addition to the fact that buying is usually larger in the early part of the year than toward its close . The trade expects to see a high rate of operations within the next five or six weeks . The price situation is better . Price advances in recent weeks are effective in most cases on first quarter business . This should add several million dollars to U. S. Steel 's earnings for the quarter . Further price advances are likely . Thus , all factors in the situation point to likelihood of a sharp upturn in profits in the first quarter , and probably through the first half of 1928.
