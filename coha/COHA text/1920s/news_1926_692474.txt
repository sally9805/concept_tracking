txt Suggestions that the violent selling movement in the New York stock market this afternoon was due to a " leak " whereby advance knowledge of the Interstate Commerce Commission on the Van Sweringen merger was obtained were repudiated at the office of the commission late today . " I do n't believe a word of the rumor , " said George B. , Secretary of the commission . " No one except ' the members of the commission could have known what was in the opinion , before it was handed to me for preparation ' for release . " The opinion was mimeographed behind locked doors before it was given out to the press room . It was handled In such a way that there could not have been a leak . " Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , March 2 . ? Fundamentally on the ground that the financial plan for the proposed merger of five great railroads into a new Nickel Plate system is defective and objectionable in structure , the Interstate Commerce Commission today denied the application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The full test of the decision is printed on Pages 12 and 131 The unification proposed would have embraced the present Nickel Plate , the Chesapeake &; Ohio , the Hocking Valley , the Erie and the Pere Marquette Railroads . It would have taken in more than 9,000 miles of roadway , embraced in lines declared by the commission to be worth more than $1,250 , - 000,000 , stretching from the Atlantic Coast to the Mississippi Valley and from Virginia to the Lakes . The transportation plan generally was approved , and in this particular respect the Van Sweringens are believed to have gained a distinct advantage , but the financial structure involved in the merger was disapproved by the commission and condemned in language that bristles with denunciation , especially the alleged failure to accord full recognition to the equities of certain minority stockholders in planning the merger . The proponents of the consolidation are entirely free to renew their petition after such revision as they may think meets the objections on which the denial is based . Whether the Van Sweringens will modify their financial plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under consideration by counsel for the company tonight . It is the expectation here that if those interested in the merger feel that they can so revamp the financial plan that it would satisfy the commission , application for acquisition of control and for issuance of securities will be renewed . ? Called Victory for C. &; 0 . Minority . The action of the commission is regarded as a distinct victory for the minority stockholders of the Chesapeake &; Ohio , who vigorously opposed the merger . At the outset two questions were raised by interveners representing the Chesapeake minority stockholders . They contended that the application for acquisition of control was not lawfully before the commission and that the latter was without authority to approve the application for unified control . While the commission denied these particular contentions and held that it had jurisdiction , the fact that the commission denied the application of the Van Sweringens and condemned assignable and transferable upon the books of the trustees " subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement .

The agreement constitutes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trust , which is to continue for twenty-one years after the death of the last survivor , with the right on the part of the survivor to ap I , point successors to a deceased manlager . Without giving further details of the financial structure of the proposed merger is regarded as a victory for these minority stockholders , who represented 143,325 shares of the Chesapeake stock . Colonel Henry W. Anderson . counsel for the stockholders , said tonight that the decision was very satisfactory to him . The decision was reached by a 7-to-1 vote . Three of the eleven members of the commission  --  Messrs . Hall , Woodlock and Taylor  --  did not take part in disposition Of the case , and of the eight who did exercise their authority only one , Ernest I. Lewis , dissented and said he did not favor denial a the petition . While the other seven  --  Messrs . Aitchison , Meyer , Eastman , Each , Campbell , Cox and  --  agreed on the broad principle that the application should not be granted , the majority split several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Decision a Great Surprise . The decision , issued at 3:30 o'clock , after the closing of the stock market , and purposely withheld until that time , came as a complete surprise . While speculation in Washington has differed widely for weeks over the probable action of the commission , it was generally believed that the commission would approve the merger plan with recommendations for modifications of the financial plan . The opinion , written by Commissioner Balthasar H. Meyer for the majority members of the commission , vigorously criticized many of the important financing features which 0 . P. Van Sweringen defended when he was on the witness stand . Interlocking directorates of the present Nickel Plate , the Chesapeake &; Ohio and the Hocking Valley ' were condemned , and the commission reminded W. J. Harahan , President of the Chesapeake , that a railroad President is a " quasi-public official . " " The President of these two companies , " says the commission , after charging that inadequate consideration was given to the terms of stock exchange of the stockholders of the Chesapeak and Hocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or figures bearing on the matter while the plan was under consideration . He first learned of the proposal from the newspapers , and voted to approve it without change . " The commission asserts that the record emphasized the " need of railway directors who ? actually direct , There are too many passive directors who acquiesce without knowledge and without investigation . " The boards of the Chesapeake and Hocking , the commission declares , " appear to have acted as boards of ratification rather than authorization or direction with respect to these matters . " Says Van Sweringens Would Control . According to the view taken by the commission , the Van Sweringens , with an actual minority interest in the ' properties they propose toe merge , could have a voting majority of the stock . To a large extent , it Is charged , this would be brought about by a uniform policy of depriving preferred stockholders of the railroad involved of voting rights , except in default of dividend payments . Through their control of 80 per cent . of the voting stock of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts , the Van Sweringens now control 54.17 per cent . of the votg stock of the Nickel Plate , " but control directly or indirectly only 32.85 per cent . of all the voting stock of the companies affected by their proposal . " But under their plan , the commission added , the Van Sweringens " will directly or indirectly control , without purchasing a single additional share , 50.93 of the voting stock of the new company , and thus will effectively control ifs management and operation . " The commission asserts that the conclusion can not be escaped that the plan " was aranged with the intention of keeping control in the hands of its proponents , even though their interest is a minority one in fact , " and condemns this as not being in accord with sound railroad practice . Trust Agreement Criticized . The trust agreement under which the Van Sweringens in 1924 , as owners of 130,000 shares of common voting stock of the Vaness Company , and C. L. Bradley and J. R. Nutt , both directors of the Nickel Plate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vaness Company , deposited such stock with a trustee , receiving in lieu trust certificates representing certificates of interest in common stock of the Vaness Company , also is criticized by the commission . " It is sufficient to say , " the opinion states , " that under it the Van Sweringens may divest themselves of all beneficial interest in the Vaness Company stock and still retain voting control of the new company without direct or indirect ownership of a share of stock therein . " The commission conidered these and other objections fundamental enough to compel denial of the applications both for acquisiton of control over thefive great railways intended to be merged and the request of the new Nickel Plate Company to issue certain securities , without discussing numerous other matters covered by the record . Not less interesting than its criticism of features of the financial plan is the comment of the Commission on the aspects of the merger , from a purely transportation standpoint , which latter is not found to be against the public interest . The tentative plan of the commission for consolidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Eastern Legion , according to whether the New England lines were or were not grouped in a separate system . Five of these nine were to be the New York Central , Pennsylvania , Baltimore &; Ohio , New Haven , and Norfolk &; Western systems . The four others were to take in the Erie , Nickel Plate , Pere Marquette , the Chesapeake &; Ohio , and the Hocking Valley , the latter two in a single system . Holds a Merger Desirable . The five carriers in the Nickel Plate merger were to be placed in four separate systems in the commission 's consolidation plan of 1921 . Under the Van Sweringen plan , they would constitute a single consolidation which , the commission says , would be comparable to the New York Central , Baltimore and Ohio and Pennsylvania systems , and the desirability of such a merger of the five Van Sweringen roads is emphasized by the commission . The commission declares it has never considered its consolidation plan " inflexible . " but only as a flexible guide for use in effective consolidations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Central and Pennsylva.nia systems have been brought more closely together by various means approved by the commission , and says it " seems clear that the proposed merger is a step along the right lines 1n carrying out the policy of Congress of encouraging the formation of a limited number of systems . " Under such an arrangement , the commission says , the New York Central would control 12,093 miles , the Baltimore &; Ohio 5,316 miles , the Pennsylvania 11,379 miles , and the proposed Van Sweringen system 9,213 miles , and , considering the railway situation as it exists in Eastern territory today , " dominated as it is by the three longestablished systems , " the unification proposed in the Van Sweringen merger would " result in nearly all of the principal producing and consuming centres of the territory being served by two or more , and in many instances by all of the limited number of systems , " each system ramifying through the East , each with adequate fuel supplies . each serving two of the five North Atlantic ports , t while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway operating income would be more nearly equalized " than is possible in the present number of systems , " or even in the number proposed in the tentative plan of the commission . Grouping in Public Interest . " Other meritorious groupings of these carriers might be proposed , " says the commission , " but , viewing the grouping presented in this application strictly from a ' transportation standpoint , we find that the proposed acquisitions of control are in the public interest . " That being so , the commission had to consider whether the conditions , terms and considerations of the proposed acquisition were just and reasonable from a standpoint of financial structure  --  and decided this in the negative . The commission indicates its view that properties of the five railroads it was proposed to merge into the new Nickel Plate system are worth not less than $1,131,550,474 . This is a tentative valuation . The commission says it made no attempt in this proceeding to ascertain the value of the properties involved and that , while its tentative value of them all under Section 19-A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructive " cost of the physical railway properties of the new system to Dec. 31 , 1924 , has been ascertained by the applicants to be $991 , - ' 550,474 and that they estimate other assets of these companies to be at least $140,000,000.
