In Manhattan last week Richard Farnsworth Hoyt and Frederick Brant Rentschler , two of the most potent U. S. air financiers , made plans to synchronize thousands of miles of airlines . Shortly it should be possible to air-tour over their systems-United Aircraft &; Transport , and Aviation Corp . of the Americas , repectively-from Chicago to San Francisco , to Los Angeles , to Mexico City , thence to Miami and the West Indies , or to Panama and Ecuador . The deal to cooperate was consummated after many interruptions . United 's Rentschler was interrupted frequently by needs of his seven subsidiary companies . A. C. A. 's Hoyt , although he seems sequestered behind his Hayden , Stone &; Co. desk , is kept hopping out of Manhattan on affairs of the four aviation concerns of which he is chairman - Wright Aeronautical , Keystone-Loening , Travel Air , Aviation Corp . of the Americas ( Pan-American ) .
