Out again , in again . That was the political gymnastic performed last week by gruff , choleric General James Barry Munnik Hertzog , His Majesty 's Prime Minister in The Union of South Africa . <P> The General resigned with his entire Cabinet and in a passion . A short time previously he had met with refusal-blunt refusal-when he had demanded the resignation of his own Minister of Posts &; Telegraphs , the Rt . Hon. Walter B. Madeley . Blast Madeley 's impertinence ! If he would n't resign alone , General Hertzog knew well enough how to force the fellow out by bringing down his whole Cabinet . The crash was called , last week , and for a very good reason , a " nigger crisis . " <P> Briefly , the Minister of Posts &; Telegraphs had been showing himself entirely too considerate of blackamoor trade unions . In vain Big White General Hertzog and his Nationalist Party had threatened , fumed . Mr. Madeley as a member of the Labor Party could not see his way clear to upholding the Nationalist postulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " economically , politically . The crisis was precipitated when Minister Madeley received a Negro deputation from the Industrial &; Commercial Workers ' Union , officially , at the Ministry of Posts &; Telegraphs . That reception brought General Hertzog 's demand for the Minister 's resignation , and also a demand from Mr. Madeley 's own Labor Party that he refuse to resign . Naturally the Rt . Hon. Laborite obeyed his party . <P> The Governor-General of the Union of South Africa is the Earl of Athene , brother of Queen-Empress Mary . When General Hertzog marched in with the collective resignation of the Cabinet , Her Majesty 's brother saw to it that he marched right out again with a mandate to form a new Cabinet . This the General instantly did , appointing the Rt . Hon. H. W. Sampson to be Minister of Posts &; Telegraphs , and recalling all his other ministers to their posts . Unofficially the peppery Prime Minister expressed his satisfaction that the Laborites have now come out squarely on the issue of social and every other kind of equality for blackamoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a general election rolls round ; and one must legally take place not later than next spring . <P> Smugly confident , General Hertzog hinted that he might ask the King-Emperor 's brother-in-law to dissolve the Dominion Parliament and call a general election as early as next January , perhaps even before Christmas .
