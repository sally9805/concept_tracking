txt The sinking of the rum-runner I 'm Alone by the Coast Guard patrol was taken up actively by the Canadian Legation today when Vincent Massey , the ' Canadian Minister , called - at ? the State Department and requested that information which previously had been sought by Sir Esthe ' Howard , the British Ambassador , be ' submitted to him . This does not mean that the British Embassy has dropped the affair , but that as the schooner is of Canadian registry Canada will stand in the forefront of the diplomatic protest on the ? position of the United States . Great tritain *ill stand in the background , but will drop none of its interest ? because of the broad considerations The following statement was issued at the Canadian Legation : " When the first : reports of the ' sinking of the . rm Alone appeared ! in Saturday 's papers the name of the vessel was given incorrectly , and it was indicated that she was of British West Indian registry . In consequence , the British ? Ambassador made inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the belief that the I 'm Alone was not a Canadian vessel . " As soon as the vessel 's correct name and registry were known , the British Ambassador requested the State Department to address the reply to his inquiries to the Canadian Minister . Any discussion of the case which may be necessary with the government of the United States will be conducted by the Canadian Minister , who has already inquired at the State Department concerning the incident . " The British Ambassador , of course , will retain a direct interest in the question , should it be found that the interpretation of the liquor smuggling treaty of 1924 is involved , since this treaty concerns every unit of the British Commonwealth . " Points Suggested by Canada , That a strong protest is in prospect from Canada and possibly , also from Great Britain was emphasized today by diplomatic officers of the embassy and legation . Three questions , it was said at the Canadian Legation , are already clearly at issue .. These are : Does the right of pursuit in order to perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist beyond the one hour 's steaming distance specified in the ship liquor treaty of 1924 ? What was the nature of the pursuit of the I 'm Alone ? If these two points should be decided in favor of the United States , was the violent means taken against the schooner justified ? ? On the other hand , should it be found that the I 'm Alone , when first approached by the Coast Guard vessels , was outside the twelve-mile limit and its ? one hour 's steaming distance from the American shore , as maintained by its skipper , Captain John T. Randall , Great Britain will protest on the ground that its rights on the high seas are involved . The American position , as defined by Secretary Mellon , is that the I 'm Alone was spoken outside the threemile territorial limit , but within the twelve-mile limit laid down by the tariff act of 1922 , within which customs officers exercise the right of search and seizure of goods intended for smuggling into the United States , land that the pursuit was carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit " as defined In international law . The Canadian and British claim is that they have never recognized the territorial jurisdiction of the United States beyond the three-mile limit and that " hot pursuit " may be started only from territorial waters . Official . information thus far received has not disclosed whether Leon Montjoy , the seaman who was drowned in the sinking of the schooner , was a French citizen or a British subject . Neither at Coast Guard headouarters nor the State Department has definite word on that question been received . Diplomatic circles are uninformed . It was pointed out at the State Department that should it be found that Montjoy was a French citizen he nevertheless would have been under British Protection , because he was serving on a British ship . The French Embassy , however . would be drawn immediately into the case and it is believed would make representations to the State Department . Quote Bryan Protest in War . The twelve-mile limit , it was asserted , has been created only by American domestic law and not by international law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note sent by William Jennings Bryan , when he was Secretary of State , to Great Britain on Dec. 26. 1914. protesting against alleged British encroachments on American neutral rights in the methods adopted in searching and seizing contraband in United States vessels in the early months of the World War . Secretary Bryan wrote : " This government can not without protest permit American ships or American cargoes to be taken into British ports and there detained for the purpose of searching generally for evidence of contraband , or upon presumptions created by special municipal enactments which are clearly at variance with international law and practice . " The reference was to the British Orders in Council , which the United States held were in contravention of international law , and it was argued today that the rule was applicable in the case of the I 'm Alone . The question of the " hot pursuit " of the schooner also involves whether it was a continuous - pursuit , inasmuch as the Pm Alone was first chased by the Coast Guard patrol boat Walcott , but intercepted and sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these questions stand the fact that a British-flag vessel was sunk on the high seas by American gunfire and one of its crew killed . Status of Ship Liquor Treaty . Whether the ship liquor treatly will figure prominently in the case probably will depend upon whether an effort is made by the United States through that compact to justify the beginning of the hot pursuit of the I 'm Alone within one hour 's steaming distance from the shore . Canadian officials admitted that there had been cases , of which no diplomatic notice was taken , of their vessels being pursued beyond the one hour 's steaming distance and seized and taken into United States ports , and that American courts had upheld the action . They pointed out , - how ( ever , that when overtaken the yeseels were only a short distance ? beyond the limits fixed by the . treaty . One such case was that ; et the Canadian vessel Vinces which was sighted off the Virginia coast on March 14 , 1927 , being then 71/L. miles from land under a speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles out . Two other cases of similar charactzr involving Canadian ships have occurred since the liquor treaty was ratified . The treaty expressly declares that the three mile limit defines the extent of territorial waters . It then states that Great Britain will offer " no objection " if its vessels are boarded or pursued as suspected smugglers up to one hour 's steaming distance from the United States coast . In event reasonable cause is found , the vessels may be taken into American ports for legal action . The State Department has taken the attitude that the case of the I 'm Alone is purely a legal one and that it will give no close study to it until a protest is received from Canada or Great Britain . Awaiting Official Reports . It is presumed that before a protest is formally placed before the State Department , intensive study will be given to all phases of the affair by law officers of the British Foreign Office . A final report of the Coast Guard is awaited by the State Department . When it is received a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British diplomatic missions are also awaiting a. report 1m the British Consul at New Orleans . When all these statements are in hand , detailed reports will be made by the British and Canadian diplomats to their Foreign Office . Under these circumstances several days or even a week or two may elapse before a diplomatic move is made . The preliminary report of the Coast Guard , which was transmitted to the State Denartment yesterday , was described today as similar to the statement issued by Secretary Mellon . This will be transmitted to the Canadian Minister . Additional reports were received at the headquarters of the Coast Guard today from the commanding officers of the Dexter and Walcott . Without disclosine. their exact contents . Admiral Dillard , Commandant of the Coast Guard , said they confirmed Isis previously expressed statement that the government vessels were clearly within their rights in firing on the I 'm Alone . It is understood the reports received today asserted that the chase of the schooner began within the twelve-mile Emit.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
