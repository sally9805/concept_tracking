Two big automobiles stood side by side , their motors rumbling , their front wheels on the starting-line of the Indianapolis speedway . At the flash of the signal the two roared off in a cloud of blue exhaust , the drivers handling their cars carefully , expertly , in anticipation of the 24-hour grind that lay ahead of them . <P> The cars were an American-built Stutz , owned by F. E. Moskovics , president of the Stutz Motor Car Co. , and a French-made Hispano-Suiza , owned by Charles T. Weymann , famed motor car body designer and sportsman . Both were stock cars . The race was the result of an argument between Mr. Moskovics and Mr. Weymann , each backing his belief with a $25,000 wager . <P> Five hours and 20 minutes after the start , the Stutz coasted into the repair pits , where mechanics swarmed over it like ants on a picnic cake . The foreign car kept droning on its way . Soon the Stutz mechanics shook their heads ; their pet had broken a connecting rod . <P> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace slightly . Twelve hours later , the exhausted mechanics pronounced the task hopeless ; the Hispano was flagged down to receive the news that the Stutz had been forced to withdraw . The foreign invader had traveled 1,357 miles in 17 hours , 21 minutes , maintaining an average speed of 70.14 miles per hour . The old stock car record , made last October at Atlantic City by a Studebaker , of 1,814.96 miles in 24 hours , with an average of 75.6 miles per hour , remained unbroken .
