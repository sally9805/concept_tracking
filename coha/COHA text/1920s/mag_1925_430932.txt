 | THE story I shall tell here is one of exploration , not in distant lands , but in the near-by and wellknown Low Countries . It is a tale , too , of discovery for most Americans , at least , of a new kind of music . That this rather unusual subject may he the more readily understood , it is worth while at the beginning to give a few moments ' thought to the lands where this unique music originated , and to consider why it is now attracting special interest . Four hundred years ago Charles V , Roman Emperor and ( as Charles 1 ) King of Spain , inherited the territory now within the boundaries of Holland and Belgium . To duchies , counties , bishoprics. and lordships existing there , he added French Flanders , and proclaimed a new political unit under the name of the Seventeen United Provinces . Appropriately , the seal of the new federation was a lion holding a sheaf of seventeen arrows . Put soon the sheaf fell apart and the arrows were turned against one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distracted territory , and in a time of sieges and of distress unparalleled , a civic music of rare beauty came into being ? a music which , while continuing ever since and increasingly holding a place in the love of its people , has been until lately almost unknown outside the boundaries of its origin . Gradually since the time when Charles V reigned , this music has been wonderfully developed . To-day it is widely commanding artistic consideration and , with its noble architectural setting , it is coming to be recognized as peculiarly fitted to adorn and stimulate civic and community life everywhere . A LAND DOTTED WITH SPIRES The region of which this article treats extends from the North Sea shores inward for 5o miles or more in plains which are largely just above high tide . Often , with protecting dikes , portions of fertile @# acreage there are found even below sea level . Throughout these tranquil reaches windmills and waterways abound , and sometimes ships seem to be sailing through the land . On every side one sees scores of cities , towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the middle distance they become less distinct . and on the horizon in soft and misty outline they almost disappear . In every such extended view , above town hall and city gate and ancient church , rises dominant here a rugged tower , there a tall belfry or a graceful , slender spire . And each of these skyward-soaring structures becomes for the traveler a Singing Tower if , on nearer approach , he finds it crowned with that majestic instrument of music called a carillon . The word " carillon ' ' ? pronounced " car ' i-lon , " with the " o " as in " atom " ? and the derivative , " carillonneur , " are French in origin , but now generally accepted in English . TIIr CARILLON EXPRESSES THE SPIRIT OF A COUNTRY After crossing the Atlantic , we touched at Plymouth and at Boulogne , and then on a Friday night came in sight of the shores of the Netherlands . At the mouth of the River iIaas ( Meuse ) we waited for the high tide at two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ship to steam slowly up to Rotterdam . Here we found the tower of St. Lawrence 's Church , whose old bells make not merely a great musical instrument , but by their melodies express the spirit of the country over which they sound . De Amicis , the Italian traveler , after climbing the tower of St. Lawrence , said that the indefinable sentiments inspired by the Dutch landscape held him silent for a long time . Then he was startled by strange music coming from he knew not where ? the silvery notes now falling slowly one by one , now coming in groups ,  | in trills , in sonorous chords , a quaint dancing strain somewhat primitive , an echo of the ancient life of her people , making one smile and sigh at the same moment . We mounted t h e circular stone stairway leading to the heights of tower after tower to see the bells of a carillon in all their beauty of decoration and arrangement . We found ourselves among a great company of bells , fixed upon a heavy framework and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling the great tower room . The little bells hang in the highest tier ; the big bells just clear the floor ; the intermediate sizes hang in tiers between . The largest bell of all is taller than a tall man and it may weigh four , five , or even six or eight tons . The smallest bell has a height of lo or 12 inches only and perhaps a weight of less than 20 pounds . Soon o u r search showed us that of greater consequence , however , than number , or size , or weight , is the pitch relationship of the bells ; for the bells of a carillon always progress by regular semitone - or chromatic intervals . The carillon of St. Lawrence 's tower has these intervals complete through more than three octaves , except that the two lowest semitones are lacking . CARILLONS ARE PLAYED BY TOWER CLOCKS AND BY HAND The arrangement and character of the hells had first attracted our attention . Then we began to study how the music is produced . We soon discovered that a carillon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolving barrel connected with a tower clock , which starts the music at the hour , the half hour , and at the quarters , and sometimes even at the eighths ( see page 364 ) . Second , by a trained musician , a carillonneur , seated at a keyboard like that of an organ . Six and even more notes can be struck in chords on the carillon keyboard , and , so delicate are the adjustments , that sustaining tones on the lighter bells are easily accomplished by " tremolando " ( see page 367 ) .  | Automatic playing of simple folk songs , chiefly on the light bells , with now and then the addition of a deep bass tone , is what the traveler constantly hears as he wanders through old towns in Belgium and Holland . The keyboard-playing by a carillonneur is reserved for special occasions only . It takes place on the market day , and on Sunday , and in the greater cities on a fixed evening every week in summer , particularly in Belgium . Then for one hour an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , too , the best music of great composers , such as Beethoven and Schubert , is played , as well as beautifully arranged Flemish and French folk songs and national hymns . Thousands gather for these concerts . Quiet , even in so large a city as Antwerp , is then maintained in the neighborhood of the tower , vehicle traffic being diverted  | from the near-by streets by order of the burgomaster . ROTTERDAM HAS VARIETY OF CARILLON STRUCTURES The tower of St. Lawrence 's Church was begun in 1448 , and the city placed a carillon in it in 1660 . In the tower of the Rotterdam Bourse we found a smaller carillon of 27 bells , also more than two and a half centuries old . A third carillon in Rotterdam to which we listened is the one that has just been placed in the new City Hall . It is larger , both in weight and in number of bells , than any carillon made in the last too years ( see illustration , page 358 ) . Rotterdam 's three Singing Towers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourse , and one above the Church of St. Lawrence , gave us a clue to the variety of structures which may possess  | a carillon . Our journeys showed us that similar music had floated for more than two centuries over the city gate at Enkhuizen , the Royal Palace at Amsterdam , the Weigh House at Alkmaar , the Cloth Hall at Ypres ( destroyed during the World War ) , the University Library at Ghent , the Wine House at Zutphen ( burned in 1921 ) , and the Abbey at Middelburg , and that the spires of not a few of the historic churches of the Low Countries are Singing Towers . Finally , we discovered the important fact that wherever a carillon hangs , its bells are owned by the city , its carillonneur is an official chosen by city authority , and the tower itself is under city control . What a ride of peaceful beauty it is from Rotterdam to The Hague ! Windmills and waterways , long rows of slender trees , and black-and-white cattle contentedly grazing , are to be seen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy with fresh appreciation our.first 14 miles in Holland . At Delft the carillon is in the spire of the New Church , called " new , " though over 400 years old , because it was begun  | a century later than the Old Church , near by . Here , far above us , we could see nearly four octaves of bells , ranged in rows above and on both sides of the dial of the tower clock . Within the New Church , not far from the tombs of William the Silent and of Grotius , we found the final resting place of Delft 's most famous carillonneur . On it is this inscription : Here lies Dirck Scholl , who for more than sixty years made the carillon in the New Church to live . Six miles beyond historic Delft lies The Hague ? old , yet cosmopolitan , and ever delightful . We walked across the Square to the near-by Vyver , that small sheet of water in the center of the city , surrounded by shaded walks and the restful Parliament buildings . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we heard coming faintly from the Singing Tower in the background an enchanting folk song . Then slowly a deep bass bell gave the afternoon hour . HOW THE CARILLON ORIGINATED In Holland and Belgium , about the middle of the 15th century , when timepieces were rare , and the people were much more dependent upon the town clock for knowledge of the time of day  | or night , it became the custom , as a premonitory signal . to precede the striking of the hour by a short automatic chiming on three or four small bells hung in the clock tower . As this town and that sought to surpass its neighbors the bells were increased in number and the musical scale of tones and halftones thus became complete . Brief melodies began to be heard at the hour and the half hour , and with the addition of still more bells came . at these divisions , whole tunes played upon three or even four octaves of bells . All this playing was automatic . Then came the adoption of the keyboard . similar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note and readily responding to the art of the accomplished musician . Soon pedals were devised to play the heavier bells . Thus , in the course of two or three centuries , was developed the carillon . By making The Plague a center we found we could easily reach every part of Holland 's carillon region in day journeys . Early one morning we went to Gouda . There , in the great church , we gazed upon the wonderful 16th century glass windows , the finest in Holland , abounding in glorious color , allegorical design , and historic interest , and listened as the carillon played far above its . A CARILLONNtUR MUST BE FREE FROM GOUT Ascending the steep winding staircase . we came finally to the carillonneur 's cabin . There a charming scene met our eyes . Seated at the keyboard was the carillonneur , surrounded by an admiring group of seven boys and girls , who were thus  | enjoying the morning of their Saturday holiday . One boy played now and then in duet with the carillonneur , and later , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is of Thee . " Painted on two of the great posts of the frame that - carries the bells , we read the names and date of service of all Gouda 's carillonneurs , from 1669 onward , covering two and a half centuries . The longest recorded term was 63 years , the shortest 10 , and in all only seven names appeared . The present incumbent - has already 16 years to his credit . He is one of the best carillonneurs in Holland and is deeply devoted to every phase of his art . Carillon playing everywhere in the Low Countries is a question not so much of pay as of pride . Fischer , author-carillonneur , who played in 1738 in Utrecht , declared that a carillonneur must have a good knowledge of music , good hands and good feet , and no gout ! THE PILGRIMS HEARD LEIDEN 'S CARILLON Only half an hour from The Hague is Leiden , where we found the Singing Tower crowning the low and very beautiful Town Hall . The Pilgrims , who , after leaving England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , for the city has had a carillon since 1578 . Twenty-five miles beyond Leiden we came to Haarlem . There the carillon is in the tower of the old church , famous for its organ and models of historic ships suspended high in the groined arches of  | the ceiling . As we stood in a quiet street listening to the bells , a baker 's boy passed us with a tray of cakes balanced on his head . He looked up affectionately at the tower , paused long enough to catch the air the carillonneur was playing , then joyously whistling it , he went the happier on his way . AMSTERDAM HAS SIX SINGING TOWERS Amsterdam , the commercial capital of Holland , lies 38 miles from The Hague . Whether the journey between these cities is made by railway , by canal , by automobile , by bicycle , or on foot , it is a succession of attractive scenes . To us it was a continuation of the beauty that we had already enjoyed between Rotterdam and The Hague , with the addition of tulip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dunes . Amsterdam is first among present-day cities in the number of Singing Towers it possesses . The Royal Palace , the old Mint Tower , the Ryks Museum , and the Zuider , the West , and the Old Church spires all have carillons . When we came to know that Amsterdam had six carillons we were not surprised that John V of Portugal , traveling in the Netherlands in 1730 , was so impressed with this music that he determined to have a carillon for his sumptuous palace then being built . The price having been ascertained , it was guardedly suggested by his treasurer that the cost was rather great . This implied criticism so offended the self-esteem of the monarch that he replied , " I did not think it would be so cheap ; I wish two . " And these he got , for two magnificent carillons , played by keyboard and clockwork , exist to-day in the royal residence at Mafra , near Lisbon .  | Only copper and block tin , in the proportion of three parts of copper to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same practice prevails among the best bell founders to-day . From which it may well be concluded that the " golden molten " bells of Poe , the " heart-of-iron " bells of Longfellow , and the " silvery " bells of other writers are solely poetic license . 1,500 TUNING FORKS BRING BELLS INTO ACCURATE TUNE In one foreign bell foundry the equipment consists in part of 1500 tuning forks . There bells are brought into as accurate tune as is a piano . Properly made bells , once in tune , remain so always . It is half a day 's journey from The Hague to that part of the Singing Tower region far in the northeast of the Netherlands , where purple heather and hills abound . Groningen , not far from the seacoast , in these higher lands , merits a visit . Here , high up in the tower of St. Martin 's Church , we saw one of the finest of carillons . When we were there a city watchman , as had been the custom for centuries past . spent the night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every quarter of an hour , he appeared successively on each of the lofty miniature balconies that face each point of the compass . After all was serene in the sleeping town below , he sent out to north , south , east , and west a faint trumpet strain . And what more restful reminder that " All is well ' ' can be conceived ; or what more frugal scheme to let the tax-  | paying burgher know that at least one employe is awake and on his job ! Alas ! this ancient custom has now ceased , and the last survivor of the trumpeting tower watchmen , a company that even in recent years has given a medieval touch to many a city of the Low Countries , through the operation of municipal economy , has been retired . Other explorations took its to Amersfoort , Arnhem , Utrecht , Middelburg , Flushing , Veere and Zierikzee , in each of which towns we found carillons which commanded our interest and invited our study . And then our journey took us into Belgium . ONE SCENE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking out over the trees of the Place Verte , at Antwerp , from the open windows of our hotel we saw the Cathedral spire close enough to us to reveal the  | delicate details of its beauty , and , above the confusion of the flower market and tramcars in the busy square below , we heard , b of o r e the great bell Karolus - truck the hour , a lightly falling carillon melody . Full of poetic associations are the nearby river banks , for it is " On the Scheldt , near Antwerp , " that one scene of " Lohengrin " is laid . And majestic are the sweep of space and time and the silence of night , with this music dominating all , that Rosetti has conceived in his poem , " Antwerp and Bruges . " At Ghent , where the hells hang in a separate structure . the Belfry , an intelligent custodian took us up the tower in a modern electric lift . Nowhere else is a carillon tower so equipped , and to those who would gain the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells of a carillon of the first order , and its mechanism and the carillonneur 's cabin , and vet would avoid an arduous climb , Ghent is commended ( see page 373 ) . The carillon of Ghent rang out more than a century ago when , on December .24 , 1814 , the Treaty of Peace between Great Britain and the United States was concluded . LONGFELLOW WAS INSPIRED BY BELGIUM 'S SINGING TOWERS Eighty years before Bruges came into our field of exploration , Longfellow , dwelling in Belgium in his student days , had felt the appeal of the Singing Towers . The entries in his diary of 1842 , and his poem " The Belfry of Bruges , " of which one part is called " Carillon , " show the impressions then made upon him . In the World War the carillonneur of Bruges was of age to serve in the army and , his wife and child having been sent to England , he was compelled , so he told us , to leave the carillon to its fate . When the war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked permission to go and see how his home had  | fared . Finding all was well there , he ascended the tower and sought out his beloved bells . There he discovered the wires had been cut , but quickly mending them , he was able , when the King and Queen rode into the city a few hours later , to inspire the crowds below with the strains of La Brabanconne . A CONCERT BY THE PADERLWSKI OE THE CARILLON Most glorious of all the Singing Towers is that which rises above St. Rombold 's noble cathedral at Malines ( Mechlin ) . Appropriately it , too , is the cathedral in which the great Cardinal Mercier officiates . We arranged our journey so as to reach Malines for the anniversary of the 35 years of service of the distinguished carillonneur Josef Denyn . His skill is indeed marvelous . Well may he be called the Paderewski of the carillon . Having arrived at Malines early on Saturday evening , we found ourselves in the current of a street pageant in Denyn 's honor . Ancient guilds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procession . Thousands of people filled the old streets . Houses and public buildings everywhere were gaily decorated . This impressive pageant was but the beginning of events which filled four days , during which came the inauguration of the School of Carillon Instruction , free to all the world ; the meeting of the first Carillon Congress ever assembled ; the opening of the Exposition of Carillon Art , lasting through September , and the playing of visiting carillonneurs from France , Holland , and Belgium . On Sunday noon , in the crowded Town Hall , the burgomaster presented to Denyn a gold medal from the city , and there the American Ambassador to Belgium spoke . Carillon art attains its noblest expression in the evening concerts by Denyn at Malines . These take place year after year , on Monday evenings , in June , August , and September , from 9 to 10 o'clock . Malines is midway between Antwerp and Brussels and distant only half an @# hour from each , so that multitudes from both these cities attend the concerts . Of late many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all parts of the world . A program of the music to be played at each concert is published months in advance . And while the great master plays all is quiet , even in the Grand ' Place . That Monday evening , after the hour bell of St. Rombold 's Cathedral ceased striking and the vibration of its deep and solemn tone had died away , there was silence . So long a silence it seemed , so absolute , that we wondered if it was ever to be broken . Then pianissimo , from the highest , lightest bells , as if not to startle us , and from far , far above the tower ? it seemed , indeed , as if very gently shaken from the sky itself ? came trills and runs that were angelic . Rapidly they grew in volume and majesty , as they descended the scale , until the entire heavens seemed full of music . Seated in the garden , we watched the little light in the tower , where we knew the unseen carillonneur sat at his keyboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we watched and listened , we somehow felt that the music came from somewhere far beyond the tower , far higher than that dim light , and was produced by superhuman hands . Sometimes the sounds were so low that we found ourselves bending forward to hear them . They seemed to come from an infinite distance , so faint and delicate were they . Then , at other times , great chords , in the volume of many organs , burst forth rapturously ! The concert ended at lo o'clock with the national air of Belgium . Directly after this the great bell slowly struck the hour . THE WORLD HAS 180 CARILLONS In the world to-day are 18o carillons . Of these 134 are in Belgium and the Netherlands . The rest are scattered in other parts of Europe , the United States . and Canada . Eleven carillons were destroyed in the World War , but already three of these have been replaced .
