About Rome there is much woeful wagging of heads . Vatican expenses have mounted . This year 's income is reported already expended . What the Vatican 's total income is has never been revealed since 1870 , when the temporalities were confiscated by Italy . Pius IX ( died 1878 ) left $6,000,000 of income-bearing capital . Of this sum his successor Leo XIII ( died 1903 ) lost some $2,000,000 by poor investments , yet recouped himself by administrative economies . Pius XI 's income-producing wealth is more than $7,000,000 . But most of the annual income is derived from current donations . Most important is " Peter 's pence , " - of which the U. S. donates more annually than all the rest of the world . <P> The Pope appointed Bishop Raymond Marie Rouleau of Valleyfield , Quebec , Canada , to be Archbishop of Quebec . <P> The Vatican heard without comment that drops of red liquid flowed from the eyes of an obscure " Virgin and Child , " a fresco on a building now being demolished , in Milan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Virgin 's displeasure " at the men folk , who swear too much . " <P> The Pope appointed as bishops three Chinese , the first of their race in Catholic history . <P> Recent notice to William Vincent Griffin of Peapack , N. J. , and Manhattan that the Pope had made him a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory was but another mark of esteem to a man who , just turned 40 , has been able to establish his real estate and industrial enterprises so well that he can now give considerable time to Catholic community welfare ( Postgraduate Hospital , Calvert Associates , others ) .
