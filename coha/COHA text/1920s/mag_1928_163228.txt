Therefore , in the minds of his countrymen , it was by no means disrespectful but instead highly laudable to discuss minutely the state of those organs which caused the trouble . The three physicians attending Dr. Stresemann responded to public demand with copious bulletins as exciting to some readers as the minutes of a horse race . Omitting technicalities , the kidney bulletins were : <P> One not functioning , other sluggish . <P> Sluggish kidney thought poisoned by bad meat . <P> Poison theory exploded but kidneys still inflamed . <P> Both kidneys resume functioning . <P> <P> Specialists announce " fear of relapse is over " and review in detail stomach , heart and " paratyphoid influenza " symptoms , which had contributed to the disorder . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme pain , cracked occasional jokes with his physicians . <P> On election day , last week , patient Gustav Stresemann protested that he felt well enough to go out and vote ; but doctors , nurses and Frau Stresemann only tucked him in the closer .
