All during the last political campaign , Democrats and Progressives harried Republicans with the demand : " Why has n't President Coolidge acted on the Tariff Commission 's recommendations for a reduction in the tariff on sugar ? Is he trying to hold off until after election ? " <P> Mr. Coolidge received the Tariff Commission 's sugar recommendations on July 31 , 1924 . He did hold off until after November 3 , until after January 1 , until after April 1 . Last week , he announced his decision . <P> The Situation . The tariff on sugar is 1.764c a pound . The Commission has authority to investigate demands for changes in the tariff and recommend changes based on differences in cost of production here and abroad . The President has authority to act on such recommendations , reducing of increasing specific tariffs by not more than 50 per cent . The Tariff Commission ( one member not sitting ) recommended 1 ) by majority of three , a reduction of tariff to 1.2302c a pound , 2 ) by minority of two , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President decided not to alter the sugar tariff . <P> Reasons Given : <P> 1 ) Conditions have changed since the recommendations were made . In 1923 , when the investigations began , the price of wholesale granulated sugar was 8.40c a pound ; in 1924 , when the recommendations were made , 6.37c a pound ; in May of this year , 5.48c a pound . The present prices differ little from pre-War prices , although other foodstuffs have gone up 50 per cent . Therefore , the consumer has little objection to the tariff . <P> 2 ) The U. S. farmer , needing a chance to diversify his crops , needs the tariff protection as much as other industries need their protection . Only by maintaining the sugar tariff can the U. S. be made selfsupporting , or approximately so , in sugar productions . <P> 3 ) To reduce the duty on sugarc , as recommended by the majority , would cost the Government $40,000,000 a year in revenue . <P> 4 ) The conclusions of the Commission are not final . By using different years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , even calling for an increase of tariff could be obtained . Therefore it is better to wait for a longer period of stable conditions before changing the tariff . <P> 5 ) To reduce the tariff would destroy-at least in part - the domestic sugar producing industry . Then foreign producers , having a virtual monoply , might boost the price . For the protection of the consumer as well as the farmer , the sugar tariff should not be reduced . <P> Political Results . The President 's decision is sure to arouse Democratic criticism , which should rise in crescendo as the Congressional elections next year approach-especially if the retail price of sugar should increase .
