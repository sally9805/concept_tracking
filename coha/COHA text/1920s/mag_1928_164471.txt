Perfecting the instruments by which men shall individually kill their fellow men is not a pretty science , but in every army some one must study it . In the U. S. his name is Brigadier-General John T. Thompson , retired . He directed all the U. S. arsenals during the War and , as chief of the small arms division of the Ordnance Department , he improved the Army 's standard Enfield rifle and distributed it promptly among the A. E. F. After the War , General Thompson set himself the task of perfecting a one-man machine gun and a self-loading infantry rifle . <P> The one-man Thompson machine gun , or so-called " submachine gun , " was perfected some time ago and adopted by many a city police force as well as the U. S. Marines . It weighs only ten pounds , which is 100% lighter than any other weapon of similar functions . It fires 100 shots per minute and is valued for spraying death into a city street or narrow mountain defile . U. S. gangsters as well as police admire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip or from a rest on boulder , windowsill or automobile tonneau . <P> The self-loading infantry rifle perfected by General Thompson was last week awarded the British War Office prize of $15,000 and will now be tried generally throughout the British Army . A rifle for each soldier to carry , to fire aimed shots from the shoulder without pausing to reload , the Thompson self-loader differs from a machine gun in that the trigger is pulled for each shot instead of held down for a continuous stream of lead . Rid of the necessity for bolting a new cartridge into the firing chamber between shots , as in hand-loading rifles , a soldier can aim 25 or 30 shots per minute with the Thompson self-loader . <P> <P> A bullet no bigger round than a seed-pearl would kill a man if projected through his heart , brain or spinal cord . But martial experience has found 30/100 of an inch to be about the ideal diameter for man-killing bullets . The prize-winning Thompson weapon is .30 calibre . <P> Increased lethal effect is obtained by softening the nose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacketed bullets shoot straightest and farthest but bore clean holes instead of smashing a wide wound . Various powder loads have various killing power , but following is a rough table of the calibres and types of bullets generally recommended for various types of killing by rifle : <P> <P> PREY BULLET DIAM .
