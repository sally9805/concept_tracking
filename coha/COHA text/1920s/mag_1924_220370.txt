A sack of flour now costs $3.25 more than before the rise in wheat started . Roughly every 75 advance on the flour sack means a penny more for a loaf of bread . Already the four-pound loaf has jumped from 16 to 19 . First and last , it is estimated that the present increase in British bread will call for the payment by England of about $90,000,000 to foreign wheat-exporting countries . <P> The anxiety of the British over the future price of breadstuffs is aggravated by the fact that already there are over 1,000,000 unemployed , and that exports stand a third below the pre-War rate . Some hunger may be felt in Great Britain as a result . <P> The effect in Central Europe will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consuming about 550,000,000 bushels of wheat each year .
