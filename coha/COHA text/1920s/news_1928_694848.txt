Announcement of the decision of the wing was made tonight , bringing promise of a sharp threecornered fight for the control of the State delegation . John 0 . Davis , one of the Northern California Committee of Five , repre7enting the wing , . was , notified by John B. Elliott of Los Angeles by telephone that Walsh had agreed to have his name go on the primary ballot . The list of delegates which will be pledged to : the Montana Senator will be announced within a few days . - . That would head the antiSmith group has ' been known for some time . He will oppose the Smith ticket which former United States Senator James D. Phelan leads , and the Reed group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued from the leaders said : " The Northern California Committee of Five in complete accord with the Southern California Committee of Five already has named ' its list of outstanding and ' in many instances nationally known delegates , public announcement of which will be made within a very few days . These delegates will constitute a solid and unbroken phalanx of dry , , progressive anti-Tammany , Woodrow Wilson Democrats . " The Presidential candidate has been agreed upon unanimously and enthusiastically . He will commend himself to the sober thought of the people ; attract the agriculturally minded South and West ; appeal to the honest citizenship of the country , regardless of political affiliation . He will weld together all elements of the warty into an effective fighting force such as we have not witnessed since the vigorous and inspiring leadership of Woodrow Wilson captured the imagination of the public , carried California and planted the banner of Democracy on the steps of the national capital . " Senator Walsh 's entrance into the California fight is unexpected . It was believed that the dry group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Agriculture . The ticket will have the backing of the Anti-Saloon League . Senator Admits His Candidacy . Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , March 2 . ? Senator Thomas J. Walsh , a Catholic and a dry , appeared openly tonight as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in opposition to Governor Smith of New York , Catholic and a " wet . " First reports that Senator Walsh was ? in the race came in dispatches from . California that the forces in that State were preparing to enter the Senator in the primary contest there . When Senator Walsh v : as asked about this late tonight he said : " I was importuned some time ago to allow my name to be used and I simply said that I would not veto it . It is very generous of my friends there to think of me . " The action taken in California seems to indicate that Mr. has turned to Senator Walsh as the most available man to lead the cause of the drys in an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Walsh is a Catholic , it was felt in political circles here , would avail to give Mr. an argument that his only purpose in throwing his strength against Governor Smith was to keep the Democratic Party dry , and that personal bitterness and the religious issue had nothing to do with his own activities . Mr. , whose political power , according to many observers , had long been failing , stated some time ago that he would not himself be a candidate for the nomination . As a result of Mr. 's withdrawal , and the activity of the ' friends of Governor Smith in building up organizations for him in some Far Western and Middle Western States , it looked as if Governor Smith would probably get most of the delegates from , these States without much : opposition . California and some ? other Western States had virtually been placed in the Smith column . The appearance of Walsh in the race will serve to cast doubt on the outcome . Senator Walsh would not discuss his plans in detail tonight , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , he will seek delegates in several States . If he has any material success in his venture and Senator Reed of Missouri , who is in California now pressing his , candidacy , also gets a considerable number of delegates , the possibility of a deadlock at the Democratic National Convention is increased . Entrance of a man as conspicuous in public life as is Senator Walsh will also bring the wet and dry issue sharply to the front and emphasize its iriiportance as an issue when the convention meets at Houston . Senator Walsh is as dry as professes to be and presents a more striking figure about whom the dry wing of the party may rally than does any other candidate who has come out in the open . He was Permanent Chairman of the 1924 convention and would have been nominated for the Vice Presidency by . acclamation had he not suddenly adjourned ' the convention while ? delegates in various parts of the hall were ? vainly attempting to obtain recognititon and place his name before the gathering .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
