In this piece he is the smartaleck vaudevillager whose wife becomes a famed cinemactress while he is left in comparative obscurity . He wins her back from a sleek cinemactor ( Ricardo Cortez ) after slap-stickery and problem-solving . <P> Danger Street . The jilted " clubman " can not honorably take his own life , but a distorted sense of honor permits him to meddle in the affairs of a gang-governed district , hoping always that a gangster 's bullet will end it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , but the girl ( Martha Sleeper ) , a luncheon cashier , lists not to the mating song of the clubman when she learns he has been balked by another .

Hopping a freight with the gang to elude hawkshaws who were after Murderess Nancy , Oklahoma Red holds informal court , sentences Nancy 's young hobo to be thrown off the train . The discovery of the hawkshaws on the train postpones execution of the sentence . Red uncouples the car in which the hoboes are riding and temporarily foils the hawkshaws . He continues to attempt to take Nancy until the realization is driven into his consciousness that she loves her young hobo , none other . As wholeheartedly as he desired the girl for himself , Red is converted to helping Nancy to free enjoyment of Nancy 's fancy . The rest of this active picture exposes his methods . <P> Here is a realistic reel . The hobo types might easily have been friends of onetime-hobo Tully on the road .
