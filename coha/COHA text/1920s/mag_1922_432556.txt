T WAS the evening of the Birthnight ball when George Anne arrived , in a hackney coach , attended by her dresser , and scarce visible for mantua boxes . The three children were put away ? / heir usual fate ? in the beds within , and though not able to sleep for excitement , were mute as mice , lest they be punished by the closing of the door upon the ravishing glimpses they had of the parlour . ' T is not for a mere scribbler to intrude upon the chaste mysteries of the toilet . Suffice it , therefore , to say that , when all was completed , George Anne and Mrs March , the dresser , stood back , breathless , to contemplate the work of their hands . Mrs Gunning , her fine brown hair piled on her head into an edifice twisted with gauze and feathers that granted her five inches more of height , looked a Roman empress ? her fine host displayed to advantage and sustaining a necklace of stage emeralds set in pinchbeck , which could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they copied for George Anne from her Grace the Duchess of Bridgewater 's . Iler hoop was very wide , and over it a green satin brocade flowered with gold , wherein George Anne had played Lady Modish but twenty times , and so rich that ' t would serve her great-granddaughter . ' T was ruffled at neck and elbow with h Mechlin , and the girls gazed in awe at their splendid mama . T was a changed woman . She expanded , she glided , she moved , as a swan floating through her native ele cent differs from the sante lurching along the bank . But Elizabeth ? 0 beautiful ! Sure ' t was joy to see her ! Her hair , agleam with gold , was rolled back and carried in massive braids that crowned and bound her head in the Grecian taste , confined by a bandeau of pearls that crossed her brow . Her Grecian robe ( indeed the fair Miss Lebeau had played Calista in it ) was a white satin with a fall of lace , and round her slender throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . ' T was simple , but simplicity becomes a goddess , and frills and flounces can but distract the eye from loveliness that seems native to heaven . Her mother surveyed her in a kind of amaze and then turned to Maria . ' T was peculiar to these two fair sisters that they adorned each other , each appearing more beautiful when both were in company . Indeed ' t was said later that this coati-allied much to their triumphs . Maria now appeared in a fine India muslin embroidered in gold wheat-ears , a robe which , ' t is to be feared , Mr Sidney of the East India Company , the rich nabob of Jubblepore , had laid at the feet of George Anne in pursuance of a suit not wholly disdained . No matter ! On Maria it shone like the raiment of the youngest of the angels , draping yet expressing her fair limbs with a seductive reserve that was art embellishing nature . She had a row of seed pearl like her sister , and one rose of faintest pink nestled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in curls a is mouton , as:Mrs March expressed it , and a string of pearls wove through the rich tresses . But ' t is useless to describe beauty . As well dry a rose in a book and look for bloom and dew . It depends on bright eye and smiling lip and wordless sweetness and the fall of exquisite lashes and the tone of music and ? and this poor scribbler lays down his pen and attempts no more to paint where the great artists later owned themselves vanquished . And all is prepared , ' cries George Anne , exulting . ' For my mother 's job coach is at hand to take my three beauties ; and distress not yourself , my dearest Madam , for I engage to remain with your little family and will return in the coach when it deposits you here . And now , children , peep and whisper no longer , but come see your lovely mama and sisters before they go to conquer the world . ' ' T was the kindest heart ! She clapped her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose , careering round and about the three , shouting , laughing , and begging to be took also . Raisins and oranges from George Anne 's reticule alone restored them to their beds in pence . " The Golden Vanity " has sent forth two incomparable beauties , ' says she at the door as they stepped into the coach . May it bring them the luck of its heroine and more . ' St Patrick 's Hall was all of a blaze with wax candles and flambeaux , and shining mirrors set in with gilt Cupids , and twinkling of fairy lights in the great glass lustres and their glittering chains of drops and pendants . Garlands of green , with roses interspersed , were in swags and loops about the splendid walls , where hung the pictures of bygone viceroys in ribbon and star , in frames to match the mirrors that multiplied the scene a hundredfold , And , more than all , the handsomest women in Ireland were decked out in silks and satins and all the family jewels , and they sparkling like the lustres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms and silk stockings showing off their fine calves , and they strutting with their swords and squiring the ladies and bowing . And above it all the Throne , with the velvet canopy and the Royal Arms , and my Lord Harrington , his Excellency , sitting like a picture of himself , with his stars and orders and his coat of sky-blue velvet laced and embroidered with gold ; and as each pretty lady came up to him and swept her curtsey he lifted her by the hand and kissed her cheek ; for the Viceroy has that privilege , and many a man envied him a few of the kisses , if they did not envy them all . And now at the great doors appeared three ladies , quietly , like persons used to assemblies , though to be honest their knees were trembling under them and their little hearts quaking . So they were passed on from one golden image to another , until they arrived before his Excellency , the company politely making way , and a whisper that rose to a buzz running with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Who can they be ? ' ? ' Look at the girls Exquisite ! ' ? ' Beautiful ! ' ? Tor my part I see nothing in them . Vilely dressed . Very far from modish . ' Too tall . ' ? " roo short ' ? in fact , every expression of approval and disfavour . But every lady stood on the tips of her satin shoes to see , and every gentleman took the fullest advantage of his height ; and had poor Harry been there , he had died of jealousy . Alas ! even his fond letters were not in Elizabeth 's gentle bosom , but tossed forgot on the bed in Britain Street , with George Anne casting the eye of sensibility on them . And now the officer who performed the introduction took Mrs Glinting 's gloved hand , very stately , and led her before the Throne . The Honourable Mrs Gunning , your Excellency . ' Down she flowed in a magnificent curtsey , her hands supporting her brocade on either side , her head bent majestic ? Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dais . What ? ' he cries . Do my eyes deceive me ? Impossible ! But sure I have the happiness to see the daughter of my old friend , and I am honoured beyond expression to welcome her beneath my roof . Where have you been retired ? And what are these two lovely nymphs ? Your daughters ? No , sure it ca n't be and you all youth and beauty yourself . Present them . ' And while mama blushed and bridled , the magic words were spoke , and the two dropped the gentlest curtseys , and rising , received a salute more than usual warm from his Excellency on either fair blushing cheek . ' T was observed he lingered an instant on Maria 's . Viceroys , too , are human . ' T was an instantaneous conquest ? how could it be otherwise ? A moment later they were the centre of a competing crowd of gentlemen , and glances of coldness and aversion mining on them from ladies only a little less fair and now deserted . That his Excellency was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not in company with the beauties , he was discoursing of them to others . True it is that he conducted the Dowager Rathconnel to the suppertable , but equally true , that he left the lady seated before such dainties as ensure an old age of gout , disengaging himself with a nimble wit that should have appeased her , and sought out the mother of the Graces , devoting himself to memories of old times , while Maria and Elizabeth danced and smiled on their adorers , blooming and beautiful . My dear Madam , ' says his Lordship , how is it possible that you have lived so retired for fifteen years ? ' T was not justice to your admirers ? of whom I was ever one . How came it about ? ' Why , your Excellency , ' says the lady very serious , ' ' t was not with my good-will . You know well that my late father 's good heart was his chief possession ; and my husband ? alas ! ' Sure a pause and downcast eyes are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peruke , and echoed the lady . Alas ! Cards , horses , the bottle ? how many a wife and mother bath had cause to curse that fatal trinity ! And ' t is even so , Madam ? ' She applied George Anne 's laced handkerchief to her eye , then smiled faintly and seeing opportunity , seized it . ' I would not cloud this festive scene , your Excellency , yet why should I reserve from a tried friend that I and my poor daughters ? ' Yes , yes ! ' cries his Lordship , very impatient . Are here this night in borrowed dress , ' continues Mrs G. solemnly , ' and are indebted even for the shoes upon our feet to the kindness of an actress , Mrs Bellamy . ' Good God ! ' says Lord Harrington , genuinely shocked , and the more so that he had himself known Mrs Bellamy some years since . ' Sure it ca n't be ! I wo n't believe it . Indeed , we must discourse further of this . Come hither ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there they fell into so deep discussion that never had he been such a negligent host . And when Mrs Gunning left the withdrawing-room , it was with an imperial head held high , and a flush in her cheek which became her so well that the most prying female eye would not give her a day over thirty . His Excellency led out Maria to a minuet . Twice he took Elizabeth down the country-dances . The generous wine had warmed his heart , the glow of beauty kindled it to flame , and it was plain to be seen that his eyes were only for the fair Gunnings . The world followed his example ? when does it otherwise ? ? and a petal from Maria 's rose , a look from the violet , dark-lashed eyes of Elizabeth , were the prizes of the night . A party of noblemen escorted them to the doors on leaving , and ' t was with the utmost difficulty Mrs Gunning persuaded them it was unnecessary to ride in cavalcade about the coach to Britain Street . When the ladies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Irish Beauties , ' and break their glasses in their honour until the floor was strewn with broken crystal , and the celebrants were most of them borne speechless to their beds . Indeed , a challenge passed between my Lords Cappoquin and Tuam upon a dispute as to which lady was the greater Venus . Never was such a triumph ! And Mrs Gunning , falling into George Anne 's arms in Britain Street , declared with tears of joy : ' You were right , entirely right , my dearest Madam . I am promised a handsome pension on the Irish Establishment , and his Excellency counsels me to transport my girls to London , where , he considers , they may pretend to the highest matches , and promises introductions worthy of them . And , 0 Madam , playing at faro in the cardroom , I won a milleleva ? no less ! ? Fifty guineas ! ? Lord ! was ever anyone so happy ! ' Tears of sensibility stood hi George Anne 's eyes . She was one who shared to the full the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. 's hand and embraced the fair conquerors , scorning to mention the rent in Maria 's muslin gown , and the stain of wine on Elizabeth 's satin . It was a generous heart , and had earned more gratitude than she afterwards received from two , at least , of the ladies . ' T was amazing to Mrs Gunning and Maria now , that ever they had contemplated the stage ? so very far below their pretensions ; and it took but a week to open the former lady 's eyes to the little cracks in George Anne 's reputation . She saw plainly that such a friendship could be no aid to their soaring aspirations ; and indeed her ambition had now spread its wings to some purpose . The Earl of Harrington having advanced the first installment of her pension , she immediately moved their lodging to the genteeler Mount Street , and Britain Street was forgot , along with George Anne . Sure a mother must be prudent ! Elizabeth only forsook not her friend , going to wait upon her and carrying with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister and herself . She had little in her power , for money was still none too plenty ; but kindness and gratitude smell sweeter even than roses , and these she carried in handfuls straight from a grateful heart to George Anne . It smoothed not her own path in Mount Street , for Mrs Gunning 's pride grew with what fed it , and though admirition was plenty , offers were few . It might be that the enmity of the Dub. lin ladies stood in their way , for certain it is that Mrs G. was never a favourite . Where she judged well to flatter , she flattered too openly ; where she disliked and saw no gain , she insulted ; and many gentlemen would have retired from her acquaintance , but for Maria 's frolicsome gaiety and the sweetness of Elizabeth . It gained ground about the city that there was much scheming in Mount Street with a view to rich husbands , and it smirched the girls as well as their mama , and put thorns in their way . It made the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maria was the hardier and took it as a necessity of their situation ; but the milder Elizabeth wept often on George Anne 's kind bosom over the insults ( as she took ? it ) which Mrs Gunning received with rapture , as hopeful signs of love . And , whatever the actress 's own case might be , ' t is certain she showed more delicacy in dealing with the girl than did her lady mother . Nor had she much comfort from Mr Harry 's letters . His father remained adamant ; and though he writ , ' t was more carelessly , and a rumour reached Dublin that coupled his name with the great fortune , Miss Hooker , and was generally took for truth . Mrs Gunning greeted it with pleasure , regarding Mr Harry as a gone-by and much below her hopes ; but though Elizabeth 's heart was not wounded , her pride was pierced to the quick . It seemed that all the world conspired to humiliate her , and she asked herself what was the use of beauty , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last letter unanswered . Miss Maria too had her troubles . My Lord Errington pursued her with ardour , and his handsome rakish face and gallant impudence drew the pretty moth towards the heat and flame of a dangerous candle . Folly , no more ; but his lady took her vengeance in scandals that spread about the town , and a duel was fought that did Maria no good and kept off worthier pretenders to her hand ; and indeed it was not a day too soon when the family packed up their belongings and changed the air to London . The girls outshone all others ? true ! but ' t was thought more in beauty than discretion , for Elizabeth must needs sink with her family . The world draws not nice distinctions . But to say they were courted in London is to say little . They broke trisim pliant upon the town , supported by letters from his Excellency , and the town received them with frenzy , as it might the great Italian singer or the new lions at the Tower , or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put himself at their disposal , urged thereto by a particular letter from my Lord Harrington and his own love of beauty . He dangled about them daily , and it must be owned that , from the first moment of meeting , Mrs Gunning fixed the eye of cupidity on his Grace . For of all of the matches of the Kingdom , James Hamilton was the greatest available . Duke of Brandon in England , of Chittelherault in France , of Hamilton in Scotland , of vast possessions , of suitable age and gallant presence , a princess need not have disdained his hand . A great prince , indeed , and knowing it possibly too well , ' t was he to dazzle a girl 's eye and carry her heart by storm ! As for hearts , it was never supposed his G race possessed one ; at least , he wore it not on his sleeve , but was ever cold and haughty , though it was well known he liked a pretty woman as well as any ? short of the wedding ring . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until wagers began to be laid at . White 's as to which had caught his favour , and where would fall the handkerchief of the Grand Bashaw . Meanwhile , his attentions made them more than ever the mode , and the town gallants swarmed about them like bees at the Assemblies where they figured , attended by my Lord Duke in ribbon and star . As the days went by , however , the anxious mother observed that his preference was for Elizabeth , and that he had no thought to interfere with my Lord Coventry , who could not keep his eyes off Maria , though he committed himself no further than the Duke . Indeed , stories were now freely circulated concerning Britain Street and the poverty and shifts of the family , and wagers were laid that neither the one nobleman nor the other looked for more than a few months ' amusement with the two loveliest girls in England . Mrs Gunning was openly called the Adventuress , and it was a favourite sport with some Ladies to imitate her Irish accent and carnying ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little too openly for her lord . They were , in short , easy game for the mockers , and Elizabeth shrunk daily more into the shade . It appeared as if it would be the Dublin story over again . Mr Harry came at once to their lodging on his return from Yorkshire , and , to be sure , had not a word to say of Miss Hooker . He would have saluted Elizabeth , but she drew back with a curtsey , her manner sweet and cold as an autumn dawn with a touch of winter in the air . He found her changed , and no wonder , and said as much with some anger . ' It should not surprise you , Harry , ' says she serenely . ' I am now eighteen , and have seen the world , as you have also . Our betrothal was a child 's game . I like you too well to be your ruin . Marry Miss Hooker , of whom I hear . " 1 ' is your best way , and obedience to parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dublin , ' replies Mr Lepel , casting a jealous eye on the fair monitress . If her looks had changed it was to a more radiant sweetness , and there was that in the way her long silken Lashes lay on her fair cheek that dwarfed Miss Hooker 's fortune . He had better have kept Isis distance from the siren , he thought with bitterness . But sure a. little pleasant dallying could hurt neither Miss Hooker nor his father ? a summer pastime and no more ; and if the tales flying about town were but the half of them true , he might hope for this , especially with the past pleading for him in Elizabeth 's tender heart . Sure there was a softening in her glance . He pushed his chair somewhat nearer and took her hand . She withdrew it , and removed her seat farther away . ' Is my Elizabeth angry with her Harry ? ' cries he witha fine dramatic air . Does she forget those happy days when we were all to one another ? What is Miss Hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Your future wife , as I understand , ' says Elizabeth , perfectly calm . ' No , Mr Lepel ? I know the world now , better than I could wish ' ( she sighed ) , and I desire not your attentions . I ? ' But Mr Lepel broke in , pale and furious . And is it thus you speak , you heartless jade ? Clothes , jewels , balls , ' t is these you value . Is there a woman alive that will not sell her soul for the like ? 0 God , why are fair faces made to madden us ? Now I have seen you once more , how can I return to that flatfaced ? ' She rose , with a wave of her hand that dismissed him ; but he ranted on in a towering passion of wrath and grief . It had all burst up anew in his heart , in and for a moment . He believed himself hardly used indeed . ' Could I bury my father and inherit his land , you would not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , and you are for sale like an Eastern slave . Who is the highest bidder ? But I know well . What am I to compare with ? ' His Grace the Duke of Hamilton ? ' announces Mrs Abigail , very demure in her pinners at the door ; and in walks his Grace , magnificent in manners and dress , and Mr Lepel 's fury stopped on a breath , though he could not regain countenance as readily as Elizabeth . She rose to meet the visitor ? a rose in June ; and he might take the blush of anger which was due to Mr Lepel for a welcome to himself . What could Mr Harry do but draw back , stammering and looking foolish under the cold glance Duke Hamilton bestowed on him . Prudence counselled , Withdraw . What do you here ? ' Angry Love retorted , ' Here I stay . What ! Shall I leave the field to a rival ? ' And so , he flung himself in a chair glaring defiance , Elizabeth palpitating between the two . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke , as if for protection ; that there was an imploring softness in her face as she looked up to him ; that she saw him greater , handsomer , stronger than ever , beside this idle and futile young man who had reviled her . The carelessness of his glance at Mr Lepel seemed to fling his pretensions in the mud ? his haughty coolness to degrade the young man ; and to such thoughts women are responsive . If her heart was touched before , the dart went deeper now . She held her head higher , deerlike , and wasted no words on the unwelcome guest . The two gentlemen , seeing neither could outstay the other , departed presently together , Mr Lepel saying with assumed lightness as he bowed , bat in hand , at the door : ' We had not the pleasure to see madame la your Grace , and no doubt but she is slipped away on some hunting errand . I wonder what new fox is broke cover . Half the world bets on my Lord Coventry still ! ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell whether or no his arrow had gone home through the armour of chilly pride and silence . He himself strode angry and ashamed down the street . That same evening a council of three was held hi the lodging : Mrs Gunning with her mask of smiles laid by , Maria fretful , Elizabeth grave and retired in her own thoughts . The ladies had but the one bedroom , with a little closet for the youngest adjoining . Girls , ' says Mrs Gunning , " T is time I spoke plain . This six weeks in town hath reduced my purse till I am frighted to look in it ; and what have we to show ? Young women with not half your looks are married and settled since we came hither . We have had a vast deal of froth and flutter , but nothing solid . Were it possible to live on sweetmeats and dress in posies , we have a fine prospect , but not else . I see naught before us but Britain Street ? or worse . ' Maria shrugged her white shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Ramsden has offered marriage , and Captain Golightly ; and Mr Lennox has asked Elizabeth , and Mr Lepel ? ' What signifies all that ? ' cries Mrs Gunning . ' Do n't let them slip . They ' II serve for the future perhaps , if all fails . Elizabeth , I command you on your duty that you please Mr Lepel , though not more than sufficient to content him . If we ca n't better him ? But Maria , what said my Lord Coventry to you at Lady Lowther 's ball ? I saw him very earnest . ' Nothing that might n't be in the news-prints , mama . His breed of black shorthorns filled his thought and tongue . I protest I loathed the man 's folly . ' T is an insipid creature when all ' s said . ' No man with a coronet is insipid . He is grave and reserved , and I would he had been Elizabeth 's admirer rather than yours , for they could have sat silent in a corner together . But what of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Elizabeth flamed in a blush , less beautiful than painful . A sore heart was behind it . She replied not . Mrs Gunning frowned . ' Well , girls , you ' re easy enough , but so an , not I. Now therefore listen while I speak my mind . ' ' T is needless to be particular in recording the lady 's speech , which was much to the point in dealing with their needs and stratagems . She spoke for many minutes and at the end tears of shame and anger were in Maria 's lovely eyes . If Elizabeth wept , ' t was behind a sheltering hand . What signifies grumbling ? ' finishes Mrs Gunning . ' ' T is as plain as the nose on your face .. Elizabeth 's is the best chance , and if she makes her match , my Lord Coventry will kiss your slipper , Maria . The Duchess 's sister can marry where she will . ' ' T was vain to interrupt . Mrs Gunning sailed on , maternal , imperative , and took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk that followed , and the plan laid for the entrapping of his Grace , of whom it may be said that he could protect himself against even the assaults of beauty better than Mrs Gunning supposed . But Elizabeth , borne down by two to her one , fought a losing game . I hate the man , ' she cried with spirit , and knew ' t was false as she said it . ' I ' d sooner sweep a crossing ? ' Mrs Gunning smiled contemptuous . Not you ! You came pretty near it in Britain Street , and ' t is known how you relished it . Beggars , my clear , ca n't be choosers . The Duchess of Hamilton may have as much delicacy as she pleases . Miss Elizabeth Gunning ca n't afford it . There ' s no more to be said . ' Yet Elizabeth said it furiously , and in vain . A subdued light of wax candles ? the most flattering light in the world ? made the parlour enchantment when his Grace sauntered in one evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate scent of violets in the air . On a table by the window lay a magnificent chickenskin fan sent by my Lord Coventry for Maria 's birthday : it was covered with rosy figures of Cupids swinging garlands in blue air , the mother-of-pearl sticks latticed with gold . It lay beside a lace handkerchief , as if a fair hand had flung it careless clown . A decanter of purple Burgundy with two glasses was hard by , and a small painting of the lovely sisters from the hand of Neroni , who had asked the favour to depict them as wood-nymphs . They advanced , smiling and hearing a garland between them clown a forest glade , while two Cupids concealed behind a tree aimed a dart at each fair breast . The Duke contemplated this work of art , smiling at Isis own thoughts , and not pleasantly . Presently the door opened and Mrs Gunning and Maria entered , in hats and capes , followed by Elizabeth , dead pale and in a negligee with blue ribbons , her hair falling in long tresses to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked not even her eighteen years in this dress , and had a most touching beauty . His Grace kissed Mrs Gunning 's hand , yet with the half-contemptuous air of the great man . Some might resent suds a kiss as an insult , but the lady 's armour NN'OS defensive as well as offensive . Says she . curtseying : I beg a thousand pardons , your Grace , but we are disturbed with as unexpected call . " I ' is what we never imagined , but ca n't refuse . Good Mrs Acton , a friend of our Dublin days , k took ill and bath sent for its to Harbour Street . She is unattended in London . and I know your Grace 's sensibility will excuse us . ' Why , Madam , friendship is so rare a virtue that ' t is worth proclaiming at the Exchange . I will give myself the pleasure to wait on you another CVCS-ing : His hat was beneath his arm ; he picked up his clouded cane . I thank your Grace . ' Mrs Gunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Elizabeth . ' And now , my flower , my dove , repose yourself on the couch , and Mrs Abigail will bring you the lavender drops , and let me find my treasure well and smiling on my return . ' What ? Does not Miss Elizabeth accompany her mama ? ' The tone was alert . By no means , your Grace . She has ailed all clay with her head , and is not lit for a sick chamber . Farewell , child . I wait your Grace . ' He took Mrs Gunning 's hand to conduct her to the coach ; ' t was as pretty a comedy as ( WC/ . George Anne Bellamy played . He laughed inwardly leading her to the door , and on the stairs discoursed charmingly on the last masquerade at Vauxhall . Without the hall door he paused . Is Miss Elizabeth Gunning too ailing , Madam , to receive a friend for a few moments ? Permit me to assist you . ' And before the lady could reply , lie bundled the two into the coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cry : know not , your Grace . A moment perhaps ? ' He bowed from the door . Be easy , Madam . I will myself administer the lavender drops if needful . ' It was impossible for the Duke to hasten himself , for this he had never done within the memory of man ; but ' t was scarce a infinite since he had left the rosin when he reentered , half fearing to find his pretty bird flown . Not so , however . She leaned against the shutter , her eyes fixed on the evening sky . It seemed she had forgot his Grace , for her expression was sorrowful and quiet , unlike the female trifling he expected , and he heard a faint sigh . Site turned , startled . Forgive me , my Lord Duke . I think I ca n't stay . My head ? ' She would have glided to the door . 7 was provocative , however meant , and he put himself in her way . She tried the other side of the table . He blocked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased the attempt and stood with eyes cast clown . Child , do n't hasten . Give me a few minutes . I see you alone for the first time and never so lovely as /IOW . Is it your long hair , or what is it ? Sure the angels have locks like this . ' He lifted a heavy tress as if marveling . She snatched it from him like an aggrieved queen ; then , seeming to recollect herself , stood silent again . ' T was but a schoolgirl , with trembling lips and veiling hair . He took her hand like a man accustomed to be obeyed , as indeed he was . Child , your mama hath left you in my care , and you ca n't desire I should relinquish the pleasure . Such an opportunity no gentleman could resist . Be seated , Madam , and let us discourse . ' " 1 ' was all on one side , for she had not opened her lips . But she obeyed him , and sat in the chair he handed her to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss to continue , and stood looking at her where she drooped , then took a chair beside her . You arc pleased to be less cordial than I have known you , Madam . Is it whim or anger ? I like a woman 's pretty coquetries as well as any man , but this silence ? ' It still continued . She was snow and marble . Not a word . Only the dark lashes like fans on her cheek . Not a gleam rewarded him . A sullen beauty ! ' says his Grace languidly , ' but yet a beauty beyond all others . So here we sit ! ' He drew out his jeweled timepiece . ' I give you a minute , Madam ? nay , two . And if by then you have not spoke , I will try if the warmth of a kiss on those sweet lips wo n't thaw the ice . I swear it ! ' Ile laid the sparkling toy at her elbow on the table , and stared in her face . ' T is certain his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any woman thus unless where it was asked for . A minute went by ? the tick was audible , but she moved not . And now a slow hot tear scorched its way down her cheek . If this followed mannt 's instruction , it bettered it . The time was scarce out when he springs up and cries with triumph : ' I was not mistook . Your silence asks a kiss , child , and James Hamilton was never the man to refuse a woman 's challenge . Give me your lips , and more . ' His swashbuckling Border-ancestors were stirring in his veins , and for a moment his face coarsened and his eyes were gross . He caught her by the two arms and bent his mouth upon hem . In a flash the fair statue was living and dangerous . He was a strong man , she a wisp of a girl ; but she flung him off and stood glaring at him . How dare you ? ' she panted , and could no more . The eyes were unveiled at last and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her look thus ; she faced him gallantly . He applauded as if it had been the Woffington or any other fair game . " T is prettily clone ? but I see your drift , Madam . If a young lady is left by her friends and her own desire to sit alone with one of the best-known men in town , she takes the consequences . Yet I would not have missed Lucretia ? she lacked only the dagger in her hand . But the comedy may end . Give me your lips , child , and coquet no more . ' Sir ? if you are a gentleman ? ' Madam , I am a lover . ' ' Oh , ' t is too much ? too much ! ' she cries . ' I have undertook what was beyond me , and I ca n't ? I ca n't carry it through . I would if I could ? I can-not ! ' The strange words , the despair in her face was no stage-play . The Duke knew sincerity when it cried aloud . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring in her face , You can not , Madam ? What mean you ? Are you in earnest ? ' Not withdrawing her hands , fast held and quivering , she kept silence . He could feel the pulses flutter in her wrists , and the fumes of wine cleared slowly out of his brain and carried the brutality with them . Have the condescension to explain yourself . You are safe in my company now . Possibly I was mistook , but I supposed you not unwilling for our the-a-tete . Accept my apologies if this is not the case . I thrust no attentions on women who dislike them . ' Sir , I will explain and go , and never see your face again . I die of shame . ' He could still feel the pitiful flutter in her wrists . He relaxed his grip and handed her to her chair , ? a gentleman again , ? James , Duke of Hamilton and Brandon . I see myself gravely in error Madam . I await your words . ' She would not sit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could scarce hear the silver tremble of her voice . Sir , we are poor . You know this . And last night my mother did ask me whether I supposed your Grace had any feeling for me beyond careless good-will . I knew not . What could I say ? And she then revealed to me ? oh , how reveal it nowt ? that our little means is all but spent , and that gone , we must retire into poverty and misery again . Also that there are debts , and prison for debtors . Also that any match for my sister is impossible to hope for ? No ? how can I tell it ! And she did say that if we could hope ? could but know that ? ' Her voice died on her lips . She hung her head in agony . He took her up . The task is too hard for you . Let me continue . Your mama said that , if she and your sister withdrew and left you wills me , if you put forth your charms ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t was possible you might set the sweetest trap for the rich man , and with his aid clamber out of the mud and sit secure beside him . Confirm me if I do n't err . Confess ! ' ' I confess . ' The words scarce broke the silence . ' And love was not in the bargain , ' the cruel voice persisted . ' Mama did not enquire whether James Hamilton was distasteful to you or the reverse . He was a moneybag ? no man . Confess again . ' ' I confess . Sir , we have used you very ill . I ask your pardon . I was a fair mark for insult . ' Her head dropped lower . She could not otherwise hide her face , but the shame overflowed it in waves of crimson . To be frank , Madam , I have never found your mother congenial company . ' I ' was not for her I sought this house . Tell me , was this her plot only ? Was it acceptable to you ? ' ' At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am one flesh and blood with her . If she is a plotter , so too am I. I bid your Grace farewell , and pray for so much pity as that you will never come this way again , nor see me , lest I die at your feet . ' ' Madam , do I owe you no apology ? ' ' I think none , your Grace . You acted as the woman you took me for might , I suppose , expect . Let me go . ' A singular thing happened here . The Duke , the haughtiest and coldest of men , bent his knee and carried her hand to his lips . So on Birthnights he kissed the late Queen 's hand , she standing before the Throne . Then stood very grave . ' Madam , I entreat your pardon . I have shown you a side of a man 's character very unfitting for your eyes and you but the child you arc . Forgive me and , ere we part for ever , answer me one question , in token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lowest of my clan ? could you have honoured me with any regard ? ' She stammered ? trembling before this melancholy gentleness . ' I know not . ' He persisted , gentle but firm : ? ' We have perhaps something to pardon each other . I ask again ? would this have been possible ? ' Constrained , she sought for breath . Because a cold handsome face softens , and because distrust is melted , shall a woman let her heart fly like a bird to a man 's bosom ? ' Sir , you ask more than I can answer . ' Still the eyes insisted , and now the strong hand held hers . ' Sir ? I think ? I believe ? it had not been impossible . ' ' What ? not James Hamilton ? no more ? ? with a shealing on the moors , and the heather-cock for food , and a Hamilton plaid to wrap his heart 's darling , and a fire of peats to sit by , and this hand empty but for love and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to his breast ? ' His voice was a strong music ? a river in spate . His eyes caught hers and held them . " T is not impossible . But oh , how should I prove it ? prove it ? There 's not a word I say but rings false now . Leave me ? leave me . I have said too much . ' ' You ca n't prove it ? But you can , and if you prove it , I will distrust God 's mercy before I will distrust my girl . All you have told me was known to me ? known to all the town . It rings through the streets that the fair Gunnings and their mother are schemers ; that they love none and seek only the best price for their charms . Marry me now , this hour , Elizabeth , and face the world that will call you plotter and adventuress . For they will so ! There ' s no club in town but will ring with the story of how the beauty was cunningly left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurry Walpole and all the old women of both sexes will have it ! All this will be known through your mother 's folly and your Abigail 's chatter , and they will tell how you trapped me , how I would have escaped and could not for the snares about my feet . Marry me and face this , if you will , and I will believe you love me , for you will stand a disgraced woman for all time . Marry me not , and I will make your way easy with gold , and your mother shall tell her own tale , and not a smirch on your name , and fear not but another rich to will give you all I could , and not a spot on it . Choose now once and for all . I have seen and I know how : my coronet will sting you with shame ? with shame set in it . ' He did not embrace her . ' T was the strangest wooing . The clock pointed to eleven . The house was dead silent . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . They will say you caught me drunk , whom you could not catch sober . They will say you forced the marriage , lest I escape . There is nothing they will not say but the truth ? that my sweetheart is the sweetest , the purest , the proudest woman alive . Your delicacy will be trod in the mud , Madam . Will you take your man at that ? Will you crawl through the dirt to his heart ? ' His fire kindled hers . Her eyes glittered . And if they believed use worthless ? that is not what I ask . What would your Grace think ? ' He smiled with peculiar sweetness . Child , you know . Look at me . ' And still she trembled . Beloved , adored ! ' he crier ! . ' Think you I knew not ' t was death to you to tell the truth ? Shall a man find a pearl in the dirt and not set it over his heart . I have loved you since first I saw your fair face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bless me ; and when these fools cackle and gibber , I shall know how to protect my wife . ' His arms went round her . I will do it , ' she said . The minutes passed in an exquisite joy , plucked out of shame like a rose from a torrent . He left her and went to the door , and leaning over the balustrade , called down the stair : ? ' Armitage ' A young man , handsomely dressed and something of a fop after his valetfashion , sprang up the stair , his Grace 's gentleman . His master , very tranquil and haughty , was by the door ? the fair Miss Gunning erect in her chair . Armitage , proceed at once to my house , and acquaint my chaplain , Mr MacDonald , that this lady and I arc to be married immediately . Desire him to come hither with all that is necessary , and lose not a moment . ' And seeing Armitage hesitate like a man wonderstruck , the duke stamped his foot and set him flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Desire Mrs Abigail to come up this moment . ' They heard the door shut violently , and Mrs Abigail came up , very demure and curtseying to the ground . ' Be seated , good woman . Your lady will excuse you . We wait the Reverend Mr MacDonald , with ring and licence , and you and Armitage shall serve for witnesses to the marriage , Now I think of it , call also the woman of the house . ' He carried it masterfully , and Eliza . beth , no more than any other woman , could be insensible to that charming tyranny . He stood behind her chair while the woman called for Mrs Mann ? who came , mortally afraid of her company . Shall Mrs Abigail braid my hair ? ? it tumbles all about me , ' says Elizabeth , questioning her master timidly . " T is so great a beauty I will not have it hid , ' he cries , standing behind her chair where the long locks lay on the ground . Silence again , and the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propelled somewhat before him up the stair , and into the room walks his Grace 's gentleman , and before him a stout personage in bands and cassock , so breathless from haste as to be incapable of any speech . Hath he the licence ? ' He hath , your Grace , but he declares that the occasion being so great , and the incumbent of Mayfair Chapel , Dr Keith , being at home and the chapel open , for the greater solemnity ' t were well to have the marriage solemnised there . ' T is but ten minutes , and I have brought the chariot , if it please your Grace . ' And now , puffing sore , the clergyman put in his plea , not for delay , ? the Duke 's face forbade that , ? but that all be done with ceremony . If a word more be said , I send for the Archbishop ! ' swears his Grace , flushed and handsome . ' My chariot ' s at the door . Bundle in all who can . Madam , al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his , and preceded them down the stair , holding it high as in a minuet . The women followed without a word . Elizabeth went in a dream , half enchantment , half nightmare . The chapel was dark and musty ? no time to light the lamps ; but Mr Armitage , the facile , the adroit , a perfect Mercury and old in experience , called m four linkmen waiting by their ladies ' empty chairs in the street outside . These grimy fellows stood upon the altar steps , two at a side , lighting the book the parson opened , his voice resounding through the silent place with startling loudness . Behind the bridal pair huddled the women . Dearly Beloved , we are met together ? ' and so to the close . But his voice was muffled beside the clear ring of James Hamilton 's . His ' I will ' fell like a sword on the air . He was never a man to show his heart but to the one in whose hand it lay , and his tone disdained all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his signet ring on her finger , and they turned from the altar man and wife . Give each of these men five guineas , and bid them light her Grace to her chariot , Armitage . Take you the woolen back to Mrs Gunning 's lodging , where we follow . I thank you , Mr Keith , for the best service man ever did me . It shall not go unrewarded . ' He handed her into the chariot with the utmost ceremony ; and when the door was closed , flung himself on his knees before her , clasping her waist . ' My dear ? my ' girl , how shall I thank you ? Think you I do n't know what it hath cost you ? and the proof you have given me that your heart is mine . My wife ? my sweetheart ! ' ' T was half after twelve when Mrs Gunning returned with Maria , being a prudent woman , and resolved that , if the criminal did not hang himself , it should not be for want of rope . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parlour ! ' she whispered ; sure , he ca n't be there still ? Heaven send he be not drunk and asleep . ' T was mere folly to leave the wine ! ' Not a sound . They approached as it were on tiptoe up the stair , and softly opened the door . My Lord Duke , attended by Armitage , stood before them , splendid in his dark red velvet laced with silver , the blue ribbon crossing his breast . He held Elizabeth by the hand , she pale as arises but perfectly composed . Mrs Gunning gave a fine dramatic start , Maria advancing behind her , devoured with curiosity . What ? what can this mean ? Little did I expect to find your Grace here at this hour . Elizabeth , I fear you have been vastly imprudent . Your good name ? ' She might have said more , but the Duke came forward , very magnificent . Madam , permit me to introduce a stranger , ' says he , with emphasis on the word , ' Her Grace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be ! ' cries Mrs Gunning , all radiant , and mistaking his meaning . ' 0 my sweet child , my Eliza beth ? how have you took me by surprise ! When shall it be , your Grace ? ' Madam , it is done . Miss Gunning became my bride in the Mayfair Chapel ? was it twenty minutes since , Armitage ? ' Fifteen , your Grace . ' " F was all in order ? a clergyman ? ? ' t was legal ? ' pants Mrs Gunning , her hand to her heart . ' Assuage your maternal fears , Madam . ' His lip was disdainful ; lie set her a world away . All was as you could have wished . Permit the Duchess and myself to wish you farewell and good night ? or rather good morning . ' He led Elizabeth to the door , which Armitage held open . It closed behind them , and their steps were heard descending . The Duchess had not said a word . There was silence until the chariot had rumbled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not credit her with such skill She bath played her cards well indeed . I would give the world to know what passed . ' That we shall never know , ' sacs Maria . ' He ' s not the man to tell his secrets , nor she neither . Sure , they ' re a pair . ' Well , Heaven send you show the like skill with my Lord Coventry . You ca n't do better . Lord , how my heart brats for joy ! ' ' I shall not need , Madam , ' says Miss Maria coolly . ' She has ensured my match with her own . The Duchess of Hamilton 's sister wo n't go begging for a husband . " I ' is now but to choose my wedding silk . Come , let us to bed . These late hours hurt my bloom . Let us however drink a toast in this wine to old Mother Corrigan and the Golden Vanity . ' T is the least we can do . Blow out the candles . '    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
