Stretched eastward from Manhattan in the shape of a candle-flame , lies Long Island . Here , in a country made for pleasure , live socially-minded persons who dart to their diversions along concealed and crooked trails , inserted through the woods or strewn upon the shore . Their houses , lying between hills or built above bright beaches , are walled with forests and reticent behind curling drives . Who builds them and makes them beautiful ? <P> There occurred in Manhattan last week a party which partially answered both questions . The party was given to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their partnership , by the firm of Delano and Aldrich , architects , to their clients . Since Delano and Aldrich are architects who have made the kind of houses which rich people like to live in , their clients came to the party gratefully and bearing gifts ; Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow sent by airplane from Mexico two silver bowls . <P> Other clients , who desired to make ambitious and tangible presents , were dissuaded by the architects who suggested a more practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson , poet and sister to the late Theodore Roosevelt , presented " a sum of money contributed by the guests at the party to the American Institute of Architects to establish a fund to enable French students of architecture to visit the United States to study the work done here , which will help to repay in a small way the generosity of the French Government to the many American students who have received their education , free of charge , at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris . " <P> Good architects , like good doctors , resent publicity . There is nothing pretentious about the firm of Delano and Aldrich . The building in which they work , designing perhaps 30 mansions every year , as well as office buildings , schools and churches , is an old stable neatly rebuilt into studios and little rooms . At its front are some of the little round windows which , erroneously enough , have come to be regarded as identification discs upon the works of Delano and Aldrich . <P> Actually , there is no way in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his style . Every patron has some notion of his own , every site is different . Yet Delano and Aldrich , now that they are to their branch of the profession what Cram and Ferguson or McKim , Mead and White are to theirs , are generally allowed a fairly free hand in their designs . They prefer to arrange , not the house alone , but the grounds and gardens which go with it . <P> William Adams Delano and Chester Holmes Aldrich have always been bracketed together . They went to the Beaux Arts together in Paris in 1896 ; both started to work with Carrere and Hastings ; their partnership has been free from squabbles and disagreements . <P> When the Prince of Wales came to Long Island he stayed at J. A. Burden 's house , which Delano and Aldrich built ; they were consultant architects when the roof of the White House needed fixing . The Colony Club in Manhattan is some of their work , as is the institution where girls prepare for membership , Miss Chapin 's School which has just opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , where good St. Bernard boys will go if they are lucky . Even Otto Kahn , when he decreed his stately pleasure dome at Cold Spring Harbor , L. I. , called upon Delano and Aldrich ; they built it for him .
