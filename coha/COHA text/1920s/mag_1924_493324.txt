SPECULATIONS consists of the notes and essays that were left by a young English philosopher , when he died in 1917 , the victim of a mechanism his philosophy compelled him to respect . In Mr. T. E. Hulme die forces that had produced Mr. Wyndham Lewis 's Blast , the forces that produced the Great Blast of 1914 , in which men became as rigid as Mr. Lewis 's forms or as dismembered as Senor Picasso 's bodies -- these forces , I say , made their way into modern philosophy , Forma/ism in ktithetics , absolutism in morals , and a dogmatic religion were the facade of Mr. Hulme 's philosophic edifice : the smell of the charnel-house clung to its walls . Whether one agree with Mr. Hulme as a pnilosopher , one must respect him as a prophet , for he anticipated certain changes in our spiritual atmosphere which have become much more perceptible during the last decade . In Speculations we have the fragments of a philosophy in the making ; but its outline and temper are plain ; and we perhaps see the animus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts themselves have not yet been put into conventional costumes . These essays have the untouched rudeness of a soliloquy : dry , hard , chunky , they have as little en recommend them from a literary standpoint as a demonstration in geometry . Mr. Hulme would not have regarded this as a defect : his esthetic position van perhaps best be stated by saying that the abstract quality of a mathematical theorem was exactly what he demanded of a work of art . But this is to anticipate . Half of Speculations is a polemic against humanism ; the remainder contains Mr. Hulme 's philosophy of literature , a , sympathetic exposition of Bergson 's aesthetic ; an excellent introduction to Sorel 's Reflexions on Violence , and a collection of aphorisms , called Cinders . The criticism of humanism is central to Mr. Hulme 's philosophy ; and for an alternative he is driven back onto a belief in a static world of fixed values . To arrive at these conceptions , he posits a complete discontinuity between the inorganic world of mathematical and physical science , the organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the world of ethical and religious values . In Mr. Hulme 's mind , the first and third worlds had the common characteristic of being " absolute , " and subject to absolute knowledge . The intermediate world of life was " a muddy mixed zone " of the concrete and the relative . In practice , the absolute in ethics , for example , is the existing body of convention and habit ; but with history net aside as all-too-human Mr. Hulme could afford to forget the evanescent and relative and quite local character of his absolutes . The humanist movement of the Renaissance was anathema to Mr. Hulme because it had broken up a set of fixed assurances and standards that had bound together a great part of Western Europe and Asia Minor since the collapse of the Roman dominion . Instead of the dogma of Original Sin , humanism had set up a belief in perfectability ; instead of clinging to the external concept of God , it tended to deify man ; in short , in every department of life and thought it supplanted formalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . hi Michelangelo and Leonardo and Marlowe , Mr. Hulme is prepared to acknowledge that humanism had a heroic and positive aspect ; but for the most part its gains seemed insecure , for the doctrine de-generated too readily into the sort of romanticism and sentimentality which Mr. having Babbitt associates with Rousseau . While many of as take the humanist scheme of values for granted , to Mr. Hu/me it was false and contemptible . Man is not a god he is a. sorry animal who needs the incessant discipline of formal standards . Progress does not exist ; for it impudently demands of human institutions a quality which the very nature of man denies . Art and philosophy must look upon living things only as materials for the absolute ; the abstract relation , says Mr. Hulme , is more important than the things that are related . Mr. Hulme was conscious of the fact that humanism and formalism seem to recur rhythmically in the life of a people ; for example , even in the formalist Middle Ages there was the so-called twelfth century Renaissance ; and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fetters under Louis XIV . Some personal quirk , however , made Mr. Hulme think that the difference between humanism and formalism was a difference between the false and the true : he was not sufficiently the philosopher to escape the temporal bias of his philowphy ! " Sloppy , " " muddy , " " messy , " " loose " ? these are some of the adjectives Mr. Hulme applies to life and to the humanist outlook on life . He transferred to humanity a sort of perpetual sense of the " morning-after " ; and one ca n't help reading into his philosophy an irrelevant disgust towards the drab streets and slatternly people of London , area through the smear of a fog . Into the august categories of abstract thought , Mr. Hulme poured the spiritual biography of his generation ; and the revelation is all the more complete because the philosopher was not conscious of the process . The futility , the disillusion , the sheer physical exhaustion of our age are recorded in Mr. Holmes Speculations . Given these disabilities , his reaction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anschaung in a period when men 's powers are waxing and seem strong enough to hold the upper hand over the environment Ab- solutism , on the other hand , is a convenient refuge for the mind when men are conscious , of their feebleness , when the environment seems all too formidable , when the boundaries of the world must be restricted before men have the courage to sally forth . Armor and movement , walls and open spaces , stability and adventure ? between these poles the life and thought of a community perpetually oscillate . The hardihood that sustained the navigators of the Renaissance penetrated the study ; men faced the infinite in thought , the untried M science , the inexpressible in poetry with a new confidence in their powers ; even in illness and hallucination they added to the tally of their triumphs : the Blokes and Nietzsches have a place alongside the Leonardos and Newtons . More truly than the classic thinkers , the men of the Renaissance could say that nothing human was foreign to them , for they had made the world their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that our humanist world has gotten out of hand has slowly been creeping over us . What looked like a triumphant conquest of Nature and Man 's Institutions has relapsed into a siege ; and meanwhile , the enemy has invented new terrors and difficulties . Reason is not as strong as we had thought in disciplining the personality , and natural benevolence not quite so copious : science and invention and machinery have not automatically removed the brutalities of toil : the elimination of past abuses is no guarantee against future ones : and the nations , instead of settling down to create their own heaven on earth , as Sir Thomas More had hoped and as the eighteenth century philosophers had planned , are only too apt , through blind imbecility , to raise hell on their neighbor 's portion . Baffled by these difficulties , it is only natural that men should lose confidence in the adventure , and withdraw to their cellars ; and for the moment , the cellar-philosophies are multiplying . The philosopher reduces this tumultuous , man-infected world to a neat grammatical " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russell creates a new scholaticism : the artist ceases to battle for a place in our mechanical civilization , and glorifies the mechanism that is eliminating him : the political observer turns away from the great array of social programs that were formulated from Morelly to Marx , and abandons political life to the rule of thumb or hems knuckles ; in literature , a hard , dry classicism gives to technique the satisfaction that used to come from thought and imagination . In short , we are obviously in for a period of spiritual shrinkage and encyst- meet ; and it was to Mr. Holmes credit that he jubilantly proclaimed the final stage of this process before most people realized it had begun . Against this inane acceptance of ebb-and-flow the humanist , however , is driven to protest ; for one of the reasons for being conscious of historic process is to he able to correct them without passively awaiting the turn of the tide . To relapse hastily into formalism is to acknowledge defeat before the battle has been fought ; and although the forces December 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , than they have been for three hundred years , they are not yet done for . In assthetics , in philosophy , in social life , formalism represents the path of least resistance : to praise machinery or to accept the Church 's solutions for our moral dilemmas is much easier than to put machinery in its place and to carve out a positive morality which shall bear some relation to the facts of natural history . But it does not become a philosopher to embrace the first program , and call it true or good ; that , indeed , is the shoddiest of rationalizations . If humanism loses out , that is , if it does not repair its own weaknesses and rally fresh minds to its standards , it will mean only that the generation which followed the war is tired ? even as Mr. Hulme was tired before the war broke out . These unfinished Speculations focus , I believe , the capital intellectual conflict of our time ; and for this they deserve an honorable place even in the consideration of dime who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets forth .
