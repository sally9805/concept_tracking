Wall Street magnates blew smoke rings from their fat cigars and looked wise . <P> Many rumors went on circuit . Sterling-ten cents off par-was to be brought to parity ; new methods of paying the British War debt were to be formed ; a modification of the debt agreement was sought ; the Governor was on a secret mission for the British Government . <P> Then up spoke Governor Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank : <P> " Governor Norman has authorized me to say in his behalf that his visit to New York is his customary trip , which he has made every year or two in the past in a similar way , for the purpose of conferring with the officers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which is the New York representative of the Bank of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> It seemed also that , as the Bank of England , affectionately called by Londoners the " Old Lady of Threadneedle Street , " is preparing to enlarge its quarters in " the City " , Governor Norman had come to the U.S. with his eyes and ears open for new ideas for improving the Old Lady 's efficiency .
