Textile mill strikes flared up last week like fire in broom straw across the face of the industrial South . Though their causes were not directly related , they were all symptomatic of larger stirrings in that rapidly developing region . Labor troubles first developed in Eastern Tennessee , were followed by strikes in South Carolina and later in North Carolina . <P> Tennessee . Last October Herbert Hoover went to Elizabethton to make a campaign speech . Proudly its citizens led him through the shiny new mills of the Bemberg and Glanztoff artificial silk companies . He was presented with a sample suit of underwear . Shrewd Germans had invested $10,000,000 in these mills to escape the U. S. tariff . But Germans are hard taskmasters . Mill operatives worked 56 hours per week ; their pay envelopes held from $8.90 to $14 ; overtime brought no extra money . Spurred on by the American Federation of Labor , the Elizabethton workers struck last month . The strike was settled , with the company promising pay adjustments , but 300 union members were discharged . <P> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. of L. and Alfred Hoffman for the United Textile Union went there last week to smooth out difficulties . Their missions were successfully completed when into McGrady 's room at the Lynwood Hotel ( where Mr. Hoover was feasted ) broke a masked mob at 2 a. m . McGrady was seized , placed in a taxi , threatened with death if he ever returned , deported to the Virginia-Tennesee line at Bristol . <P> Hoffman was similarly pounced upon in the hotel lobby , blindfolded , forcibly despatched to the North Carolina line . Five men , one a foreman at the Bemberg plant , were later arrested , held for trial . President William Green of the A. F. of L. protested the " outrage " to Tennessee 's Governor Henry Hollis Horton . <P> South Carolina . Operatives first walked out of the Brandon Mills at Greenville . Others at Spartanburg , Union and Anderson followed . Complaint was against the " stretch-out " system whereby workers were given increased work without proportionately more pay . A committee of the South Carolina Legislature , headed by Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Federation of Labor , investigated these strikes and reported : " The whole trouble has been brought about by putting more work on the employes than they can do . . . . In the ' stretch-out ' system it is the employe who does the stretching out . . . . The strike is in no sense a rebellion against improved textile machinery . " One weaver , for example , the committee found , had operated 24 looms for $18.91 a week . He was given 114 machines to tend and his pay raised to $23 a week . He struck .
