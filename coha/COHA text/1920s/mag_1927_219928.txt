Last week the Standard Oil Co. of Indiana , chesty child of a potent tribe , made a few announcements <P> 1 ) Its net earnings for 1926 were $62,500,000-$6.03 a share- 13.68% on the capital invested . <P> 2 ) It has changed its president . Dr. William M. Burton , who " cracked " petroleum so hard that it yielded twice as much gasoline , was granted his wish to retire , was succeeded by Edward G. Seubert , a onetime newsboy . Soon , no doubt , the success magazines will be asking Mr. Seubert for the story of his rise . It is an epitome of the great U. S. biography , a machinist 's helper at 15 , a bookkeeper whose accounts balanced , a chief clerk who plugged , a vice president - one of the faithful rewarded when he reached a healthy 50 . <P> 3 ) Robert H. McElroy and Edward J. Bullock , both of whom had served the Standard Oil long and faithfully , were lifted to the rank of vice president . <P> These announcements and most maneuvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of a burly lawyer-Colonel Robert Wright Stewart , chairman of the board of directors . He did not rise from the bottom . He broke in at the middle and puffed out the chest of the Indiana oilcan . Babbitts could not understand how he did it . He had played football at Coe College ( Iowa ) , plunged into the law at Yale , cavorted with Theodore Roosevelt 's Rough Riders , dabbled in politics in South Dakota . But he was and is a shrewd lawyer . The Standard Oil wanted him . Soon the general counsel was made chairman of the board ( 1918 ) . * He summoned lethargic directors to thrice-weekly meetings , made them agree unanimously on every decision . Under the Stewart impetus the company grew big with physical properties and profits . More than 15,000 employe stockholders shared the resulting pleasures . <P> Mr. Stewart 's biggest coup came in 1925 when he combined the Pan-American Petroleum Co . ( Edward L. Doheny 's mainspring ) and the British Mexican Co. with the Standard Oil Co. of Indiana . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest and least stoppable fullback in the oil field . <P> *A not unusual practice among great corporations within the last two decades .
