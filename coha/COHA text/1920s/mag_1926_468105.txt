OT long ago I called on a woman who is doing , as we women in ? business and professional life love to say , " a big piece of work . " Her importance , achieved in an incredibly short period , was attested by the location of her New York offices and by the crowded reception-room in which I was asked to sit down and wait . " Could you state what you wished to see Miss A. about ? " her secretary had asked in a rather toplofty manner . I could not , and this answer , strangely enough , seemed to give me precedence . I was conducted almost at once into Miss A. 's presence . She sat at her desk , facing the door , a youngish person , unostentatiously dressed in a white blouse and dark skirt . " Will you sit down ? " she invited , though invited is too strong a term to express her impersonal , detached tone . I took a chair near the door , feeling I should not obtrude myself farther than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. completed what must be , I thought , an urgent report . After pencilling a number of annotations on the sheets before her she tucked them away in a filing cabinet in the most deliberate manner and , seating herself at a typewriter , typed away for some ten minutes . Then she rang , told the messenger she would see Mr. So and So now , gave the man some instructions when he appeared , and dismissed him . I was immensely impressed . " Is it possible , " I thought to myself , " that we women in business are taking ourselves so seriously as all this ? " At last Miss A. glanced in my direction and , without the ghost of a smile , indicated she could give me her attention . I stated my purpose in calling . I wanted advice . I was thinking of making a change and entering the business field in which she herself was a pioneer , though I must confess that during my long chilling wait I regretted the impulse which had brought me to see her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my project , assuring me there was plenty of room for others besides herself , that the opportunities in the field were indeed almost limitless , and that there were particular reasons why it was one suited to women . She traced modestly her own beginnings , the discouragements she had met , the obstacles she had had to overcome , but insisted that the difficulties had been exaggerated and should prove no deterrent , even going so far as to offer to take me under her tutelage without charge . She was , it turned out , when it came to what she was doing , not only human but disposed to be thoroughly helpful . As we shook hands in parting Miss A. suggested I should see a Miss Brown , I may call her , who was also ( Miss A. 's words ) " doing a , big piece of work , " in a related if not identical line . She offered to give me a note of introduction or to telephone that I was coming , but I declined both courteous offers , feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to observe what Miss Brown 's " big piece of work " had done to her if I went unannounced . There was no anteroom , no opportunity to send in my card . At the end of a spacious , rather empty-looking office I saw a woman I judged to be Miss Brown , a forthright capable-appearing person , of what we used to designate as the school-maem type before the teaching profession came so largely into the hands of the pretty , girlish , smartly dressed young teachers of the present day . Miss Brown was explaining something in a thoroughgoing manner to a gentleman who was listening with meek attentiveness . Although it was about eleven in the morning and she gave no evidence of having just come in or being on the point of leaving , Miss Brown wore her hat . The fact of her wearing her hat in her office was , as I had learned years before , eloquent . I paused inside the office door , waiting till it was convenient for Miss Brown to come forward or send the girl sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Brown was aware of my presence . She kept snapping her eyes in my direction as she went on with her discussion . The girl at the typewriter lifted her eyebrows in my direction once , with a vague inquiry in her otherwise expressionless face , then resumed her pounding . I advanced cautiously , trying to make it apparent I did not wish to interrupt . " I 'll wait , " I had started to say to the girl at the typewriter in a low voice , " till Miss Brown --  --  " But Miss Brown had sprung from her chair and with a movement of shaking her flounces , though she had none to shake , challenged me , " What is it you want ? " " Well , not , " I answered , suppressing a smile , " to sell you insurance ? or anything else ! " Miss Brown stared at me for an instant , then taking a step forward , reiterated , " Well , just what is it you want ? " My reason for corning to see her proving not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar , the girl at the typewriter . " Well , I can'tpossibly sec you to-day , " she said finally . " I have an important conference at two o'clock , another at four . And to-morrow ? " There were other important conferences on the morrow . " But day after , promptly at three , I might give you a few minutes . " Next morning , however , her secretary called me up to say that it would be inconvenient , after all , for Miss Brown to see me at the time appointed . " Miss Brown would prefer next week . " I failed to avail myself of this opportunity to see Miss Brown again , but I must say I blessed her memory . I shuddered to think how often I must have prated of " important conferences , " and sought to give the impression that my time was more valuable than Judge Gary 's . II The habit of taking ourselves too seriously grows , no doubt , out of taking our jobs too seriously . What every woman in a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say four thousand a year , she must make the showing of a man drawing ten . In our nervous anxiety to succeed , straining every faculty to the uttermost , we overlook the part our lighter , the more purely feminine side of our nature might play . Women in business are constantly surprised , not to say shocked , to find how much time men " waste , " how much frivolous interchange goes on among them . If business men work hard , in spurts , they play not only at lunch time and on the links , but all through the day apply to their toil the lubricant of agreeable intercourse with one another . Ina word , they have made of their business life , if not actually an exciting , at least a pleasurable affair instead of a sad necessity . Gossip and jokes enliven their most important councils and a raconteur among them possesses a valuable business asset . Yet we women in business are afraid to take time to be gracious , almost afraid even to smile . I do not refer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 297 to the vast number of girls and women who are in business only for a season , till they marry or the family situation improves , but to that smaller , though ever-increasing , proportion who , either through necessity or choice , expect to make business a career . It is those who work so feverishly . The business world may conceivably grow to be a far more beautiful and joyous place than it is to-day . Yet they add neither beauty nor joy . They rattle the dry bones . They increase what is already , with all men 's efforts to freshen it , the too great aridity of the business atmosphere . Nor is business alone damaged thereby . A. business woman , herself a shining example of success in whatever she undertakes , remarked one day : " I wonder if we women in business are not overreaching the mark and failing , where we fail , not because we are unintelligent or untrained , but because we are too much in earnest , too conscientious , and above all , too hardworked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pungently , " is excess of virtue . Those who strike the happy medium are really the most successful . When we women play more , we shall create more . " Another business acquaintance comes to my mind whom I met first soon after her graduation from one of our leading women 's colleges and entrance into her first position . Brilliantly endowed , she was a lovely creature at that time , wore simple but becoming clothes , was sparkling , responsive , generally charming . I heard of her from time to time and after some years met her again . She was dowdy , ill-groomed , tense in her manner , and self-centered to the last degree . She still gave evidence of what is termed a " steel-trap mind , " talked fluently and ably about her work and the problems involved , but was interested in nothing else in the world and had lost every vestige of her former attractiveness . A masculine associate in the business house where she started her business career , in discussing the change , said to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl of rare promise . But we saw it coming a long while ago . Her gayety and enthusiasm grew to be sharpness , then hardness , and now it is ? well , I might say , hysteria . And the sad part is , she seems to think this furious attention she gives things , the high-speed , ruthless manner she has developed , are aids to business success . " As a matter of fact , " be went on to say , " I happen to know she was asked to resign from one position and shut out from another for which her name had been considered , solely because in her ardor to make good she has developed a personality few care to encounter . " III In taldng our jobs so solemnly , we have , of course , little time to indulge in sports or social diversions of any kind . Largely unawakened , as a class , to the fact that it is the quality rather than the quantity of service we render that counts in business , in order to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis go by the board and only the most audacious among us dare go in for golf . I played golf myself for years before I entered business , but have never touched my mid-iron or brassy since . We seem to think that we can keep physically fit by no more exercise than the daily gentle whirl in our office chair or a little marching about indoors from floor to floor . At most we allow ourselves the tame diversion of driving back and forth to business , when walking might furnish a certain exhilaration to our sedentary day . We bring to business exuberant health and spirits , and more often than not in a few years grow seedy , stodgy , or obese , haggard and with frayed nerves , as the case may be . Being constituted as we are , we business women need to give our health even more intelligent attention than business men do theirs . Not that they , with the dietary crimes they daily commit , their high blood pressure and chronic sleeplessness just when they reach the big job , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as women , is to trifle even more flagrantly with the mechanism that keeps us going . I mentioned one day to the president of a big business that a fine young woman in his employ had recently been committed to a state institution for observation . " Miss R. is the third , " I said ? not accusingly , but as a matter of interest ? " that 's been committed within a short time , all of them ten to twelve years in your employ . Did you know that ? " " What is the diagnosis in these cases ? " he quizzed , after a pause . " Overwork , I believe . " " Nonsense ! " he said . " Nonsense ! Mighty few people , in this company , anyway , work too hard . But a lot of them do n't have enough fun . That 's the trouble . There is n't enough fun in business itself except in a very few jobs , like your own , " he laughed , " to furnish the requirements of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done . The only solution I see is to fill up on fun of some sort outside . And if you knew the inwardness of these cases you speak of , " he went on , " you 'd find they 're simply cases of starved lives . It 's not what people do in business that hurts them . It 's what they do n't do outside . It 's the reason , " he ended , " I 'm in favor of decreasing working hours as rapidly as is feasible . Most people have got to find satisfaction for their human cravings outside of business , and they need time to do so . " The president was right , I found out later , at least in regard to two of the cases in question . These young women , when the prospect of marriage had receded , had narrowed themselves zealously to their narrow routine jobs , in the hope , no doubt , of finding there a compensatory interest . Not only had they had no social life to speak of , even less had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction or poetry , cultivate an appreciation of nature or the arts . In a word , they had drunk scarcely a drop from any of the great wells available for human refreshment during years and years of pouring over columns of figures and of filling customers ' orders , But columns of figures and customers ' orders will not , it appears , yield all that the mind and body of women in business ( being yet women ) need to keep them healthy . Business houses abound in nice girls past their first youth who are growing a trifle " queer " as the result of a too steady and unmixed business diet . It is so easy , I admit , to sink into a rut , to consider we have time for selfcultivation only along the lines of business , and as tired business women to develop even more childish and barren taste in what entertains us in our hours of relaxation than has the tired business man . Let anyone who challenges the truth of this last statement secure the yearly program of almost any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sprung up all over the country . The American business man has long held the world 's record of being , to people of esprit , the dullest of dull companions . Observe him on one of the present popular Mediterranean tours , where he is conveyed , without having to exercise his higher cerebral centres , from the Casino at Monte Carlo to the Parthenon , from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to the Great Pyramid of Gizeh . Observe , and with compassion rather than gibes , how he seeks , and is sought by only his own ; how he is happy and at home with himself only when he resumes his endless discussion of prices and production costs , or what he believes may affect one or the other . It was when waiting together at Port Said to cross the Canal that I asked one of these captains of American industry how he liked Athens . " Athens . Athens . Oh , yes , I got SEVEN DEADLY SINS OF WOMAN IN BUSINESS 299 the best shoeshine there I 've had on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note he now has a rival . We women in business propose to become even more dull , more thoroughly confined , if possible , to one subject of conversation . Why , however , should we not leave him his precedence in at least this one province ? The more so , that we may again be on the wrong track . Very recently a woman in New York was elevated to one of the highest positions any woman in business has yet attained . It is , I think , of real significance that interviewers who seek her in her office find , and apparently are surprised to find , a vase of pansies on her desk and a Martha Washington sewingtable in one corner . The fact that she has not permitted that side of her nature which flowers in pansies and sewingtables to wither and die has helped her , I do not doubt in the least , to her present high post . She has been , according to all accounts , a very busy business person since she entered business fresh from High School more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her way to becoming president of a great corporation to read , to ride , to shoot . She has even taken time for the humanly enriching adventure of matrimony . In striking contrast to this picture , a slim dark-eyed woman , no longer young , of distinguished bearing , and with every evidence of an exceptionally intense nature comes up before me . For convenience I shall speak of her as Miss Black . She entered the huge business organization where she still works till late every night and on Sundays as well at a time when the presence of women in a business organization , except in routine jobs , was far more keenly resented than it is to-day . Being perceptive in some directions beyond the common , she soon perceived that any open move onher part to secure control of the important department of the business with which she was connected would be defeated . She developed cunning subterranean methods of securing her ends , became in time a master-strategist . She was not primarily concerned with outwitting men , not especially antagonistic to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , was never overweeningly ambitious for recognition and reward . But she craved contact with the most intimate affairs of the business . All the tremendous store of emotion she had to bestow , diverted from other possible objects , she bestowed on it . She loved the business for itself , everything about it , from bottom to top ? all its dustiest details . She invested it with the charm with which she might have invested a lover , guarded its interests with the fierce devotion she might have given a husband and children . To-day , after thirty-five years of this , business has entered into her very bones and tissue . She eats and drinks , wakes and dreams business . Meddling in every business department , she magnifies trifling business errors into monstrous proportions . She never consents to take a holiday , unless of the briefest , and when she hears of an associate running off to Europe or elsewhere for rest and recreation , it is certain to draw from her some such ironic comment as , " How nice ! I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does take a few days off and goes to some city , she can not enjoy the theater , opera , or even shopping , for rushing back to her hotel to see whether " long distance " wants her . Poor woman , she is as restless and unhappy , in fact , on these occasional jaunts as a mother who has left a small child at home and fears it may tumble into the fire or swallow a fishbone . She feels she never for an instant can take her fingers off the pulse of the organization , and when confined to her home from frequent illness , notwithstanding her doctor 's orders , constantly dictates to a girl at her bedside , only stopping to talk over the telephone to this executive or the other . Miss Black has given herself unstintingly to business through a lifetime , given her youth and maturity . In return ? Well , she has seen man after man pass her , often attain his rank through her coaching , while she is subsequently expected to report to him , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business but drawing thrice her pay . She has always been too proud to fight ? as men frequently have to ? for a proper stipend , but has brooded without doubt over the fact that one has never been proffered her . She is an embittered joyless woman , whose barbed tongue scourges associates , paralyzes subordinates , and diminishes or even destroys their usefulness to her . Yet possessing more than ordinary attractions of mind and person , with a generous and ardent nature and superior breeding , Miss Black held every possibility within herself of a. rich rounded life , to say nothing of an openly recognized , highly remunerated position in the great organization she has served . We have long been familiar with the effects when men have deified business . It is only lately , through figures that arrest our attention here and there in the business field , we have had opportunity to study what happens when we women prostrate ourselves before the same jealous god and allow devotion to become obsession ? a sin , I maintain , even at the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that differs at least by degree until it takes on the guise of a separate and signal vice . V Granted Miss Black is an exceptional case ? we are more familiar with this figure in the making than as a finished product , verging on the pathologic ? there is , on the other hand , nothing at all unusual in the spectacle of women in business sharply antagonistic ? assharply as they dare be ? to their men associates . Every business woman , doubtless every business man , recognizes the type . These are usually , like Miss Black , women of superior ability , and perhaps have played brave parts in the feminist movement . It is for the honor of the sex , rather than as an individual matter , they feel it incumbent upon them to demonstrate at every turn that the feminine brain per se is in no wise inferior to the masculine . There is something gallant in this attitude , and I should be the last to charge it against them except that their gallantry stops too often with their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had frequent contact . She was one of those " fierce athletic girls " Walt Whitman predicted for the republic , superb physique , vitality , and what I may call a lordly air and even stride . No staying overhours for her Miss Barnard dispatched her business responsibilities with lightning rapidity , had plenty of leisure for horseback riding , tramps , music ? whatever she chose . In addition , she was a first-rate administrator , respected and liked by a large corps of girl assistants because of the patience and justice she exhibited in her relation to them as supervisor . With the men she dealt with daily it was altogether different . Miss Barnard once confessed to me that the greatest surprise of her life was in finding so many muddle-headed men in business . She had supposed , before she entered it , that every man who attained any business prominence whatever was mentally keen , as she expressed it . She had once looked with awe on every one of the masculine figures imposingly arrayed at the speaker 's table at a Chamber of Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " raises my gorge like seeing these little men in business give themselves such big airs ? and purely on the ground of their sex , their historic position as males . " Miss Barnard delighted , in SEVEN DEADLY SINS OF WOMAN IN BUSINESS 301 fact , as I more than once witnessed , in taking them down . But she paid a high price for this delight . She had made the mistake of letting the little men , as well as larger men , know how she felt , and she had failed to take masculine solidarity into account . It was impossible to get Miss Barnard 's salary raised beyond a certain point , or to secure her promotion to one of several higher posts that yawned for a person of just her capacity . The men in a position to determine these matters , while freely acknowledging her competence , without exception heartily disliked her . " She 's too smart , that 's what 's the matter with Miss Barnard ! " one executive said of her scornfully . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged Miss Barnard in this executive 's estimation . It was her wellknown habit of showing up some man in the organization as a dolt on a business problem she herself could grasp with ease . That there was another side to Miss Barnard was proved when one day , to the surprise of everybody , her engagement was announced to a business associate , a man of character , and like herself , able , but a man she had by chance been thrown with socially , giving him opportunity to discover engaging qualities she had never thought it worth while to add to her business equipment . Above every other , an instance stands out to me of a woman even more highly endowed than Miss Barnard , a woman of superlative mind , with broad outside interests added to a positive genius for business . I do not cite this woman as a case of failure . She would lead a full life if she never saw the inside of a business house again . Her relationships with both men and women outside of business are ideal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has prevented her From reaching as high a station in the business world as any woman has yet sttained , is the technic she employs in her business relationships ? relationships with masculine associates , to be explicit . True , her technic is tied up with her honesty , with some of her sturdiest attributes . She has been unwilling to practice in business those arts which no woman who aspired to social leadership would dream of disdaining . She has failed to establish a camaraderie with her masculine associates , at once gay , dignified , impersonal , and perfectly possible for her , had she agreed to its importance . The man who sits beside us at dinner may be a frightful bore , but quite apart from any humanitarian impulse , the last thing our social training permits us to do is to give him a hint that we are aware of his dullness . On the contrary , we exert ourselves very particularly , help him score wherever he can . Why do we feel that the fine art of making people happy about themselves is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not overlook much longer the number of women with social background ? I can count a. dozen in New York City alone , without stopping to think ? who have gone into business , and as a result , not of " pull , " but of actual performance , have quickly outdistanced business sisters who could , as they say , run rings around them in business knowledge . The thing we women in business are prone to do is to look on our male associates as rivals , instead of as partners . Let me be plain . I do not charge this iniquity to others more than to myself . I know very well I should come up and take my place on the mourners ' bench . We should , no doubt , be judged rather leniently on this score . Most of us have had a fairly hard time of it to gain any recognition at all . We are still unable to dissemble our satisfaction in business triumphs , however small . But what we 're apt to forget is , that it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who gets anywhere in business ; that lie is faced with many , if not all the obstacles that impede our own progress ; has as much , nay more , at stake than we have . Leaving out of consideration family responsibilities , which nevertheless , broadly speaking , are heavier than our own , failure to succeed in business spells ignominy to him . To us , as yet , it spells nothing of the sort . There are , to he sure , often those airs of his , those airs which Miss Barnard found so insufferable . But are we , after all , patient enough with the men ? Consider their predicament ! When we women invaded business we invaded one of their last strongholds . Heaven knows we were not invited , except to do monotonous routine work they wished to escape themselves . We came of our own volition . And the average business man is still smarting under our all-too conspicuous presence in a house he thought he had built for himself . We must give him time . More than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its higher reaches ? is no place for women . More than one doubtless shares the feeling which an executive expressed in referring to the rapidly increasing number of women who are succeeding in business positions formerly regarded as incapable of being administered except through masculine wisdom . " When it comes to taking orders from a woman , I 'd as soon , " he said , laughing , but in all earnestness , " take orders from a Chinaman or a negro . " It behooves us to be indulgent ! VI It was this same frank and merry executive who reminded me that women in business talk too much not gossip , far from it . If American business men talk only of business when they leave it , during business hours , ironically enough , they arc willing and eager to listen to a little sprightly chatter on almost any subject under the sun , provided it has nothing to do with business . They have , in short , as I have previously hinted , developed a social art of sorts under the business rooftree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one ofthose lengthy disquisitions we women sometimes seek to deliver , in order to impress them with our seriousness of purpose or our acquaintance with the field we represent . A sage bit of counsel given me when I entered business by a woman wise in the ways of the business world was , " Be brief ! Boil down every business matter you have to present to the fewest possible words . " " They wear you out , telling you things you do n't need to know , " the goodnatured executive referred to insisted now , still laughing . " There 's Miss G. in the Purchasing Department , an excellent woman , I admit , but ? " He held up his hands . " I flee her like the plague ! " " But business abounds , " I countered , " in long-winded men . " " Oh , yes ! But do n't forget , " he warned , " that your sex is still on sufferance in business . You ca n't afford to imitate quite all our vices . " VII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfortunate as is our drift when we regard ourselves as men 's rivals and competitors , the deadliest of all our sins is imitation of man . Time was , only a few years ago , when a woman proposing to make business or any of the serious professions her career thought she must don masculine attire . Few went the lengths of Dr. Mary Walker , but many adopted severely cut suits , masculine collars and cravats , cultivated a brusque address , and even adopted stentorian tones . It is almost as hard now to find one of these nearmen among our thousands upon thousands of business and professional women as to find the proverbial needle in the haystack . When we do come upon one , chances are we discover a rather wistful example of thwarted ambition . We have learned at least one lesson : that imitation of man , when it comes to our clothes and our manners , does not necessarily lead to business and profesSEVEN DEADLY SINS OF WOMAN IN BUSINESS 303 sional triumphs , and may as likely as not defeat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciously or through deliberate selfinterest , to absorb and imitate the business man 's point of view , though it seems , sadly enough , that we play the sedulous ape more often to his weaknesses or his hardnesses , his prejudices and his limitations , than to his virtues . I have rarely heard any business man so blunt as a woman executive who recently remarked that she had no time to listen to employees ' grievances and had delegated a subordinate to hear all the " sob stuff . " I was especially distressed in this instance because , so it happened , I had been instrumental in securing her job for her . I had recommended her to her present " boss , " under the impression that she would put more humanity into a group of factories where the handling of workers had been along the old bullying , but no longer so successful lines . What she did was promptly to fall into the worst defects she found in her new environment . Though her higher education should have made her proof against such hysteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " Bolshevism . " This must have been foreign to her nature . Surely it was a betrayal of her scholarly training . It takes no mean courage , I may add , to express in the business world one 's feminine faith . It is hard to admit having ideals in a realm where ideals are looked on so frequently with suspicion . I remember that in so trifling a matter as taking in hand a bleak office-building lunchroom that looked as if it belonged to a penal institution , introducing fernboxes and cretonnes , I was jeered from more than one quarter . " What 's this , the Ritz , you 're giving us ? " These women jobs arc , all the same , 3urs to do , I believe . It was his woman secretary , I have understood , who introlueed tea into the office of the hardDressed president of one of New York'sgreat banking houses . I suspect she was twitted , that it was dubbed " British side " when she imported this admirable custom for use in an American business house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his associates needed ? a breathing space by way of the tea-caddy just before the final conference each afternoon . A highly temperamental business executive , who is regarded as the foremost man in his line in this country , said of his secretary , a winsome young woman , " I 've had more accurate secretaries , in the matter of shorthand , but upon my word , I wish I could pay Miss W. ten thousand a year ! She 's worth it . It 's the atmosphere she creates around her . I do n't hesitate to say she increases my output . " But so few women seem to see that it 's the woman in them , above everything else , that business needs ? needs , frankly , more than in mere matters of tea , cretonne , and flowers on the desk . More than one woman close to a big executive and enjoying his respect has abrogated her ancient right to warn as well as comfort . The motto that so long fed our complacency ? " All 's right with the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty that all 's not right with the business world . But it is equally certain that all 's not wrong . The amazing thing is , that it 's no more wrong than it is . Both sexes are highly involved , directly and indirectly , yet the point of view of only one sex has entered thus far , to any appreciable extent , into the conduct of business . Is it too unreasonable to hold that neither society at large nor the business world itself will profit greatly by our entrance into it , until we women , no longer content solely as understudies , shall offer , at whatever hazard , our own contribution ? all we have gained through our special inheritance and experience ? until we seek to supplement , rather than duplicate the parts in business that men play ?
