THERE are many differences between the betting ring of a race track and the counting house of an industrial plant . The differences , however , are largely in utility , purpose , tone , and entertainment . But if we look at them as business propositions and apart from their social uses , we notice that the differences are largely accidental . Both are gambling institutions . Of course the factory is much more of a gambling instrument than the race course . At the book-maker 's desk the public gambles against the proprietor . In the marketplace it is the proprietor who gambles against the public . At the race course the customers always lose ; the bookmakers , who are nothing more than bet merchants , business men of a very hard-boiled variety , always win . With them the element of chance is almost entirely eliminated . They operate on a cunningly devised calculation which guarantees that their patrons in the mass shall lose . In trade the proprietor is at the mercy of innumerable capricious circumstances outside of his control which may bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner in which they break across his path . i In other words , the business man , in addition to a good mind , a stout heart , a far-seeing eye , a patient and enduring will , and a sense of thrift , must also " get the breaks . " Bad luck can ruin him or at least hold him back ; good luck can make him , or at least speed him on his way . Now on this point you can get all sorts of opinions from business men . In- ; ; deed , most business men , I have discovered , have two sets of opinions on the matter . One is for private , the other for public use ? for consumption in plant bulletins , trade-journal interviews , Rotary Club orations , and inspirational school deliverances . This latter brand of philosophy deals in such uplifting phrases as " Pluck makes luck , " " The wise man is a maker of opportunities , " " Every man is the architect of his own fortune . " Many a man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cherished lucky piece hanging upon his vest . I once heard Mr. Charles Schwab , in one of those fluent , good-natured speeches for which he is famous , decry the existence of either genius or luck in business and assure his hearers that success is due to " hard , honest toil " and to nothing else . Yet I have been told that Mr. Schwab makes it a policy to deal only with successful men ; and he himself , able organizer and salesman that he is , has been somewhat favored by good luck . It is said he owed his first contact with Andrew Carnegie to a fortunate chance . Young Schwab as a boy had a sweet singing voice . One evening its notes drifted from the stables where he worked to the veranda where sat the great Scotch steel-master . Carnegie liked the voice and the song , and had the singer brought over to the great house so that he might enjoy the music at close range . Will anyone claim that that was not a lucky day for Schwab ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way to interview many business men of large achievement about their careers . On the basis of this experience I have ventured to come to two or three conclusions . One is that most men who have captured the big prizes would have got along after a fashion under any circumstances . Another is that the attainment of very large and conspicuous success in business is pretty much the result of one 's choice of a career : fortune gets in her best licks at the very threshold . Still another is that while luck plays an important part , and while all men arc at all times subject to the influence of chance , neither good luck nor bad luck can be counted on as a personal attribute . II I once worked beside an old newspaper man who felt he had been cheated by chance out of his fortune . As a boy of twelve , he and a friend , looking for work , fell upon two jobs ? one in a newspaper city room , the other in a broker 's office . The boys tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fateful nickel sent him to the newspaper office , his chum to the broker 's . He became a very good newspaper man . His chum rose to partnership in the brokerage house and to riches . Out of this episode the old reporter had evolved a theory on which he liked to discourse on Saturday night under the stimulus , I have no doubt , of his ill-furnished pay envelope . I have listened to him into the still watches of Sunday morning as we sat in the quiet of the city room , waiting for the first papers to come from the press . " It 's all in the start , " he would say . And then he would enlarge upon his two classic examples , John Jacob Astor and Charles Goodyear . " Look at Astor . He set out from Holland with just a few guilders in his pocket . When he reached New York he went straight into the one business in which a penniless man might amass a fortune with the greatest speed and certainty . He might have become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which case even he would have achieved , it is not to be doubted , such modest success as was open to a man inthose callings at the time . But he went instead into the fur trade -- -and this was in consequence of a pure accident . The ship which brought him over was held in the ice two months just outside of New York . In those two months young Astor made the acquaintance of a fellow passenger who told him of the opportunities of the fur trade , explaining that a poor man in exchange for toys and baubles might get countless skins which he could sell in London for fabulous sums . The delay of Astor 's boat put him in the way of a fortune of over two million dollars , which in those days he could hardly have made in any other way . " And look at Goodyear . He was a bankrupt . That ostensible misfortune set him wandering about one day until his gaze fell by chance upon a display of India rubber in a show window . The crude commodity took hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into conversation with a man from Roxbury in the rubber trade , who explained to Goodyear how that industry was on the edge of disaster because no means had been found to preserve the rubber for use . Goodyear thought he saw an escape from his financial ills if he could discover the secret of treating rubber . But the business entanglements distracted him until a third chance gave him the leisure to work at the problem . And this had all the appearance of mischance ? he was arrested for debt , and for several years was forced to live in the neighborhood of jail , frequently within it . Thus under the shadows of the jail and in its enforced idleness Goodyear found time to perfect his process and establish the foundations of the Goodyear fortune . There was so much of the fortuitous in these events that Goodyear himself always believed he was called by divine Providence to commercialize rubber . " There are some kinds of business in which men can make great fortunes . There are others in which those same men , however talented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance which usually determines along which line a man will travel . " All this was brewed from the bitter dregs in the career of a disappointed old man . But much wandering among the great and the near-great of business has convinced me that it is true . Let anyone examine minutely his own career and see by what a small chance he was directed upon his present course and by what a small margin he missed another ? the little want " ad " that set him forever in a bank , the chance recommendation that opened for him the door to the classroom as a teacher , the overheard conversation that pointed the way for him into a railroad office under the very eye of the President . One of the great lumbermen of the country ? Mr. Thomas B. Walker ? tells how he was sitting one afternoon in the lobby of a little country hotel waiting for a letter from the University of Wisconsin which he hoped would bring him a teaching position there . The letter came , but before it did Walker had flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotel expecting his letter , he dropped casually into conversation with a man from Minneapolis who painted in golden colors the opportunities of that city . Almost at that very moment a whistle announced a Mississippi River steamboat " comin ' round the bend " bound for Minneapolis . It was the hour of fate for Walker . Opportunity , which usually knocks upon the door , this time blew a blast on a steamboat siren . Walker flipped a coin to settle whether he should wait for the letter or take the steamboat . The coin decided for the steamboat , and the would-be pedagogue went to Minneapolis and into the lumber business , in which he made a fortune . It would be difficult to call up a more impressive example of the interference of chance at the very outset of a career than the case of James J. Hill , the picturesque builder of the Great Northern railroad . When Hill was a boy , his imagination was inflamed by tales of the Orient and its shipping . So at eighteenhe started for the Atlantic seaboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a place in any crew . It is interesting to note how many small chances altered his course as he moved from town to town , and how at last , as the result of almost aimless wandering , he found himself in a small Virginia town . There he suddenly remembered that the town was the former home of an old classmate whose family had moved to the Pacific coast , and who had urgently invited Hill to visit him . Thereupon Hill made a decision . Though within sight of the Atlantic , he turned his face toward the Pacific , hoping that perhaps his old friend 's father might find him a place on some vessel . He trusted to chalice for his route , and that chance led him by innumerable hitches to St. Paul where , he had learned on the way , he might join a brigade of trappers and traders and thus cross the Rockies . But the winter beat him to St. Paul . When he reached that small Minnesota village the last brigade of adventurers had gone . He dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dreadful Northwest winter came down and held him a prisoner in St. Paul until the spring should release him . But that spring never came . The series of chances which had led him to St. Paul was destined to hold him there . It was at St. Paul that he found the opportunity , first to enter railroading , and then to envision and build the great road which opened and developed half a continent . It is not to be supposed from cases such as these that good luck can achieve success all by itself . It must get hearty and valiant co-operation from its favorite . Whatever the verdict may be on the morals of Doheny 's system of devouring government oil reserves , the fact remains that he is one of America 's wealthiest men and , judged by that standard , one of her most successful business leaders . He was sitting years ago in front of a little hotel in Los Angeles . He was broke and calmly meditating his next move . At that moment a wagon loaded with pitch and driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dirt commanded Doheny 's eye . He hailed the driver and learned that it came from Westlake Park . Doheny trolleyed out to the park without further ado and , scratching in the excavation whence the pitch came , found the earth dark and apparently saturated with oil . He had no money , but he hunted up an old partner and the two got options on the land , raised a few dollars and set to drilling . The oil gushed forth in response . In a few hours Doheny would have left Los Angeles had not that wagon crossed his vision . And yet that wagon had passed a thousand persons , broadcasting its bargain . It was a call of fate to them all ? but only Doheny 's ear heard the call . William C. Durant , the audacious maker of automobiles and bull markets , as a very young man strolling a little aimlessly along a country road got a lift in a two-wheeled road cart . As he rode along his eye was fascinated by the graceful lines and sturdy construction of that cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was his curiosity and interest at work . The maker 's mill was at Coldwater , Michigan . There was something about wagons that had always captivated Durant , and he thereupon made up his mind to go to Coldwater to connect with that factory . So far we have a chance meeting on a roadside and Durant 's curiosity and decisiveness conspiring toward a result . When the young industrial adventurer got to Coldwater he found the factory for sale and , though he had no funds , he bought it . He had to seek a partner with cash . He found one in a chap named Dort ? later to achieve fame as a motor maker . These two men quickly enough built up one of the great wagon manufacturing firms of the country and very naturally , when the wagon 's days were numbered , drifted into the automobile field . I have heard two celebrated bankers tell how luck gave them their chance in their early years . Henry P. Davisonused to tell how he was " shot " into promotion . He got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman presented a check for many thousands " payable to Almighty God " and duly endorsed by the divine payee . Davison looked up and saw a revolver presented at his chest and a solemn madman demanding payment of the check . Bank tellers seldom have dramatic moments . But Davison had his . He scrutinized the check critically , then read it aloud ? very loud , ostensibly to see that it was all right , but in reality to attract the attention of his neighboring tellers . The ruse worked . The man in the next cage summoned the bank officer , who seized the lunatic and saved the bank some of its money and Davison all of his life . He was immediately promoted to assistant cashier and three years later was president of that hank . The late A. Barton Hepburn , the banker , always insisted he was lucky and that his first opportunity came from a pure chance . This opportunity turned up during his service in the legislature . At the time Jolla F. Smythe , chairman of the state Republican committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no end of trouble to favor Hepburn . There was no apparent reason for these benefactions and it was not until years later he learned Smythe 's motive . The Albany boss in his youth had been befriended by an old Scottish nobleman , Sir Andrew Hepburn , and Smythe throughout his life took a sentimental satisfaction in repaying upon anyone named Hepburn his debt to the old baronet . III To all this the inspirational lecturer replies that these men did no more than grasp the opportunities flung in their way ; that such opportunities come to all ; that had not these opportunities appeared there would have been others ; and that the thing which counts in the end , therefore , is not the opportunities , which are universal , but the wise and ready use of them , which is a matter of individual excellence . I am content to let this view stand . Still , we are permitted to conclude that the character of our success will depend on the kind of opportunity we seize . We have one set of choices to-day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate and mediocre success and the other , with no more expenditure of intelligence and industry , to vast riches . A very enterprising and ambitious spirit filled with belief in that ancient error that opportunity knocks but once is apt to open upon the first knock and follow the first summons . The opportunity which knocks to-day may lead a man into the oil business , the automobile industry , or perhaps to the department store , all blessed by favoring winds . The opportunity of to-morrow may lead the same man into the textile industry or the leather business or some other such calling , harassed with problems and forever threatening disaster . Whether a man becomes a first-rate captain or plutocratic empire builder , a college professor or a lumber baron will be governed by the manner in which all the numberless circumstances of life and time are marshalled at some given moment when he is ripe for a decision . Having set out in one direction , he can never be sure at what corner he may be induced to make a turning . Judge Gary might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chicago bar but for the chance which brought him into court one day in a - Minor case against a man named John W. Gates . Gates never forgot the highly professional drubbing he received it the hands of that young lawyer , and when he was ready to put together his ) arhed-wired trust he hired Gary to ) ilot him through the pitfalls of the law . Chat set Gary into the way of forming ater the Federal Iron Co. and ultimately he United States Steel Corporation . Consider again the case of ' Henry ) avison , already noted . Certainly no ian would select the teller 's cage as thescene for a heroic exploit . Davison hoped to plod along as best he might , by industry , thrift , and attention , rising slowly through the levels of promotion . And if a pious madman had not entered the bank he might have continued his plodding path for some years longer , finding his opportunity at last in an altogether different direction . There were so many chances to be reckoned with . That madman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ruse which attracted his neighboring teller . That teller had to be at his post at the instant and in full possession of his wits to catch his cue . He had to recognize Davison 's ingenious alarm . He had to call the watchman , and that gentleman had to be within call . Had not all these circumstances and innumerable others combined , Mr. Davison might have received an idiot 's bullet , or indeed might never have heard of the idiot and gone industriously about his way until some other opportunity came along and swept him to another community and an altogether different fate . His own part in the affair consisted in his clever alarm . But if the other factors had failed , it is even conceivable that the incident might have brought him blame instead of promotion . Andrew Carnegie often speculated on this contingency in his own fortune . As a boy , riding in a locomotive cab , carrying a payroll he dropped it from the cab window . The package fell on the bank of a stream and rolled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and young Andrew recovered his bundle , But suppose it had rolled another foot and into the deep stream , meditated the astute Andrew . He believed he would most certainly have been reprimanded , perhaps dismissed , and the whole course of his life changed . He might never have gone into the iron and steel business . And if he had not , there might have been no Carnegie Steel Company , and hence no Charles Schwab , and of course no United States Steel Corporation , and finally no such Judge Gary as we know . Or if these individuals were invincibly marked for success , the Charles Schwab might have been known to fame as a musical comedy star and Judge Gary as a highly respected lawyer . The chronicles of commerce are filled with such tales . At the tail-end of 1919 a group of Walling-fords set out to collect a little easy money by selling fake oil securities . The promoters leased some oil fields for scenery to lend verisimilitude to their pictures of the future and its golden gushers . When two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . To stimulate sales a young chap was hired to set up derricks in the similitude of drills and photograph the scene for sales purposes . The young man sent a pipe down twenty feet and struck oil . When the flood gushed forth there was n't so much as a barrel provided for it . The last thing these adventurers were thinking of was oil . But quickly enough the containers were assembled and in short order the whole enterprise was changed from a swindling adventure to a real productive business boring for oil and not for suckers . This concern , I am informed , was later taken over by the Standard Oil Co . Now for another and a different tale . The American Malting Co. ? distillers ? failed , I think , three times . After a long series of misfortunes it finally struggled out of the slough toward solvency and profit . And then ? prohibition came . Are we wrong then in supposing that the hand of chance is forever busy in our affairs ? I do not mean that we live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accident . If one thinks of chance as the nameless agent which produces effects without a cause then I am willing to say with Bacon that " chance is the name of a thing which does not exist . " By chance I mean the unexpected , the unforeseen , the undesigned cause of many things . Man makes his plans . He includes in them all the factors he can foresee . The wiser he is , the more he foresees . The more he accounts for in his plans , the more he limitsthe part played by chance . But the wisest can not foresee all . As he goes forward with his enterprise , the unknown , the unpredictable elements begin to make their appearance . And as these impinge upon his plans , be must modify his course , retard or hurry his pace , or abandon his quest altogether . One is appalled at the innumerable forces shuttling back and forth across the highway of our lives ; countless incidents , accidents , currents , delays , suggestions moving and pushing us about . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumulated and matured out of vast chains of circumstances of which our own minds and wills form but a part ? a small part playing against the immense fabric of the universe . Every trivial incident is a crisis ? the crisis of an infinite series of incidents brewing through the ages . It is the fruit of immeasurable , complicated forces , the rise and fall of dynasties , the march of armies , the migrations of continents , the sweep of floods and storms and eruptions , the progressions of an unnumbered sequence of episodes converging on a fixed point and bringing man , time , and circumstance together for so trivial an event as the lighting of a cigarette . All this is but another way of saying that while man may be the captain of his ship he is by no means captain of the ocean . A successful voyage , therefore will be the result of propitious seas and good seamanship , favorable chance anc wise management , good luck and the commercial virtues . A few bold ap ? praisers have endeavored to estimate tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The late Pro fessor Richet of the French Academ ' thought there was 60 per cent intelli genre , 10 per cent hard work and 30 pc cent chance . I do not know how h achieved this analysis but he weakener somewhat its scientific value by ventur ing that even intelligence and industn are themselves the fine flowers of goo luck ? and , he slyly added , the won luck of all is to be born a fool . A famot Florentine success doctor who specialized in vocational guidance for princes , one Niccolo Machiavelli , preceded the Frenchman with a gauge of success which assigned half the credit to fortune and half to one 's self . This at least seems certain : whatever the percentage of the business virtues , they are quite essential . Three per cent alcohol in a malt brew is not very much ; but it is all the difference between a good glass of beer and the sterile , profitless draught we are offered to-day . ti IV We are then arrived at this ? that man collaborates with chance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors of his success . The others are marshalled by some force or forces outside of him . But what is it that controls these collaborating forces , moves them about , into our way or out of it ? " All we know , " said Josiah Royce , " is that events happen to us and happen in a certain fixed order . We do not know the ultimate cause of these events . If we lived on some other planet , doubtless causes of a very novel sort would be manifest to us . " But as this distant and detached view of the game is not open to us we see only ? and somewhat darkly --  a universe of law with innumerable particles moving about in countless orbits , and our own little orbit bisected each instant by others without our having any power to manage the matter entirely . And yet there are many who cling to the old savage anthropomorphism : who ; ee these events happening not as part A what we have called chance but under the management of some genial or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have named chance are being ! constantly shuffled and dealt out by 3rovidence . They conceive of Provilenee , not as the artificer of a great law , ut as a watchful , supervising , interfering ) eity who also keeps things moving in onae vast but forever shifting design ofhis own . Good luck is a blessing from a loving Father . Bad luck , if not a visitation from an angry God , is a stratagem to try our spirits . Mr. Henry Doherty , the oil and utility financier , tells how on an occasion when funds were not forthcoming through the ordinary channels and all his associates were frankly disturbed , John D. Rockefeller maintained his calm and assured his nervous comrades that " the Lord would provide . " Mr. Melville Davisson Post in a current magazine article defines chance as " the manifestation of the Wisdom of God . " There are many pious souls who are sure that the saints of heaven lean from their eternal abodes to help close a real-estate deal , or that unfriendly demons occasionally desert their haunts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the stars pause in their courses to blast with an evil twinkle the fate of a bargain . If we do not , like the old Romans , build temples to Chance as a directing goddess participating consciously in our designs , we manage to worship her privately in many ways . Prayers for business success are as common as prayers for success in battle , and we always have the spectacle , which must bring laughter from the angels , of devout speculators praying on both sides of the market . Thus faith in the fates , in the stars , in charms and amulets and mascots , in lucky days and hunches and superstitious signs , makes its way into the practical affairs of the work-a-day world and expresses itself in profits and losses . I am told that in the Metropolitan financial district landlords must be content with lower rents on thirteenth floors . Indeed , there are no buildings in Wall Street precisely thirteen stories high . Recently a newspaper humorist , burlesquing the popular detective story , described a crime committed on the thirteenth floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo ! the floor was gone . There are many buildings in which the thirteenth floor is really missing . The ingenuous demons are cleverly deceived by omitting the thirteenth floor altogether and calling the story above the twelfth the fourteenth . What is all this but a belief , hacked by dollars and cents , that in some way these outside factors which I have ascribed to chance are really subject to the control of intelligences which may be propitiated or deceived or aroused by certain magical evocations and charms ? Indeed there is no legend more generally received than that certain men are habitually attended by good luck or bad luck . There are , to be sure , men and enterprises singularly favored by good fortune and others pursued apparently by evil . Have we not . always heard of the men of destiny , from the light-hearted Mr. Tunny who believes profoundly that some friendly force , which he calls his destiny , conducted him to his champion 's throne , to the ponderous and less fanciful Mr. Grover Cleveland who talked frequently of the Cleveland luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important financial leader exclaimed : " I would not like to be in William McKinley 's shoes . There is a man of destiny standing in line behind him . " It fell to my lot to communicate the news of McKinley 's assassination to a leading politician of the day . His first words were , " I knew it ! I said it would happen . " These men believed that the event came not by chance but through the machinations of some mysterious ford -- a man 's destiny in whose hands the wretched Czolgoz was but a blind tool to work its design . And yet unless we are willing to slip back into the dim regions of superstition , what warrant have we for believing that luck rides habitually with any man , that it is for him a personal attribute , and that the universe can be depended on so to arrange its affairs as to forward his plans ? V But if many a bewildered business man in his struggle to capture the favors of chance has , without quite knowing it , put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business has now found a better weapon against chance ? for after all chance is the unknown ; it fights us from the dark . It is the unknown which has been the curse of business . Man has never known enough to make his plans complete . He can not tell what the clouds will do ; what the other fellow will do . The merchant can not tell what fickle woman 's fancy will seize upon for style , leaving him with a basement full of unsalable colors and designs . Innumerable unknown facts about production and prices and demand and employment and money and such things have imperiled and wrecked the calculations of business men time out of mind . They have been the victims of what Mr. Vanderlip calls economic illiteracy . The business has been a gamble . One of the great builders of the Standard Oil Co. told me a little while ago that when he and his associates were laying the foundation of their great oil empire , business was almost a pure gamble . Business has been too much a game made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds and sees five cards . The other forty-seven cards constitute the unknown elements which baffle his skill . Business is often a game in which the player holds fewer than five cards and plays against a pack as big as the world itself . One of the conspicuous developments of the last dozen years has been the effort to reduce the number of these unknown cards ? the growing passion for facts . And it is one of the interesting phenomena of our present legal civilization that the effort of Mr. Hoover to collect the facts about business has been hampered by our antitrust laws which insist that industry shall be conducted not as a game of skill and science , as Mr. Eustace McGogl ? puts it , but as one of chance like " the old army game . " However , the work of research in bus . mess moves steadily forward . Scienet is making a " dope-sheet " for the busi ness man which puts him on a level a LUCK IN good at least as the race-horse better . Economists , psychologists , accountants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new facts and thus daily cutting down the area under the dominion of chance . About thirty-five trade associations now support co-operative research bureaus . In the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research at the University of Pittsburgh , out of fifty-two fellowships , fifteen are maintained by trade associations . The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has more than a thousand men in its service working on problems of research . These are part of the standing army of industry against the invasions of chance . About three years ago T stood in the office of a great oil-distributing company . The papers were filled with stories of over-production . Oil prices were going down . Oil men were frantically dumping their supplies on the market . A leading official of this great company brought me into a small room carefully guarded . On the wall was an enormous map , filled with dots , buttons , curves , markings of every sort . It was beyond my power to comprehend , but it informed the experts who compiled it that the apparent over-production was drawing to an end , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the price of oil would rise . This company , therefore , was calmly storing away its oil . The little men did n't know the facts . The great corporation with scouts in every continent did know . The little fellows , groping in fright amid unknown facts , were just gambling and taking the short end of the gamble . the big concern was operating scientifi.:ally on knowledge . Some months ago I had an amazingly interesting interview with Mr. Henry Clay Graton , a pioneer New England manufacturer , nearly one hundred years old , who built his first shop back in the days when Millard Fillmore was President of the United States . He told me one of the chief differences between business then and now was the extent to which the element of chance had been reduced . He is one of the largest tanners of leather in the world . Years ago when he put a fortune in skins into his tanning baths for months he took a chance on bringing out a batch of hides poisoned by a defective tanning solution . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanning chemicals he is protected against faulty mixtures by his laboratory . Strangely enough it is the professor ? once set down as the most impractical of men , good for chasing butterflies and construing verses ? who is taking the gamble out of industry . And as the unknown factors are diminishing , the luck element is being cut down . If this means anything it means that intelligence and industry have a better opportunity for success than ever before . However , there will always remain plenty of play for chance in life and in business ? at least until all of us become clairvoyant and clairaudient . Would we wish to have it otherwise ? A life of solemn certainties would not be tolerated long by the adventurous soul of man . And I think we may safely go forward gathering more facts without being troubled by the fear of knowing too much . Enough of knowledge will always evade us to preserve the seasoning we get out of the glorious uncertainty of life .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
