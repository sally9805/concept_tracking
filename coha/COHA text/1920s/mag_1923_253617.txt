Recognition of Mexico by the United States , long despaired of , became a live possibility when Mr. Secretary Hughes announced that a joint Mexican-American commission would soon meet in Mexico City to reach " a mutual understanding . " <P> Each nation will have two commissioners . The Americans have been chosen : Charles D. Warren , recent Ambassador to Japan , and John Barton Payne , head of the American Red Cross . <P> The trouble between the two countries centers in the Mexican Constitution of 1917 , which asserts that the subsoil wealth of Mexico belongs to the state . This invalidates American property rights already existing in Mexico . <P> The Big Three of Mexico-Obregon , de la Huerta , Calles-are now said to be convinced that American capital must be placated . <P> During the last six months Seor Obregon 's time has been chiefly occupied by restraining the extreme Agrarians , Socialists and Reds . He has learned that American capital will not come without guarantees of security and property-rights.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
