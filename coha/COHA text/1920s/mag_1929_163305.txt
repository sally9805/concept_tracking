In a draughty Moscow public dining hall a group of 99 U. S. tourists licked up grey beluga caviar last week , wryly gulped throat-scorching vodka . A band struck up " The Star-Spangled Banner . " The tourists , clearing their throats , joined in the chorus . " It was the first time , " opined the Associated Press , " that ' The Star-Spangled Banner ' had been played in Moscow since the War . " The day was the eleventh anniversary of the assassination by Soviet executors of Tsar Nicholas II . <P> Among the 99 were Albert Ottinger , defeated Republican candidate for New York 's governorship ; Editor Oswald Garrison Villard of the pinko-liberal U. S. Nation ; Norman C. Chambers , famed pneumatic toolman ; Miss Rosemary Bauer , Chicago debutante , Liquid Carbonic heiress ; Mrs. Mabel S. Ingalls , Manhattan socialite , niece of John Pierpont Morgan . <P> From the Polish border the tourists had come in a special train of mahogany-trimmed sleeping cars complete with electric fans and shower baths , relics of Imperial Russia . Impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a small gratuity . <P> " No , many thanks , kind lady , " said the punctilious Communist . " Tipping is officially banned in Russia as a bourgeois institution , degrading to workers . " <P> The dinner which the 99 attended in Moscow was tendered them by the Soviet Department for Western Trade . Pursuant to a Soviet request " to kindly leave behind furbelows , top hats , canes and other vanities that might strike a bourgeois note in the communist paradise , " the 99 tourists attended in sack suits , travelling dresses . When the star-spangled strains had subsided , Comrade Poliayukov , president of the Russian-American Trading Corporation , rose beaming at the head of the speaker 's table and boomed : " Welcome to Soviet Russia . While you are here you are invited to partake of as much vodka and caviar as you like ! " <P> Answered Alex Gumberg of the Chase National Bank : " I am sure that this trip will reveal to all participants business possibilities that they never before anticipated . " <P> Although it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $10 a day , and sumptuously for $20 , the Soviet authorities are abstracting $99,000 from their 99 guests for a 30-day tour of Red Russia-$33.33 per tourist per day .
