txt In two provisions of the League covenant there is a power for the permanence of peace that outweighs a thousand times all the factitious apprehensions about trammels upon our independence . or impairment of our sovereignty . We mean the provision relating to agreement for disarmament , and that which contemplates the creation of an international court of Tustice . The people of every nation are vitally interested in disarmament , for the execution of that design would lighten the burden of their taxes . Taxation to pay for the costs* of the war ended a year ago will be , in all conscience , heavy enough without adding thereto new imposts to defray the cost of wars yet to come . That there shall be set up a tribunal for the settlement of differences open to adjustment by the processes of justice is the desire of all right-minded men , for every man who has advanced far enough in civilization to approve a resort to the courts instead of to the dueling ground as a means of settling private disputes must admit that disputes which arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice : han by victory upon a field drenched with human blood . NN'ithout the Treaty and the League we shall not have the benefit of these .. revisions . These and other potential bleings which the League of Nations would confer upon humanity have pretty much been lost sight of in the leng drawn out wrangle which has **  --  ionably postponed the ratification of ' the Treaty by the Senate . It is N : ell that they should again be brought view . A large majority of the Senators . Democrats and Republicans flesire ratification of the Treaty : ? .. 1 the covenant . Both sides know *11:at that is the wish of the country . ' De Republicans have had no doubt of it since they heard the practically unanimous voice of members of their : . itional Committee , advising them that the people wanted ratification at once . The " Battalion of Death " was , of course , quite unaffected by the reports of the National Committeemen . But the reasonable Republican senators , those who occupy middle ; , - r3und , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving to bring about an agreement . An agreement will be reached , the Treaty will be ratified , , there is no doubt about that ; but it would be the gravest of all errors for the majority of - the Senate to ask , or for the minority to yield , too much . The Democratic Senators are prepared to make concessions , Mr. HITCHCOCK made that very plain by his speech in this city . The safety of the Treaty , however , must be the limit of yielding . We may 0 : : fine our understanding of its provisions , we may with great propriety set forth the constitutional limitations upon our action under it . But any reservation that changes the substance of the Treaty puts it in peril of rejcetion by other Powers . We do not want two leagues - of nations ? we want one or none . It ' would be of immense advantage to this country and to the world if Senators would turn their attention from the spooks and ghosts which their imaginations have conjured up as they have pored over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its provisions which no man can doubt would constitute a veritable fortress for the peace of the world .
