MR . COOLIDGE , the little Vermonter , has appeared against many strange backgrounds . Surely the most incongruous of all was the languorous Georgia island , where the double-breasted business suit bobbed up against the bearded oaks , the Spanish ruins , and the warm mystery of the Southland . Reading the account of his doings , we were thinking how times had fallen off . From that island , pirates once put to sea . Later , Spanish friars lived there in a mission . From a timber of one of the island 's trees was hewn the keel of the frigate Constitution . How pale by contrast must have been the scene this past week  --  a strange little twentieth-century sprite , who , surrounded by photographers , guarded by secret-service men , and tagged by reporters , phoned Washington every day from his bedroom , and dedicated , in a high nasal voice , an ancient and uncomplaining tree . IT seems unlikely that Mother England will ever discover what America is all about . The Colonies were misunderstood in 1776 , and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We offer as evidence the following paragraph from Punch , in which Punch 's dramatic critic makes a wistful but unsuccessful attempt to explain the meaning of the tide of the play " Burlesque : " " As for the tide , its meaning escapes me . Burlesque ' of what ? Of actual life behind the scenes , or of stage present ments of that life ? In either case the play gave no sign of a burlesque motive , or , if it did , it gave it too subtly to be penetrated by those who were not familiar with the phase of American life or American drama that it was supposed to be satirising . However , the problem of the title 's significance did n't seem to trouble the audience . " There you have its It 's no wonder the Colonies withdrew from the Mother Country . Even that imported Britisher , Mr. St. John Ervine , recently admitted that he could n't understand why the Marx Brothers show was called " Animal Crackers . " To explain that to an Englishman would be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Burlesque " of what , eh ? Well , " Pygmalion " who ? ALTHOUGH Christmas 1928 is but a misty isle in our memory , the stack of greeting cards we received is a sharp reality on our library table . We 've just been going through them , a mordant pastime , and find that our favorite card is one from the Chancellor ( and wife ) of Syracuse University . It reads : " On the morning of December twenty-fifth between nine and ten o'clock Mr. ? will be before us in memory and thought as we call the roll of our friends and ( telepath ' to each our best wishes for the joys of the season and the triumphs of a New Year . ( Signed ) Chancellor and Mrs. Charles ' Wesley Flint . " WE were attending the marathon yv talk contest , at the Seventy-first Regiment Armory , and suddenly the attention of everybody was focused on a burly man who had offered to escape from a strait-jacket while suspended by his heels . He was immediately assisted in this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room . As we watched the procedure , it seemed to be an answer to that troublesome old question , What does the United States Army do in peace time ? Obviously the Army is busy hoisting by the heels men who are going to escape from strait-jackets at marathon talk contests . DODDERING old graybeard that we are , our mind goes back to those halcyon days when it was something to know a millionaire or an author . Quaint times , those . Today , the streets , the subways , the living-rooms , are filled with millionaires ; they even drop into our office to bother us . As for authors  --  we know seven people who finished writing a hook less than half an hour ago . Congressman PERHAPS not enough is known about the activities of our congressman , Mr. Sol Bloom , in addition to the fact that from time to time he introduces a bill which would require citizens to salute the flag whenever they pass it , and with no exception for Fifth Avenue on Flag Day either . Mr. Bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently he went to Chicago on a delicate mission . That city was mad because New York is planning a celebration on Washington 's Birthday in 1932 which might take the edge off Chicago 's World Fair in 1933 . Mr. Moron knew just what to do because he helped build the Midway for the Chicago World 's Fair in 1893 . He was precocious , and was a builder in his youth . He put up a theatre when he was twenty-one . The Times Square , Selwyn , Eltinge , and Sam H. Harris theatres here are his work . Before he went into politics , he was also a music publisher , and he still likes to be called " the music man . " Now serving his third term , Sol is known among his colleagues as a fighter for ideals . Once he was going to punch the fiery Representative Blanton of Texas in the nose , and he would have done it too if the Representative had n't bent him backwards over a table and kept him from taking his glasses off . Blanton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a charge not founded in fact , since Mr. Bloom is interested in the cinema only because of his great wish that the doctrines of the Constitution be filmed . Nothing has been done about it ) et . THE Congressman has been quite a social success in Washington , entertaining lavishly in a fine house . For the decoration of its kitchen a Bohemian painter was imported . Jealousy of his manner of living is common . Less popular government servants have been heard to allude to his magnificent red automobile as " the fire engine . " The fact remains that he attends the White House musicales and diplomatic dinners . At the former , for instance , he is a pretty imposing figure , with golden pince-nez dangling , on a black silk ribbon set of by a white vest , a kerchief in his pocket matching his tie , etc . He is widely known for his generosity . During the coal strike a few years ago he revealed in a letter to the President that he had advised tenants in the buildings he owns here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He has helped many war veterans financially , and he paid nine hundred dollars , which went to char ity , for the baseball used in the Congressional game between the Democrats and Republicans . Also he makes up jokes . " Take the ' C ' out of Cal and that leaves Al , " is his , and he has gone even further than that . He told his secretary to put " R.S. V.P. " on his wedding invitations because it means Real Silver Vedding Presents . One of the statesman 's ideals is Mussolini , and during his annual trips to Europe with his family , his ( laughter Vera , a writer , has interviewed the Italian leader seven times . To help his brother lawmakers to understand Mussolini better , he once offered to read them all of his daughter 's interviews , but they apparently did n't want to understand Mussolini better . Frustrations do not discourage him , however . He is still hopeful that they will pass his bill to change the name of the AVar Department to Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present name of that bureau . Compulsory saluting of the flag is one thing , according to Mr. Bloom , and having a war department another . On Park Francais THE way to get waited on in a TH store was discovered by a wag about town during the holiday rush . He simply accosted a floorwalker and said , " Ees one spik French for buy zee bibelot , oh ? " A clerk who spoke French was instantly detached from her other customers and the imposter got his shopping quickly over with . Music Boxes , Old and New IN the nineties there were twenty or more men in town who repaired music boxes but now there is only one , Mr. Jaccard , whom you may see at work through the dusty panes of a small window of his shop at 309 Vest Forty-second Street . There are two windows . To see Mr. Jaccard you must peep through the one in which sits a mechanical clown whose head tick-tocks back and forth . If you go in you will find that Mr. Jaccard and his shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , a little like Steinmetz , a little like Santa Claus , and the rich gloom of his workroom is filled with that fine woody smell a music-box shop should have . Furthermore , the place is properly at sixes and sevens , with things piled against the walls and heaped about the floor . A great deal of peering and pulling must be done before anything is found . This adds to the fun of the thing for Mr. Jaccard , for he is almost certain to come upon some ancient prize he had well nigh forgotten about . He has an extensive collection . The music-box repairing business is n't what it used to he , few people bringing instruments in for fixing any more , and Mr. Jaccard keeps his shop going by buying instruments , fixing them up , and reselling them . At that , the last time we were there he was engaged in an interesting repair job , that of restoring a snuffbox which has been in the Wanamaker family for years , in which a tiny nightingale twitters the music . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music boxes come mostly from the attics of old brownstones and no matter how old or how despondent they may be , Mr. Jaccard can make them play . He sells them to collectors and others . Mr. Henry Ford is buying one old-timer , and some other millionaire is thinking over another , a gorgeous affair with drum , bells , castanets , and harp effect . In the shop you have to be careful what you touch or lean against , for everything there contains machinery . Music is likely to issue from the hat-tree , or from a blotting pad , a chair , a powder box , a towel roller , or a decanter ? " The Blue Danube , " " Heil ige Nacht , " and " Floradora , " or such modern things as " Valencia " and " I Wonder Vhat 's Become of Sally . " If you are there when the musical clocks announce the hour you will hear " After the Ball " and other old songs . Mr. jaccard has been at his trade nearly fifty years , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a youth in his birthplace , St. Croix , Switzerland , the town which used to make nearly all the music boxes in the world . Music boxes went out about a quarter of a century ago and the factories in St. Croix were closed , but some years ago a temporary use was found for them . They were reopened to make munitions of war . Theme Songs THE greatest single crisis ever faced by our American minstrelsy was the necessity to write a song advertising the film " The Woman Disputed , " and the greatest single achievement was the resultant compOsition , called ( as you probably know ) " Woman Disputed , I Love You . " Generally , theme songs come easier than that . When the picture " Ramona " was filmed , the song " Ramona " was written , there being no trick to that . For the picture " Lilac Time " it was necessary only to take the song " Jeannine " and change it to " Jeannine , I Dream of Lilac Time . " A little harder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tern-pest " was finally woven into a ballad , " Out of the Tempest into My Heart . " All these were just preparing the song boys for the great test , which , as we have all seen , they met gallantly , covering themselves with glory . Nocturne THE other eve- ning we were taken to the reception room of a broadcasting station . A dozen persons , mostly women  --  relatives and friends of the entertainers , we gathered ? were seated on chairs and sofas . A loudspeaker on a dark shiny table emitted a song by two girls . Their voices grew suddenly louder as a door opened into a small adjoining room , and we realized that we were now hearing the singers in person . They stood quietly and were apparently unperturbed . The announcer lounged in a chair behind them . He was searching through his pockets for a cigarette . Presently he came out into the reception room , closing the door behind him . " Where 's Mr. Blank ? " he asked . " This is the girls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " declared several of the ladies . " Then I 'll have to sing , " said the announcer without emotion . " I 'll probably fall down in the middle of it , though . " He went back into the little room . Just then the elevator door opened and let in Mr. Blank . Everybody spoke to him . He looked at a large clock above the elevator door , smiled , and said that he still had a minute . He removed his overcoat with deliberation and laid it down and took off his muffler . The door to the broadcasting room opened again , and the two girls came out . The announcer looked out , saw Mr. Blank , and beckoned to him . Mr. Blank advanced to the microphone , still carrying his muffler . He was announced to sing a Spanish song . He nodded to the pianist , and , as he began to sing , folded the muffler and put it in his pocket . One of the girls who had just sung was rosily flushed . It turned out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I was going to fall and almost grabbed the music rack , " story house , with about two hundred birds and four or five women assistants , who move quietly around , filling a seed cup here , snipping a toenail there . Most of the birds are up with the dawn , and so must the women be  --  sneaking around on stocking feet to try not to wake the talkative parrots . No attempt has been made in forty-five years to convert the house into an aviary ; it is simply as if someone had just moved in with about two hundred pets and had n't quite decided where to put them . Cages are everywhere  --  on chairs , on the floor , on the mantel over the fireplace , on window ledges , hanging from the ceiling . In a back room are Marion Talley 's two canaries which she brought from abroad ; over in a corner is a parrot that Margaret Anglin left there , a pensioner ; in a big cage on a chair sits a white cockatoo who used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and does a little dance to prove it ; by the door is a South American troupial who sleeps in a little flannel bag at night . Everywhere the flirting , the eager gossiping , the bright-eyed wonderment . Having gained Mrs. Williams ' permission , we wandered upstairs into a dingy room which contained only a few cages . " How 's business ? " asked a voice , which seemed to come from a cage under a blanket . " 0 . K. , " we replied . " Listen , " continued the voice , " ca n't you keep still a minute ? " We stole quietly downstairs again . " That was Powwow , " said Mrs. Williams . " A nice bird , but unbearable ? I have to keep him covered . He talks about oil stocks a good deal , and tries to call Chicago on the phone . " Mrs. Williams ' feathered boarders sometimes number five hundred in summer , when people leave town . Canaries pay one dollar a week , thrushes a dollar and a half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . She can make a slippery-elm splint for a broken leg ; she can cure mosquito bites with witch-hazel , and grippe with whiskey ; she can perform surgical operations , although birds ca n't take anesthetics ; she gives free advice to little boys who have sick puppies . She walks two miles a clay , and on Sunday visits the bird house at the Bronx Zoo , for relaxation . When one of her patients dies and she does n't understand the cause , she has the Carnegie Institute perform an autopsy and furnish her with the report . Tone THIS may not sound true , but we I-know that it happened . During the holiday rush , a tired lady visited a bootery and asked to be shown overshoes . " We cater only to carriage trade , " she was told by an elegant clerk . " Our people come in their motors and never use overshoes . " The lady gathered herself and tried on some shoes . She purchased a pair and asked that they be delivered . " Ah , but we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their merchandise . " The shop is in a side street and the lady thinks it is making a clumsy attempt at an Avenue air . The Meeting House THE new telephone book for the first time omits the Meeting House from its list of subscribers , and its passing merits some attention . The Meeting House was a brownstone at 139 East Forty-fifth Street where for fifteen years a little group of gentlemen used to gather . The building belonged to the late Payne Whitney , one of the most active members . When he died he left the house to another member , Samuel Adams Clark , and some months ago Mr. Clark sold it . Now it is a rooming house , and very likely the people who occupy it know nothing of its traditions . The club never had any rules , officers , set meetings , or dues . The founders had two purposes in mind : to get away from the usual formalities and to escape public attention . The name in the phone book meant nothing to persons who came across it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally fourteen : Mr. Whitney , Mr. Clark , Harry Payne Whitney , Lawrence and J. M. Waterbury , Eugene Hale , Jr. , Lewis S. Thompson , Finley Peter Dunne , Francis P. Garvan , Harry Curtis , Hugh D. and Edgar Scott , John Fox , Jr. , and Robert J. Collier . The last three named , and Payne Whitney and J. M. Waterbury , have died . But one member was taken in after the formation of the dub , Frederic N. Watriss . Great wealth was represented in the group , and letters too , but sports , espe cially polo , were perhaps the predominant interest of the group . The surviving members can not take as active a part in athletics as they did twenty years ago and this partly accounts for the decision to abandon the clubhouse . The remaining members , however , still foregather occasionally , usually in the offices of Mr. Clark in East Forty-sixth Street . The Meeting House was filled with rare hunting and racing prints , a priceless set of photographs of polo teams in action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members in group play or individual competition . Harry Payne Whitney was captain of the polo team which invaded England in 1909 . The members of the club who stayed home arranged to receive the score at the end of each chukker by cable , a notable stunt in those days . A telegraph wire was strung from the polo field to the cable office in England and a similar wire run from the cable office at this end to the clubhouse . How Silver Sweet HIS sleep disturbed by the giggling and tittering of two men on the front steps of his quiet home in the East Seventies , an exasperated taxpayer finally went to the window , lifted the sash , and prepared to bawl out a threat about calling the police . Abruptly , however , he went hack to bed with a sigh of resignation common to taxpayers . The moon had revealed the gigglers to be a patrolman and his sergeant , who were making a night of it , exchanging little anecdotes.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
