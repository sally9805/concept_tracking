LAST night we had a house warming for our Mexican neighbors , a long-promised celebration of the conclusion of their labors on the mud house . The labors , of course , are not really over , but the party had to be now or never , for Gertrude goes East to-morrow . Our white living-room wall , lit by candles in tin sconces , was as enhancing to the Mexicans of Tesuquc as the white walls of Taormina dance halls used to be in carnival season to Sicilian peasants . Arriving in shy , gentle groups , they wedged themselves against it : a thick row of men , women , and children with somber heads , gregariously consorting , with arms and bodies pressing one another , supporting one another by warmth , smell , touch . At first I had no sense that we were entertaining familiar individuals like Alvina , Salome , Anastacio . I saw only a woman 's profile under a black shawl , a ruffianly male silhouette , a brown arm clasping a child , an earthy fist fondling a mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian jar , these symbols seemed associated , like Indian patterns , with elemental forces : rain and drought and harvest , cloud and stream and mountain . Dark , dark , Spanish faces , tanned to leather , tortured with deep wrinkles . Should we ever penetrate their mysteries ? I suddenly felt that Gertrude and I were strangers and aliens in our little case . For all our six weeks ' hard work among these natives in the burning sun , we were still too pale to cast a proper shadow on a white adobe wall . The guests , however , gradually emerged from their sustaining consanguinity as separate friendly beings who made us , their hosts , at home with a very charming courtesy . Salome brought chairs across the acequia to help seat those invited and uninvited . ( His own family filled seven places . ) Anastacio and Matins , two musicians out of a Spanish painting , played rhythmic old Mexican airs on a fiddle and banjo . The Moorish-looking Timoteo , after a pretense of being too old , sang songs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her red skirt , and Ied his younger brother into a leaping , finger-snapping duo dance that threw flickering grotesques on the wall and again took me back to Taormina . But the couple we most enjoyed were Salome 's nieces , Flora and Celanese ? aged four and six . Thin little brown arms jauntily interlocked , red calico bodies held stiffly , eyes and ringlets melting together , they spun jerkily and tirelessly round and round and round , like two tiny toy figures on a music box fashioned by a primitive artisan . Outside in the dark a constant scuffling and whispering went on . When the ice-cream was served , a few more strange boys squeezed in Gertrude , who has the most beautiful hospitality I know , East or West , can now leave satisfied that the casa has been faithful to her best tradition . Anastacio has no air of a Spanish musician this morning , in his blue working shirt . He is always needing something inconvenient and unobtainable . To-day , in his knotted English he demands " medecina for bees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muy male . He must have medecina at once , or the beams that support the cam will cave in on our heads . A little way down the hill , Tomas leans reflectively on his shovel . There is something about a burly brown man leaning on a shovel at two dollars a day that rubs my New England fur awry . Yet I know Tomas is merely waiting to do as he is told ; only , like most of the males of his race , he is a little lacking in initiative . " Have you got the path the right width , Tomas ? " " Quien sabe ? " he shrugs . " Gertrude , come quickly and look at this path . " " No , you come here first and decide about the slope of the roof . " In another twenty-four hours there will be only one of us . I must somehow pin my friend down to common views on fences , gates , corral ? not to mention paint and curtains . July 20d . How one sleeps in the Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of a vast lake of silence and peace . On the surface of the lake to-day certain necessitous thoughts are floating . Set front fence . Hang gate . Train Melinda . Mix blue-green paint . Alfalfa for Billy and Buck . My mind noses up to these thoughts . Then , fearful of entanglement , swirls away again like a wary trout . Down under the surface is a mystic green depth where one can float and dream . Over in that drowsy backwater something tinkles and shines . A shine or a tinkle ? Yes , it 's a tinkle . Salome 's cows are being driven out into the mountain pastures . I open my eyes . They look straight up into a gold-brown ceiling made of a fine row of round beams . Fifty years old . That is what one of the roofers said . Fifty years ago a young man , the color of the beams , cut them for his bride . First he made mud bricks in a mold and laid them out in the sun to dry . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rode up into the red flanks of the mountain . He had a sheepskin on his saddle , and an ax , and frijoles in a red handkerchief . September is a golden season . It was warm yellow with rabbit brush in the open lower valleys , and the fuzzy pifion trees that patched the first rocky slopes were thick with sticky cones . He put up a hairy hand for a cone and turned the tiny nuts on his tongue , rich and sweet and round . So he rode along , chewing and whistling and spitting out the shells , and hawing to his burros as they splashed through the brooks . It was frosty yellow when he came to the stern ravines where the gray-mauve trunks of the aspen trees bury themselves so deep and chaste . Frosty in the high thin sunlight , where their heart-shaped leaves were trembling ; chill in the shade below the trunks where the streams ran hidden . Sun on the aspen tops , but a black forest looming on the next ridge . It was cold among the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full moon . All day he chewed and whistled and sweated as the round trunks fell , But at dusk he tit a flare of scented cedar wood . And when the smoke made a thin , pungent spiral and the moon sailed up over black peaks he wound himself in his sheepskin . And with the firelight turning his faun face red , and the moon turning it pale , and a tribe of little gray burro ghosts rustling and browsing uneasily in the scrub , his soul sailed off ? sailed off to meet his dark bride in the sparkling spaces of the sky . I must wake up . Colors . I must decide on colors to-day . Strong colors for the strong southwestern light that pours through the three casement windows above my bed . Our blue wall has the most beautiful surface . Perfect aesthetic satisfaction on its mere textare and its soft , rounded contours . Chinese pink like the bureau might be right for the window frames . A stir in the living room . Nan Mitchell has got up to make a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her , charming and efficient person , to come to help me through the hobbledehoy period of the house . Workmen 's voices . Workmen , but , alas ! no Gertrude . I miss her badly . Hectic rush crowded sentiment out of the last days . But now I shall see my friend , my long-legged friend in riding breeches , with her vivid face of eternal youth , at every corner of the ranch . I shall see her , her bags still unpacked , within an hour of train time , painting one more blue door ; and half an hour later , still in apron over breeches , trimming cottonwoods along the acequia with a hatchet . Naturally , when we pulled into town the train had gone . . . . Gertrude was somewhat disturbed , but not unduly . Tom could get her to the junction at Lamy . Tom did ? setting his weather-beaten jaw . But Gertrude , already on the Pullman steps , remembered that she had forgotten her valuable new dressing bag . " Gosh ! you sure do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were twenty-one , at the unperturbed lady in New York clothes who smiled down at him through her eyeglasses . She must n't worry . He 'd pack it himself , and insure it and express it . " It has been worth it , has n't it ? " called Gertrude over his head with a new accent in her voice . Or shall I say an old one , an accent not colored by blue paint ? July 23d . Miss Orgen we invite you to a feast to-day 24 at 2 o'clock pleas come in at noon its a baby Party at Frank Jimenez home and a dance in the evening and night The above , written on a smudged piece of ruled paper , was delivered just now by a small , Spanish-speaking urchin . Though this is not the twenty-fourth , and I am no Orgen , it seems to he a bona fide invitation to the christening to-day of the Mayordomo 's youngest ? and that of his new Bailie Hall . We can just sec Francisco 's long roof from our knoll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tesuque , reached by a sandy arroyo that runs up from the highroad into the hills . My young neighbors , Frank and Edith Harsh , and I went together , at about one-thirtya compromise between " noon " and " two o'clock . " No other guests had , however , arrived . Francisco , decked out in a fiery red necktie , greeted us with a pleased gleam in the eye that flashes under his beetling brows . He called his wife out of the kitchen ; one child in her arms , half a dozen others clinging to her long , sagging petticoats . The potentate of the ditch is proud of his half - Irish wife and her honeyed English words and her many children . The baby , we learned , had not yet returned from the Santa Fe cathedral . Indeed , it was all of an hour before a generous assortment of godmothers and godfathers descended the important bundle from a wagon . Now the guests began to straggle in . Frank Harsh wished , in a famished whisper , that we 'd had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls were well lined , and Francisco began to pass a tray with five glasses on it and a basket of variegated soft drinks . ( " Tonics , " they call them in New England summer trains . ) I was the fifth in line ? luckily I At three-fifteen a plate with a cup of sweet , thick chocolate and a piece of cake . When that was consumed the men streamed outdoors , as if there were to be a long intermission . At three forty-five we decided to leave , though our host protested that the meal had n't yet begun . The evening was very enchanting . Musicians on a raised platform as in Sicily , dark beaux and dark belles dancing under the beams , dancing quadrilles with swift , whirling figures , and a row of aged crones , like a cubist 's dream , sitting along the benches with the children . All the children of Tesuque upward of a month old were present , and most of them did a great deal of dancing . ( I see where Flora and Celanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romaldo , one of the village notables , put on his spectacles and read CXLIV. ? No. 864. - 98out of a paper in Spanish stating that Francisco Jimenez had a permit to open a dance hall . Then Francisco , with fierce looks , enjoined the muchachos to " put away your knives and pistols and drink no whisky . " We went home early . But I learned from Melinda that there was a rather exciting quarrel over a girl at two in the morning . July Q VII . The blood pressure of this hilltop has gone down measurably within the last three days . What kept it keyed so high and breathless during Gertrude 's stay was not only her zestful temperament , but the necessity of treating the mud house like a recalcitrant burro ; it had to be shockingly prodded and belabored to reach a definite point at a definite time . Much distance remains to be covered , but Nan Mitchell and I are taking it at a. slower pace . Houses respond to leisure as gardens respond to rain . It is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown handmaiden , Melinda , in spite of pervasive paint pots and turpentine , keeps ours most tidily swept and dusted . That helps to turn it into a place of order and charm and cool summer clarity . The living room is the nearest to completion . The books are in the white bookcase by the dining - room door . The salmon-colored Spanish chest has found its rightful place between that door and thefireplace . There are a big black Santa Clara jar filled with juniper over the hearth , and a round , terra-cotta bowl of startling carmine Indian paintbrush combined with purple and yellow blooms on the long table with wrought - iron ends . The room would be too austere without some bright flowers , though the green-blue doors stand open deliciously to the riotous brilliance of pink foothills and blue sky . The truth is , it is enough to lire in this country . Just to live . Work is n't necessary for the salvation of the soul . I feel as if I had grown vastly in graceby spending an hour with a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Tesuque valley the last days . The heavy sweet perfume still floats and broods over the thick green beds of mint along the acequia where down beyond the field , and the fence , and the new rustic gate into the corral ? Buck and Billy are cooling their knees in a silver curve . Sunflowers are springing in tufts all over the field . Hollyhocks are beginning to blossom under the apple trees . I am happy . M. Bergson once telegraphed a French philosophic friend of mine that he had discovered the secret of the universe . I believe I have a sneaking feeling that I may discover it some July morning on our knoll . Watching the thunder showers , just now , rolling northward across fifty miles or so of mountain , forty miles or so away , I thought I understood the Indian symbol of the Thunder Bird . A. great , chaotic whorl of blackness that suddenly blots out a mesa with two misty wings ? and then , as suddenly , floats on , leaving the mesa table clear and colored like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that but a demonic bird ? I keep my eyes on a long , yellow ridge , classic and austere as Greek marble . Now the Thunder Bird passes over the peaks behind . Now he drops three or four feathery cloud shadows . Deep , deep purple , they float and tremble against the golden pallor . Or is it I who am trembling ? One may live for years in the East without having a revelation of beauty so intense . July 31st . This is Sunday morning . Melinda 's little sister , the beautiful ten-year-old one , with arched eyebrows and bobbed hair , appears timidly at the door , huddling something orange and green in her arms . Out of the bundle peers a bright , perky eye . Do I like him ? Will he do ? they anxiously inquire . Nan Mitchell 's horror at seeing her Sunday dinner alive at eleven o'clock makes the Chavez sisters explode in giggles . Melinda has been used to hard farm and dairy work all her life . So she trots about in the hot sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit and eggs and cream from our ranch neighbors , running down to fetch the groceries when kind Mr. Harsh honks at the gate , and thinks it all a sort of holiday adventure . She cooks very well , scrubs the kitchen floor on her knees , and polishes the shoes . All at the age of sixteen . She goes home after lunch and we get our own supper at eight or nine o'clock , after a sunset ride . A wonderfully liberating system we find it . We cast off the painter 's trade about four , have a pleasant tea , catch our two steeds in the corral , saddle them by the storehouse ( I am still almost as green at this hostler business as I am at building a bridge of cedar poles ) , and start out . Oui horses are an ill-matched pair . Lazy old yellow Buck ? rented first by Gertrude from Natalie Curtis Burlin scarcely re-sponds to a spur . Billy ca n't he touched with one . I made no mistake when I bought Billy . He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous vitality runs by transfusion through my veins . We rode this afternoon to our own Indian village , the pueblo of Tesuque , four miles or so to the north of us . Tesuque is counted one of the least interesting of the Rio Grande pueblos . It is one of the smallest , and too easily accessible from Santa Fe . Yet tonight the square Plaza seemed to inclose within its brown walls Ancient Wisdom . The Indian fields we had crossed on horseback , the wild , rushing river we had forded , the . shady lane of giant cottonwoods , shut it far away even from the motor road -- -from everything but the scarified peaks of the Sangre de Cristo , now steeped and swimming in purple sunset light . They towered above the whitewashed purity of the church front and the low line of flat roofs . Doorways were vacant , roofs populous . Majestic beings , their brows bound with red or orange , stared down at us . Sages . Two pretty young women in black skirts and loose , high white boots , red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . Another , old and fat , with a black pot on her head , scuttled up a ladder to her house on the second story . We got off our horses and wandered about , leading them by their bridles . Faces smiled from dim interiors . A very old man in a blanket , holding a baby in his arms , followed along the western roofs , chanting a soft , croon-like rhythm . The baby was sucking a gray , pot-bellied clay figure . Did you ever stare down an ancient well upon the glint of water , and imagine what it would be to live down there in the cool and look up at the blue of the sky inclosed in a gray circle of stone ? The evening hour in Tesuque was like an hour at the bottom of the well . Life had a rare color and purity as you gazed up above those roofs . And the silent beings who guarded them ? silently watching us come and go ? were living in a mood as different from that of our hilltop as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had got much farther than we in understanding the secret of the universe . Their ears were attuned to voices we could not even hear . So merely looking at them , we rode away renewed in spirit . August 4th Only those who have the intimate confidence of the Pueblos can hope to see the many dance festivals that inter-space themselves through the seasons . They are solemn religious ceremonies , usually connected with the primal functions of the earth , and rarely heralded in advance . But every Rio Grande pueblo has one fiesta a year on a specified date ? the name day of its Catholic patron saint ? which all the New Mexico world and its tourists may attend . The greatest of these is probably the Corn Dance at Santo Domingo on August 4th . Santo DOmingo is one of the largest in population and the richest of the Rio Grande Indian groups , and has been among the least accessible to white influence . Nobody goes there with a camera ; for if he does it will be quickly snatched from his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southwest from Santa Fe about nine in the morning , in one of Tom 's cars . There were many other motors ahead of us on the mesa , and as we dropped down the horrific zigzag mile of Lavajada hill ? which descends to a much more tropic zone , climatically , than that of Santa Pe ? they were like a line of black beetles strung on the straight white thread of road . And yet when we reached the village ? and bumped , the first minute , into friends from New York and Philadelphia and Boston ? we and all the rest of the crowd were so caught up into the glaring symphony of sun , sky , dust , beating drums , bright colors , and furious physical movement , that we scarcely seemed obtrusive . The scene absorbed us into itself like grains of floating sand . Mass was just over as we arrived . The procession was pouring out of the whitewashed gloom of holy church into the pagan whiteness of Indian streets . The Catholic statue of Santo Domingo THE JOURNAL OF A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - borne manner of Catholic saints in Italy . He had one or two attendant Franciscan priests . But the bitten Mongolian faces of Pueblo elders hedged him about . And he was followed by a mixed rout of taper-carrying , intoning Indians and Spaniards , all marching and chanting in an extraordinary dusty glare . I have never seen such whiteness . No wonder the houses of Santo Domingo are built with deep shaded poriales edged with adobe walls . The upper tier ( approached by adders and set back some distance from the edge of the lower roofs ) have not only portales , but screens of green boughs . We climbed a ladder , and paid a small sum to occupy a red blanket on the dangling edge of such a shady roof . stood above its pale , walled top against the blue . Friezelike they turned , a line of men , a line of women ; friezelike they wound downward and started their rhythmic dance . A hundred men with red-brown , nude bodies , white loin cloths , coyote skins , and floating , shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , short shifts , with blue tablitas poised like monuments above their square-cut locks . Two long lines , moving in single file to a double beat . Heavy , ripe-breasted women stirring evergreen boughs from still , stoic wrists Lithe , free-leaping men shaking gourds with vehement sweep and , wound about their double isolation like a sort of moving pattern , the black and white Kosharc , the comic clown-devils , the holy delight makers . I saw a Curn Dance at San Felipe pueblo on May 1st of last year . The costumes , the colors , the measures were basicly the same . But that was the Spring Dance ? the dance of feathery blossom-time , the dance of the ecstasy of germination . And this was the Summer Dance ? the dance of full fruition . Here in the syncopation of feet , in the echo of drums , in the hoarse , insistent cry of choral voices , was harvest , teeming , prolific , overwhelming . The force of great yellow ears bursting free of their lush green sheaths . And the rain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a purple summer tempest , a cloudburst , a clash of fire and flood . As the day wore on and one group of dancers succeeded another and the sun stood always more high and burning in the sky , the pulsation grew volcanic , hypnotic . It racked our nerves , it . tortured our eyeballs , it beset our ears . It blasted , it demented us till at last we fled away . But we had scarcely reached the Indian fields when , with a grand burst of thunder , down came the ease of rain .
