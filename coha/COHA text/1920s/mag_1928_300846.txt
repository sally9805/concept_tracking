Two sister ships , the longest in the world ( 938 feet ) , were launched , last week , from German yards , and will go into service late next spring for the North German Lloyd . The sisters are Europa and Bremen . Though slim and expected to challenge the trans-Atlantic speed record held by the Cunarder Mauretania , the Teuton sisters will be no lightweights ( 46,500 tons each ) . Thus they will be but little lighter than the two heaviest liners in the world : Leviathan and Majestic , which were originally Hamburg-American sister ships , but were snatched from Germany by the Allies , and are now U. S. ( Leviathan ) and British ( Majestic ) . <P> Europa had a bottle of champagne smashed over her sharp nose , last week at Hamburg , after the U. S. Ambassador to Germany , Jacob Gould Schurman , had delivered the launching oration in fluent German . <P> Bremen , the other sister , received her champagne baptism at Bremen . It is no discourtesy to distinguished Ambassador Schurman to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man . A roar of welcome went up from 50,000 throats as He arrived , striding with ponderous tread , nodding gravely at the plaudits , a man too old and too great to receive aught but universal homage : <P> HINDENBURG <P> A deep guttural oration issued from the cavern of his throat . He did not move a muscle when the bottle of champagne tinkled and exploded . Afterwards Old Paul von Hindenburg rode away to begin his vacation , hunting chamois in Bavaria . But Germans remembered his words : <P> " Seventy years ago when the orator was ten the then young North German Lloyd launched its first vessel for trans-Atlantic service . It gave the craft the name of Bremen . . . " Now it is our wish to give this newest and largest vessel of Germany 's revived fleet to its elements . ... I christen thee Bremen ! " <P> " I hail the Bremen and the Europa as new links between Europe and America . I hail them as manifestations of the indestructible German capacity for work . " <P> Sagely did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present German merchant marine as a " revived fleet . " The achievement summed in those two words has been prodigious , unprecedented . The victorious Allies seized from beaten Imperial Germany enough ships to reduce her pre-War merchant tonnage of 5,500,000 by almost nine-tenths , or to 600,000 , yet today the merchant fleet of Republican Germany is up to 3,500,000 tons , or three-fifths of pre-War tonnage . Absolutely phenominal has been the " revival " of the North German Lloyd fleet , as statistics tell : <P> 1914 : 950,000 tons . <P> 1919 : virtually extinct . <P> 1928 : 721,000 tons . <P> 1929 : assured 900,000 tons . <P> The total tonnage of the U. S. merchant marine is 16,887,501 , British 22,782,573.
