Meehan . Deputy Chief of the department , who testified yesterday before the Congressional Committee on Shipping Board Operations .

Fisher , chief clerk and statistician of the Shipping Board , with having made a false statement in connection with this transaction , and further asserted that the attack on Mr. Bolling was Bolshevist ? ropaganda . The witness admitted he had not made an exhaustive investigation of the alleged transaction . He said he had somewhat changed his mind concerning the charges since ho made the affidavit . L.

I Mr. Meehan said he began his investigation last February . He went to Alonzo Tweedale , then Treasurer of the Shipping Board , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told Mr. Tweedale of rumors concerning Mr. Bolling and said Mr. Tweedale told him Investigation of the charges had been made at Mr. 13olling 's request , and that Mr. Tweedale was satisfied with Mr. 13olling 's explanation . Mr. Tweedale I also had talked the matter over with Mr. Fisher and had concluded the ' charges had no basis in fact . Mr. Twee ' dale ls. ' ier expressed the opinion that Mr. Flailing was the victim of a blackmail attempt , The witness told of having investigated George W. Beckerly , formerly an employe of the Shipping Board , on wooden ship construction : Beckerly subsequently was removed . The witness said a partner in the brokerage firm of Connally , Robinson &; , Bolling had turned over to Beckerly some of the concern 's assets , and he felt Beckerly would / : ) , , able to supply information concerning any transaction between Mr. Boiling and Sands .

Mr. Meehan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bolling brokerage firm for services in helping to finance that concern . His demand was made under threat of exposing Mr. Bolling , according to the witness . Meehan was also informed by the brokerage concern of a plan by which their assets were turned over to Beckerly as a dummy to keep them away from Sands . Subsequently , according to Mr. Meehan , Beckerly became very uncommunicative . When Chairman Walsh asked the witness whether his investigation had been thorough , Mr. Meehan said it had not been closed : that although he believed Mr. Bolling innocent , he was not prepared to give him a " clean bill of health . " " On what theory , " asked Representative Kelly , " do you think Mr. Downey was induced to put his notes into the hands of a man like Sands ? " " I told counsel for the Shipping Board , " replied the witness , " that Downey did it to bolster up his standing as affecting his credit with the Shipping Board . Sands did not want this in the record , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is merely an opinion on my part . " " Mr. Meehan , " asked Chairman Walsh , " do you want this committee to understand that you made an investigation of the Bolling matter ? " " To some extent . " replied Mr. Meehan . " Is it not a fact , Mr. Meehan , that your investigation stopped with the rePort made by the Department of Jusiee and your talks with Mr. Tweedale . end Mr. Boning ? " The witness admitted this substantially Nt-as the limit of his investigation , but he wanted it understood that no one had suggested that his investigation be dropped for fear of involving some one in high authority . Favored Immunity for Sands . The witness reminded the Chairman Itliat at a conference in the committee room he had advised Mr. Walsh and Mr. , Fisher that he favored granting im7nunity to Sands , if any evidence could lie found to establish the guilt of Mr. Bolling . In view of the fact that Mr. Meehan had testified he was incredulous of the ? harges against Mr. Bolling because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Chairman Walsh : , " You were investigating a crooked transaction and you would expect crooks to be interested in it , would n't you ? " Mr .. Meehan admitted this . " Yet you satisfied yourself with 13olling 's examination ? " queried Chairman Walsh . The witness said Mr. Bolling had convinced him of the truth of his explanation , and also apparently had convinced ir . Fisher . To 3111 his talks Mr. Bolling had made no reference to having accepted $500 from Sands as profit on a house , although Sands had said the money was part of a thousand-dollar commission he received for procuring a contract for some pipe-bending machinery . ( ander cross-examination by Representative Kelly Mr. Meehan admitted he had never investigated the reasons for which Mr. Downey paid the f540,000 commission to Sands . Representative Kelly suggested he should have started by asking the Credit.Department to ascertain whether it was necessary for Mr. ' Downey to bolster up the credit of his company . Mr. Meehan thought this unnecessary because the Shipping Board had let contracts to concerns which had practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record a report from the Credit Department showing that the Providence Engineering Company , In which Mr. Downey ' was interested and which bad applied for a contract , was in excellent financial condition and had adequate facilities for delivery as well as a sufficient plant to undertake a contract for the board . Sands Made , Loans to Honing . Mr. Meehan testified Mr. Bolling had told him of several small loans obtained from Sands . Asked why he had n't gone to Sands 's office to look into his accounts , he said he and his assistants had been subjected to much criticism by Congressmen and others as a result of their investigations . " Do n't you think it would have been proper to have gone to this bad , desperate man , Sands . and this eminently proper ? person . Bolling , and have checked up their accounts ? " insisted Representative Kelly . " No , I was convinced there was nothing in the charge , and Admiral Benson also was of the opinion that Mr. Bolling was all right , " replied Mr. Meehan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , did he not ? " " No ; Bolling went to the Admiral at the time the story was being circulated ! and told him of the whole affair . " " You did not , as a fact , check up these accounts of loans ? " No . " " Nor ask Bolling for the aggregate of the loans ? " " Not that I recall . " In the course of this examination the witness suggested it was possible Sands eed been telling the truth and that Bolling had been lying . L. Franklin Fuller , who admitted he had been indicted . In the Federal Court in the District of Columbia in 1918 for tittering a forgery , after which he was engaged as an agent by the Department of Justice , was first examined by Chairman Walsh , who asked : " Were you present at a meeting between Sands , Bolling , Sisler and Cranor ? " " I have been in Mr. Sands 's room a number of times and met all these gentlemen , " replied Mr. Fuller . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sands relative to these contracts with the Downey Shipbuilding Corporation ? " " No , I have n't , " said the witness , who was then asked when he first learned about the alleged transaction . Fuller said that either in the late Spring or early Summer of 1918 , Sands told him he could " make some money by buying some good notes . Sands then offered to sell him four notes aggregating $40,000 for $35,000 . He . finally duced Sands to take $25,000 , but he ( Fuller ) necked out of the bargain after getting commercial reports on the ' Downey Corporation . He told of a visa to Sands 's rooms in the Spring of 1C ; 18. when Sands Is alleged to have handed a check for $600 , or $500 to Mr. Bolling . He testified that he had remarked to Bolling : " Pretty soft for you , " to which Mr. , 1 Bolling is alleged to have replied . " No , 1 it 's pretty tough . " ' " Well , I 'm sorry for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the witness said he replied . After Mr. Bolling departed , the witness said , he asked Sands about the check , and was told the money was an the . Downey notes . He swore that ! " these fellows " knew of it as soon as Sands had cashed the notes , and came to get some of the proceeds . He said he had seen Mr. Bolling at least halt a dozen times in Sands 's rooms . " Did you ever hear Bolling and Sands discuss Sisler and the efforts he was to make to get the contract ? " asked Chairman Walsh . Fuller had not . Questioned further about Mr. Bolling . Fuller said he knew the latter well and had had transactions with him before the incident he had just described . " Do n't you think it was unusual , " asked Chairman Walsh . " that an experienced banker should tell you he had bribed a Government official ? " " He did n't tell me that , " replied the witness . You understood what was going on ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lot of that stuff going on in Washington all the time , and I paid little attention to it . " Says He Has Proof of Bribery . " Do you mean to say you know of other cases in which Government ' officials have been bribed ? " asked Chairman Walsh . " Yes . " " Can you furnish documentary proof ? " I can furnish some . " In describing his indictment Mr. . Fuller told the committee an appeal was pending and that in the meantime he had been engaged by the Departmen of Justice in the packer investigations which have resulted ? in the indictment of one company on 137 counts . He said he was at present employed by the Nestles Food Company . When Sands was recalled to the stand he told of a controversy between himself and Wallace Downey which resulted in a reduction of the amount of the commission from $40,000 to $25,000 . Mr. Downey , he said , insisted the money had been paid for the assistance given by Sands in securing financial accommodation , and could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said lie told Mr. Downey then that he understood the money was paid for his aid in procuring the Shipping Board contract . Mr. Downey gave you the $40,000 a long time before any arrangements were made for that loan from the bank ? " - asked Representative Kelly . " Yes , " replied Sands . " You are sure about that ? " " Yes . " " Was this credit arranged at the hank purely for the purpose of strengthening Downey with the Shipping Board ? " " I suppose it was , " replied the witness , who explained that Mr. Downey already had $50,000 on deposit with the Commercial National Bank when the $100,000 loan was negotiated . The witness was directed to furnish all canceled checks dealing with the dise position of proceeds of Downey notes . He was asked if he knew a Mr. Robertson , and said he formerly was . connected with the bank , but later entered the brokerage business with Mr. Bolling . " Did you have anything to do with that firm ? " " I only furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm was F. A. Connolly &; Co. , and explained that it had gone out of business and liquidated its assets as a result of a " leak . " " What leak ' " asked Chairman Walsh . " We have n't heard of any leaks except leaks in ships . " Sands testified lie did not remember having received any commission from Mr. Downey for services in procuring a contract for pipe bending rolls . Neither could he recall having had any confer-ence with Mr. Boiling relative to such ' a contract or having divided a fee for such services . " Did you ever write an anonymous letter to the Shipping Board or the De-1 partment of Justice ? " asked Chairman ' Walsh . I have never written an anonymous ; letter in my life , " protested the witness . I " Did you ever threaten Mr. Bolling ! that you would make it hot for him or expose him ? " I never did . " The hearing will be continued this morning at 9:30 o'clock .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
