Through choppy Mediterranean seas dashed the British battleships Warspite and Valiant , last week , steaming full speed ahead from the Empire naval base at Malta toward the Egyptian ports of Alexandria and Port Said . Beside the ponderous battleships , paced three swift cruisers , keen Empire dogs of war . Smoke belched . Spume flew . Meanwhile a good old fashioned ultimatum was being cabled by the potent Government of His Britannic Majesty to the puny Egyptian Cabinet of puppet King Fuad . <P> The Egyptian Parliament , greatly daring , had brought the ultimatum upon itself by approving the so-called Public Assemblies Bill . Under that innocuous title is cloaked a measure which would severely curtail the police power to maintain order during public meetings , which , in Egypt , turn very easily into anti-British race riots . Therefore the London ultimatum to Cairo , last week , informed Egyptian Prime Minister Nahass Pasha that he must " immediately . . . prevent the Public Assemblies Bill from becoming law , " or else expect " His Britannic Majesty 's Government to consider themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them to require . " <P> The " action " thus cryptically threatened was understood to be the blockading by battleships Warspite and Valiant of the customs offices at Alexandria and Port Said , from which the Egyptian Government derives a major portion of its revenue . Faced with such a threat-to-pocket , Prime Minister Nahass Pasha yielded inevitably , but sought to save the face of Egypt by promising merely that action upon the Public Assemblies Bill would be " postponed . " To this equivocal capitulation His Britannic Majesty 's Government sternly replied that they " would again be obliged to intervene ... if ... the Public Assemblies Bill were to be revived . " <P> Paradoxically the drafter of Britain 's ultimatum and threat to intervene was Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain who recently received a Nobel Peace Award ( TIME , Dec. 20 , 1926 ) . In the House of Commons , last week , Sir Austen bared his imperfect teeth in a wolfish smile when Opposition back benchers shouted that he was " Bullying Egypt ! " With the crisis safely passed , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valiant had been ordered back to their kennel at Malta .
