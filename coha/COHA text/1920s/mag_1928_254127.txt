When a man offers to do an important job , it is scarcely unreasonable of the men who want the job done to ask how he proposes to do it . <P> To demonstrate how Alfred Emanuel Smith might return the Democratic Party to power in the land , proponents of the Brown Derby argued at Houston as follows : <P> There are 531 electoral votes . <P> It takes 266 to elect . <P> If the Solid South-States which never have gone Republican-would stand by Smith , he would have 114 votes ( Alabama , 12 ; Arkansas , 9 ; Florida , 6 ; Georgia , 14 ; Louisiana , 10 ; Mississippi , 10 ; North Carolina , 12 ; South Carolina , 9 ; Texas , 20 ; Virginia , 12 ) . <P> Smith 's prime claim to candidacy is his claim that he could carry his own New York , which has 45 votes . So that is the next factor to add . The Solid South plus New York would make 159 votes . <P> The next consideration is the Border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States total 64 votes ( Delaware , 3 ; Maryland , 8 ; Kentucky , 13 ; Tennessee , 12 ; Missouri , 18 ; Oklahoma , 10 ) . <P> Smith would have to carry most of the Border States to be within striking distance . The Solid South plus New York plus all the Border States would be 223 votes . <P> Now the Democracy would have to invade Republican territory . The Smith appeal is primarily to urban voters . Therefore the next States to consider , in the order of their likelihood for Smith , are : <P> New Jersey . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .14 <P> Massachusetts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .18 <P> Indiana . . . . . . . . . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .15 <P> Ohio . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 <P> Illinois . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29 <P> Needing 43 votes to win , Smith could be elected by carrying any three of these , or any two , if one of them were Illinois . <P> Should Smith fail to get 43 votes among the Urban States , he still could win . There are four Western States with Democratic leanings . They are : Arizona , 3 ; Montana , 4 ; South Dakota , 5 ; Colorado , 6 ; totalling 18 . <P> This group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urban States could put Smith over , provided he had the Solid South , his own New York and the Border .
