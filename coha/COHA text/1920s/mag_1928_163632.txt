Were a caricaturist to sketch a situation that last week developed on the U. S. investment scene , he might show President E. H. H. Simmons of New York Stock Exchange as a headwaiter of a crowded restaurant , and Chairman Charles Hamilton Sabin of the Guaranty Co. as a caterer serving with his own hands a new dish to his gabbling , gobbling customers . <P> Mr. Simmons as head of the Exchange suddenly announced the listing of the Kingdom of Great Britain &; Northern Ireland 4% bonds and Mr. Sabin 's investment company was already prepared to sell 2,000,000 ( $10,000,000 ) worth . Buyers demanded more than the Guaranty Co. had to sell . But 386,777,664 ( $1,933,888,000 ) more of the same issue have already been sold by the British government and conceivably , but not probably , U. S. investors may freely trade in them through the new permission of the New York Stock Exchange . <P> Results . These bonds are listed in the Exchange in pounds sterling , a 200 bond being treated as though it were a $1,000 bond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the centering of world finance in the U. S. <P> Another result is that the way has been made for listing another and greater British security , the 1,950,000,000 ( $9,750,000,000 ) 5% British war loan . If that is listed it will be the greatest bond issue ever offered to U. S. investors , exceeding by $3,500,000,000 the Fourth Liberty 4% loan . <P> Another result is the further enhancement of Mr. Sabin 's prestige in international finance . His handling of one-half of one per cent of the British &; North Irish issue was as weighty as Albert Henry Wiggin 's deal the week before . Mr. Wiggin 's Chase Securities Corp . formed the $10,000,000 Finance Company of great Britain and America Ltd. with Sir Alfred Moritz Mond 's Imperial Chemical Industries ( TIME , April 23 ) . Both transactions enable U. S. capital to flow to England , and thence farther afield . <P> Still another result was the immediate rise of the pound sterling 's exchange value . It went to $4,884 ( par is $4.86 ) , almost the point at which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England .
