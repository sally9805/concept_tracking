Eternal Spirit of the chainless Mind ! Brightest in dungeons , Liberty , thou art ; <P> For there thy habitation is the heart- The heart , which love of thee alone can bind . <P> So mused the great but indiscreet poet , Byron . <P> " We chose Liberty for a name because it is the first word in American consciousness . It was first made to mean something here in America . . . It had been a dream despaired of elsewhere . Here it was realized ! " <P> So exclaimed the publishers of the Chicago Tribune and the Daily News ( Manhattan ) . It was small wonder that the musings of J. M. Patterson and R. R. McCormick differed from the poet : they had not committed his indiscretions , nor had he made a fortune by collecting pennies from the gum-chewers of a great nation . <P> For Messrs . Patterson and McCormick , having driven out all comers except Hearst and a small business daily from the morning newspaper field in Chicago , looked ahead for new fields to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little illustrated sheet , of scandalmongering propensities , the Daily News . The gum-chewers of Manhattan seized the News and gloated . Pennies by the carload rolled into the proprietors ' pockets . And yet they felt the urge for " More ! More ! " <P> It is now some months since the report was bruited through the publishing world that the Chicago Tribune had in mind a new magazine to compete with The Saturday Evening Post . Last week the report was justified . Liberty appeared . <P> With the magazine in hand it is easier to conjecture what went on in the fertile minds of Messrs . Patterson and McCormick . <P> " We have taught the people of Chicago to stomach our ware . The gum-chewers of Manhattan have gobbled it up . It must be popular stuff . It 's too bad we ca n't sell it to the whole country . But it would cost a terrible lot of money to start a newspaper in every city . Why not put our stuff into a magazine and sell it everywhere ? <P> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . Then we 'll have an editorial page and put at the top that things of Decatur 's : ' Our Country . . . may she always be in the right ; but our country , right or wrong ! ' That must be good stuff ; we 've used it for a long time . Then we 'll get some stories-the kind we use in our Sunday editions-by George Barr McCutcheon , Albert Payson Terhune and Montague Glass . And we can have Mae Tince , who does our movies , contribute some of that ' Ask <P> Me ! Ask Me ! ' stuff about the screen . We can take a leaf from our success with the News and put in a couple of pages of news photographs-everybody likes pictures . And a few of that not-too-serious kind of article that gets away strong in The Saturday Evening Post . Oh , yes , and add a few of those ' inspirational ' articles that the American Magazine makes its living by , and some of the women 's heart stuff and patterns-the things that sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ' coloroto ' the way we do our Sunday supplements . Better still , we 'll sell every other page for advertising , all the way through the entire magazine-that will get the advertisers ! And sell the whole thing for a nickel , in competition with The Saturday Evening Post . By , that 's a wonderful mixture !
