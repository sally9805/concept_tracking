txt EXCERPTS FROM LETTERS ON MANY SUBJECTS Arming the Citizen . The letter of J. F. Cullen in THE Timns , In which he states that the carrying of revolvers by citizens in general is not to be recommended because ( 1 ) the hold-up man will have his victim covered before he ( the victim ) can draw his gun , and ( 2 ) because the general carrying of guns would result in a great many accidental shootings . Now , without doubt , the bandit has an advantage in that he initiates the situation , which may give him a decisive advantage as against a single victim , though it would not be such an advantage where the attempt is made to hold up several persons , two or more of whom are armed . Nowadays it is common for two bandits , or even a lone bandit , to hold up crowded stores . poolrooms. &c..; in perfect safety , simply because ( as the bandits , of course , know ) none of the victims has a gun . * * * As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no epidemic of such shootings before the Sullivan law was passed , and , therefore , there is no reason to apprehend that there will be an epidemic of them if the law is repealed . ? * * PAUL A. KELLEY . Bayport , N. Y. , Feb. 2 , 1925.
