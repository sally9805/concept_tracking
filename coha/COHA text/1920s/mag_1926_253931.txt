Physics students at the University of California watched with amazement the antics of a gas flame in a glass tube on Dr. E. E. Hall 's lecture desk . Near the tube was a radio transmitter . No one tampered with the gas supply , yet the gas flame was made to flare up , turn from yellow to blue and roar . Dr. Hall explained that seven miles away , in the General Electric Co. ' s laboratory , Charles Kellogg , famed " bird man , " was broadcasting notes from the phenomenal upper register of his voice . The vibrations , 15,000 to 20,000 per second , transmitted by radio , affected the gas flame as would the vibrations set up by a tuning fork in the experiment familiar to physics students . Sufficiently intense vibrations would have extinguished the flame . The color change resulted merely from the vibration of gas and flame , being similar to the effect produced upon a gas flame by increasing the pressure of its fuel . <P> Birdman Kellogg 's larynx has long been a source of entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been on and off the vaudeville stage for 15 years . His flame experiment was the result of thousands of " fan " letters he received after a radio lecture last month . He can " sing " a note so high that it is inaudible to the human ear . Such a sound can be made with a violin but no Tetrazzini , no Galli-Curci , could make it . With these notes topping his vocal scale Mr. Kellogg has learned to imitate and even improve upon the songs of birds ; to imitate insect calls . His phonograph records , including a choral effect obtained by playing many records into one , are well known and remarkable . Sympathetic vibration has been another of his studies-finding the note that will make a dog howl , a small object tremble . He has propounded the theory that sympathetic vibration is the key to the mystery of how news travels with great rapidity over long distances among primitive tribes . <P> A lifelong vegetarian , stocky , muscular , soft-voiced , with a shock of greying hair and a flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his days . On his valley ranch in California he grows corn twelve feet high , according to his less skillful neighbors , by singing to it .
