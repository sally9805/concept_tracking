txt Flying his seaplane with rare skill at a speed never before attained in these machines , Lieutenant " Jimmie " Doolittle of the United States Army flashed first over the finish line in the Schneider maritime cup race this afternoon and gained another leg on the trophy for ? this country . His speed for the 211-mile course was 232.57 miles an hour , which is 55.19 miles an hour faster than this race was ever flown before . It is 43 miles an hour faster than the time made unofficially over this course last year . Doolittle was never pressed hard . The other two American seaplanes of the same type were making only 220 miles an hour when they were forced out by engine trouble , and tho only English entry , the Gloster-Napier , flown by Captain Hubert Broad . finished second with 13. speed of 199.18 miles an hour . The Italian entry , a Macchi-Curtiss Monoplane , flown by Lieutenant Giovanni de Brigand , which was third in the race , made only 108.44 miles an hour and was still flying long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racers today came to grief , twq Americans , Lieutenants . Criddihy rind Ofstie , and Lieutenant di Brigand , Italian , being forced down . All were towed to safety . Cuddihrs machine lost Its oil : thinteL how and sprung a leak in the radiator . He stopped on the last lap and flames from the burning oil and gas in the chambers flared out . Cuddihy came down safely and after he landed beat out the flames with his cushion and handkerchief . Ofstie ran out of gas and was forced down in his sixth lap . Di Briganti did not drop into tht bayuntil he had crossed the finish line . The cause of his trouble was not do'termined . One more victory by America will win the cup permanently for this country , although six races had been flown before the United States entered the contest . America won last year . Doolittle Skillful at Turns . The flying of Doolittle was masterly . He banked so sharply on his corners and held his plane so cleverly on its side until he had regained speed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut the corners so closely that experts estimated that he flew fifteen miles less than did the British and Italian planes . Their turns were very wide , adding materially to the distance they had to fly and wasting some of their precious supply of gas , for racing planes do not carry an ounce more fuel than necessary . When Doolittle banked around the home pylon he held his plane in so tightly that he passed over the heads of those on the judges ' stand so closely that they felt the wind from his prepeller . He could not have been more than thirty feet above them , and the black , shining whirlwind crashed by with a roar that was terrifying . Just how fast this plane would travel over a short straightaway course the pilots decline to predict , but Doolittle beat by nearly five miles an hour the time made by the British supermarine Napier over a straight three-kilometer course . The superruarine was the ship that crashed here Friday , a ship in which England hoped to win the race and clinch her hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour over the short . course , which is 4.57 less than the winner 's speed today . It Is probable , if the weather is fa- vorable tomorrow , that flights will be made over a three-kilometer course , but Doolittle today broke every seaplane record from 8 to 200 kilometers . The ill-luck which has beset the English entries in the race still held today , for when Bert Hinkler went out this morning in the Gloster-Napier to take his navigability test it was rather rough ; and a rear strut broke under the pounding of the waves . The other struts then collapsed and the fuselage settled down on the pontoons , being held between them by the wings . Hinkler cut off his engine an soon es the strut broke , but not In time to prevent the pontoons being punctured . Their compartments kept the plane afloat until a boat reached him , and he did not even get wet . It was an ala.est perfect day for the race , for after the discouraging weather of the last few days there was only a mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sun shown down between ragged clouds on the blue-gray Chesapeake . There was a small crowd along the shore and on the big pier Which held the reserved seats and judges ' stand , for Bayshore is nearly twenty miles from Baltimore and few could get away from work . eiloster-Napier First at Line . The English Gloster-Napier , a beautiful ship with white wings and a light blue body , was the first to reach the starting line . She was towed out by a boat , and floated lute a white bird , lifting with the waves , until a few minutes before the start . iAfter she was in posidon , Lieutenant Doolittle taxied past the end of the pier to the line , his plane being almost covered with Spray , which washed up and was thrown back by his propeller . These fast Curtiss beats proved today that they are also sturdy seaplanes . Tisey made good time taxleing on the water and lifted quickly despite the waves . They seemed almost buried in water at times , and it cascaded from their wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a minute or two late in getting to the line , but he more than made up for it - when he turned , about and started . There was a roar from his motor , the nose of the plane came up slightly , lifting the front end of the pontoons , and the tiny black and gold ship , glittering wet in the sun , shot across the line . Spurning the sea beneath her like a gull she leaped into the air , and in a minute was a speck in the distance . There was beauty and grace as well as ' power in her flying . While Doolittle had been getting ready Captain Broad had been warming up the motor of his white and " blue Gloster . He did as little taxieing as possible , and when he got his starting bomb , opened wide hnd shot ovdr the line . There was the same ease and power of movement In the Gloster as in the American plane , and she left the water quickly , but despite the greater horsepower Of her motor she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lientenant George T. Cuddihy , flying one of the navy Curtiss racers , flew far back of the line , . and when he came out to start was so far that he was forced to taxi for more than a mile . He was followed by Lieutenant Ralph A. Ofstie , flying the other navy plane , and then ' cattle Lieutenant Giovanni de Brigand , in the Macchi-Curtiss monoplane .. This plane was to have been flown by Lieu , tenant Riccardo Morselli , but at tile last moment . Brigand 's plane developed magneto trouble and he took Morselli 's . The Italian Craft had barely got started when a tiny speck ? out over the water could be seen , flying low and with great speed to the home pylon at one side of the pier . It was Doolittle , streaking his way through the air at 223 miles an hour . Just before he reached the pylon he bahkee sharply , holding his machine far on her sjde and , keeping her in tightly to the course . His , . was ' holm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he got around he held her on her side until he had almost reached the pier , so that her ailerons would not drag and prevent him from recovering the speed he lost in banking . When those on the end of the pier were able to duck the black thunderbolt that was being hurled at them , ' Doolittle slowly straightened his plane up to a level position and gave her a slight lift to increase his margin of safety In clearing the pier , but he came so close that those beldw him had the thrill of their lives and got some idea of what a specel of 223 miles an hour means . The aide approached as fast as the eye could follow , and when it reached a point about fifty feet away all details of it were lost . It was just a black shape crashing by and vanishing . the sound of it hitting the ear almost es a blow . Doolittle 's Speed Increases . By the time the race was half over it was seen that Doolittle Was running away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour to 228 , 230 , 231 and then 232 . His motor was running with an even song that did not seem loud until it went by 30 feet away . As he came by the pier on his last lap , having . flown faster than at any other time , he pulled back on his stick and sent the little craft zooming almost straight oil , her momentum carrying-her to 2.000 feet in a few seconds . Doolittle circled around and came down in a long glide that , landed him far out in the bay . He turned and taxied back in a shower of spray . When he got nearly into the pier he shut off his motor and climbed down on a pontoon . A rope was thrown to him and made fast to the plane and it was towed toward the pier . There Was a burst of cheering ' when Doolittlegot near enough to hear , and the boovish looking pilot , with a smile took off his leather cap and bowed somewhat shyly . Major Gen. Mason M. Patrick , head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pier with some staff officers , smiling broadly and waving his clasped bands in congratulations . " I am very glad , naturally , at the result . " said General Patrick " He flew a good race and got the utmost out of his machine . " " I simply had the fastest machine , " bald Doolittle in talking of his victory . " I passed one of our machines on the stretch and could see that I was pulling ahead easily . The machine handled perfectly and the motor-was in good shape . The other fellows had tough luck . " But for all DoolittIe 's modesty , there was no doubt among other fliers that much of his speed was ? due to thee way in which he took his curves . Captain Broad in the English machine flew a steady , consistent race , but despite his 700-horsepower motor his speed never quite reached 200 miles an hour . His speed on the first lap was 194,275 and the averages rose after that to 198 , 198 and 190.16 for the entire course . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ( 14 mike an hour and the last at 168.44 . The two American planes which were forced down rose from 207 and 211 to 218 and 220 miles an hour . When the difference in speed due to putting pontoons on a plane is considered , Lieutenant Doolittle 's Speed Is just as good if not better than that of Lieutenant Cyrus Bettis in the Pulitzer race . who flew the same racer at a Speed of 249.9 ? miles an hour . It is estimated that pontoons take at least twenty miles an'hour from a plane . It Is difficult to make an accurate comparison , however , because of different conditions .
