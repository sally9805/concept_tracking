s there hope now for a new party ? This question has come to us in many letters , for the political interest and excitement engendered by the campaign are persisting in an unusual degree . Emphatically we believe that there is hope for a new party . Despite the huge popular vote rolled up by the Democrats their party is moribund . We are well aware that Franklin D. Roosevelt and Governor Smith have referred to the fourteen or more million votes as proof of the vitality of their organization . But a party may register many votes , yet still be near dissolution and still deserve dissolution . The Democratic high tide of votes in 1928 was not due to party principles , for these it deliberately threw away . Nor was it in response to any thrilling new  --  or old  --  social or international program , for no such program was presented . It is largely to be explained by resentment at the way in which Governor Smith was persecuted for his origin , his religion , his political associations , and his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage and charm of the man himself , to his picturesqueness , his ability , and such liberalism as he voiced . That can not , however , conceal the fact that his party is bankrupt as to ideas , has na single principle left to differentiate it from the Republican Party which it strove to emulate in every way possible . But that leaves millions unsatisfied . Opposed to the Republican Party , they can not embrace the Democratic now that it insists that it , too , stands for Big Business , for high tariffs , for the gospel of all-controlling prosperity , for the curtailment of immigration , far a big navy , and has forgotten all about the Wilsonian doctrines of 1912 . So deep is this feeling that we are convinced that one able , brave , and earnest leader , with a liberal program , could rouse the country . There is no such leader in sight  --  nor likely to be . Again , if there were a single compelling moral issue , a new party would arise as quickly as did the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplicity of evils and no generally accepted solution . If one adds to the lack of a leader , and of an all-compelling issue , the blindly reactionary policies of the American Federation of Labor , and its refusal to enter politics as a labor force , and the notably individualist character of the American dissenter , it would seem on its face as if the situation were hopeless for those who desire a warless world and a new order in which there shall be adequate social control of private profit . We can not wholly blame those who see no use in moving until some new leader appears , or the prosperity spell has lost its hold . But for us the possibility of an immediate beginning is present . We can not forget that nearly five million votes were cast for Mr. La Follette and his progressive platform only four years ago . We are deeply impressed by the growth of liberal forums and clubs , by the spontaneous action of readers of The Nation in voluntarily banding themselves together in a number of cities  --  without any suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves the issues for which The Nation stands . We meet , moreover , many men and women who see at last that economic conditions and needs compel a progressive political organization . We venture , to prophesy that there is not a hamlet in this countrywithout a few persons in revolt against the existing eco nomic and political order . Finally , there was the election itself to encourage us . Never before was there such a breaking of party ties , such splitting of ballots  --  of which the election of a . Democratic Governor of New York is one instance , and the amazing defeat of the Crowe gang in Chicago another . Multitudes were ready to distinguish ; ready to vote for an issue , but also to weigh the merits of individual candidates , and to vote with no regard for party labels . How else could Senator Shipstead have been reelected without any party ? The omens , therefore , seem favorable . But what can be done now without a leader or a party name , without funds or a single compelling appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin is to begin ; the way to organize is to organize ; the way to fight is to fight ; locally now wherever the opportunity offers . There are progressives enough powerfully to affect Congress and to influence the election of 1932 if they could only come together . They do not know one another  --  often not in their own towns  --  partly because of the reign of reaction since the war , partly because there has been no common ground of association . An organization to serve as a liaison office ; to list the innumerable existing civic and national organizations vitally interested in political and economic reforms ; to register the names of individuals in every State who are ready for a change ; to encourage political and economic study and action and to inspire it wherever possible ; to inquire into the best methods of diffusing progressive thought ; to draft slowly and with care a simple platform-that is the great need of the hour . This , we believe , will be the best way to begin the founding of a new liberal party with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanitarian , and international point of view , and their tenacious organization , will be able to affiliate . We are aware that it is a new technique for this country which we are suggesting . New parties have usually arisen out of a temporary economic stress , or because of a vibrant personality like that of Mr. Roosevelt . To build from underneath is , however , the democratic way . The Republicans did so , and did not know their Lincoln until their machinery was ready to his hand . Today it may seem like essaying the incredible . Not to us . If the work is honestly and ably done it will count . Even if it leads to no party organization , it will be worth while if it merely enables liberals to know one another and stimulates political thinking in the country which today does less sound political thinking than any other important one . We believe that thousands upon thousands of key men and women will rally to the organization as soon as the news reaches them , and that money can be found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of drift and compromise , or of marking time to see if the Democratic Party can be liberalized , when , as we have so often shown , it is without coherence , or unity , or principle , composed of utterly dissimilar elements . Not if the controlling idea is a certain success in 1932 . But if there should be courage , outspokenness , daring , and radicalism  --  in the English sense of the word  --  there will , we are certain , be an immediate and unequivocal response . Stop the Cruiser Bill ! Bothersome Colonies N . sane person wants war between the United States and Great Britain , but we are moving in that direc- tion at a dizzy pace . At Washington the militarists are using our national miseducation on preparedness to jam through Congress the fifteen-cruiser bill . They are telling our befuddled Congressmen that the failure of the Disarmament Conference leaves only one answer to the British menace , the answer of the biggest navy in the world . Some of them are not content even with this answer ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough to whip both Great Britain and Japan combined . Such chauvinism always finds its echo in the opposing nation . When the British quote Liberty the Americans quote Dean Inge , who let slip an unguarded remark about the possibility of Europe uniting to pull the American Shylock 's teeth . If the process goes on , the United States and Great Britain will present the spectacle of two angry boys , each with a large stone in his hand , shouting cheap threats at each other and growling : " Put down that rock or I 'll hit you in the eye . " In the midst of this puerile snarling of militarist bullies and professional patriots where does our Government stand ? President Coolidge in his Armistice Day address deliberately fed the flames of national prejudice and fear . His words brought such a storm of protest from all parts of the country that in his message to Congress he stressed the fact that we were building new cruisers chiefly for replacement and renewal . " This country , " he said , " is neither militaristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not precipitous in his demand for more military power , he included in his message a recommendation for eliminating the time clause in the cruiser bill . The bill originally called for the construction of five cruisers in 1929 , five in 1930 , and five in 1931 . But the ' President suggested that these time clauses be omitted and that the cruisers be built when the Executive deemed it necessary . This policy can have only one meaning . Mr. Coolidge does not want new cruisers , but he wants new threats to use in the diplomatic game of frightening Great Britain into a naval agreement that will be more favorable to the United States . What a jumble of fevered patriotism and political feebleness this policy is ! Either we need new cruisers or we do not . The President by waiving the time clauses in the cruiser bill virtually admits that there is no immediate need of the cruisers . As everyone knows , their ultimate purpose is not so much to defend America as to prey upon Britain 's trade routes in case of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counter-threats , that , indeed , they are primary causes of war . We can not frighten Britain into disarmament by a military bluff any more than Britain can stop American expansion by a bluff . If we have no immediate need of these fifteen cruisers we should say so , and frankly tell Great Britain that we do not propose to enter into a naval race . The effect of such a declaration upon British public opinion would be electric . The little group of progressives in Congress who are fighting the cruiser bill deserve the hearty support of every citizen . The Nation urges its readers to send appropriate telegrams and letters to their representatives at once . T HERE was a paragraph in President Coolidge 's Armistice Day speech which passed almost unnoticed - in the United States but has raised a tumult of discussion in our overseas empire . " Our outlying possessions , with the exception of the Panama Canal Zone , are not a help to us but a hindrance , " said Mr. Coolidge . " We hold them not as a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused much talk and some resentment in the regions alluded to , especially as some of them have been chastised by nature recently as well as by the President . A typhoon has lately caused large loss of life in the Philippines , while the Virgin Islands and Porto Rico were pitilessly battered by the hurricane of last autumn . Rothschild Francis 's Emancipator of St. Thomas admits sadly that the President 's profit-and-loss statement is true in regard to the Virgin Islands , but adds that " if Denmark had known the value of money she certainly could have got at the time of sale $175,000,000 or even $250,000,000 for this particular outlying possession . We paid $25,000,000 . It is too late now as this is peace time and talk is cheap . " In this country there may be a slight shiver at hearing our colonies discussed from quite such a bookkeeping standpoint as that of Mr. Coolidge , but his words throw a cold light on the whole subject of empire which may be quoted usefully against the policies of his own Administration . If our outlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindrance , " we wonder how Mr. Coolidge explains the passion of the State Department for the practical annexation of Haiti and Nicaragua . In any event , if we have a duty toward our outlying possessions , now is certainly the time to recognize it . The Virgin Islands have been consistently neglected since we acquired them a decade ago , and are still under the " temporary " ( and highly unsatisfactory ) government then set up . But Porto Rico needs our even more immediate attention , as it was the spot hardest hit in the recent West Indian hurricane . A recent survey shows that the island sustained damage to the extent of $85,000,000 besides the heavy toll of human life . The Red Cross has assisted in supplying food and in rebuilding 50,000 houses , but has no funds for the rehabilitation of agriculture . The coffee industry is in the worst plight , and it is to be hoped that Congress will accede to the plea to make a loan for its revival . This industry is the only considerable one in the island still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living conditions of the workers are pitiable , it would be too bad if this remnant of . independent agriculture were allowed to perish . As it will take five years to bring new coffee trees into bearing , and as most of the growers are without capital , it is obvious that they will have to have more or less assistance until they can sell their first crop . Harwood Hull 's Porto Rico Progress takes the wise stand that this is the moment to take a broad survey of the island 's problems as a whole , and act accordingly , instead of merely dealing out temporary doles here and there . It recalls another part of the Armistice Day speech in which Mr. Coolidge said : " We intend to preserve our high standards of living " and declared that " we should like to see all other countries on the same level . " The newspaper then asks : If the United States holds Porto Rico as a duty , as the President says , what is the duty of the United States to her fellow-American citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high ? standards of living in the United States and how badly does he want those standards attained and maintained in Porto Rico ? Millions of money may be appropriated for Porto Rico with scarcely more effort than that required to make the President 's speech . If appropriated every cent will be wasted , and worse than wasted , unless basic facts and conditions are studied and understood and a broad general plan developed for the physical , social , and economic rehabilitation of the largest group of American citizens anywhere outside of continental United States ; rehabilitation required not because of a chance hurricane , but because of generations of malnutrition , disease , ignorance , and neglect . Though he did not know it when he made his speech , this is the " duty " of the United States to Porto Rico to which the President referred . The position is well taken . The situation in Porto Rico is critical , But it is only a little more critical because of the hurricane than it has been during all the thirty years of our occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed and too little to put into them . The density of population is ten times that of the average for our continental United States , and yet agriculture is  --  and seems destined long to remain  --  the one great source of subsistence . The food of the workers is miserably inadequate , and anemia is widespread , due to hookworm and malnutrition . The Porto Rico Chamber of Commerce estimates that at the present time unemployment ? extends to 60 per cent of the workers , but this is not greatly beyond the normal , which is always appalling . Porto Rico Progress is right . If we pretend a duty to the island , then there is an immediate call for a searching survey and an honest , intelligent effort at a remedy . The Spectator T HE London Spectator has just passed its hundredth birthday , an event appropriately celebrated by a commemorative issue of the magazine and by the publication in book form of a history of its career. * A good quarter of a century older than its conservative rival , the Saturday Review , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moderate , or rather conservatively tinged , English liberalism , and all signs point to a future no less bright than its past . On this anniversary we extend to the Spectator our heartiest congratulations , with best wishes to the editor , John Evelyn Wrench . Probably no other magazine of equal age has maintained so completely continuous a tradition or , in general ; , undergone so few vicissitudes . Times change and opinions change with them , but the Spectator 's position in relation to the problems of any particular period has remained almost the same during a century , and it has survived not merely as a name but as a personality also . Doubtless this continuity has been more easily maintained as a result of the fact that from 1828 until 1925 it underwent only two significant changes of ownership . Founded by a rather shadowy Scottish journalist named Rintoul , who remained its editor and proprietor until 1858 and established its ten- dency , it passed ( after a brief interregnum ) into the hands of Meredith Townsend and R. H. Hutton , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strachey assumed control . In all three cases proprietor and editor were . one , and as each editor relinquished it he handed it on , not as a mere property to be sold in the open market but to a successor who would regard it as a permanent institution , It so happened , moreover , that under each regime the magazine found itself called upon to take an active part in molding public opinion concerning a particular group of related issues . Rintoul passionately championed the cause of the Reform Bill and fought for . the repeal of the Corn Laws . Townsend and Hutton espoused the cause of the North in the American Civil War and played a considerable part in the efforts to effect the change of attitude brought about in England . Mr. Strachey was faced with the responsibility of determining the policy of the magazine in respect to the World War . Perhaps Mr. Strachey 's regime was the most conservative which the paper had known , and The Nation , of course , is not inclined to regard his militant patriotism and his imperialistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mr. Strachey himself defined the position of the Spectator as being that of the " left center , " and the description is accurate when applied to the whole of ? its historic policy , even though the earlier editors may have been further to the left than he . In general the Spectator has supported the most important reform measures as they have appeared , but it has always very carefully guarded itself against any possible charge of what would have been called " jacobinism " in its early days and is called " dangerous radicalism " now . Increasing age inevitably gives to any institution an increasing air of respectability , and irreverent members of more than one younger generation have sometimes been inclined to consider the Spectator , in spite of its liberal principles , as primarily an organ of solid bourgeois opinion . Stevenson 's reference to it as his " grandmother " supplied a nickname which stuck , but on the whole the charge of " grandmotherliness " could be more easily sustained by judicious quotation from the literary columns published during its past than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , as the author of a summary in the centenary issue admits , " for a hundred years the Spectator was surprisingly the same in its literary outlook ; very quick to recognize solid achievement , a little slower to praise talent that came with a disruptive and unusual vigor . " In its earliest days it divided its intensest admiration between two established figures , Scott and Byron , and a little later it published articles by Carlyle and Swinburne , but it was somewhat querulous in its reception of Tennyson , Browning , and Meredith , while it was uncompromising in its criticism of various other men who have since been everywhere accepted . Of " Wuthering Heights " it said that " the persons and incidents are too coarse to be attractive , " and upon the dogmatic Matthew Arnold it expressed the strange judgment that he was , as a critic , " too tentative , and too insecure . " Campbell has " of all the bards of the present century . . . the surest chance of becoming the poet of posterity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been written under the influence of can sucre and Whitman " delights to dance naked and to chant indecent platitudes in prose run mad . " Obviously the Spectator ' , as not good at literary prophecy ; blit in all fairness it must be admitted that few magazines ever have been .
