txt 8o flrt and Education satisfying , such plastic forms remain comparatively meagre and correspondingly deficient in reality . In general , if there were no depth , there could be no solidity , no rendering of planes one behind the other , as they exist in the world as we know it . It is obvious that to render the depth and solidity of objects , the illusion of deep space must be created by plastic means . In flat painting , in which objects can have only two dimensions , they can have no depth , cast no shadows , can not bulge or recede , and can not be felt to be solid . Color remains superficial , sequence of line is chiefly mere pattern , light is divorced from pattern and can play no role except to modify the quality of color , and composition is reduced to arrangement of objects above and below , to right and to left . But when deep space is conceived , color , line , composition and design are endowed with new possibilities of individual and interrelated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create new and more complex plastic forms that move us by a multitude of realities not possible in merely flat painting . Plastic form and reality go hand in hand ? that is , an attenuation of means results in a form which leaves out of account much of the actual quality of things which in art , as in the real world , moves us so deeply . When a painter uses any of the plastic means inadequately , the fullness , the richness of his work , suffers to the extent of his lapse , for it is a characteristic of good art that it gives a reality more convincing , more penetrating , more satisfying than actual objects or situations themselves give . While it is true that painting which portrays spatial depth is , in general , richer in plastic values than painting which approaches flatness , it is not true that mere depth or solidity of objects is the factor which deterPlastic Form 8 1 mines the relative worth of such paintings . It is possible to get an effect of depth and solidity by tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimension becomes mere virtuosity ; instead of reality we get a specious unreality , more unreal than a frank two-dimensional pattern . Spatia-depth and solidity of objects have aesthetic value only when they are achieved by plastic means harmoniously coordinated with the other plastic elements ; that is , when they function as elements in a unified design . Therefore , it is obviously absurd to judge the relative merits of two painters upon the success with which they render , the illusion of a solid figure extending into deep space . For example , a figure by Renoir has not , generally , the solidity of a figure by Cezanne ; such a figure would not enter harmoniously into the plastic form , the lighter , more delicate general design of the Renoir ; Cezanne 's design conveys the effect of austerity and power , and anything but a solid figure would be a disturbing factor . In short , spatial depth and solidity are not to be judged by any absolute standard but only by their contribution to a unified plastic form . The merits of relatively flat painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be compared only when we observe how the artist has used color and light . One often sees paintings where color is merely laid on the surface like a cosmetic ; it has the quality of tinsel , of something added after the object has been constructed . Instead of increased reality we get an effect of falsity , of unreality , and the painting lacks organic unity . Color is usually not a property merely of the surface of objects as we perceive them in the real world . The gray of a stone seems to spring from its depth , to go down to the body of the stone ; we see it as a solid object and as // a gray object ; the color is perceived as part of the structure of the stone , not as something laid on . In painting , the failure to include color in form reduces the degree of conviction carried by form , and makes the total effect relatively cheap , tawdry , unreal . Not less important than color , in attaining a convincing and real three-dimensional character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is two-dimensional , light functions through modification of hue or tint so that the shade of a color is partly determined by the light that falls upon it . In three-dimensional representation , solidity of an object is achieved by having the most light fall upon the point nearest to the source , from which there is a continuous gradation to deepest shadow . The swells and hollows are portrayed by means of the rise and fall of illumination . In other words , solidity is rendered by color and light correlated , and that correlation constitutes the modeling of forms . But it is obvious that this correlation makes possible another aesthetic effect : such use of color and light that they may each form independent and separate rhythmic patterns which in turn form rhythms with the other plastic elements . For example , in Bellini 's " Allegory of Purgatory " the pattern made up of the light and shadow placed in various parts of the canvas , is one of the principal components of the plastic form : it is totally independent of the function of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , in Titian 's " Man with the Glove , " the pattern formed by the light used to render the solidity of various parts of the head and hands , does much to organize the picture . In general terms , the artist has used a particular plastic means to portray the essence , the reality , of the subject and also to enrich and vivify as well as unify the design . // The plastic element which determines the character of three-dimensional painting is deep space and this is achieved by the use of perspective . It need not be literal perspective as we perceive it in the real world : it must be used plastically , that is , changed or adapted by the artist to particular needs . Perspective conjoined with the modeling makes possible what is termed " space composition . " This is something over and above the third dimension achieved by the utilization of line , color , light and perspective to make an object appear solid . It is different from " composition , " as that word is ordinarily employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting . Space-composition is such an arrangement of things in the depth of space that the intervals ; back and forward as well as up and down and to right and left , are felt to have a pleasing relation to each other . We feel the intervals not primarily as three-dimensional qualies , as we do in perceiving solid objects , but as the ace itself which surrounds those objects . Spacecomposition moves us aesthetically when each object Is so placed in its particular position that we perceive the space around the object in a definite relation to the ? ace around each of the other objects , and that all these spaces are unified , that is , composed . If there arc no objects there could be no space between them ; cc space-composition involves both the objects and e intervals of space . It is the sequence of objects d spaces so ordered that they form a pattern which perceive as a thing in itself . Space-composition is rssful when it enters into relation with the other stic elements to give a plastic form which functions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so successful in suggesting planes receding , ancing and interacting with each other , that the // whole series of spatial intervals between objects , as well as the objects themselves , interests or charms us . Space-composition contributes enormously to the reality of total effect , since in our commerce with the real world we not only see objects but move among them . ' We live in a world of space and we see objects in relation to remoter objects : a tree with a wall beyond it , a house against a background of hill or forest . Our mind is filled with these forms . ' When an artist enriches them with his deeper perceptions and feelings , and moulds them into designs richer than our unaided powers could construct , we share his larger vision and deeper emotions . We have seen that plastic form is satisfactory when there exists an integration , a balance of its factors , that is , when they unify . As one progresses in the study of plastic art , a great variety of falls from plastic unity reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subject , to see it in its concrete fullness and with an eye to all its relations , or one with an insufficient command over all the plastic means , produces but an inadequate substitute for a unified painting . He may single out for emphasis some one feature and slight the others , treating them sketchily , perfunctorily or conventionally . When this happens , we have what is termed formula painting , or academicism , and while often the parts treated are done very skillfully , the skill is mere virtuosity : the painter , no matter how adroit , is not genuinely an artist . Line , or light , or modeling , or perspective , or the relations with surrounding objects that enter into space-composition  - -  any one of these may be accentuated to the point of submerging the other aspects of the object or situation . When this occurs proper integration of the various // plastic means is not achieved and the result is comparative unreality . Intelligence guides us to reject as uninteresting what we find unreal : we can not accept as real what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its aspects , in its concrete fullness . This principle , so true in real life , is equally true in all the forms of art . For example , in poetry , Swinburne 's spontaneity , variety and subtlety of rhythm produce an exceedingly brilliant effect . But the flow and surge of his verse is soon seen to conceal an inner emptiness ; mere rhythm is made to serve for the imaginative grasp of the subject that should vary both the ideas and their expression by all the poetic means . This constant repetition of rhythm without other poetic content becomes mere virtuosity . Verbal magic destitute of meaning constitutes unreality . In music , Berlioz and Liszt have a great cornand of orchestration , but their themes are almost nvariably commonplace and conventional , their ideas arc thin , and the orchestral dressing fails to conceal the essential triviality . Here again one factor is given an exaggerated role to cover up a lack of real substance , and the effect is one of showiness or melodrama , of unreality . The conception of plastic form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in this book as the standard and criterion of value in painting , and hence all the alyses and judgments that follow will be an illustran of its meaning . To clarify what is meant by tegration of plastic means we may anticipate the later mission and consider Raphael as a striking example Of inadequate plastic form . Raphael has often been looked upon as one of the greatest of all painters . He was undoubtedly a master of his medium and possessed // extraordinary ability to put down what he had in mind . He had a great command over line , his ability to use light to indicate contour and to make a pattern was of a high order , and in space-composition his gifts were unsurpassed . But these accomplishments were largely borrowed , his line and light from Leonardo , his spacecomposition from Perugino . His color is superficial and undistinguished in quality ; it is thin , dull , sometimes garish , and it seems rather an after-thought in the design . His composition is almost invariably conventional ; it has not the freshness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Giotto , so that for all the spaciousness and airiness of his pictures we never get the impression of a really original and powerful imagination at work . His borrowings he has made in some measure his own ; but they are not sufficiently changed to indicate that they are really a creation of a strong personality and a distinct mind . His subjectmatter lacks originality and is generally so sweet and soft that one feels that he saw things sentimentally and that they produced in him commonplace and rather trivial emotions . In other words , he had no vigorous personality to serve as the crucible in which the qualities of things should be fused and welded into a new form . The result is that his particular means remained disjoined from his conceptions as a whole , and his light , line , and space-composition stand out as isolated devices , as exploits of virtuosity . He did achieve a form of his own , and his great technical skill enabled him to attain marvellous results , but the efforts are often specious and the effects tawdry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to he mere tricks or mechanical stunts , we may examine the picture by Guido Reni entitled " Dejaneira . " We find almost nothing expressive of // the painter 's individual grasp of the subject , and correspondingly there is no real synthesis of the plastic means employed . The pattern and composition are effective , but these are taken directly from Raphael and executed less competently . The impression of movement is rendered skillfully , but it is so much overdone that it suggests histrionics rather than art . The color is without charm or originality , and is simply laid upon the surface . It is so little integrated in the plastic form that another set of colors might be substituted with no damage to the total effect of the picture . What we have is a mere assemblage of devices without inner coherence and contributing to an effect that is conventional , strained , and exceedingly tawdry . The recognition of the balance or integration of plastic means which constitutes plastic form comes only from experience in looking at many kinds of painting . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which variety and brilliance of color , elaboration of grouping , rhythm of line , etc. , must be present , and then say that if any of these factors fall below ouch a point , there is overemphasis on the other factors . Colorists such as Rubens and Renoir can not be accused of overaccentuation of color because they realized other aspects of the world in plastic terms equally strong , so that it is clear that they did not conceive Krlusively in terms of color . In the work of both of these painters we see significant line , movement , composition , effective spacing , both on the surface and in the third dimension . Color serves not as the only source of effect , but as an organizing principle . Renoir 's drawing , for example , is done in terms of color , and though the incisive line characteristic of Raphael or Leonardo is absent , the effects to which line contributes ? movement , fluidity and rhythm ? are // rendered with great success . Although the kind and degree of solidity which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Renoir 's figures , they do not seem vaporous or unreal . They have substance , mass , actuality , though not in the same manner and degree as do the figures in the work of painters whose primary purpose was different . The way in which emphasis of one of the plastic means may be united with subsidiary but sufficient realization of the others is further illustrated in Rembrandt . He employed chiaroscuro , that is , a bright area surrounded by darkness : light surrounded by heavy shadow serves as the point of departure in most of his pictures . He avoids overemphasis of his special means by making the tones in connection with light function as color more powerfully than any colors of Leonardo or Raphael . In the portrait of " Hendrickje Stoffels " ( in the Louvre ) and in that of " The Old Man " ( in the Uffizi ) , minute variations in the goldenbrown light give a richer , more glowing and actually more varied effect than all the colors of the spectrum used by a lesser artist . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright color the effect is one of marvellous depth , richness and fire . This same combination of economy of means and great effectiveness is to be found also in his line and composition . In space-composition , for example , the use of chiaroscuro narrowly circumscribes the space at the painter 's disposal , yet in the " Unmerciful Servant " the effect of roominess achieved is comparable to the fine spatial effects of Perugino or Poussin . In general terms we may say that in painting , as in all other forms of art , whatever quality is selected as setting the dominant note must be ballasted and made real by being shown in a context of other qualities , and // w hen this is not done the effect becomes conventional , cheap , tawdry , unconvincing , and unreal . The " reality " which we consider to be the essence of art-value in painting may be illustrated by reference to the subject-matter portrayed by the French painters , David and Delacroix . In David , there is constant recourse to stage-settings , poses , themes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byronic themes , there is a similar indication that the world in which we actually live is beneath the artist 's serious attention . In both cases we are conscious of an artificial or theatrical quality , and this conviction that the painters are playing a game or acting a part is not affected by the fact that the histrionics were doubtless free from deliberate insincerity . What they portray of poignancy , pathos , tragedy , significance , existed in the world about them . If they did not find them there , we are justified in concluding that they did not know what they are , and that their portrayal of them is essentially a caricature , a set of figments out of daydreams. ' 1'liis condemnation of " classicism " or " romanticism " is not based upon literary considerations , but upon Fantic ones : antiquarianism or sentimentalism betrays taelf in limited and unoriginal command of plastic means . The painter does not really draw inspiration for his art out of his own personal experience but deends upon other painters for the methods by which ii pictorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather coldness , is due to a line which he took turn Raphael and Mantegna and they took it from cient sculpture . It is not something which the artist tually saw as a part of a personal and coherent view real things , but a studio-device to which the qualiea of color , mass , and space were added as an after90 Art and Education thought . These qualities do not really fuse with the line to produce an impression of reality , but remain adventitious , just as the " noble " or " distinguished " figures and situations painted remain strangers and phantoms in the world in which we actually live . The same is true of Delacroix . The stormy emotion , the exaggerated gesture and violent drama , are almost as spectrally unreal as David 's " nobility , " and they mean the same inability to see the actual world about him . Delacroix does not seem so artificial either in subject-matter or in plastic quality as David , because romanticism was for him less a pose than classicism was for his predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he took from others . His color represents an advance over Constable 's or Rubens 's in that he showed a degree of originality in the methods he took from them . Consequently , he seems more real , and so more interesting and a greater artist , than David . We realize how essentially fantastic David and Delacroix were when we compare them with later painters . The concern with actually existing scenes , persons , and situations made of Courbet and his successors the legitimate successors of Velasquez and Goya , in making us see the objective qualities of things , divested of the subjectivism that constituted the romanticists ' exhibited world of self . To sympathy with Courbet 's insight we owe the great painters of 187o ? Manet , Monet , Degas , Sisley , Pissarro , Renoir , Cezanne ? and the imaginative telling of the story of life in a real world . Of that group , Renoir and Cezanne deal most objectively with the whole range of experience as men find it verified in themselves , free from the trifling , the insignificant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or personal vanity . Plastic Form 9 1 If one looks beneath the dissimilarity of techniques , Renoir and Cezanne are seen as close kin in dealing with the fundamental , universal attributes of people and things . Both treated the familiar , everyday events that make up our lives . We see , feel , touch the particular quality that gives an object its indi. vidual identity . Each of the painters created a world richer , fuller , more meaningful than that revealed to our own unaided perceptions . Each mirrors a world we know by having lived in it , so vividly that we get a sense of going through an actual experience . Both are great artists because they make art and life one by convincing us of the truth and reality of what they see and feel and express . Pattern and Plastic Form 1 By LAURENCE BUERMEYER IN Mr. Clive Bell 's book , Art , published in 1914 , is expressed a conviction and a standard widely influential in contemporary art-criticism . The burden of Mr. Bell 's contention , that the distinguishing excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its subjectmatter but that it depends on what he calls " significant form , " an independent and specifically aesthetic relation between the elements of the work of art , is not original with him . It is clearly foreshadowed in Pater 's assertion that art at all times strives towards the condition of music , in which the appeal to emotion is made without any recourse to images of real things . For this view Pater himself never claimed any essential originality : he regarded it as a simple generalization from the work of the school of Giorgione . So far as the effect of Mr. Bell 's book was limited to driving home to the popular consciousness the truth that a picture is not good because it resembles its original , points a moral or tells an entertaining story , he was to be commended for a real service to the cause of education . The same thing may be said of his work of undermining the saccharine tradition which goes back to Raphael . Since the views against which he contended were overwhelmingly dominant in the popular consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . Unfortunately , however , he did not content himself // with exposing the more flagrant errors of popular aesthetics , but offered an aesthetic theory of his own , as far removed from the truth as were the views which he attacked . Starting with the premise , unexceptionable in itself however little original , that a picture is not necessarily good because it mirrors accurately some real thing , he draws the conclusion , which does not in the least follow , that the goodness of a picture is totally and absolutely independent of its relation to any real thing . The only alternatives which he contemplates , in other words , are slavish imitation and wholly abstract or non-representative art . It is the contention of the present paper that this sharp disnction leads to a reduction of " significant form " to what may better be termed " pattern , " that it makes decorative design as we find that in rugs or in wall'per the ideal of all plastic art , and that " significant form , " as Mr. Bell understands the word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meaningless " form . A picture , Mr. Bell says , is good if it possesses significant form . " We should naturally expect such a atement to be followed by a definition of this allportant quality . No such definition is ever even attempted . Instead we are told that " significant form " such an arrangement of the elements in any work of t as is productive of aesthetic emotion . When we what aesthetic emotion is ( a necessary question , cc according to Mr. Bell most of what passes for aesthetic emotion is mere sentiment ) , the answer is at it is the emotion which is produced by significant nu ! Of course , nothing is ever fully definable in tins of anything else ; definition in the end resolves If into mere pointing , an indication of some immediaete experience which must be had or felt if the defini94 Art and Education tion is to be intelligible ; but it is generally regarded as the mark of intelligence , and certainly of scientific analysis , to defer this recourse to the merely immediate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find words for ultimate realities , we are entitled to expect that relations , the things with which what is defined has affinities , be pointed out . We find nothing of the sort in Mr. Bell , so that " significant form " remains wholly esoteric and recondite . The lady who by her reiteration of the only too familiar refrain , " I do n't know anything about art , but I know what I like , " earned Whistler 's retort , " A quality , madam , which we share with the lower animals , " seems to have differed in this respect from Mr. Bell only by her superior modesty . Mr. Bell , it appears , knows what he likes and calls that and only that art . Admitting the value of Mr. Bell 's castigation of popular errors , it is indeed a question whether the good his book has accomplished among the aesthetically illiterate is not more than counterbalanced by the harm it has done among the discriminating . It is important that the specific which characterizes a work of art and distinguishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized and valued . This form , as it appears in painting , is perhaps better termed " plastic form " than " significant form " ; it does furnish the criterion of properly aesthetic quality ; but the manner of Mr. Bell 's advocacy of it , the obscurity in which he has shrouded it and the Olympian assurance with which he dogmatizes about it , have seriously compromised its recognition . Oracular mystification where clear definition is the first requisite , and display of unbounded certitude in the early stages of analysis , where everything ought to be tentative and hypothetical , are perfectly adapted to compromise any cause . // The source of Mr. Bell 's vagueness is not far to seek . It is due to the absolute divorce between form and subject-matter , to the repudiation not only of copying , but of every type or degree of interpretation . In opposition to Mr. Bell , we shall seek to show that plastic form is only relatively independent of subjectmatter , and that while subject-matter does not in any degree prescribe the detail of an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relatively , at least , x the conditions of success . When the clue which it hers is entirely discarded , when truth , imaginative or terpretafive as well as literal , is utterly banished rom art , the artist is reduced to playing with sensations , to devising patterns which have , to be sure , many elements of aesthetic appeal , but which are far from sufficient for great art . We shall attempt to show this in detail by examples the sort of criticism to which pure abstractionism ads . The general criticism , however , may be illustrated in music and literature as well as in painting . To condemn program-music , the bleating of the sheep and blowing of the wind in Strauss 's " Don Quixote , " is one thing ; to say that the best music is the most " pure , " the most destitute of any expression of human emotion , is a very different thing : it is to exalt Haydn above Beethoven . Similarly with literature . It is often said that aesthetically style counts and ideas do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of Milton is cited . The belief of these men in what Santtayana calls the Christian epic now finds little echo to most cultivated readers , but the value of their style , the greatness of their literary stature , no one denies . To say , however , that their ideas , the content of their poetry , are dead , is to forget how much of their work goes beyond any mere scheme of supernatural salva96 Art and Education tion , how much of it expresses human feeling and aspiration as they appear in realms wholly non-theological . To say that , because any particular idea becomes obsolete eventually , the permanent value of poetry can be achieved by someone who has no ideas but is concerned to make a deft arrangement of words , is utterly false , and it is the precise analogue of the view that great painting springs not from any vision of the world , but from a fondness for making decorative upholstery . The view of which Mr. Bell has been taken as the representative is thus the view , already combated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the museum , a separate compartment in life into which we can enter only by turning our back upon the rest of life . It is not necessary to debate further this persuasion or prejudice in its general form ; it may be useful , however , to point out the difference made by it in the practical procedure of education . If the view is true , then training in art , either in the appreciation or the execution of works of art , is a training in special tricks of the trade , devices or rules by which good patterns may be made and distinguished from bad . Specimens of such tricks , examples of such rules , are what we find in picturegalleries , to which accordingly the potential artist or connoisseur is directed to go for the acquisition of something as essentially abstract and specialized as skill in playing chess . The opposed view , here defended , is that what the picture-gallery offers is of course valuable , but that it is valuable as the means of seeing , through the paint and canvas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world as a mere matter of physics or chemistry or impersonal sensation , but the world seen by the individual // painter . The reply of Renoir to the questioner who asked him where one learned to paint , " Au musee , parbleu I " may be interpreted to mean what the patternmakers mean , or ? a very different matter ? that it is through the vision of others that the painter sharpens his own . ' Which interpretation is to be chosen , Renoir 's own practice makes abundantly clear . No modern painter , assuredly , combined a greater store of illumination derived from the traditions of the past with a fresher eye for the life about him , the unhackneyed , unstereotyped things of the contemporary scene . ( ) ur contention , in brief , is that the primary purpose of education in art is refinement and enrichment of the act of seeing , and that the plastic form which is not an expression of such seeing is trite , superficial or merely decorative . Mr. Bell is to a large extent responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative arrangement of line , color and mass , and the organization of those elements by which a convincing reality ( " convincing , " not " photographic " ) of an artist 's experience with an objective world is achieved . Imitating Mr. Bell 's objectionable ystification and dogmatism and throwing to the winds nearly every principle of psychology and logic , a host of writers have added other absurdities , in efforts to prove that art is something essentially separate from everyday experience . They thus lose the clue afforded imaginative interpretation of the reality of things andd fill in the resulting vacuum with elaborate definitions of pattern that extend from deification of platiitudcs , such as " significant form , " all the way to meanical formulas which are alleged to have a mathetical foundation and are baptized by the meaningless catchword " dynamic symmetry . " Each of these con-r // coctions is guaranteed to contain the secret of all great art . One of them offers a set or table of the elements of design , comparable to the table of chemical elements , and gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all " design " to an arrangement of lines and areas in two dimensions . Not a suspicion , apparently , occurs tha ' ) all such elements and relations are wholly relative to the particular purpose of the painter , to the aspect of reality of which he is giving his personal version , or that in great art the rules laid down are as often broken as they are obeyed . Rules of this sort are useful to anyone who has nothing of his own to say and who wishes to learn to repeat what someone else has already said . They are useful to the real artist or student in precisely the same way that crutches are useful to the athlete . What lends plausibility to the confusion of plastic form with pattern is the fact that a pattern , a decorative arrangement of superficial qualities , is usually if not always to be found in works of art . Decoration , in other words , is a quality of painting , and a valuable quality , if it is not made the be-all and end-all of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigidity , is not essential to the reduction of plastic form to pattern , so that the case for pattern is really stronger than many of its advocates make it out to be . Decorative arrangement of line and mass , however , at its best falls far short of the aesthetic rich-1 ness of truly expressive plastic form , and some illustration of this fact must be given if the true relation of the two is to be made apparent . In every great painter the presence of pattern can easily be demonstrated by an analysis of his pictures . In Giotto , for example , the rhythm and sequence of line , distribution of masses , and contrast and harmony // of color , have an immediate and obvious decorative effect , but the expression proper ( not of course merely facial expression but imaginative insight ) goes far beyond decoration . It resides in the restraint and dignity with which the figures are conceived , in the mystical quality conveyed largely by a pervasive , transfiguring color-glow and by a convincing spaciousness , attained by few and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things enter also into the pattern , hut it is in their service in revealing a world which only Motto was capable of seeing that their most moving aesthetic effect resides . This is true also of El Greco , whose mystical world is revealed no less convincingly than is Giotto 's , different as is its fervidness from the serenity of Giotto . For other examples we may take Rembrandt and Manet . In both , of course , the pattern is present . In Rembrandt it is formed largely by gradations of light , contrasts of light and shadow , by which colors usually dull in themselves are made to glow and display an extraordinary richness , and by which masses scarcely defined by linear contour are given body and reality , and are organized in space . The pattern in Rembrandt , however , is much less clear-cut , rhythmic and decorative than , for example , in Botticelli . Rembrandt 's enormous superiority over Botticelli is due to something quite apart from pattern ; it is due to his ability to make the play of light over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth the living human being who is portrayed . This is done by no mere emphasis of the ordinary signs of emotion , the facial gestures indicating pain , hope , sorrow or compassion , all of which depend upon more or less casual sociations of ideas . It is truly plastic , and yet much ore than decorative . It contains what plastic form loo Art and Education always , and decoration never , achieves : a grasp of the essential nature of a thing , the unique quality which makes the thing what it is , which is shared with nothing else in the world . Rembrandt 's painting of human hair , for example , is much slighter as decoration than Botticelli 's ; certainly it is equally far from photographic literalism ; but it is infinitely more moving , because it gives us , as Botticelli 's does not , an essential reality and not a superficial embellishment . In Manet this reality is primarily achieved by the use of broad brush-strokes which , omitting irrelevant detail , yet give the natural , essential quality of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are from those which engaged the attention of Giotto , El Greco , or Rembrandt , they are equally essential and distinctive . The critic whose eyes are closed to everything but pattern can see in these brush-strokes merely the elements in a particular type of decoration . This decorative aspect is indubitably there , it is an important part of the total effect , but to attach exclusive importance to it is as grave an error as to consider only the illustrative aspect of Manet 's work.3 Critics of the " advanced school " may be expected to reply to the foregoing contentions that they revert to the popular literary standard of plastic criticism . The difference between plastic form , as here conceived , and merely literary form must be pointed out . If in Giotto , ? or El Greco the effect , as above expounded , depended upon identification of the persons portrayed as Jesus , the Virgin , or the other figures of the Christian hierarchy , the charge would be justified . There would Pattern and Plastic Form lot then be reliance upon what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we actually see upon the canvas . The things would be labels , not realities . But in all the painters in question the illustration is given in good plastic terms . We see and feel the reality as the painter saw and felt it , and we need no extraneous associations to eke out what is actually presented . What is characteristic of merely literary painting is that the image set before us is trite and meaningless in itself , and that it derives its interest from the part played by the thing represented in practical life . In true plastic form , what is represented is significant not as an arbitrary symbol but as something of which the meaning is felt immediately , as an integral part of the actual image . The interpretation of plastic form as pattern involves a denial to the painter of all effects that involve more than mere sensation . According to it , the funded results of past experience can never be more than adventitious associations , irrelevant to pictorial design . It is evident that the ejection of the meanings upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferred and not actually perceived , can not stop short of such reduction to the bare immediate ; it is equally evident that such rejection seriously compromises some of the purely plastic effects which are to be found in the work of the greatest artists . Space-composition and modeling , for example , depend upon revived experience of movement and touch ; they are not directly given by paint on canvas ; and if all meaning is to go , they must go too . ' With them go all // rhythm and movement in deep space , and landscapepainting and figure-painting join portraiture in the limbo of the " merely literary . " These consequences are ordinarily found so repellent that only a few pamphleteers , special advocates , and purveyors of new aesthetic pills and powders are willing to accept them . But they may impose also upon critics of real discernment , such as Mr. Roger Fry . Mr. Fry 's knowledge and experience are extensive , and his integrity does not permit him to pronounce upon matters of legitimate doubt with the unlimited certainty usually characteristic either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shares , however , the conception of form set forth by Clive Bell , at least to the extent of assuming that form is not only relatively but absolutely independent of the qualities of what art represents . This assumption is fully in harmony with his view of imagination as radically and essentially disjoined from practical life ? the cardinal principle of what we have called the museum-theory of art . ' Continuity of Traditions in Painting 1 By VIOLLTTF DE MAZIA IF the history of the development of painting is expected to reveal a significance adequate to its subject , a mere narrative of successive art revolutions , of so-called artistic upheavals , becomes illogical , meaningless and altogether out of place . Art ? " a fragment of life presented to us enriched in feelings by means of the creative spirit of the artist " 2 ? enters into such close union with life , is so much a part of it , that an understanding of a genuine evolution of painting can be based only upon the very principle that governs life itself : today has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to painting , it expresses the idea that modern or contemporary art represents a logical denouement from the interplay of preceding traditional forms . This conception is the keystone that firmly supports the educational program of the Barnes Foundation and around which are gathered its collections of old and modern pictures , its French and Persian miniatures and its pieces of Egyptian , Chinese , Hindu , Greek , Negro and contemporary sculpture . The Foundation 's courses in art appreciation center upon a tracing of the essential continuity of art traditions . Its program is objectively carried out by demonstrations in I04 4rt and Education front of the particular works of art under discussion ; it is organized into a practical application of the psychological and scientific principles represented by the most modern methods of education . When it is said that modern painters resort to similar means ? selected and utilized in view of a same general purpose ? as those recognized in the paintings of the early Florentines and Venetians , of the Flemings , the Germans or the Spaniards , unless one qualifies the statement , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists make use of colored pigments to transform a uniform flat surface into a painting , where line , color and tone may combine into effects of space and volume , and result in more or less decorative and expressive forms . Aesthetic discernment discriminates between a mere painting and what constitutes a work of art . A piece of canvas covered with color becomes a product of art only in the case where the elements at the disposal of the painter are so brought into play that there results a communication from the artist to the spectator , a communication of his distinctive and personal conception of some actually lived or imagined experience . His means of expression are not borrowed from other spheres of life : literature , photography , morals , each aiming at a totally different result than that of pictorial art is not able to supply the necessary terms of the artist-painter 's language . The latter conveys his% message directly , i.e. , without appeal to outside intermediary agents such as sentimental , anecdotical , religious or historical data . Without recourse to such illicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ? color , line , light and space , with their innumerable , possible permutations and relations ? constitute his vocabulary . From this , it goes without Continuity of Traditions in Painting 1o5 saying that no method of art-study can be termed intelligent or adequate that does not deal directly with the pictorial elements . These are qualified " plastic " in the sense that they acquire different characteristics and appear under diverse aspects as changes are effected within their sets of relationships ; and " plastic form " is a resultant from the synthesis , the fusion of these elements into a unified ensemble in which is resolved , built up and expressed the artist 's vision , his reaction to some material or psychological situation of life . Plastic form is thus the medium by which he is able to reveal the qualities of human interest that have impressed and fired his imagination : the urge to express something personal about life and our world is the spark that sets his powers to creative work . To react to one 's environment means to be in tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values it contains . To have something to say and to embody one 's message in a form worthy of art , means to be able to steep it in the character of one 's personality : the echo of a song , the plagiarism of an idea , a warmed-up dish , are far from offering the distinctive appeal , the charm or the flavor of the original creation . The criterion of a painter 's worth in terms of individuality and propriety of the selected factors of expression , may justly be considered as a standard of appreciation , to the measure of which old or modern art should be submitted . Originality , though not an objective element in an isolated picture , can be sensed and its presence objectively demonstrated by a method of comparative study . An intelligent appreciation and a just understanding of Titian or Michel Angelo , for example , are not restricted to these artists ' work but expands into and is enriched by the recognition of their I o6 Art and Education forms as they were modified by men like Renoir and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bellini , Masaccio or Leonardo on the other . On this line of study , a similar aesthetic purpose , yet a different individual wording of it , is found in modern cubist pictures and in some of the Cologne Masters working in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries . Similarly , an appreciative enjoyment of El Greco or of primitive oriental art leads ? plastically speaking ? to an analogous appreciation of the contemporary artists , Picasso or Matisse . " Enjoying , " " liking " either the moderns or the old masters without the ability to see them as they stand in the scale of values , in relation to followers and predecessors , is to practice self-deception and to miss the all-important value of the artist 's intelligence , at work in his " purposive reorganization , through action , of the material of experience . " 3 The comparative-study method questions old and modern masters according to a same criticism of plastic form and directs our judgment toward the thread that links them together . Great artists of today such as Matisse , Picasso , Modigliani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of means intrinsic to painting and , taking their predecessors ' traditions as a foundation-stone , they erect upon it and mould a new form , a creation , not a replica , a form which has its raison dYtre , its intrinsic value , because it expresses in appropriate terms the interesting personality of the man and contributes an added link to the evolution of art , In like manner the perception of Giotto 's artistic greatness depends not upon the consideration of his religious subject-matter , but upon that of his plastic form ? a selected and definite organization of the elements into the vehicle most competent to convey the // profound human and universal qualities that had moved the painter . In Giotto 's time , in the days of the Italian Primitives , a great number of circumstances attaching to the development of general civilization were a stumbling-block to a clear demarcation between the interest of realizing a purely plastic form and that of illustrating some religious lesson or a narrative of historical events . The gradual freedom from imposed subject-matter and a more direct application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of the development of art from primitive to modern times . The fundamental continuity , however , which brings close together artists apparently so different as Soutine and El Greco , Cezanne and Tintoretto or Michel Angelo , exists independently of subject-matter values , and can be traced and followed back and forth through the particular organization of the plastic form . The definition of " plastic form " implies that its constituents ? color , line , light , space ? arc malleable elements under the artist 's brush . In other words , they arc susceptible of acquiring an aspect different from that to which we have become accustomed by our practical interest in our daily contact with Nature . Such distortion ? abstraction or emphasis ? when found to be intentionally applied to the representative form of objects or relations , is obvious proof of a purpose different than that of reproducing photographically the superficial , visual traits of our surrounding world . From Giotto to Soutine , departure from literal representation is aiming toward the achievement of the bestfitted receptacle for the artist 's aesthetic expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his individual experience . A picture is an argument : the artist lives , reacts , io8 Art and Education selects , expresses , and his work becomes the justification of his emotions . Is this sufficient ? The justification of someone 's emotions is not inevitably interesting , edifying or illuminating ; the educative process takes place , however , when , through following the presentation of the argument , a new view-point of our world is attained : this is naturally the place where the Old Masters ' contributions become particularly eloquent as a background upon which we may base our judgment of some later painter 's originality and worth in the hierarchy of art . Whatever the grade of creative work , former traditions never entirely disappear from it . They appear with more or less subtlety , minor or greater obviousness , according to the painter 's ability to grasp their significance in terms of plastic or merely technical values ; and no isolated study of either the work of one man or even of the whole tradition of his time can possibly reveal the clue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in painting . An assemblage of borrowed elements , deprived of any organic relation , characterizes the work of all servile followers , plagiarists without scruples , eclectics , such as exist from the Giottoesque painters through the Renaissance Carraccis , Albanis , Renis , etc. , down to the modern Derains or to the contemporary , superficial worshippers of Cezanne , Picasso or Matisse . A short account of the salient traits of the Florentine and Venetian traditions in relation to a few of their i persistent characteristics , as these are found in subsequent forms , may serve as one example upon which the study of genuine art appreciation is based . The form of the Florentine artists ? an outcome of Byzantine paintings and mosaics ? engrafts an ampler sense of reality upon the more decorative previous paintings , by means of a fuller content of plastic values . // The key to their richer aesthetic design lies in the relations between a more expressive linear drawing , a delicate , harmonious , though not very deep , color , a firmer modeling , a more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses and spaces . In contrast to this comparatively austere form , controlled by the exigencies of religious teachings , the Venetian picture , on the whole , displays a greater spontaneity of expression , a naturalness due to the interest in the actual world , liberated from the yoke of ancient compulsions or necessities . Color acquires more power , fills a greater number of plastic functions and becomes through these the dominating feature of the Venetian school and its chief contribution to painting . The pigments remain no more as surface coloration between lines of contour ? as they were , relatively so , in the Florentines ? color appears to filter in , to penetrate into the matter of the object so as to become its truly constructive element . The Venetians draw with color ; in other words , all the plastic elements ? line , light , space , composition , movement , rhythm , etc. ? are translated in terms of that clement and organize into a form , which , on this account , reaches the highest level of art in painting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination that there results the Offect of an enveloping atmosphere which fills the spatial intervals with a colored light and reinforces the aesthetic contribution of the Florentines with an added sense of reality and a profusion of expressive and decorative . values . Besides directly influencing their French , Flemish and German contemporaries , for whom the Italian tradition was a starting point upon which to evolve their own characteristic art movements , both the Florentine and Venetian forms are the backbone of whatever // painting was produced in Europe after their time . The origin of the greater part of the characteristics constituting the value of modern art can be traced back to Giotto 's work . His form , gradually modified by later Florentine and Venetian contributions , is still clearly reflected in Poussin 's expression ? a delicacy adequately adjusted to a force of conviction ? and through Poussin , Giotto extends his dominion throughout the entire French school . French art , however , is not that of Florence , neither is it that of Venice : it is a resultant and represents French creative individualities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution of methods , the original source of which lies in some of the Fifteenth Century Italian painting : Masaccio , before 1428 , made use of aerial perspective . By means of definite relations of color to light and to a linear drawing , modified into terms of perspective by which objects further away in the field of vision lose precision of contour , Masaccio bathed his compositions in a translucid haze , a veil of colored light . This actually visible atmosphere originating with his form was subsequently enriched by the Venetian painters , with deeper and more powerful color-overtones . They modified it into a fiery , typically Venetian glow of luminous color . In Claude Lorrain , in the landscapists of Barbizon and Holland , in Rembrandt , in Watteau , in the impressionists , in Renoir , Pascin , Lawson , etc. , the atmospheric illusion , though far from being identical to Masaccio 's or to that of the early Venetians , is fundamentally the same to a trained eye able to discern the various modifying influences of intermediary traditions , to which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual form . From this reorganization of the borrowed plastic factors emerges the determining character of Continuity of Traditions in Painting I I I the new tradition . The technique of the impressionists , for example ? i.e. , the use of complementary colors , juxtaposed upon the canvas by short and perceptible brushstrokes ? absent from Masaccio 's form , develops from a technique in use by Constable , Delacroix or , though less generally so , by Rubens in the Sixteenth Century . On the other hand , though Masaccio 's figures are simplified in their details , and their drawing non-photographically rendered , the simplifications apparent in the form initiated by Monet have greater affinity to those that characterize the Spanish tradition of Velasquez , and particularly so , as they became more generalized in Manet 's grasp and reintegration of them . Impressionism ? " revolutionary " modern conception of art ? extends its tentacles as far as early Florence and Venice , toward Spain , Flanders , England . . . . Seurat , one of Monet 's direct descendants , continued to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of his canvases . In " Les 1'oseuses , " however , this Venetian-Impressionist form is re-created in terms of clear-cut units of spatial composition leading back to the classic gracefulness of the l " lorentine expression in Raphael . Without a knowledge of the essence of these past traditions it is evidently beyond the means of any so-called educational method to ever grasp or even approach the real meaning , force and finesse of a work of art . When Cezanne , Matisse , Prendergast , etc. , disregard literal effects of perspective , for the sake of a definite , plastic design , they are interpreting in personal terms the distorted spatial and linear relations characteristic of Uccello . Uccello 's distortion of a naturally receding background into a contrasting but rhythmically related screen is repeated in Fra Filippo Lippi with variations , and is 1 12 11rt and Education a foretaste of the modern fusion of foreground , middle distance and background as realized by Manet , Pissarro , Seurat , Renoir , Cezanne , Matisse or Rousseau le Douanier . In the latter , the spatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the comparative literalness of the Florentine tradition where a number of his inspirations were born . The most modern artists of our day are constantly affected , directly or through modified intermediary forms , by the influence of the old masters and primitives . Piero della Francesca reappears in Puvis de Chavannes , and also in Picasso , in the use of color , of linear drawing , of light and modeling . Picasso 's plastic talent as an illustrator places him in a class with Raphael and Michel Angelo . Nor has El Greco 's meaning escaped Picasso 's sensitive intelligence : he borrows the contorted line , the general distortion and elongation , the dramatic contrast of color and light ; but in his pictures they become associated with other borrowings from Daumier , Manet , Cezanne . These plastic qualities are thus converted into a new version , which represents an incontestably modern , a Picasso creation . This distorted linear element , so typical of El Greco 's writhing compositions , does not , however , originate with him . A whole century before El Greco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a series of small color-and-light units , which he used in terms of linear circular rhythms to lend movement and life to the ensemble of the composition . The " swirl " innovated by him in the Fifteenth Century persists throughout the various artistic evolutions , ever essentially the same and ever modified by the individuality of the creative artist . Under different aspects , in various sets of relations , fulfilling varied roles , it contributes to Botticelli 's decorative // appeal as well as to Greco 's , Rubens 's , Delacroix 's , Fragonard 's variedly expressive forms . It can easily be discerned as one of the most powerful factors in pictures by Renoir , Cezanne , Pascin , Rouault , etc . An intelligently conducted study , based upon the fundamental significance of traditional plastic forms , is the only method capable of leading an interested student of art along the trajectory followed by this evolution and continuity of aesthetic principles . An innate sensitivity and a trained sense for relations of things , are the necessary complements to this method of education in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for traces of Leonardo 's influence upon the schools of painting that succeeded him , we must be able to recognize it in the Venetians , even if his modeling in isolated medium of light and shade is but the foundation upon which they draw and build up solid three-dimensional volumes in terms of structural color . Leonardo 's principle still governs in Renoir , Cezanne or Matisse , but modified by the Venetians , enriched by the numerous intervening traditions and adequately adapted to their respective plastic entities . Matisse may juxtapose a red to a yellow , and each of the colored areas will act a double part in the inter-relations of the plastic terms ; the red , for example , while an active factor in the color-organization of the canvas , may play toward the yellow a modeling role of shadow . If Cezanne and Renoir , the masters par excellence of the modern movement in art , reveal their heavy debt to the great ones of the past , their work is too honest to demand any commentary . Cezanne 's borrowings from El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courbet , Manet , Monet , are legitimate loans . He pays back to art the debt of an honest u4 11rt and Education and scrupulous artist and gives , in place of a possible and facile plagiarism , a new form , a creation none other than Cezanne 's own , impregnated with a power of color and conviction not found again , even in the masterpieces of his obliging inspirators . As to Renoir , no intelligent student can seriously pretend to a just appreciation or an adequate enjoyment of his form , who has not assimilated the essential plastic qualities of Greek statuary , of Giorgione , of Titian , Tintoretto , Rubens , Fragonard , Boucher , Monet . His personality has distilled these various traditions into a characteristic Renoir quintessence , which he poured over his canvases , with the bouquet of his own vintage . In this attempt to trace the continuity of traditions in painting , let us sieve through our method a few of the contemporary painters . ' We may eliminate eclectics like Derain , as well as plagiarists who have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists like Utrillo , Modigliani , Chirico , Soutine , who attain to the level of important creators . Chirico 's dissociation of figures into geometrical shapes organizes into certain linear , color and spatial relations similar to some plastic effects attained by Uccello ; his rhythmic contrasts are comparable to Ingres 's ; Perugino and Raphael are largely responsible for his spatial compositions , and Tintoretto and El Greco for the dramatic contrasts of his masses in space . Chirico has assimilated the contributions of his various predecessors , he incorporates them into a new entity , representative of a personally expressive interpretation . Utrillo , Soutine , Modigliani take from Manet the luminous quality of color , the technique of brushwork , his generalization and elimination of detail ; they take // the essence of his form , the meaning of his contribution , and so merge it with elements similarly borrowed from other sources as to bring into existence new plastic forms . Utrillo adds to Manet what he learns from Tintoretto , from the Venetians in general , in the richness and the structural quality of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Uccello , absorbs Corot 's poetic charm of landscape and dissolves it all into the important debt which he maintains toward the impressionists . Soutine 's brushwork and general use of color and light are also easily traceable to impressionism . However , in order to find the origin of his grotesque but plastically expressive distortions , we should understand some of the Egyptian sculpture-designs of the Fourth Century B.C. , some of the primitive Negro wooden statues and masks , and we should know the Venetians , particularly Tintoretto and his dramatic use of light-and-color contrasts . Soutine 's color is structural ; he applies it upon the canvas in series of small , powerfully rich units : Cezanne 's dabs and patches , applied with comparative reflective deliberateness and restraint , are replaced in Soutine by a freer , more spontaneous and dashing technique and by a greater opposition of more brilliant color-notes , i.e. , a merging of van Gogh 's method with the above-mentioned earlier inspirations . The contribution of Modigliani consists of a form that embraces certain attributes of the work of Manet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florentines and the structural color-values of the Venetians . These borrowings are fused with a translation into painting terms of important plastic values of primitive Negro sculpture . // An objective pointing out of these various subtleties of relations and a practical comparative study in front of the very pictures discussed easily verify our fundamental art-to-life principle of relation in the sense that either modern or contemporary art is an outgrowth , a flowering , which draws its strength and life from the sturdy roots implanted by the great masters of the past . Darer and Holbein 1 Diirer THE German tradition rose to its greatest height in Albrecht Diirer 1471-1528 ) . We have seen that the best of the Cologne school found much inspiration in the work of van Eyck and in that of the early Florentines . Darer retains this van Eyck-Italian influence plus its accretions in the early Cologne Masters , but these are chiefly points of departure for the creation of new and very personal entities . He is German to the backbone and derives more directly from the Cologne men 's own contributions than from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stephan Lochner , especially in composition and the marvelous delicacy and expressiveness of line . Ile always paints in plastic terms of his own creation , unique in subtlety and grasp of character . Throughout the course of his career , his work shows a profuse variety of forms , from his early portraits painted between 1490 and t 500 to his compositions of 1520 and 1526 . Numerous cxperiments and many adaptations of previous and contemporary traditions are perceptible throughout , but always with his own personality paramount . His earlier works ? the portraits of himself in the Louvre , the Prado , the Munich Pinakothek , and those of his father in the Uffizi and the National Gallery ? show a 117 r 8 Art and Education more subdued color-scheme than that generally employed later . At a distance his color seems to be of a rather uniform tone , but it is so interspersed with light and so related to shadow and space that a great variety of subtle hues of the same color are obtained . What strikes one at first , in his self-portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glowing color . Although no one color predominates , and none stands out as especially brilliant , the hues and tones are welded into an impressive and convincing totality . His color has not yet the structural quality nor the brilliance of the great Venetians , but these self-portraits prove Durer 's rank as a colorist . Here , his color-power is realized in a manner more akin to that of Michel Angelo , Daumier and Rembrandt ; that is , light , line and space are so dominated by color that one feels color-power despite the lack of varied or brilliant colors . What Durer accomplishes here with a grayishgreen , grayish-blue or other subdued color is what Daumier and Rembrandt do with deep golden-browns ; these portraits are neither dark nor somber : an effulgence radiates from within the color . Grunewald in his " Crucifixion , " and El Greco owe something to Diirer in a kind of lurid , eerie , ethereal quality of the color . The lack of actually brilliant tones is compensated for by a series of fine , extraordinarily active rhythms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns made up of features , wrinkles , hair , etc. , reminiscent of some of van Eyck 's faces . There is also a vague similarity to some of Mantegna 's work in which the effects , due to linear patterns in faces and to distortions of color related to those patterns , are made more delicate and are organized by Durer into a richer plastic form . Very few painters have equaled Durer in linear delicacy and charm . In // general , his line is Florentine in its sharpness , with a general curvilinear character , light , fluid and graceful . It resembles Botticelli 's line but is infinitely richer , both in the fuller expressiveness of the line itself and in the way line is harmoniously merged with and reinforced by the other plastic means . His great ability to merge line with the other plastic elements appears from a comparative study of his Louvre crayon-portrait of " Erasmus " with one of Holbein 's drawings , " Head of a Man , " in the same room . Iolbein 's is merely a linear contour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durer , shadows , light and line combine and function as a unit . In the clean-cut and rhythmic character of his line , Diircr resembles Vivarini , with the important difference that in the latter the line is totally unrelieved by color-reinforcement . The narrow , inklike line , noted in some of the earlier Cologne panels , reappears at times in Diircr . In his later pictures , of the period after i5oo , the color-scheme takes on a different range of tones . The individual colors become bright , as in his " Adoration of the Magi " in Florence , " The Saints " in Munich , " Portrait of a Girl " in Berlin , or even daringly brilliant as in the " Madonna " in Berlin . In this " Madonna " he shows his ability to take the conventional , brilliant , glaring color-scheme of the early Italians , made more heavy by the Cologne school , relate the colors to one another harmoniously , and convert them into striking , predominantly linear patterns . This proves what a. great creator he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cologne school color-scheme than of the Italian . This seems to be an experiment out of the regular line of Durer 's work in which he succeeds in taking away the tinselly , raucous quality of the Individual colors in a manner similar to the most daring // of Matisse 's work . For instance , in the background of the " Madonna " a small , narrow , ivory band is used to bring into relation two contrasting brilliant colors ? red and green ? in Matisse 's manner of using a broad colored outline to effect a similar purpose . At that period , some of Durer 's pictures , e.g. , the " Head of a Woman " at Berlin , recall Bellini in their broader , less linear drawing and looser contour . Durer 's large compositions are less successful as powerful organic unities than his portraits and episodic pictures , but they reveal a fine feeling for the ordered placing of objects on a single plane as well as in deep space , and for uniting the individual patterns of line , light , color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his compositions in Vienna , " Ten Thousand Martyrs of Nicodemia " and " Adoration of the Trinity by all the Saints , " show his derivation from the Cologne Masters . " Ten Thousand Martyrs of Nicodemia , " similar to Cranach 's composition in the same gallery , in which many figures in a landscape are depicted in active movement , probably owes a debt to Lochner 's " Last Judgment " ; this debt appears in the space-composition and in the grotesque characterization . The drawing is highly expressive and , while the active movement is felt everywhere , there is no feeling of affectation or unsuccessful expression . The structural quality of color , about equal to that in the Louvre self-portrait , contributes to variety and the feeling of reality . The rendering of the ground in this picture sometimes approaches a Giorgione-Courbet-like solidity . In " Adoration of the Trinity by all the Saints , " the bright colors of Baldung are present , but with the glaring effect avoided . Durer 's derivations from the Master of Marienleben and the Master of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darer and Holbein 1 21 the composition is reminiscent of Titian 's " Assumption . " Darer here shows less departure from the conventional form of the Cologne tradition than in his portraits . The lurid , eerie quality of the flesh , noted in some of his early portraits , is absent in his later ones . After he achieved that original and striking note , he apparently abandoned it and adopted a more traditional method of painting flesh as a point of departure for his own creations . The faces in his later portraits have a general reddish-yellow monochrome effect , similar to that of Holbein , but with the addition of a new and characteristic pinkish element which differentiates the flesh from that of all the rest of the German portraitpainters . This color is fundamentally different from the lurid , ghastly , ivory-white in the Louvre selfportrait . It is part of a new and well-organized colorscheme of delicate colors , mostly light-blue background , **34;0;TOOLONG flesh , and brownishyellow furs . This color-ensemble is a real , definite , powerful form . In general , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather sharp , defining contour , and making patterns in face , hair , etc. , which set off the light , delicate color-scheme . Inspected closely , the face and hands give the essential feeling of flesh , but not a literal representation . The unnatural color , while constituting a distortion , does not lessen his grasp of the essential quality of the flesh ; in other words , he uses human flesh as a point of departure for the creation of a multitude of linear , color and spatial relations , which unify in a general form highly expressive of human character . The head and chest of " Hieronymus Holzschuher " show creative use of the plastic means to make a deeply expressive unit , contrasted and merged with the light-blue of the background and the // yellowish-brown of the fur , in a balanced and harmonious total plastic form . In the painting of hair and gowns , Durer owes much to Stephan Lochner and something to the Master of Marienleben , but Durer 's color is richer and imparts a deeper and more real feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Cranach , in whose work the stuffs seem to be merely paint . The filiform painting of the hair and the beard in the portrait of " Hieronymus Holzschuher " affords an instance in which literal , almost photographic , realism does no damage to the plastic value of a picture , since it is the work of an authentic artist . In spite of this detailed representation , Darer 's art carries conviction in his profound grasp of character . Dignity , placidity , strength , gentleness , character , poetry , receive legitimate plastic embodiment . On the whole , Durer makes use of the German tradition , but he creates a new form in which the characteristic heaviness is lost , and all the strength and force retained . In that form , one feels the fluidity , grace , charm and power peculiar to Durer . He is the most important of the Germans both as a painter and as an artist : he ranks with Giorgione , Rembrandt , Titian , Velasquez and the few other supreme masters . Holbein Tarr works of Hans Holbein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Durer , Rembrandt and Titian in popular esteem and financial value . His short life was full of rich experiences that came from wide travel and contact with many of the leading characters of his time , whose portraits he painted . He was born in Basle , lived much in England , and traveled often in // Italy and the Netherlands . It is natural , therefore , that his work should show the influence of van Eyck , the Flemings in general , the Florentines , and the Venetians . But his stock was German and his form is based upon that tradition as it came through the Cologne Masters , after they had assimilated the contributions of preceding schools . Holbein makes , generally , a fair use of the traditions , with enough personal modification to merit some distinction . He shows no deliberate imitation , but neither does he show any striking individuality , such as would place him on a level with the great men of the past or present . Occasionally , his pictures are mere hash-ups of attenuated and debased features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than imitations of the early Germans such as Bruyn or Cranach , or of early Italians such as Ambrogio da Predis . Holbein is essentially a portrait-painter who renders human character less by legitimate plastic means than by literal reproduction of detail . Thanks to his extraordinary skill he reproduced a wealth of ornament with minuteness and precision . I lis painting of detailed stuffs , however , is vastly inferior to that of Domenico Veneziano and his Italian contemporaries , from which it is derived , and to that of the important French painters of the Sixteenth Century , such as the Clouets and Corneille de Lyon . Compared with the latter Holbein 's heaviness , coarseness and expressive and decorative inferiority are flagrant . In comparison with Durer 's , Holbein 's handling of stuffs is a mechanical application of pigment . How slight , finicky and overemphasized is Holbein 's painting of detail appears from the contrast between his " Portrait of Merchant Georg Gisze , " in Berlin , with Quentin Metsy 's treatment of the same type of objects in " The // Banker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter picture particular objects take their place as compositional masses related to other masses of color , line , space and light ; in the Holbein they are a series of itemized articles . His color has some structural character but does not attain the power and reality of the great Venetians , or of van Eyck or Petrus Christus . On the whole , it is nearer the old German tradition of Bruyn , Grunewald and Schongauer . In nearly all of Holbein 's painting of flesh there is a puttylike uniformity , a wooden character destitute of the vital quality of flesh . In his Louvre portraits , the reddish-brown tone of the flesh is repeated mechanically and uninterestingly in faces and hands , with no variation to meet the individuality of the face or hand painted . Only occasionally , as in the portrait of " Christina of Denmark , " in the National Gallery , is flesh rendered with reality and conviction . This portrait has more kinship with the Flemish than with any other tradition , but even here , though the redness of the Louvre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting remains mechanical : there is as always a radical lack of imagination . Holbein 's most direct link with the Italians is seen in the decided tendency toward a unification of his pictures by means of a sort of reddish-brown glow , a fusion of color with light , which came from Bellini and was used by all the Venetians . Except possibly in Grunewald 's " Crucifixion " at Colmar , this suffusion of color does not appear in any of the earlier Germans . It is likely that Holbein derived it from the Venetians , but it lacks the glow and richness found in Titian or Tintoretto . When Holbein uses bright colors , as in " Anne of Cleves , " the result is a patterned rather than // a colorful picture . The apparent richness in " The Ambassadors " is due to surface-illumination more than to any penetrating depth or glow from within . His organization of paintings by means of the colorsuffusion is mechanical and unvaried : the poor effect arises not only from the monotony but also from the aridity and bleakness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , to be also an unimaginatively used technical device . At times Holbein 's light recalls Carpaccio 's : it is related to large areas of color , which are ivory-gray in Carpaccio , chiefly brownish- or reddish-yellow in Holbein . The patterns of light are usually conventional . Modeling of faces is done in the manner of Leonardo , but Holbein improves upon Leonardo by injecting a fairly structural color into the shadows and so adding a certain force and richness . The monotony of Holbein 's surfaces is often varied and relieved by linear patterns in faces , figures and incidental objects , which testify to the fact that he is a greater draughtsman than painter . The tightness of his line is that of the Florentines , such as Vivarini , with something of the character of the Twelfth and Fourteenth Century Chinese artists ; the latter , however , not only integrated line with light and color more successfully in isolated units , but organized their pictures as a whole more completely and with greater delicacy . The one plastic element that Holbein uses with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely placed in space , are related to one another in all parts of the canvas and make a very interesting pattern . Sharp line and effective contrast of light and shadow increase the appeal of these designs in space-composition . Yet fine as the individual units are , the groups // are not so related to each other to form an integrated whole : they lack the organizing force of color . Carpaccio 's striking space-composition , in contrast , is achieved by variations in the colored objects themselves , so that the relation of his ivory tone with that of the objects and intervals produces organic coloreffects of which Holbein is incapable . Compared to those of Durer , Holbein 's figures seem merely posed : they lack grace , fluidity , vitality . His pictures chiefly represent the virtuosity of an able craftsman . Exceptions to this rule are his two portraits of Erasmus ? one at Basle , the other in the Louvre ? in both of which there is a satisfactory realization of character in good plastic terms . As an artist , his chief claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , color , space and light to each other . However , these plastic means are often too easily differentiated ; though they are related , they are practically never merged or integrated into a single expressive form , as they are in the great Venetians or Flemings . Photographic representation skillfully executed probably explains Holbein 's popular appeal . The Transition to Modern Painting BY ALBERT C. BARNES IN order to show the general nature of the traditions which have played an important part in the development of painting , and how they are utilized and modified by individuals , it is necessary to consider briefly the historical aspects . 01 ( 1 traditions constantly emerge in even the most recent painting , as , for example , Tintoretto in Soutine , the Persian miniatures in Matisse . One can judge of the individuality and importance of a painter only by referring to the sources of his effects , and by observing how these effects are combined with those from other sources . lithe artist is a real creator these effects pass through the crucible of his own personality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be destitute of organic relationships , the painter is a mere imitator , as in the case of academicians like Paxton or Redfield , or of an eclectic like Derain . Modern painting developed out of mosaics . These are substantially in a single plane , that is , flat , and really amount to little more than colored patterns , with an illustrative appeal . Although many mosaics are positive creations of definite art value , their subjectmatter is usually stereotyped or unreal , with little or no sign of personal expression . Convention was the 127 // rule and individual expression the exception . The aesthetic effects spring from color and line composed harmoniously into what is really decoration . The absence of light , modeling and perspective , and the use of a rigid line resulted in figures stiff and not individualized and in highly formal compositions , with very simple rhythms . Departure from this flat decorative pattern began with the gradual introduction of perspective , illumination and modeling , and their application to more realistic subject-matter , so that painting became more expressive , through command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal feeling in the painter . The line of demarcation between painting which is and which is not modern is difficult to draw with exactness , but it is clear that impressionism made a sharp break with the traditions that preceded it . For practical purposes , contemporary painting may be said to date from the age of Courbet , Manet , Monet and Pissarro . In the work of these men , the motives of the latter men are present , although not disengaged from the traditions which went before . The chief point of difference between the old and the new may be said to be that the moderns exhibit greater interest in relatively pure design . In order to show the development of this interest , it will be necessary to trace the evolution of plastic design as something in itself , apart from the question of subject-matter . Criticism of any work of plastic art is valid in so far as it concerns itself with the form the artist has created out of the means at his disposal , namely , line , color and space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters as it is of Cezanne or Matisse , and there can be no reasonable doubt that // what makes the art of Giotto great is not the religious subject-matter , but the plastic form , the design , by which deep human values are conveyed . A variety of circumstances prevented the early Italian painters from making a sharp distinction between their interest in design and their interest in illustrating a religious or historical narrative . The spirit and state of culture of the early Renaissance required that painting fulfill definite public functions . It was necessary that church frescoes should illustrate religious motives , that portraits should reproduce their originals , that pictures ordered by states or guilds should portray specific occurrences of interest to their purchasers . The general conditions were such that books were accessible only to the few , and their function was largely taken over by painting . All these circumstances made it impossible that properly plastic or pictorial motives should operate without constraint . The history of the transition to modern painting consists of an account of the removal of all such irrelevant compulsions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means came to be more and more directed to the realization of pure design . Such an account will make clear the essential continuity between painters apparently as diverse as Piero della Francesca and Picasso , Tintoretto and Cezanne . Design , as it is found in modern and contemporary painting , appears in the work of the early Italians whenever literal reproduction is so modified that the arrangement and handling of objects make a more aesthetically moving plastic form . Giotto is , in his way , as far from literalism as Renoir . If we compare Giotto with his inferior contemporaries , we see at once that a large number of his simplifications must have been conscious departures from photographic repre130 Art and Education sentation . These departures are of the very essence , of the appeal of his themes , and are clearly expressive of an interest in plastic form for itself . Even though his designs are always accompanied by a narrative , they embody the spirit , and not the details , of this narra , tive . In other words , they express a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such expressiveness is inevitably an enhancement and not a distraction . In this sense Giotto seems far more modern than such painters as van Dyck , Reynolds , or David , in whom the role of painting is instrumental to such cheap human activities as personal flattery or surface imitation . In the early Florentines , Uccello and Fra Filippo Lippi , interest in design was so paramount that contemporary academic critics propagate the obvious misconception that Uccello was principally an experimenter in perspective . But considered from the plastic standpoint , his work is a striking illustration of the value of a design which discards an imitative presentation of the spatial relationships of objects in favor of one which has greater intrinsic value . Fra Filippo Lippi. distorted perspective in still another manner , and achieved a design which is akin plastically to that used by most of the important painters since Courbet . Design is the animating motive in drawing whenever there is simplification or deliberate distortion directed to heightening of aesthetic effect ; this is clearly discernible in Andrea del Castagno , in Michel Angelo , in El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them it is only partly representative and more aesthetic or expressive in intent . In " the Fifteenth Century Florentine , Masaccio , the deliberate distortions of line , light , and color produce an appearance that is both realistic and infinitely more moving aesthetically // than any literal or photographic representation could be . The paintings of these great artists prove the absurdity of those ultramodern writers who contend that plastic form is an absolute creation of the artist , in which no attempt is made to render the quality of anything in nature . We maintain that such form can be no more than decoration , that plastic form at its best does seek to give an equivalent of something real ? of fundamental aspects , of essences , though not of insignificant detail . In fact , at all stages in the history of painting , from Masaccio to Mallet and Matisse , the departures from literalism by which a more satisfactory design is secured , accomplish also a better effect of realism . We have not gotten farther away from realities , but nearer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in whom design , free from realistic representation , concerns itself chiefly with decoration . This inferior order of design has its modern counterpart in those cubistic paintings in which design is reduced to the level of mere pattern ; this is iii the same category , aesthetically , as the pattern in a rug . When a painter uses color which departs from the observable color of an object , that also constitutes distortion . Such distortion has been constantly practiced to enhance the value of design , notably by all the great Venetians . The Venetian glow , a circumambient atmosphere of color , is obviously a color-distortion introduced to modify , harmonize , emphasize , and set off the colorful aspect of things , so that the effects are richer than those ever found in nature . The most original element in the work of Matisse , that is , his interest in color-combinations for their own sake , is thus clearly foreshadowed in the Venetians . But this similarity is overlooked because , of the great differ132 Art and Education ences in perspective , solidity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those used by Matisse . Light is also distorted from its naturalistic effects in the interests of design . ' When used naturalistically , light accomplishes some degree of modeling and sets off color ; but those are only a few of its functions in contributing to great effects in art . In Leonardo , for example , it does much more than this . Its modeling function is strongly accentuated and the way it falls upon surfaces is not in accordance with physical laws of literal reproduction in any given situation , but is so modified that it makes an independent pattern . It would be manifestly absurd to accuse Leonardo , one of the most advanced scientists of his day , of ignorance of the physical laws that govern the incidence and reflection of light ; it is more reasonable to suppose that his distortions of light were used deliberately , with the aesthetic motive of forming an independent pattern . Both Leonardo and Raphael used light in the same manner , even to the extent of an accentuation that disturbs the balance of plastic means . A better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total plastic form is found in the most of the painters of the Venetian school , in Rubens , Claude and practically all the important moderns and contemporaries . Line , light , and color are all highly distorted in El Greco , partly to heighten the effect of religious mysticism , but mainly to achieve a form of intrinsic interest which adds to the direct moving power of the picture without going through the circuit of appeal to the emotions aroused by religious imagery . Rembrandt 's chiaroscuro is distorted light employed for two distinct and obvious purposes , first to show an objective fact , such as a face of three-dimensional solidity ; second , as a means of making a particular arrangement of color // and line with a specific effect different from that yielded by ordinary illumination . Even in Velasquez , where the effect of the picture as a whole is apparently realistic , the realism , like that of Masaccio , is attained by many departures from exact reproduction , all of which contribute directly to the creation of a form far more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them painters there is interest in illustration , but the purely plastic interest is present though it has not yet appeared in isolation . The actual process of transition is to be seen in the impressionists , in whose work literal representation is scarcely attempted ; the drawing is very broad , and much greater liberties are taken with the actual coloring of objects than in the earlier painters . With the impressionists it is the mode of presentation and not the object presented that counts . For example , in Manet 's " Olympia " it is - apparent that the interest lies in the composition and that the story is unimportant . The strangely modeled and proportioned woman placed in just that position and in just those relations with surrounding objects , creates something independent and more moving than any story . This picture represents an advance towards abstract plastic form when compared with , say , Rubens 's " Judgment of Paris , " in which it would be much easier for the spectator to lose his way in the narrative . One of the most important innovations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of representing foreground , middle distance , and background in terms of literal perspective , they distributed light and color all over the canvas . The result is a homogeneous color-mass , embracing the entire painting , making a unified plastic form . This relative freedom from literary or photographic // interest , that is , from the interests which are not plastic , recurs in all the impressionists . Their very tech &; nique , the use of divided color , is itself a departure from literalism , since it replaces a merely imitative rendering of colored surfaces by one in which the colorfulness of objects is better realized . In Monet , the sense of design is less vigorous than in Manet or in Pissarro , and he sometimes falls victim to an interest in the effect of sunlight on color , which interest is more photographic than plastic . But the greater artists of the group , Renoir and Cezanne , used sunlight and divided tones only as means to the achievement of a design which is purely plastic . Their forms are richer , more powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Nineteenth Century . They not only sum up the painters who preceded them in much the same way that Poussin and Rubens summed up the painting of the Renaissance , but they created new forms that stimulated their followers to the creation of still other and different plastic forms . From impressionism all that is best in contemporary painting has been developed . It may be said that in Renoir and Cezanne , design is more completely realized in terms of color than in any of the early great painters , and that this would not have been possible without the researches of Monet and those who followed him . To them is due the credit for forging'the instrument by means of which the effects characteristic of modern art at its best were achieved . Renoir and Cezanne By ALBERT C. BARNES Renoir AT all stages of his career , Renoir 's ( 1841-1919 ) work was as personal and his use of the plastic means as original as that of any painter since the time of the Renaissance . His earliest work . was done under the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's naturalism is freed from its heaviness and the Velasquez-Goya influence is endowed with a new delicacy and charm reminiscent of the Eighteenth Century French painters , though with an added note of strength . From the very start Renoir 's mastery of color and his extraordinary facility in using paint are the outstanding characteristics . His work of the early seventies is a long succession of pictures that , for color and difficult achievements with paint , compare with any by his great predecessors . The paintings of figures and of interiors at that period have deep reality with a strength , delicacy and charm that make them comparable to the best work of Velasquez , Vermeer , Chardin and Corot . Goya 's superb rendering of the light , diaphanous quality of stuffs is carried to greater heights by Rehoir 's finer feeling for color : a piece of filmy material covering a darker one is so painted that // the individuality of each textile is reinforced by a rich but transparent glow . These early pictures of Renoir 's were painted before the development of the impressionistic use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat in the manner of Manet 's simplifications and broad brushwork but with more and richer color and with less evidence of Manet 's obvious technique . There is no suggestion of the reds which he afterwards employed profusely , but there is great sensuous richness everywhere , heightened by the blue tinting of the shadows , variegated in the background by chords of color , merged with line , and so pervasively active as to function powerfully in composing the picture . The drawing is done chiefly with color and there is a striking fluidity of line . Every painting is a composite of many subsidiary designs , made up of line , light and color , and merged into units that relate themselves to each other harmoniously . The light arranges itself into a subtle pleasing pattern and also contributes to the modeling , in which color does not yet operate so powerfully as in the later pictures . The three-dimensional effects are not emphasized but are subtle , achieved without aptparent effort , and they have a degree of convincing reality akin , sometimes to that of Vermeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Renoir 's next period is marked by a change in technique . In the pictures painted in the late seventies there are suggestions of the impressionistic use of juxtaposed brush-strokes or spots or streaks of contrasting color , which at a distance fuse into a single expanse of bright color ; but the effect is a certain obviousness of technique which was later overcome . Contrasted with his earlier pictures , these show a greater variety of colors . The rather uniform blue // and ivory previously employed are supplemented by reds , yellows , and browns , used sometimes pure , sometimes modified with light , so that a whole gamut of color-variations is secured . As time goes on , this method of painting in juxtaposed color-spots is used more and more , but it is always used judiciously and is varied by means of broad areas of paint in certain parts of the canvas . This method causes the colors to melt into . each other and gives a creamy , velvety quality , as in the " Pourville " 2 landscape , and an opulent decorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the predominance of color-spots used in connection with bright sunlight , as in the " Bougival " 2 landscape , yields comparatively superficial effects , more like those of Monet and Sisley . In all of the landscapes of the early eighties there is extensive use of the divisionistic manner , but its application to different material is so infinitely resourceful that both the color and the compositional effects are far more varied and powerful than those of Monet . Renoir 's researches in the impressionistic manner developed new technical resources that merged perfectly with his previous Velasqucz-Goya-Manet methods . The realistic results of his earlier period were increased by sensuous charm , by an added structural use of color , and by a glowing iridescence . His contributions had changed the impressionistic technique from a mere device into a power for greater creation and more complete organization of the whole painting . It became one of the great and firmly founded traditions . During the eighties Renoir developed temporarily a third style , marked by sharp , incisive line and dryness , almost acidity , of color . Its obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of that period is closely akin to that of Ingres , but the resemblance is. all on the surface . The radical difference is that in Ingres the line is fundamental and the color , which is comparatively perfunctory , thin , and unreal , is mere decoration added to the linear structure . In Renoirs even of that period , it is the color that is fundamental ; it builds up structures and welds together compositions as it never does in Ingres . The sharp line is merely a particular way of bringing colors into relation , and it compels the eye to follow the rhythms of color as constituting masses in deep space , rather than the movement and direction of the line itself . Ingres 's line is tight and restrained , while Renior 's is free and more expressive of abandon . Renoir 's manner at this time is often considered a regression to the methods of earlier painters , but the modeling and other uses of the plastic means are dis-tinctively Renoir 's own . That the method was clearly an experiment in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the sharp line and the acid color gave a fluid , luminous quality to the forms such as no other painter ever achieved except in ' water-color . The worst that can be said of these pictures is that the color is structurally less successful than it later became and it was probably for that reason that Renoir abandoned the method . . - In the late eighties , he turned his attention toward the development of a technique that would enable him to render the movement of volumes in deep space , and in 1889 he succeeded in doing it with great conviction and appeal . These masses are so free from minute detail or obvious realism that , to an inexperienced observer , they often seem to be scarcely solid at all . But plastically considered they realize perfectly the // essence of the massive quality , without its adventitious detail , in a degree comparable to that of Rembrandt and Velasquez . The rhythm is made more pervasive and powerful by the flow of color throughout the picture , partly by the modification of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a colorsuffusion which recalls the Venetianglow . As Renoir perfected his individual form , the rendering of masses gradually became less clearly defined , more floating and vaporous , but not less convincing . The impressionistic technique has become more and more generalized , and the individual brush-strokes appear subtly , and only in restricted parts of the canvas . By this time Renoir had reached the point of giving the large-scale effects of landscape with an impressiveness worthy of Claude , to which he added the grasp of the spirit of local place , the intime charm of Constable . This combination of epic grandeur , of lyric charm , and of a dramatic quality , appears in Renoir 's landscape-painting throughout the rest of his life . In the nineties , the technique itself comes to be so completely flexible that a distinctive quality is given to each repetition of the same subject in only slightly altered form . At this period he painted a series of pictures of the same young girl , each of which is so varied in color and drawing that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality are attained in each one , but they are different and distinctive in each case . Drawing , by means of color , has become extremely fluid , and there is fidelity to the characteristic feeling of things , worthy of Velasquez . Literalism is. completely avoided and all the ordinary means of rendering solidity , outline , perspective , begin to be replaced by obvious distortions . The interest in relatively abstract design comes to be more and more // dominant . Recognizable objects never fully disappear , but they are very freely rendered and their significance becomes almost purely plastic , that is , they are conceived chiefly as elements in the design . It is ability to accomplish this , with no loss of conviction , no degradation of the form to the status of mere pattern , that marks Renoir as an artist of the first magnitude . His design is created out of many lesser designs , so that every part of his canvases has an intrinsic interest as well as a functional interest , the whole forming a monumental effect comparable with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as varied and harmonious as a fugue or symphony . At the beginning of the present century , Renoir had reached the full control of his powers and thereafter he deepened and enriched still further his color-values . In his figures there is an increasing use of red and a more voluminous and more voluptuous three-dimensional solidity . In his landscapes there is often a major . theme of emerald , ruby , or lilac-blue , around which there is rose melting into violet , blue into shimmering green , with a pearly atmosphere , giving an effect of deep quietude , dignity , serenity , majesty , peace . In everything he painted there is a more convincing massiveness , and a more powerful three-dimensional rhythm . The means he adapted to this end is a swirl not unlike that of Rubens , but of larger scope and much more moving . Color becomes paramount ? it indicates perspective , suffuses the whole painting , increases the contrapuntal richness of forms , welds the units together into a rich and powerful design . He left his preceptors constantly further behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classic spirit of the best Renaissance painting . This classic spirit becomes increasingly evident towards the end of his // life , and shows how profoundly he had assimilated and lent new life to all the valuable influences in art . More than that of any other painter his work constitutes an epitome and rounding-out of the whole history of painting . We may now summarize Renoir 's characteristics as they appear in all periods of his work . The foundation of his painting is color as it came from Fragonard and Rubens , and through Rubens from the Venetians . In the use of color he was an impressionist , though he transcended everything in that technique which is suggestive of formula or mannerism . It is not only in the use of color that he advances upon Rubens and Fragonard , for his spirit is essentially different . There is at all times in Rubens 's and Fragonard 's work a kind of remoteness and , in consequence , loss of perfect reality . In Rubens , this took the form of the flamboyant , the grandiose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's debt to the Dutch , to Velasquez , and to the realists , Courbet and NI ; met , of his own century , is evidenced by his much greater interest in the things of everyday life . Nis temperament made him love and observe attentively the commonplace people and incidents of life , so that in his hands they cease to be commonplace and become suffused with poetic charm . He is at home with them and he delights in enveloping them with the wealth of sensuous quality , the voluptuousness , that came from his own rich endowment . His delight is that of an artist , not of an animal , for his voluptuousness is free from sensuality . He has an unerring grasp upon essentials ; hence the truth and naturalness of his drawing , the success with which he makes his people reveal themselves in the performance of some ordinary act , such as taking hold of a cup or // handling a needle , or in the unpremeditated play of their features . His sense of the dramatic in the events of everyday life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renoir never despises the people whom he shows acting . His pleasure in the beautiful things of the world is revealed in the richness and delicacy of his textiles and in his rendering of human beings pulsating with life and glad to be alive . The sensuous charm and the general decorative quality of Renoir 's work is achieved by color-chords of a wealth nowhere else paralleled . In Rubens the color is less brilliant and less real , and he lacked the characteristically French delicacy of Renoir , which refined and made more subtle the elements of decoration . In Renoir , everything is fluid , light , transparent ; the flesh is luminous , the atmosphere is pearly ; when the surfaces are hard , their color is jewel-like . In his work , vulgar scenes and persons lose their vulgarity . A group of them , seen as an ensemble , resembles the flowers in a bouquet . His nudes are symbols , not naked women . Nobody ever painted more spontaneously , freely , with more improvisation , than he did . All this decorative quality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his rich , juicy , varied , glowing color is also structural and compositional . It functions in design , reinforces drawing and perspective , and heightens the rhythms of the picture . His line is not only rhythmic but is as expressive of the character of personality , of drama , as is Degas 's . He can give the grandeur and majesty of landscape in a degree comparable to Claude 's , and he advances upon Claude in that he secured these effects by means of color . In landscape on a smaller scale he rivaled Constable , and in his sense of the intime quality of interiors he is the equal of Chardin . He has the poetry of Giorgione , // but it is a more homely poetry , less Arcadian , with less of the pathos of distance . His weaknesses spring from the same source as his strength ? his absorption in the life that is visible to the eye , his unreflectiveness , his incomparable sensuous charm . He has not the impersonality or quite the subtlety of Velasquez , nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human values , the mysticism of Rembrandt . Ile is less imaginative than Giorgione , less elevated than Titian , less dramatic than Tintoretto , less powerful than Michel Angelo or Cezanne , and less completely absorbed in the essential , to the neglect of all secondary matters , than Giotto . But purely as a plastic artist , he has greater command of means , greater variety of effect , and certainly a greater decorative quality than any other painter . Cezanne CEZANNE ( 1839-1906 ) began working at the time when impressionism was at its height , and the influences upon him were in large measure the same as the influences upon Renoir . Both men were impressionists in their technique and remained impressionists throughout their careers , even though each used the method in a distinctive and individual way . Both Renoir and Cezanne were deeply influenced by Delacroix and Courbet . The first , but only fleeting , influence of Delacroix is seen in the romantic , dramatic subject-matter in Cezanne 's earliest paintings . The profound lesson which he learned from Delacroix , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the structural and organic use of color . From Courbet he absorbed the simplifications and vigorous painting of // naturalistic objects , which , combined with the later influences of Michel Angelo , El Greco and Pissarro , . determined the form taken by his whole-hearted devotion to the construction of relatively abstract design . The early influence of Pissarro upon him was so strong that the first impressionist paintings by Cezanne could almost pass for Pissarros of extraordinary vigor . He took over his entire technique ? quality and kind of color , its use in juxtaposed spots varied with broad areas of color , and his manner of using light . His grasp of fundamentals , and his ability to form original and powerful designs , seem to have been innate , for they appear in his earliest work , long before he had developed his final and characteristic form . Consequently , his use of Pissarro 's method resulted in paintings that were stronger than Pissarro 's own , more solid , better organized by means of color . His better sense of line , color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form stronger than that of any of his contemporary impressionists . Cezanne 's evolution into his own distinctive technique was a slow process because he was deficient in natural facility in the use of the brush . From the first he was clearly an independent artist , but it was a long time before he could paint with the assurance of Renoir , and his early work lacks the finish and mastery of medium which is to be seen in Renoir from the start . " The sense of effort and strain remains even in his mature style , which never attains to Renoir 's unconscious ease and naturalness . Although Renoir 's painting also represents a gradual progress toward his final form , his early pictures are much more complete in themselves than Cezanne 's and do not so clearly represent experimental and tentative stages . During the course of Cezanne 's experimentation the // impressionistic technique is always much in evidence . The interest in color , the use of light to vivify the color in selected spots and also as a general illumination , are unmistakably in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of skill in the use of paint equal to Pissarro 's , there is a noticeable advance in the dynamic power of the color in the design , and in its use to produce more convincing effects of threedimensional reality . His progress towards the use of a thinner impasto resulted in an increasing ability to render the effects of solidity in terms free from the sculptural tendency of his earlier thick paint . This thinner paint transformed the roughness of effect in his early work to a lightness and delicacy that involves no loss of strength . As his style becomes more characteristically his own , the ability to compose in terms of deep space increases , with great heightening of conviction and moving power . At the same time , there is a softening of contours . His line rarely becomes blurred as in Renoir , but it loses its earlier tendency to hardness and comparative isolation from the other elements , and comes to be realized more intimately in union with light and color , especially color . His composition departs from conventionality and flows rhythmically throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects become less naturalistic and more arbitrarily subordinated to the requirements of design . This tendency to distortion of shape has always been the quality in Cezanne which aroused the scornful wonder of the inexperienced observer , and is chiefly responsible for the effort which is required to appreciate his painting at all . Ile has none of the charm which Renoir has for the superficial observer . Such an observer does not , of course , see the essential plastic virtues of Renoir , but // he does see an immediately pleasing lyric quality , while in Cezanne he is likely to see nothing familiar . Cezanne can be appreciated only after all considerations of naturalistic accuracy have been dismissed . His distinctive achievement was to establish a series of relationships in deep space between solid three-dimensional objects , so that their ensemble is a unified plastic design of great aesthetic power . This feeling for the dynamic relationships between objects and the ability to coordinate the resulting forms into a design involved a specific genius , which in the period of his maturity resulted in designs as original and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs he violated all conceptions of probability or possibility . Objects appear suspended in the air , in complete defiance of the law of gravitation , figures and faces are distorted into monstrosities . Both color and outline are treated as motives to be worked with as design requires , and in no sense as requirements laid down by the actual appearance of things in the real world . These distortions are to be found not only in the faces and other parts of the human body , but also in all the plastic means , including line , mass , space : they are fundamental to the planes themselves . These planes are changed from the normal in every conceivable way , and the new forms are built up by the interpenetration of these distorted planes , which represent the most basic plastic debt of Cezanne to El Greco . In all of his work there is a perceptible , a definite idea , which he himself called the motif . Naturalistic considerations in the representation of subject-matter were sacrificed to the desire to make lines , perspective and space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into equilibrium . In other words , objects , deprived of their resemblance // to real things , were merely the means used to integrate the plastic elements into new and distinctive forms . The essential material for all his forms was color , and he built everything up out of color . His modeling is done by layers of modulated colors and not by the usual method of variations of the same color to indicate the gradations of light by which in nature the curving surface of a solid body is shown . Cezanne used strokes of color , which give the essential effect of solidity , but in a form far removed from that of nature . The result is a richer plastic effect , with no loss of conviction . In modeling he also used light in the usual way as an additional means ; but color in layers is the essential characteristic , is distinctively his own method , and it shows the thoroughness with which he carried out his intention to utilize the prime material of painting , color , to the greatest possible extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economy of means comparable to Rcmbrandt 's , and is perhaps even better than Rembrandt 's , because color is in itself richer than chiaroscuro , it has more possibilities , and is more distinctively the material in the medium of painting . In the achievement of subtle effects by means of color he rivals Velasquez , though he was by far the lesser craftsman . He raises the functional quality of color to its supreme degree , and thus carries the Venetian tradition to its consummation . Perspective , drawing , composition , and the creation of solid structure are all done chiefly by color . Even in his distortions , the line is either color itself or is so merged with color in a moving formal relation to adjacent colors as to make the drawing more powerful . The distorted planes in his best work consist of an equilibrium of colors fused into new forms which // are Cezanne 's very own . In these , color enters into fluid , rhythmic relations with all the other plastic ele , ments , and organizes the painting by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cezanne 's great achievement , and was never realized better by any other artist . Color animates everything , without any recourse to the moving power of illustration . Cezanne 's forms are essentially abstract , but they are achieved through the medium of subject-matter that has sufficient point of contact with the real world to establish relation with our funded experience of real things . For example , the hands in the " Portrait of Madame Cezanne " are obviously distorted and unnatural , but they recall human hands , in their essential and abstract quality , with a forceful , moving reality greater than any photographic imitation of hands could produce . In this power to give the feeling of the real while avoiding all literal realism , Cezanne vies with Rembrandt and Velasquez , in whose paintings there is the same realism without photography . More than either of those painters , Cezanne stripped away everything not absolutely essential , and through new technical means succeeded in giving that sense of profound fidelity to the deeper aspects of things , which is the characteristic of all great art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the use of means purely plastic and by a new use of the most difficult of those means ? colorhe realized a form of the highest conviction and power . In his elimination of everything not entirely necessary to design , he followed in the footsteps of Michel Angelo , Tintoretto and El Greco , whose distortions he applied to new purposes . From Velasquez , through // the intermediation of Manet , he learned to simplify . But in him the whole tradition of simplification and distortion was merged with the impressionistic technique and became something radically new in the history of painting . His power is equal to Michel Angelo 's , and is more effective because it is achieved by means entirely intrinsic to painting , instead of the suggestions derived from sculpture to be found even in the best of Michel Angelo 's work . His landscapes have the majesty of Claude 's , combined with a more austere , rugged force ; they have an added purity because he dispenses with anything of even the degree of obviousness of Claude 's atmosphere . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple still-life a monumental quality that makes Raphael 's " Transfiguration " seem trivial . Cezanne 's shortcomings arise partly from the same source as his greatness and partly from his never wholly perfect command of his medium . As a painter he never rises to the greatest heights , those of Velasquez , Rembrandt or Renoir . Cezanne 's laborious efforts to force and coax paint to express his ideas and feelings are perceptible at all stages of his work . Even in his most mature paintings he sometimes lacked that command over paint which makes it seem that an artist can execute without apparent effort , which is the mark of the supreme craftsman . Another disadvantage is that his resolute adherence to essentials left him comparatively little interest in the sensuous charm that accompanies a specific decorative quality . In this respect he is inferior to all the greater Venetians , to Velasquez , to Renoir , and even to Rubens . This does not mean that his surfaces are at all bleak or barren , hut there is not the wealth of decorative quality throughout every area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flrt and Education example , in Giorgione 's . In Renoir there is a similar , powerfully plastic form made up of solid masses rhyth- ' mically arranged in deep space , but in addition we have a greater variety and richness of color-chords and a more ingratiating charm , such as exists in Giorgione and Titian . The examples of these artists also show that it is possible to have strength of plastic form in combination with a greater variety of human values than Cezanne presents to us , so that his purification of plastic form is not attained without loss . This defect is offset to a certain extent by the sensuous richness of the plastic forms themselves , in which the color is deeply integrated . He was the equal of the greatest artists in making his forms embody the abstract feelings , the human values , that the objects and events of everyday life communicate . He rendered the essential qualities of those feelings stripped of the irrelevant and accidental , and endowed them with the pervasive mystery , power and charm that make them moving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By ALBERT C. BARNES THE distinctive note in the painting of our own day is the development of interest in design as something comparatively independent of the ostensible subject of the painting . Almost all modern painting shows the influence of impressionism , especially as that movement was shaped and brought to its consummation by Renoir and Cezanne . In the work of both of these artists , the interest in achieving design primarily through the medium of color is paramount , but the interest in color takes a different form in the two men . Renoir 's color is more varied , brighter , more sensuously charming and more decorative . In Cezanne it is more restrained and is used more in the interest of solidity or mass . But in both artists it assumes throughout the canvas a functional power to effect composition in a degree unequaled in the history of painting . The emphasis of color as the most potent of all the instruments of design is thus due to the researches of these two men . In the evolution of their techniques , Renoir and Cezanne adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rubens , Goya , Delacroix and Courbet , through Manet 's simplifications and generalizations . These latter were achieved principally by the broad brush-strokes that enabled Manet to give 151 i
