Nothing seemed able last week to stimulate the U. S. wheat market out of its most serious slough since 1921 . Like a sick giant , it lay in the pit , neglected , inert , gasping to keep above the $1-per-bushel mark . Railroads east and west had cut wheat and flour export freight rates to help move the largest surplus in ten years ( TIME , May 13 ) . Hard-headed railroad executives were skeptical of the assistance they were giving . They saw that foreign demand must exist to move export wheat , and that no such demand existed . The fact remained that the world had as much wheat as it wanted , with more than it wanted in prospect come next harvesttime . <P> Senate Bill . The Senate 's passage of the Farm Relief Bill containing the Export Debenture Plan so heartily disapproved by President Hoover , did nothing to revive the wheat market . Without dramatics , the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 54 to 33 . Nine Senators ( eight Republicans , one Democrat ) who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the Bill on the ground that they must vote for some kind of Farm Legislation , good or bad . The measure did not get a single Republican vote east of Michigan . <P> G. O. Peace . Just before the vote the dove of peace again settled gently upon the Republican side of the chamber . Senator Fess of Ohio had characterized as " pseudo-Republicans " his party colleagues who had not supported President Hoover against the Debenture . Senator Brookhart of Iowa retorted : <P> " Not having had much school training , I got down my copy of the International Dictionary to find out what this ' pseudo ' business means . ... I find that ' pseudo ' is a Greek word ... as a prefix in English signifying ' false , counterfeit , pretended , spurious . ' ... It ruffled my feathers a good deal at first ... so I looked back in the dictionary and found that the word has a second meaning : ' In Lobachevskian geometry an analog of the corresponding term in Euclidean geometry as ' pseudo-form . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what all that means . But probably that is what the Senator from Ohio intended to apply to me , and so I do not feel mad about him at all . " Everybody laughed . <P> Senator Fess rose to say that he had taken the word from an earlier speech by California 's Senator Johnson . Though a college professor , he confessed that he did not have the " dictionary definition ' ' before him when he tagged Republican Progressives with the word .
