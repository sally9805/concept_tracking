Coming through the rain at Delaware Water Gap , Pa. , last week , was the hulk of Archie Compston , British golfer . He was doing well-one under par on the last nine holes . That gave him a final card of 287 and the Eastern Open championship . Said a rain-vexed U. S. golfer , " High time an Englishman won at golf . " <P> Al Heron of Reading , Pa. , finished two strokes behind Compston . Aubrey Boomer of St. Cloud , France , who looked like a winner , blew up near the finish .
