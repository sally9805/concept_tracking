Science . The Fourth Annual Educational Conference of the Episcopal Church concluded its meetings in Omaha . The educators declared themselves open to all modern knowledge and scientific research which was not contrary to the Apostles ' Creed . This stand for liberalism was taken , they say , because of many questions asked by young people who fear they have to give literal belief to the story of Jonah and the whale and other incidents recorded in the Bible . <P> Teaching . The Religious Education Association ( of all Protestant churches ) held a four day convention in Toledo . Like the Episcopalians in Omaha the week before , they voted strongly for weekday religious education . They further advocated teacher-training and pay for Sunday school teachers , " in order that religion be as well taught as public school subjects . " <P> Rood Screens . A reminder of pre-Reformation days was discovered in rebuilding Noyon Cathedral . The shell scarred floors were removed recently , revealing the foundations of an ancient jub , or rood screen . In olden days the jub was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nave , and from a tribune on top of this wall a cleric read the Gospel and Epistle . The rood screens of today serve to ornament the church rather than to separate the clergy from the laity .
