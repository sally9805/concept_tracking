Expeditions are not what they used to be . Sail to the ice-studded shores of Greenland and you can still telephone your wife by wireless . Trek to the heart of Africa and you will not leave the automobile behind you ; in fact , a Cape-to-Cairo airplane may pass overhead any day . Last month the British press announced the death of Charles St. John , 86 , last white survivor of Missionary David Livingstone 's seven-year expedition to find the watershed between Lake Nyasa and Lake Tanganyika , central Africa ( 1866-73 ) . Concurrently there were reports of modern expeditions , coming and going : <P> MacMillan . Home from Labrador and Greenland , with plans for going back again to spend five years , came Explorer Donald B. MacMillan last week . He had been investigating ruins and legends problematically indicative of Norse settlements in America a thousand years ago . Maine coastal towns turned out to welcome their state 's special hero . The Field Museum of Chicago rejoiced at the prospect of receiving a 1,500-pound walrus carcass and other specimens . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kodak " ) Eastman , of Rochester , N. Y. , has been spending the summer photographing and shooting big game in Kenya , Tanganyika and the Belgian Congo . Near Nairobi natives chaired him on their shiny shoulders for slaying an eight-foot lion with two express bullets . Last fortnight came a letter from Explorer Carl E. Akeley , with the Eastman party and in charge of collections for the African Hall of the American Museum of Natural History , saying that the Kenya veld , once a hunter 's paradise , is now stripped of fauna . " The unhappy remnant . . . now has its ear attuned to the rattle and bang of the motor car , which carries the alleged sportsmen over the veld in the hope of killing the last of a given species . " At one water hole , Mr. Eastman photographed giraffes in the act of slaking their exaggerated throats but " could n't bear the thought of being responsible for the death of one . " <P> Putnam . Publisher George Palmer Putnam of Manhattan , with his small son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunrud , cowboy ; Dan Streeter , author ; Capt . Bob Bartlett , Explorer Peary 's onetime skipper ; Knud Rasmussen , explorer ; and naturalists from the American Museum of Natural History , have been cruising Davis Strait and Baffin Bay , off Greenland , in constant radio communication with the New York Times . Many a description of Arctic weather effects has been received , couched in Publisher Putnam 's best editorial verbiage . Walrus , seals , narwhal and varied seafowl have fallen to the voyagers ' trusty guns , a high moment coming last fortnight when the Putnams , father and son , and Dan Streeter touched off their rifles simultaneously into the bulk of a polar bear on a cake of pan ice . David Putnam , 13 , veteran of William Beebe 's last Galapagos cruise , had been spending days in the crow's-nest sighting for bear ; it is unlikely that he will neglect to mention the episode in his projected treatize : David Goes to Greenland .                @ @ @ @ @
