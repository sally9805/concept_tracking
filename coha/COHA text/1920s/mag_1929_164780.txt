Princeton Junction , N. J. , has an unpredictable railroad platform . Upon it you may see anybody from a debutante to an astronomer , for Princeton University is nearby . But always you will see , getting on the early morning commuters ' train , getting off the early evening commuters ' train , a neat , plump little man for whom a robins-egg Rolls-Royce stands at stately attention ; for whom a footman leaps from the box ; for whom the train will back up if necessary to set this important passenger down at the precise spot he wishes . Plump and neat , he trots between Rolls-Royce and train on trim little trotters . <P> He looks like a man of money . You would think him a financier , and not inaccurately . But he is also a power in the social and not wealth-despising Protestant Episcopal Church . His name is Monell Sayre . His eminence in the church began when it became apparent that Episcopalian ministers should be pensioned and famed Bishop William Lawrence of Massachusetts , stepping in where others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that effort , then secretary , now executive vice president of the Pension Fund of the Protestant Episcopal Church , was and is substantial , trim-trotting Monell Sayre . <P> Pension Expert is a very real title to Mr. Sayre . Seven years after leaving Harvard in 1898 , he was Pension Expert of the Carnegie Foundation . Now he is pension adviser to the U. S. Federal Reserve system , to the Church of England , as well as to the Episcopal Church . Present assets of the Protestant Episcopal Church Pension Fund are $25,000,000 . Offices are at No. 14 Wall St. , Manhattan . Income on the Fund supplies the pension money . To become eligible for pensioning , an Episcopal minister must be 68 , retired or disabled . The average pension : $800 per year . <P> Last week , Monell Sayre went to a conference at the Church of the Heavenly Rest , one of Manhattan 's newest , most expensive churches . The subject was not money but the " mystical element in the Christian faith . " Pension Expert Sayre was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Mysticism to a Business Man . " More and better preaching was what Mr. Sayre wanted . Parsons had propounded too much politics and social uplift , not enough mysticism , he said . What the workingman needed was an awareness of God . Said he : " If you try to talk Christianity to industrial workers they simply deny it or talk about something else . It is not that they are antagonistic , but simply that they revolve in one circle and religion in another . They do not touch . What I have myself observed in many industrial communities convinces me that the situation holds true throughout the land . "
