txt " What is the right time ? " John G. Moore to William C. Whitney . " Nine thousand and nine . " Whitney answer . " Some time ! " ejaculated the head of the Stock Exchange 's then pre-eminent brokerage house of Moore &; Schley . " Ah , perhaps 1 did not understand you . " observed the millionaire debonaire . " When anybody asks for figures tnowadays I naturally think they arc trying to find out what 's the latest figure on the number of folks who have doubled-crossed Jim Keene . " Schley and round-about coterie applauded . Fine joke ? that on James R. Keene forever explaining semi-daily market switches as due to everybody else being a deceiver . So had run the record in about every pool where Id r . Keene had been other than a managing partner  --  a particular'y loud storm having broken over recent casualties in the market for Consolidated Tobacco . Mr. Whitney had been the shining head of that enterprise , and the Keene shilielah had suddenly gone cracking . A gentle-souled friend bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked was that he was sorry to have false notions abroad ; really , he was the least suspicious human being on earth . A bit later that friend entertained a doubt or two . Business  --  m.6 it was in the interest of Mr. Keenc  --  taking hint west , he landed at Brown 's Palace Hotel in Denver where a mining convention absorbed accommodation . In the midst of urgent arguments he was applying to the room clerk a sturdy stranger tapped him on the shoulder , saying in carrying whisper , " Come with me ! " The room clerk leered  --  perhaps he thought significantly . " 1 ani tic ? house officer , " the saluter confided , guiding , step in step , toward a nearby alcove . Necks at the desk craned interestedly . " Do n't you remember me ? " that officer went on . " I certainly do not , " was prompt avowal . " You will in a minute , " the stranger pursued ; " and you need n't %%orry any further about having a room for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Denver boasts of many a record , but no maximum that it ever scored surpassed that which for wonder with a shiver played tag just then up and down a Wall Street spine . " Try to think back a little . Do n't you recall ever : having to do with a man about my size and with a voice like mine  --  a man of the name of Smytheson ? " " I never saw you before , I never ? . " so irately protest started , then suddenly switched . " Were you a clerk of Talbot Taylor , Mr. Keene 's broker son-in-law ? " 1 , " Right  --  just that ! Seeing you here now unexpectedly made me a little impulsive , maybe ; usually I ai n't . ' Mighty gl id you do remember me , and , say , if you do n't mind I 'll see that you have the best suite in the house for old times ' sake  --  come along ! " And a moment later the clerk who had not a single roost left found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palace 's famous bridal chamber . " I was a clerk in that Wall Street office , " went along the communicative possessor of auld lang sine sentimentality , " a clerk there for about six months ; and , if it wo n't shock you , the day I left Mr. Taylor told me that I was , he felt sure , the rottenest that ever set foot in a broker 's cage Maybe , he knew . But Mr. Keene was satisfied . I was Mr. Keene 's man , you gee ? " " No , I do n't see , " was sighed for answer . " I really do n't just at the minute seem to be seeing much of anything . S'pose you help me slake a thirst ? " " Yes , " the narrator proceeded , " 1 was in that office ' for Mr. Keene . I applied for a job when Mr. Keene happened to be standing around , and he waved me in , was a little gruff to me , but saw I needed the work , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bunk . The day be- , fore it had all been rehearsed , for I was , you see , I was a Pinkerton man . That was Mr. Keene 's way , his own regular way , of keeping informed of what was going on inside  --  though , confidentially , my work was outside as welt as inside . Every night at his hotel Mr. Keene . got hisrreport ; every swains litere he received bit report on night doings. lie wanted to know everything ; he learned a lot . Once I sat out the night with you yourself and a ** millionaire at Rector 's  --  you a pool manager . and the Pittsburgh man carrying 10,000 Tennessee Coal that Mr. Keene wanted to be sure was n't being slyly unloaded ; and when I told the old boy that I saw you get hot and refuse to go joy-riding at two in the morning he made a comment that sounded a little harsh . A blanked ass he called you . ' When I was his age l 'd made a detective earn his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
