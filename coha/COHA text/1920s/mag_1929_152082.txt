The wind-vane on the Delaware &; Hudson Building in Albany , N. Y. , is a miniature of Hendrick Hudson 's good ship Half-Moon . Early one morning last week this vane stood very still . It was a fine calm morning , but the Hudson River at Albany was not calm . By the pier of the Albany Yacht Club , the river 's grey-green surface had been transformed into dirty , bubbly whipped cream . A fleet of 133 little launches , each with an outboard motor attached , was milling about , racing its engines , darting hither and yon like a swarm of noisy water beetles . Finally Commodore William B. Eldridge appeared on the balcony of the Yacht Club building . The boats lined up under the railroad bridge . The Commodore fired a pistol . With a shrill spattering sound the boats streaked down the Hudson . As each passed the balcony its time was marked , because the Hudson is not broad enough for 133 little boats to start at the same time . Having fired his pistol , Commodore Eldridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the winner . From Albany to Manhattan the Hudson River measures 132 mi . Railroad trains cover the distance in three hours . By air it takes 90 min . The winner of last week 's outboard motorboat race took 3 hrs. 36 min. 40 sec . When the yellow boat with its Johnson D motor reached 152nd St. , Commodore Eldridge fired another pistol and black-mustached Jacob Dunnell of Boston had broken a record for the Albany-New York course . His average speed was 37.4 m. p. h . Honors in last week 's race went to the Johnson D motors which won first , second , sixth , seventh and eighth places . Third place went to an Elto E ; fourth and fifth to Evinrude C's.
