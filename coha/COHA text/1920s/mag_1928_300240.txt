The first of three maps " visualizing the progress of President-Elect Herbert Hoover around South America appears this week in TIME . The Hoover Odyssey is chronicled in National Affairs . Lands mapped on the South American continent pass in brief review below : <P> Colombia . Of all the nations of South America only Colombia faces on two oceans . Strangely enough this does not mean that it would be easy for President-Elect Hoover to visit President Miguel Abadia Mendez of Colombia from the Pacific side . Short of flying it would be nearly impossible . For a chain of mighty mountains cuts off Bogota ( see Map ) from the Pacific Ocean , and the Colombian Capital is itself more than a mile and a half high ( 8,560 ft . ) . Even from the Atlantic side it takes longer to reach Bogota , by express steamer up the great Magdalena River , than to sail from America to France . <P> Only recently have Colombia 's adamantine mountains been conquered-by commercial air routes . Today the Scadta ( " Colombian-German Air Transport Corporation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is probably the only unsubsidized passenger and freight air service in the world which is showing a really handsome profit . All the great European air lines are state-subsidized and relatively cheap ( Paris to Berlin-eight hours-$50 ) . Colombians are glad to pay relatively dear ( $200 ) to be flown from the Atlantic to Bogota in eight hours , when the boat trip ( $80 ) takes from eight to sixteen days , according to the state of the river . Only by air could Mr. &; Mrs. Hoover drop briefly in on President Mendez-and no U. S. President or President-Elect since Theodore Roosevelt has made bold to enter an airplane ( see p. 59 ) . <P> Colombia is prospering vastly , not only on account of major U. S. oil and fruit developments ( see Map ) , but because the taste of Americans is rapidly turning from strong coffee to mild-the kind grown in Colombia , whereas stronger brands come from Brazil . The popularity of platinum and the present Parisian rage for emeralds are also potent prosperity factors , for Colombia is the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France is less than half as great as Colombia , in area ; New York City is only slightly less in population . <P> Ecuador . Day and night are always of approximately equal length in Ecuador , for it lies astride the equator . The ruling class is of pure Spanish blood , proud and enervated . In consequence almost half the territory which is legally Ecuadorian is actually within a " sphere of influence " impudently maintained by adjoining and militant Peru . Here again , as in Colombia , the factor of altitudes is vital and decisive . Gigantic parallel ranges of mountains , many over four miles high , cut off the nominally sovereign scions of Spain in Quito , the capital of Ecuador , from the vas ' hinterland tracts which Peru has quietly and simply taken . Quito perches at an altitude of two miles , has a Savoy Hotel , steep streets , abundant flowers , about one hour of rain almost every day in the year , and-wonder of wonders-a rail connection with the seaport Guayaquil. *       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
