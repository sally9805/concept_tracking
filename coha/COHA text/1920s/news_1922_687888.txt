txt A STUDY IN THE PRICE MOVEMENT In the studies of the price movement , based upon Dow 's theory , so successfully applied in The Wall Street Journal for the past twenty years or more , it has been repeatedly found that the two averages of twenty railroad stocks and twenty industrials must confirm each other to give an authoritative prediction . The railroads on July 6 gave a strong bull point , but it should be noted that an advance in the industrial average of nearly two and a half points would be necessary to confirm it . Although the nature of the secondary decline in a primary bull market has been explained here time and again , and forms an illuminating part of the recently published " Stock Market Barometer , " it still fails to make itself clearly understood and is frequently confused with a return to a primary bear market . With inconsiderable reactions the price of the industrial stocks advanced from 63.90 , August 24 , 1921 , to 96.41 on May 29 of this year . The simultaneous movement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 86.83 recorded , like the last high of the industrials , on May 29 , 1922 . Following the May high points , which were made after an interesting line of accumulation extending over a month , there was a typical  --  and therefore deceptive  --  secondary reaction . It carried the industrials down to 90.73 , or a little short of six points , by June 12 , 1922 , while ' the railrpads pa the ' same date made a low for the reaction of 81.81 , a recession of five points . Since then there has been the characteristic slow recovery of such a movement . The railroads may , therefore , be said to have partly established the fact of a resumption of the major bull movement by making a new high for themselves on July 6 . Secondary reactions result from technical conditions ( like overbuying ) and also from events which the market can not possibly foresee . Major movements in the market precede and predict broad general changes in the business of the country .

Experience has proved that inferences drawn from a single group of stocks are easily deceptive , but become of the highest prediction value when the two averages confirm each other . If the twenty industrial stocks sold at 96.42 or better , it would be a positive indication , so far as all experience goes , that the bull market which set in in the latter part of last year was again in full swing and well calculated to advance much further . With these provisos it may he said that the indication of the averages is distinctly bullish . The present hull ma ? - ket , dating from the low of the industrials in August , 1921 , has not lasted a year , and the average length of the six hull markets in the past quarter of a century has been twenty-five months . The shortest of these was twentyone months and the longest three years and three months .
