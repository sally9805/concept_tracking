 |p474  ONE descends from the snow-strewn crests of towering mountains to fat plains and valleys , to lonely deserts purpled with sage , to gay beaches and surfbathing ? in California . " Our State has everything , " a Native Son told me , and with a sweep of his arm he indicated mountain tops , fruit valleys , the booming Pacific ; and then , " Per acre our harvest is several times larger than the East . Think of our mines , our shipping , our movies . I 'll tell you , man , this is the one place in America to live . " Innocently enough , I had asked a Native Son a few questions about California . Of course , you know what a Native Son is . Before we visited California we were under the impression that a Native Son is a person born in that State . But nay ! A Native Son is one who was not born in California ; rather one who at the tender age of thirty goes there to live . Mostly he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska ; generally he is to be identified by his leaning for the following milestones of conversation : " Are n't you glad you 're in California ? It must be terrible weather back East . . . Yes , this is the Golden State . . We Native Sons , of course , " etc . . . . " You know at one time California was a nation . . . Now we Californians regard , " etc . . . " A Californian will be the next President . " And just as California 's mountains contrast with its deserts and with its very beautiful seashore , so do its Native Sons contrast with its real Californians , with its sons actually born there . You can discern the real Californian negatively . He never breathes deep and says , " This is God 's country . You can discern him positively if you say " Frisco . " The  |p475  abbreviation riles a real Californian . Even the most timorous one will suggest : " You do n't say York , now , do you ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And broadly the Native Sons have their habitat and the Californians have theirs . More broadly , you find Native Sons in southern California centering around Los Angeles ; you find Californians based upon San Francisco to the north , to the east , to the south ? as far south as Santa Barbara . For Los Angeles and San Francisco are totally different . Theirs are differing municipal personalities ; for the personalities of their people are different . We came into California , down from Salt Lake , across Nevada ? where it is a crime punishable by law to , sell a cigarette ? climbed over mountains which the Infinite must have given California to keep out Nevada laws , and came down to the desert ? the arid Mojave with rankly growing oases of cactus and sage , unfit succor for man or beast . And then we crossed the plains , those dry plains that irrigation reclaimed from the sun ; and so on into a fat , oil-soiled land a-bloom with the extravagance of tropical nature ? then into Los Angeles . " Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers call them " Angelos . " CALIFORNIA 'S MIRACLE CITY LOS ANGELES impressed me as being a bit of the Middle West set down in a semi-tropical atmosphere . Which is to say that there was an abundance of " honest work " going on , retailing by determined , tight-fisted settlers who spoke of " business conditions " with every sale ? which is all wrong in a dolce far niente climate . A city of countless shops ? many expensive ? of countless real estate developments , bungalow land , also signs proclaiming farming land , viz. , sizzling acres off on the fringe of the desert where the water for irrigation would some day be turned on ; meanwhile " own a little farm , " so much down ; so much a month . A city which seemed not to worry about the numerous Japanese in its midst , but one of whose newspapers scarcely lets a day go by without carrying some item calcu/ lated to raise race prejudice . And the Japanese ? they seemed unobtrusive and inclined to mind their own business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in real estate , and sell Oriental curios and wearing apparel to Occidentals who ought to know better . There is a decided brisk-on-the-job Middle Western spirit of " good business " in Los Angeles , and miles away to the north and east and south , more Middle Westerners are tilling the land and harvesting bumper crops of alfalfa , vegetables and fruit , and stowing away great bundles of money in the savings banks . There is little industry in Los Angeles . There is a great deal of talk about industry and banks and chambers of commerce , and various other sirens are singing to lure capital into manufacturing there ; and the Angelos can point to progress , for one of the largest American rubber manufacturers is indeed constructing a plant . But Los Angeles industry is relatively trifling . Whence comes then the prosperity of the city ? It 's prosperous , all right . Otherwise , why the fine residential streets lined with palms ? Palms cost money to plant ; of course , nature never meant them to grow in Los Angeles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting the stage . And the stage ? Just a moment . Yes , they 're prosperous with their big up-to-the-minute banks , with their " Fifth Avenue " shops , with movie theatres downright staggering in their luxury and very Middle Western in the art of their decoration ? which is to say Japanese , Gothic and Byzantine merged into one . ' here does the money come from for all this ? SELLING CLIMATE AND SCENERY WHY from you and from me ? from us who save up our pennies so that now and then we can travel , which is to acquire wisdom ; and from us who now and then slide our quarter into the box-office of a movie theatre which is to inspire us with the thought , " I could write a better scenario than that . " For Los Angeles is selling climate and scenery to tourists and to motion-picture producers . Oh , the Angelos  |p477  are apt to get hopping mad if you tell them that , particularly after they 've talked to you of " industry " and " developments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climate and scenery are most profitable things to sell . They do n't cost anything . Switzerland ? an entire nation ? makes a living on them ? as do the Angelos . Analyze it . Surely no one in his right mind would travel across the continent to Los Angeles were it not for the scenery and the climate . What else is there ? Languorous , tropical life ? Seek it rather in Des Moines . Picturesque native costumes ? Omaha just as colorful . But climate , where else can you bask in that almost year-round sunshine which is southern California 's ? Where else can you , in half an hour 's motoring , descend from a snow-capped mountain to a bathing beach and into the surf in November ? And a blanket necessary on the bed of summer nights ? oh , boy ! Oh , the Angelos will deny it , but it 's that climate and Nature 's adornments which are pouring the flood of gold into their cash registers ? Golden California ! Do you who are suffering with a cold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , know how many days of rain they had in and around Los Angeles last year ? Twelve days out of three hundred and sixty-five . Do you wonder that the movie people make the cross-continental trek so that they may expose their films to that sunshine ? Eighty studios are running full blast on the edges of Los Angeles . Eighty studios devour millions and millions of dollars . Pay rolls we think to be extravagantly high are met weekly ; and this money is being spent right in Los Angeles ; it is pouring into the coffers of the shopkeepers from the Middle West who have settled there . And they are spenders , these movie folks , big spenders . They alone , even without the tourists , would make Los Angeles very prosperous . They live by themselves in the movie colony , a place of bungalows , and often the high jinks there shock the Middle Westerners , who more than any of our people , save New Englanders , struggle against the Evil One ? and jazz . But the movie folks pay cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you weary of Los Angeles , nearby is Pasadena , and further south , San Diego , with their miles of beautiful homes . Delectable sea food , too ? lobsters , like huge crawfish , different from our Atlantic lobster . And to the east and north , one finds the oil fields of Bakersfield , the valleys of fruit , and quaint Missions back in the hills . It 's worth the trip , every mile of it ? provided you motor from Los Angeles . And if you care for Coney Islands , they have them close to Los Angeles . Venice and Ocean City , raucous with " jazz " and the cries of the " hot dog " vendors ? but there is wonderful bathing , too . THE " PALM BEACH " OF THE PACIFIC AN easy motor drive , about a hundred miles up the coast , and Santa Barbara is waiting for you . Santa Barbara is California . Santa Barbara is short on Native Sons and long on atmosphere . There , when we were shown to our room in the Belvidere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the wonderful Pacific was rolling almost beneath the windows . No unbeautiful flats of silt , rank with cat-tails , at Santa Barbara ; rather the green mountains , then the little Spanish town , then a snow-white beach and the Pacific booming in between some ruggedly pretty islands that looked blue and gray as the sun burned through a thin veil of fog . " The Palm Beach of the Pacific Coast , " they call Santa Barbara , the fashionable season beginning before Christmas and lasting through February . We missed it by a month and were not sorry . For it was fun to stroll along the very wide and very placid main street and poke in the Spanish shops without rubbing elbows with New York , Philadelphia and Chicago . Santa Barbara has charm and is different and the people do not speak with a nasal twang or drink coffee with the spoons in the cup or use the words " Native Sons . " And on the main street , close to the theatre , there is an unpretentious looking house presided over by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yum , yurni One finds no Greek waiters there to sabotage the soup , nor is  |p479  there the desperate attempt to induce gaiety , so characteristic of most of our restaurants , through short-skirted revues and jazzy music ? the real purpose of which , do n't you think , is to distract you from the inferior quality of the food ? But at Signor 's there are dishes of cheese , magically melted and poured into mysterious Spanish batters ; and one eats of miracles performed with peppers , rice , chickens , onions , tomatoes and sauces . Well you know what the Englishman said to the Frenchman : " In London one never mops up one 's plate ? blots up a sauce with bread . " And the Frenchman 's retort : " That , monsieur , is because you have no sauces worth mopping up . " * * * Well , in Santa Barbara you 'll mop . @# AND do n't forget the monastery ? a venerable place going back to the days of the Spanish governor -- cool and dim and charming . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil ? Bless us , no ? derby hats ! Do n't fail to meet the delightful old monk who will guide you around and who , after you leave , may be very sorry if you have not purchased from one of the Brothers a string of Job 's Tears , in which the storehouse of the monastery seems to abound . And one warns you , if the girls go along with you to that monastery , you 'll unbutton your wallet ? amen ! We came up the coast to San Francisco from Los Angeles on a train called " The Owl , " which seems to seek to break all known records for railroad speed and makes riding in an upper berth almost as much of a stunt as riding a flat English saddle on a Texas broncho . It was at breakfast on " The Owl , " as we were skirting the edges of San Francisco Bay , that we chanced on something which one hastens to pass on ? fresh figs ! It is difficult to imagine the gods ever leaving Olympus so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California figs ? those of France , of Florida , are not to be likened to them . To do so approaches gastronomic blasphemy ? fresh figs , moreover , with cream . The figs never find their way East in condition to do them justice . We lost two weeks of our lives by being in California that long , before  |p480  learning of their total superiority to any other breakfast fruit . Make not our blunder ; with moist eyes , one beseeches ! As our train hammered along the shore of that amazing fifty-mile-long body of water , San Francisco Bay , my companion was lamenting : " If Frisco has n't Los Angeles beaten , I 'm going home . I 'm fed up on prop palms and stores where they soak the life out of you just because they 're used to having a lot of fool movie actors and actresses throw around their money like water . I 'm sick of the hotel where they have the million-dollar rug ' ( so named because Fairbanks , Pickford and some others stood on it while discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing that this movie director and that one gets more money than the President of the United States . I weary of hearing of money ? money . I want to get back my respect for a five-dollar bill and meet some of these wonderful Californians of whom I 've been hearing . " WE DISCOVER SOME REAL CALIFORNIANS IT was my companion who , after looking out of the taxi window as we drove up Market street , said suddenly : " Say , this city has its foot on the gas all right . " Which is indeed San Francisco . Everyone there seems pepped up . Everything is busy and moving like New York . People have n't time to boast about what a wonderful place it is or how much money they are making . I had heard that your true citizen of San Francisco carried a dirk under his coat for use on New Yorkers . But when we called upon a man to whom we had letters of introduction , he said : " So , you 've come all the way from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in America , yours and ours . " Now he was a very busy man in a very important financial house . It was not eleven in the morning , but nothing would do but that he promptly call it a day and take us in tow . Shamefacedly recalling that we in New York often have a way of suggesting the matinee for out-of-towners , and then " look you up about five at your hotel and we 'll have dinner together , " we  |p481  remonstrated with him ; we 'd meet him later in the day . But , no ! " So you 've been in southern California , eh ? How did you like Los Angeles ? " We told him . We were frankness itself . We spoke with feeling . He smiled . " Now , " he said , " you will see California and I 'll have you meet some real Californians . " " But we 've been in California some time . " " Huh , " he snorted , " you 've been in Iowa ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other real Californians not to indulge in " boost town " talk . None of them used the expressions , " Native Son " and " Golden State , " and " Most wonderful State in the Union , " and " Is n't the climate wonderful ? " and " You know , of course , that California was once a Nation by itself . " Rather , it seemed to be the way of the San Francisco Californian to show you and let you make your own opinions . Perhaps he knew they were bound to be favorable . His city is a treasure . THE CITY BY THE GOLDEN GATE CALL it back in your memory or imagine it ? a city built on hills , like Rome , some of their slopes so steep that electric cars can not climb them and only old-fashioned cable cars can struggle to their crests . A city of ravines and mountain tops ? with you descending and climbing up and down from one section , from one hill , to another . Here a Chinese quarter , there an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyglot city in America , excepting New York . Yet out of these strange-tongued blocks they went willingly , the San Francisco foreign born , to fight with their 91st Division in France and in Belgium . They it was who formed an Escort of Honor that marched with King Albert to Brussels . From one of the city 's hilltops we looked down on the bay , alive with great commerce , with countless steamers and picturesque sailing craft in the Oriental trade . We looked across rich valleys to the mountains beyond , northward to/ ward Sonoma and Shasta counties , those treasure-houses of the earth . " Of course , it 's not the old San Francisco , " our friend was explaining . " The fire cleaned up Chinatown . It 's just a harmless tourist place now . We have n't the restaurants we used to have , " and he sighed . " There was one , the Poodle Dog , you know , where you drove into the building in your auto ; then , car and all , you were carried up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the private dining room you had reserved . The fire did wonders for the city . All those who were worth while decided to stay and build up again . We did not lose many . Those we lost went south , " and he grinned . * * * They like Los Angeles in San Francisco ! There is a dash and audacity about the city . Prohibition was law and Los Angeles was bone dry . Even dry in Baron Long 's famous Country Club on the outskirts of the city . in Vernon , even dry at the Ship Cafe in Venice , both places which , in the wet days , the movie folk had made quite wild . But with the arm of the law in the background Los Angeles had cannily decided to eschew that reprobate , John Barleycorn . Not San Francisco . What was a fine or two ? What was a police raid ? Not a few were the bars and cafes , our friend assured us , where highballs and cocktails were still being . dispensed . That was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles , complaisant ; San Francisco , rebellious , with a bit of bravado thrown in . Of course , the Cliff House , where in the days before Prohibition almost everyone you knew ? they told us ? used to sip a cocktail and watch the sun go down over the rim of the Pacific , has its doors closed . But after you motor out past the Presidio and around through Golden Gate Park , where they have a Japanese tea garden totally unlike anything you have seen in America , and you come out of the park and motor along the ocean watching the horseback riders galloping along the well-packed sand of the beach , you arrive at Tait 's . Do n't miss Tait 's at tea-time or dinner . An exceptional country home once , it is now a restaurant , and one very different , very delightful . Fronting the ocean as it is , set down  |p483  among charming gardens ; also being the kind of place to which one can take one 's sister , it is thoroughly enjoyable . Just as California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it has another and different type in Tait 's Beach . Nothing in or around New York approaches its charm . We would have remained longer in San Francisco were it not for the warm hospitality of those Californians with whom mutual friends had thrown us . So open-hearted , so big is your good San Franciscan that being his guest is apt to be embarrassing . Southern hospitality has , we found , no virtues that are not San Francisco 's . THE VALLEY OF THE MOON OF all the California we saw , were one to record it , would make for endless reading . To the north , in Sonoma County , we visited Glen Ellen in the Valley of the Moon where Jack London built his home . A fertile place and of verdant beauty we thought plausible the story that London and his wife traveled two months in a wagon through California seeking the most beautiful spot they could find on which to build their home ; and that when they saw the Valley of the Moon they went no further . Oh , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sacramento River to Mount Shasta , to the largest copper mine in America , Mammoth , on a mountain top with a great clanging smelter at Kenett in the valley below . One could tell of going into the mine shafts , twenty-five miles of them ; of a dinner on a bleak mountain top among rough mine-camp surroundings , but in the charming little house of the superintendent 's ; that dinner presided over by his wife who used to be a New York society girl living on Washington Square , North , a dinner with finger bowls to finish ? while a stone 's throw away , explosives roared in the night and piles of copper ore rumbled out of the mountain 's sides ? for the mine never slept . One could tell of the wonderful motoring to be had in Shasta County , north of Reading , of climbing 2500 feet in  |p484  25 minutes up a trail that seemed to hang at times on the edge of the world ; of trout fishing in the Truckee , the second coldest stream in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a wide valley to towering snow-hooded Shasta and gray Mount Lassen , a volcano that erupted not five years ago . Oh , the beauty of that northern California , stupendous and rugged and fine ? fine like its people ! You 've seen the highlands of Europe and you have n't seen California ? Go West , young man ? but do n't forget what has been said about Native Sons and real Californians .
