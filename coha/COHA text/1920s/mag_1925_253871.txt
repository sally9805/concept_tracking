In Los Angeles , seven earnest young men marched one after another to the rostrum of the Philharmonic Auditorium . Arranging his notes , " shooting " his cuffs , clearing his throat , elevating his chin , each young man in turn orated of judges-the Hon. Louis W. Myers , Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court ; a retired Judge , a female school superintendent , two professors , a learned doctor , a bishop-empowered to award prizes to the amount of $5,000 . <P> It was most inspiring if it did take a long time . And the judges were at last able to decide that the best oration had been furnished by blond , curly-headed E. Wight Bakke , 22 , of Onawa , Iowa , a junior at Northwestern University ( Evanston , Ill . ) . They awarded the $2,000 first prize to Bakke for saying , among other things , that the U. S. Constitution is not " an old faded parchment in the Nation 's capital , but a document written on the heart of every American . It bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed by but one name our own . . . . Through our amending power or through customs which we create , we are constantly enriching its terms , giving new meanings to old phrases . When Americans have realized their responsibility , they have written into the Constitution the inalienable rights of every citizen , they have given to women an equal chance to express themselves through the ballot , they have made our Nation a saloonless Nation , they have made slaves men .
