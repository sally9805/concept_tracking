Not only were these three among the foremost men in their denominations , but the meeting was planned by the merchants of the city , though the churches furnished the speakers : Mgr . CHIDWICK , Dr. CAD- 1 MAN and Dr. Muss . They all came , like the Three Wise Men of old , in common homage to the spirit that pervades the teachings of the Founder of Christianity . Mgr .
