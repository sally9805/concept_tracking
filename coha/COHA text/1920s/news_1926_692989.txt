txt When the " boss " became a " leader , " he must have felt an obligation , coupled with a chuckling satisfaction , to show that the new name would not impair the thoroughness of his work . Recent evidence , in rich volume , proves that he has increased his already high efficiency . Grand Republican " leaders " have been revealed in Pennsylvania and Illinois . It is a pleasure to add to our collection Mr. MORRIS ELLER , Crowe-Barrett " leader " of the Twentieth Ward of Chicago . With just pride he calls his organization " wonderful ; the best in Chicago . " The best in Chicago can hardly be excelled ' even by the best in Philadelphia . Of whom is Chicago 's best composed ? " Job-hunters and my personal friends . " Fifty-two placemen get from $190 to $200 a month ; say $125,000 a year distributed at the good pleasure of the " leader . " He Is too prudent to incur the danger of being called worse than an infidel . Six members of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be . The results of the wonderful system speak for themselves . " Naturally we got pretty near a unanimous vote . " This is no exaggeration . Originally Colonel SMITH was credited with 7,212 votes in the Twentieth and Senator with 217 . Even the snooping " official recount " gave Smrra 6,406 and MCKINLEY 345 . So the . wonderful triumph of the best organization in Chicago remains undimmed . " Do n't think that this was brought about without unremitting attention to details and rigor of method . County Judge JARECKI , Democrat , supervises Chicago election officials . In the course of his duties he examined the Eleventh Precinct of the Twentieth Ward : The registered vote was 781 . On primary day there Were 780 votes cast . I found that seven registered had died , 130 to 140 had not been known to the people in the territory . I watched the , election there closely and on election day I received complaints about that ward . One man was on his way to vote when a machine traveling at a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All through the day we received complaints of gun threats , of intimidation of judges and clerks . A worker was kidnapped and  --  dropped several miles away after 8 P. M. His . overcoat and some po were taken from him . These modern pleasantries of Eatanswill , if actual , illustrate the humor and the strength of the machine . ' Judge JARECKI thinks that the election was dishonest in a majority of the precincts in the Twentieth Ward . That is only an opinion ; and he have been unconsciously prejudiced by the fact that he had just sentenced four lelection judges to six months ' imprisonment for making false primary returns . At any rate , the Crowe-Barrett machine ? of the Twentieth is clearly " wonderful , " even if the substantial " unanimity " which it brings about be the result of artificial processes ; and the " leader " is as much . of an improvement upon the " boss " as the direct primary is upon the convention .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
