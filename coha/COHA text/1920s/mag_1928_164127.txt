Jews . Almost as a retort to recent racial increments of the Smith following ( see p. 8 ) , announcement was made last week that Herbert N. Straus , secretary &; treasurer of R. H. Macy &; Co . ( Manhattan department store ) , would be Republican treasurer for New York State . At the Kansas City convention , Mr. Straus offered to bet large sums at 2 to i that Hoover would carry , not merely New York State , but New York City itself against Smith . His first public stroke in his new office was to write letters to 3,600 golf clubs and ask them to close for a few hours on election day . <P> Italians . Another racial question was raised last week when a Dr. Charles Fama of the Bronx , N. Y. , promulgated the prophecy that 90% of the country 's Italian-American vote would be pro-Hoover . The reason , according to Dr. Fama , was that Italians have been taught to favor " separation of church and state . " Dr. Fama charged that secret orders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith . Such orders , he said , would be indignantly disobeyed . <P> Germans . Even higher-95%-was an estimate placed upon the pro-Hoover vote forthcoming from German-Americans .

Koenig of the Milwaukee Steuben Society said : " Nothing could be more ridiculous than such statements . The sentiment of the German-Americans of Wisconsin is overwhelmingly for Governor Smith . " <P> Secretary Charles Wolfram of the Steuben Society of America denied that any significant conference of German-Americans had been held . A poll of local sentiment was being taken , he said , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Traditionally , Germans cherish beer and Hooverism is not beery . Supposedly , they still dislike the Hoover who interfered with Germany 's War measures in Belgium . <P> Counterbalancing , is a belief , cherished by some branches of the Hoover family that Andrew Hoover , Maryland Quaker , progenitor of the family in the U. S. and the Nominee 's **29;12639;TOOLONG , came to this country in 1740 or before , not from Holland as some have said but direct from Germany . He signed his name Andreas Huber at first . He spoke " high " German . He is thought to have become a Quaker after his arrival in the U.S.
