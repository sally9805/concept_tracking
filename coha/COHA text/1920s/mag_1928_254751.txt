Quiet , steady progress toward a wider democracy and a stronger commercial structure is now the tempo of Japanese affairs . <P> Progress loomed even in the perfunctory opening of the Imperial Diet , last week , by the ugly but sublime " Son of Heaven , " His Majesty the Tenno ( Emperor ) Hirohito . All present knew that the present session is the final one of the last diet to be elected under a law which enfranchised only 3,000,000 property owning Japanese . The new law , to become operative when a new Diet is elected this spring , enfranchises 9,600,000 adult males . Hereafter the unenfranchised will consist of women and of those men who are either paupers or receive charitable aid from the state or individuals . <P> Since the new Tenno has not yet been crowned-barely a year having elapsed since his father 's death-the Diet unanimously voted , last week , a munificient appropriation for the forthcoming coronation . <P> Commercial progress was signalized by the fact that Japan has recovered her financial equilibrium after weathering the appalling panic of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced even the great house of Suzuki into bankruptcy ( TIME , April 18 ) , and toppled the cabinet of Premier Reijiro Wakatsuki ( TIME , May 2 ) who has been succeeded by Premier Baron Gchi Tanaka . <P> Today healthy recovery conditions are signalized by three facts : 1 ) Japan 's unfavorable foreign trade balance has been sharply reduced by wise retrenchment ; 2 ) Money has grown sufficiently plentiful in Tokyo so that large issues of securities are again being placed there , notably the recent Osaka Municipal Loan ; 3 ) Tourist spending in Japan is on the boom ; 4 ) Japanese interests in Manchuria are prospering under the firm if iniquitous rule of Marshal Chang Tso-lin.
