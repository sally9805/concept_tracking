As yet , the political side of the World Court issue is largely confined to agitation within the Republican party . It is too early to classify the opinions of the party as a whole-all shades of opinion are to be found . There is no open break as yet between the President and any faction over the Court issue . Reports continue to say that the President will press the issue . Senator Watson and others are opposed to his doing so-largely , it is assumed , in fear of the consequences in the elections of 1924 . Senator Hiram Johnson is expected to lead the isolationists in a fight " against the Court at any cost . " Senator Capper of Kansas ( a farm bloc leader ) says that the farmers are " for " the Court . Senator Borah declares that the proposal is " ineffectual . " Senator Pepper believes that it is time to " go beyond " the Court and accept the League with modifications . " Senator Lodge , Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , is lukewarm . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the President 's proposal as the best measure practical at the present time . Senator Carter Glass of Virginia ( a former member of the Wilson cabinet ) expressed this as his intention . It is equally possible that the Democrats may take the opposite course , if the Republicans try to pass the Court proposal with reservations . Ex-President Wilson in a letter to the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee declared : " I approve not of the conditional but of the unconditional adhesion of the United States to the World Court . " Meanwhile Mr. Harding is reported to be embarrassed by the early announcement of his candidacy in 1924 . He may even abandon his contemplated speaking tour of the country ( in which he was expected to advocate the Court ) , if it appears that he will have to come before the country not as the president of the United States but as a campaigning candidate .
