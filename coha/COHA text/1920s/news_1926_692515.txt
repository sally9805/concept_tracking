txt Colonel John C. Coolidge continued to fail today . . Reports from the sick-room of the President 's aged father , critically ill at his farm home here , indicated that his vitality was ebbing slowly . Colonel Coolidge 's long illness , Dr. Albert M. Cram of Bridgewater Indicated , has reached a phase where only his great vitality is prolonging his life . Only a little liquid nourishment can be taken , and the weakness of the eightyyear-old patient Is extreme . Dr. Cram. who preserved close reticence in the earlier stages of the Colonel 's illness , now has lifted the veil , and the neighbors who gather each day in the Plymouth general store to hear reports from the sick-room believe that the end is only a question of time . Today 's bulletin read : " The condition of Colonel Coolidge has remained unchanged , during the past twenty-four hours except that his heart is a trifle slower . His temperature and respiration are normal . He is very quiet and in no pain , but weaker than yesterday . All possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 60 . Asked to enlarge on this brief statement Dr. Cram said that early today Colonel Coolidge 's pulse had been 74 , but by afternoon it had receded to 60 . He admitted that sedatives were being administered to relieve the patient 's suffering . " I could have phrased the last sentence of the bulletin in other words , " the physician said . " However , it is understandable as it is . " For the most part the physician has confined his visits to the Coolidge home to one each day , keeping in touch with the Colonel 's condition by telephone between the calls . Last Thursday , when a sinking spell followed a digestive disorder , he remained in Plymouth until after midnight , and today , on leaving for the seven-mile drive back to his Bridgewater home , he said he probably would return here tonight . From this the neighbors deduced that the situation was more than usually critical . But at 9 o'clock tonight Dr. Cram telephoned from Bridgewater that he would make no night visit to the Coolidge home unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report from the Coolidge household that the condition of Colonel Coolidge had not changed since his call earlier in the day . Colonel Remains Cheerful . Despite his weakness , Colonel Coolidge was cheerful this morning after a restful night . For some time vis- itors have been excluded from his I room , but an exleption has been made in the case of a few relatives . To ' day Mrs. John J. Wilder , aunt of President Coolidge and effectionately known in the village as " Aunt Grace , " was admitted to see the sick man . The Colonel was able to tell his visitor that he was feeling well and had rested comfortably during the night . Mrs. Wilder returned to her home . which adjoins the Coolidge farmhouse , firmly convinced that the Colonel was much better , but her optimism was not shared by her husband , who is " Uncle John " to Plymouth folk . " Aunt Grace " took out her scrapbook and worked for an hour pasting up newspaper clippings and pictures relating to Colonel Coolidge , bringing up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . For some time the diet of the sick man has been restricted to liquids and great difficulty has been met in finding food that he could assimilate . He has suffered much from attacks of hiccoughing . Many messages have been received with suggestions for counteracting these . One telegram from a person in Pittsburgh said lemon juice was a sovereign remedy . Boston Specialist Consulted . Dr. Cram has held frequent consultations by telephone with Boston specialists , who have been interested in Colonel Coolidge 's case , and also with Major Coupal , the President 's personal physician . Those in close touch with the course of Colonel Coolidge 's illness said today that in its early stages the hardest thing for him to endure was the enforced inactivity . A man of great strength and spirit , his life had been busy and full of affairs , up to the past year . In his day he had held every office in the gift of the town , including a term of one year as Selectman . For many years he was Postmaster and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when he sold the general store thirteen years age to Miss Florence Gilley , its pr.sent owner , he was reluctant to take the step because it would cut him off from the duties of the post office . After the condition of his health forced him to take to bed the Colonel chafed at the fate which held him helpless . He continued until recently to follow closely the doings of the village folk , maintaining this interest until the time when he was pronounced too weak to talk to visitors . Snow Blocks Road to Ludlow . No progress was made today toward clearing the road to Ludlow in preparation for a possible visit by the President , but the neighboring town of Woodstock offered to send assistance for the work if needed . The tractor snow plow which broke down in the drifts at the Ludlow end had not been repaired . A five-ton.tractor owned by the State was brought today from Rutland to Ludlow , clearing the thirty miles of highway between these two points , and will be ready tomorrow to start on the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little union meeting house here where Colonel Coolidge used to attend worship , but no services were held . The Rev. John White of Sherburne , an Episcopal clergyman , who holds Sunday services here in the Summer months , is unable to make the trip to Plymouth in Winter . The usual Saturday night dance was held last night in the public hall over the general store . The attendance was unusually large , for many came from outlying parts of the town to obtain news of the Colonel . More than twoscore couples danced for several hours to the music of a three-piece orchestra which has performed before the President and Mrs. Coolidge on their visits here : The orchestra members are Mrs. Cassie Cady , piano ; Louis Carpenter , violin , and Clarence E. Blanchard , clarinet . Herbert E. Moore acts as prompter . Square dances alternated on the program with the waltz , one step , and fox trot , the most advanced steps in vogue at Plymouth Notch .                @ @ @ @ @
