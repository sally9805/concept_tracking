HE MORAL CRISIS OF PROHIBITION " is the title of an editorial in the Christian Century , which comes close to being the most Christian chuich periodical in America . This paper attacks the political methods of the Anti-Saloon League , saying : If the churches are to continue to support prohibition as a moral issue they can not do so on a basis which is itself morally questionable . Prohibition is a moral issue , not the moral issue . It does not transcend nor fuse into itself all the other moralities . . .. Almost without knowing how it happens they the churches find themselveswalking arm in arm with the Ohio gang , with a Len Small-Frank Smith gang , with that most cynical , most sinister of American figures , the " political Dry " . .. . While the church is being maneuvered into alliance with political infamy , laws may stand or laws may fall , but the moral authority of the church can not survive . This is refreshing candor , and indicative , perhaps , of a new awakening . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more exhibits of " political Dryness . " The first came in the story of the arrest of the Governor of Alabama at a liquor-drinking party . The dispatches report that a Negro servant , after receiving a promise of pardon from the Governor , long an ardent political Dry , assured the court that the liquor was his and that he was giving it to the Governor and his friends . The other and more encouraging exhibit is a speech by Governor Pierce of Oregon , who is said to be personally as well as politically Dry : he calls for a new campaign of education , charging that the attempt to browbeat people into Dryness has failed . " We can not legislate people into being moral and temperate , " he says . And he is right ; this country has had too much political and not enough personal Dryness . A NOTHER ELECTION SCANDAL has bobbed up to bother the Republicans  --  this time in their own State of Maine , where Arthur R. Gould , a rich Republican , was elected as United States Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' charge was that Mr. Gould went far beyond the legal limits of primary expenditures in his recent campaign . This was declared unproved by the Secretary of State . Worse than this , his Democratic opponent has brought out the fact that Mr. Gould in 1918 paid $100,000 to the then Prime Minister of New Brunswick , Mr. Flemming , during the construction of the St. Johns Valley and Quebec Railway , of which Mr. Gould was the leading spirit . This was termed an act of bribery by Chief Justice Harrison A. McKeown of New Brunswick and , because Mr. Gould had been held personally guilty of this bribery , he was non-suited in the effort made by him and his associates to recover $335,000 which they claimed was due them from the Province . Mr. Gould admits that the $100,000 was paid , but asserts that it was done against his protest by his associates , that it was not a bribe but a political assessment demanded by the Premier as the price for the continuance of this American enterprise . Subsequently , Mr. Gould declares , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused his company was put out of business . Since he adds that every American enterprise in New Brunswick was similarly held up by politicians , it is evident that we have here a first-class scandal which should be investigated by the authorities in Canada as well as by the Senate of the United States . S ECRETARY HOOVER rejoices , and well he may , that in the fiscal year 1925-1926 prosperity in the United States reached a point never before attained in the volume of production and consumption , in the quantity of exports and imports , and in the rate of wages . He admits that there are three or four bad spots  --  the New England textile industry , the bituminous coal fields , and , " in two or three sections , " the agricultural industry . On the whole , he declares , " the country was able to maintain the highest standard of living in its history  --  a standard far above that in most other countries of the world at this or any other time . " Since the close of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never confined to only two or three sections , has grown steadily worse , particularly among the cotton growers . In Iowa the situation is alarming ; no less than nineteen banks failed there in one week , all in agricultural sections . In North Dakota , where 600,000 persons inhabit a State larger than New York , conditions are equally harassing , while in the East the farmers are just about able to hold out , though making no money . On the same day that Mr. Hoover declared that agricultural conditions were improving , Senator Brookhart of Iowa declared that " America 's much-vaunted prosperity means sheriff sales for the farmer . " A million farmers , he asserted , have lost their homes during the Coolidge and Harding Administrations . Laws , he added , have created this situation and only new laws can remedy it . As a matter of fact , the worst offenders are the tariff laws ; we are seeing now the fine flowering of the protective tariff system which has exalted manufacturing at the expense of agriculture . Perhaps the Business Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Nagel as its chairman , will see and recognize this truth . T HE REVOLT OF THE JUDGES will doubtless result in the modification of some of the more hysterical provisions of the Baumes laws in New York . Designed to reduce crime they are succeeding most effectively in reducing justice . They have so completely robbed the courts of their discretionary powers in sentencing offenders previously convicted for felonies that one judge after another has protested . Judge Taylor 's refusal to give a life sentence to a Negro with three previous convictions , who had been induced by the District Attorney 's office to plead guilty as a first offender , will be reviewed by Justice Lewis of the Supreme Court . Following Judge Taylor , but employing opposite tactics , Judge Collins in the Court of General Sessions sentenced a man to life imprisonment and then publicly denounced the Baumes laws as " inflexible , arbitrary , mandatory " and plainly suggesting " mob philosophy in the enactment of legislation . " The prisoner had been sentenced to five years for the offense in question  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been remanded for resentence when a third conviction was found in his record . A few days later Judge Allen similarly increased the term of a prisoner from eighteen months to life imprisonment with reluctance and a vigorous attack upon the mandatory features of the laws . Even a few district attorneys , including Love of Monroe County and Banton of New York , have expressed disapproval of the mandatory life sentence for offenders who have already committed three felonies . When the rest of this hard-boiled brotherhood suffers a similar change of heart we may hope for a reversion to justice . 1W E HAVE LONG been skeptical about the alleged superiority of Jersey justice , as our readers who have followed our comments on the Passaic strike mustbe aware . Now , having watched the conduct of the Hall-Mills murder trial , we are emphatically of the opinion that whatever the verdict another severe blow has been dealt to the judiciary in that State by the conduct of the case . In common , we are convinced , with multitudes of people , we have found ourselves disgusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has only himself to thank if the avei age newspaper-reader considers him a mountebank , a play actor , and a low-grade politician with no regard for the standards and ethics of his profession . But what shall one say of the judges who permitted this prosecuting attorney to turn upon Henry Stevens and ask him whether his mother was a virtuous woman and whether his brother was not the bastard child of a mulatto ? No one can pretend that these questions had the remotest connection with the guilt or the innocence of the Stevens brothers . No judge who respected his ermine would have permitted them to be asked . Such a happening would have been unthinkable in an English courtroom . The tables are turned when well-to-do and cultivated people thus suffer the treatment accorded to Negroes , radicals , and friendless folk in general , but the dignity of the courts is not enhanced nor is the cause of justice served . I N OUR ISSUE of February 18 , 1925 , we told how Roth- ' schild Francis , editor of the Emancipator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libel because of a criticism  --  which to us seemed quite within bounds  --  of the local police force . He was declared guilty by Judge George Washington Williams , sitting without a jury . When in a subsequent issue of his newspaper Mr. Francis took exception to this conviction he was again haled before Judge Williams , who sentenced him to jail and a fine for contempt of court . Mr. Francis took an appeal from both convictions to the federal courts in this country , where the conviction for libel was overthrown but the sentence for contempt was upheld . A. A. Berle , Jr. , carried the latter decision to the United States Supreme Court in behalf of Mr. Francis , but that tribunal recently refused to review the case . When news of this action reached the Virgin Islands Judge Williams clapped Mr. Francis into jail for the thirty days to which he had been sentenced and , as the editor did not pay the $100 fine which was a part of the punishment , 100 more days in prison were imposed on that account . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis refused to ask the Governor for a pardon or commutation of sentence . T HAT A MAN of such mediocre abilities and tempera-mental unfitness for the bench as George Washington Williams should occupy the highest judicial post in the Virgin Islands is due to their remoteness from our continental press and a lack of local democratic control . That Judge Williams should be able to vent his spleen upon so devoted and unselfish a popular leader as Mr. Francis  --  who had incurred judicial displeasure by opposing the reappointment of Judge Williams  --  should be an argument in Congress for ending the anomalous and - autocratic " temporary government " by naval officers that has spelled political dissatisfaction and economic disaster for the islands since we acquired them almost ten years ago . Incidentally the sentence of Mr. Francis calls attention to the unfairness of compelling a man to work out a fine at the rate of $1 a day . The extreme penalty for contempt of court in the Virgin Islands is thirty days in jail , but to this may be added a fine of $200 , which if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era is far in the background when even the humblest worker 's time could be - rated at $1 a day . Prisoners ought to demand a more adequate rate . If necessary to obtain it , they would be justified in walking out . T HE SALE OF THE WHITE STAR LINE to the Royal Mail Steamship Company interests consummates a deal which will be of considerable value to that lame duck , the International Mercantile Marine , an organization to dominate the North Atlantic trade formed by the elder J. P. Morgan on an economically unsound basis . It has been attacked from the beginning as an organization inimical both to American interests and to British interests , for it has meant the operating of ships under three flags by one company . For a long time past the sale of the White Star ships has plainly been called for , but for some mysterious reason the bargain arrived at between the International Mercantile Marine and the Furness-Withy interests , outlined in our editorial of May 12 , 1926 , failed to go through . The acquisition of the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator , controlling , , as he now does , 538 ships  --  he bought his first steamer in 1889 . Since he became chairman of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1902 it has acquired the fleets of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company , the Glen Line , the Shire Line , the Lamport and Holt Line , the Forwood Line , the Shaw , Savile , and Albion Line , the great Union Castle fleet of fifty vessels , the Elder , Dempster Line , and now the White Star Line . If Baron Kylsant continues absorbing fleets we may yet see almost a monopoly of British shipping in one man 's hands . I N 1895 A MARRIAGE was contracted and solemnized at St. Thomas 's Church in New York City . In 1920 the marriage was dissolved and each of the divorced pair married again . In 1926 the original marriage was annulled , declared never to have existed , by the Rota , high court of the Roman Catholic Church . This apparently superfluous formality was carried out in order to regularize - in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons involved , whose Catholic husband was not permitted to marry a divorced woman . If the existence of the second marriage was to have religious recognition the non-existence of the first marriage had to be established . And so the court at Rome annulled , on the ground of coercion , the marriage performed in New York by a Protestant Episcopal bishop . A case of bad professional manners , no doubt , and a silly business all around . But when the ministers of various sects in the United States , from John Haynes Holmes and Harry Emerson Fosdick to John Roach Straton , support Bishop Manning in his denunciation of this infringement of Episcopalian and American rights we are astonished . If Consuelo Vanderbilt , in order to satisfy the demands of her present marriage , finds it necessary to have a previous marriage wiped off the ecclesiastical record why should anybody regret that the legal system of the Church of Rome permits so elastic an interpretation of the marriage vow ? But we can not accept the optimistic belief of the Living Church ( High Church Episcopalian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be approaching a common plane . "
