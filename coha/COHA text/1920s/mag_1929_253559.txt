Ganna Walska has had busy days this season . She has fought in court with the U. S. Customs endeavouring to establish a legal residence separate from her husband , Harold Fowler McCormick . She has opened a Manhattan branch of her Paris perfume business , and obtained orders from small-town department stores . And , contrary to all expectations , she has taken a concert tour , the peak of which came , last week , in Manhattan , where she had never ventured a public performance . <P> In Carnegie Hall , as if for Kreisler or Paderewski , a great crowd gathered . Its chief motive seemed to be curiosity . Its reward was an exhibition of incredibly bad singing . But few seemed to mind . The bulk of the audience applauded loudly , encouraged the kittenish Walska ways , the heaving surface sorrows , until the few real friends of music present were as mortified for their fellow listeners as for the performer .                    @
