txt The President and Polities . Since one of your correspondents has intimated that there exists some thought of politics in the Presidential mind , or that politics is not wholly excluded in the joys of a Summer vacation , Mr. Ralph S. Bauer has taken you to task in order to demonstrate that President Coolidge never thinks about politics except when engaged in a political campaign . Of course , Mr. Bauer Is quite right and your correspondent altogether wrong but Mr. Bauer makes this statement , which is a bit startling , to say the least : " I bellexe if Senator Lodge had held the New England delegation together , as he could have done at the Chicago convention . itnd had been loyal to the then Governor Coolidge , there would have been no doubt about Calvin Coolidge having been elected ( sic ) President at the Chicago convention . " Mr. Bauer then quotes Senator Lodge that he ( Mr. Bauer ) " did not understan ? national politics , " whereupon Mr. Bauer adds : " I admit this to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of your readers will persist In giving your correspondent the benefit of the doubt , if any such may arise .
