People 's Money still remain unsolved . The func ? tions of underwriting security issues and of partici ? pating in corporate management are far from being assumed by either labor banks or their parent or ? ganizations , the trade unions . Even discrimination as among various fields of investment , for con ? siderations other than safety or yield , is narrowly restricted by the practical requirements of success ? ful operation . It is true , to be sure , that the Locomotive Engineers have in the past year organ ? ized an investment corporation ; but it is as yet a small institution . For the realization of their powers in this direction , the leaders of the financial enterprises of trade unions must wait upon greater resources and more experience . At the same time the potential resources of labor banks are simply enormous . Existing labor banks have not begun to tap them . Statistical esti ? mate is here a hazardous undertaking . But there can be no question that a large proportion of the saving and capital accumulation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom are members of labor organizations . A recent report of the Federal Reserve Bank , based on the returns of 885 banks distributed through the United States , shows an , increase in savings deposits inthe last year of nearly $600,000,000 or about ten percent . The total savings deposits of the same banks are nearly $7,000,000,000 . Assuming an an ? nual wage-earners ' income of , say , $30,000,000,000 it is not hard to regard the future of labor finance with assurance . So far workingmen have not come to their own banks in vast numbers . Habit and inertia play their parts in the labor movement as well as elsewhere . But an ever increasing di ? version of resources may be expected after labor banks have lived through a period of trial , in which ? they have proved that they can operate safely and profitably . Labor banks have begun their work conserva ? tively and wisely . To their operation they have brought men experienced in the arts of traditional banking . They are observing the known rules of safety in banking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can use it if they are able to solve their problems of personnel . For to win the prizes of control for the people re ? quires men not alone trained in the technique and ' routine of bank operation , but alive also to the-wider implications of their function as labor bankers . ON March 19 , 1808 , the Columbian Cen ? tinel of Boston , discussing the rapidly growing power of the press and the mul ? tiplication of newspapers throughout the Union , remarked , " Since the introduction of newspapers and the practice of preserving regular files of them , it may safely be affirmed , that they furnish the best picture of manners , and the most important mate ? rials for authentick history , which the republick of letters has ever enjoyed . It will be the office of future historians to collate and compare the differ ? ent accounts after the ephemeral passions which have heightened the colors shall have been forgot ? ten , and the causes which excited those passions shall only be the subject of pity or regret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of the above remarks but it is doubtful whether the ordinary reader appreciates the entertainment and profit yielded by even a cursory study of the musty files to be found in such abundance ' in many of our libraries . Of spe ? cial interest are the papers of the first two decades of our national history . Politics had ceased to be local . New leaders were appearing . It was an age of world disturbance and as in our day a new European philosophy was questioning established institutions and beliefs . Through their pages pas 's the great men of the day not with the dignified strut of the histories , but often furtively and sometimes with heads low ? ered and collars raised against pelting abuse or howls of a popular execration . The marine news , . and ship chandlers ' advertisements of " pistols , cut ? lasses , round shot and high grade cannon powder " may evoke visions of a more romantic age when privateers and pirates , instead of bootleggers and high jackers frequented coastal waters . An occa ? sional item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " among our best friends in summer months , purifying the atmosphere by destroying putrefac ? tion " may indicate the backwardness of scientific knowledge . But after all , the most striking feature of newspaper literature is its vivid picture of un ? changing human nature . American life may have had greater simplicity a century and a quarter ago , its range of interests commercial or intellectual may have been somewhat narrower , but how slight has been the change of attitude on fundamental social and political problems . In the last few years there has been a tremen dous outpouring in answer to the general question ? " What is the matter with the present age ? " Our shortcomings have been attributed to almost every : agency from the Bolshevik Revolution and Dar ? winism to the Ford motor car . Yet has there been any more sweeping indictment than that published ' // in the Independent Chronicle of Boston , June 12 , 1800 , as a picture of the " characteristics of the present age ? " " Mental indifference and apathy , insensibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempt for opinion , disregard of appearances and consequences . " " This dreadful change " is attri ? buted to " habits of ease and indUlgence , as well as to luxury and dissipation , to the facility with which not only the necessaries but the comforts of life may be obtained . . . . The great improvements which mankind has made in commerce , agriculture and the arts , enable them to acquire the means of subsistence at much less expense of labor than heretofore was necessary for the same purpose ; and every class of society is in possession of enjoy ? ments which were formerly confined to those of a superior station . " For almost five years we have had incessant agi ? tation about conspiracies against American institu ? tions . Far away Moscow has been the centre of nefarious plots . It has served as the theme of much bad fiction and worse poetry . Newspaper editors , chambers of commerce and bar associ ? ations have seen visions of the Reds looting the safe deposit vaults of the local trust company and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and good people like themselves . A promi ? nent politician , advertised as imperturbable , has been moved to the depths of his being by the per ? nicious activities of liberal clubs in the women 's colleges . Yet for six or seven years around-the beginning of the nineteenth century , the American public swallowed greedily great doses of similar hum ? bug . The wicked Illuminati , a nefarious organ ? ization originating in Bavaria , had undermined pub ? lic and private morals in France and produced the terrible upheavals of the great revolution . They were now at work in America and similar results impended . " War , murders , executions , robberies , profligacy of manners , impurity and atheism " had swept France , declared a writer in the Connecticut Courant , September is , i800 . " Can we expect to share any better fate ? . . . Neighbors will become the enemies of neighbors , brothers of brothers , fathers of their sons , and sons of their fathers . Murder , robbery , rape , adultery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be rent with cries of distress , the soil soaked with blood , and the nation black with crimes . " Surely a de ? scription worthy of a place in the Boston Tran ? script , a hundred and twenty years later . Yet peo ? ple honestly believed in this conspiracy . Intoler ? ance and fear were abroad in the land . Typical of this fear is an oration by Thomas Day , a member of the Williams College faculty , delivered on the Fourth of July , 1799 , and re ? ported in the Farmer 's Museum of July 22 . Ac ? cording to Mr. Day , a great organization was atwork throughout the land : " Its numbers are im ? mense ; its strength is formidable ; its resources are ample ; its efforts not half exhausted are di ? rected against the peace and happiness of every nation under Heaven . " " We are told , " says a writer in the Connecticut Courant in 1800 , " that our countrymen will not engage in hostilities and commit enormities even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But let it be re ? membered that the same means are being used to excite class hatred , which have already produced the horrors of the Reign of Terror . " Our govern ? ment is denounced as tyrannical , our rulers as royal ? ists , rich men as harpies preying on the heart 's blood of the poor , taxes as laid to enrich the few at the expense of the many . Besides , we have thousands of foreigners in this country , the refuse of Europe , who have fled from the pillory and the gallows and are here stirring up rebellion , watching for plunder , and rioting in the thoughts of dividing the property of the honest and industrious . The most violent and most to be dreaded among these foreigners are the Frenchmen and Irishmen . " " The United Irishmen , Frenchmen , and destitute rabble of our cities , " says the New England Palladium , ' December 31 , 1802 , in ' a warning addressed to the farmers , " would number more than sixty thousand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land titles throughout England . In France , the revolution changed the owners of the land . Every complete revolution will ' do it . Our next will do it . " Russians and Lithuanians rather than French ? men and Irishmen now serve popular , bogeys and Moscow has replaced Paris as the source of all political and social abominations , but the spirit is the same . Yet all the above furore was raised over the progress of the Democratic party led by Thomas Jefferson and other worthies who now occupy honored places in the hearts ' of their coun ? trymen . There are undeniable conditions justifying the restrictive immigration policy of the present day , but the nativism of the Ku Klux and similar organ ? izations , the lack of sympathy for the immigrant 's problems , the tendency for the unthinking to hold him ' responsible when an outbreak of lawlessness or chicken ' pox occurs in the community are noth ? ing new . The Columbian Centinel , March z , 1799 , denounces " the inconsiderate , short sighted policy of indiscriminately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest men and good citi zens are as rare among them as worshippers of the true God in Sodom and Gomorrah . " " Exotics from the hotbeds of foreign ' countries have been so fostered in this country , " declares the Massa ? chusetts Spy , March to , 1802 , " as to overtop its native plants , which languish under their rank and pestiferous shade . . . . Foreign vices are import ? ed to your once virtuous shores . The customs , the December 19 , 1923 THE NEW manners and even the dress and diction of Europe have been servilely aped . Profligate Europeans teach you how to dress , how to speak , and how to think . Their chaffy and corrupting books dis ? grace your libraries and pollute the minds of your children . " Do the flappers of 1923 cause our editors to shake their heads and wonder to what end the race is coming ? Listen to the editor of the Boston Repertory , September 25 , 1804 , when he delivers a lengthy opinion on women 's fashions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent muslin when clad at all . . . . With regard to dancing vul ? garity has proved equally successful . The Scotch step , the Irish Shuffle , and the partridge waddle , have triumphed over the graceful minuet and ele ? gant cotillion . A strange rage for imitating low life seems the epidemic malady of the age , a com ? pliment which democracy has extorted from us , or ' else it must be one of those unaccountable freaks which fashion sometimes plays . " There is a strangely familiar sound in the fol ? lowing editorial from the Repertory , June 7 , 1804 , on the subject of higher education . " The facility with which the honors of college are obtained in , duces many to pass through the forms of what is falsely denominated a liberal education , merely for the name , and obtaining the name , their views are accomplished . Education thus becomes in every sense of the word , too cheap . . . . We must give up the idea of bringing our highest degrees of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give up the chances of being favored with men of complete erudition . What is lost by bestowing useless and imperfect knowledge on many , might well be employed in perfecting the education of a few . " However there are signs Of improvement and " the officers of several colleges are aiding the tendency to reformation , by exacting higher qualifi ? cations on admission than have of late been re ? quired . " When we see our contempories proclaiming the impending downfall of our institutions it should comfort us to remember that our forefathers were equally excited over similar phenomena . Thomas Jefferson did not destroy the funding system , neither did he succeed in keeping us out of war . The French revolutionary philosophy had no great permanent influence on . American morals , but it did further various humanitarian reforms , liberty of opinion and the scientific spirit . Progress is slow and it may be debated whether it is not largely material , human nature remaining changeless and unchangeable . , Such was apparently the opin ? ion of the writer in the Columbian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following pre ? dictions , singularly accurate when we remember the terrible decade just closing and the still more terrible period about to follow . " A few enthusiasts in politics like Peter the Hermit have set the world on fire ? millions of lives are to be sacrificed , and whole nations are to be laid waste ? but men after all will have kings and priests , religion and gov ? ernment . All the fine prospects of liberty and equality will pass away like the blaze of a meteor . Men will be no more governed by reason a century hence than they were a century ago ; fools and knaves will be as numerous in future as they have been in times past . Some men will be rich and others poor . Some will be wise enough to save their property , and others will be villainous enough to plunder it . There will be governments to punish and rogues to be punished . . . . The mer ? chant will explore , the four seas for wealth , the speculator will hazard all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the die . The clergyman will preach ? the lawyer will labor in ponderous folios for arguments to convince a judge who does not understand him , and plead for a cause which would be better determined by the turn of a cent . There will be tyrannical fathers , faithless hus ? bands , scolding wives and lawless children . Men will still be subject to pain and disease ? they will send for doctors ? and between disease and the doctor all must finally die ? and all this the fine theories of Condorcet and Godwin to the contrary notwithstanding . Any blockhead may know this who has lived half an age ? yet France will put the world to the expense of , ten million lives , to prove what an ordinary blockhead may know by a few years reading and observation . " The fine theories of 1919 seem to be of much the same order . Some may , like those of 1799 be of permanent influence , but as the old Boston editor predicted we shall doubtless have fools and knaves a century hence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
