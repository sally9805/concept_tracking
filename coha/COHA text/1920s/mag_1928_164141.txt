Those who conduct Boy Scout affairs in the City of Cleveland passed a resolution last fortnight , saying : " Be it resolved , that whereas recent advertisements have been creeping closer and closer toward the inducement of girls to adopt the smoking of cigarettes , and whereas this purpose is being more and more plainly announced , it is felt to be the duty of this council to declare that the now-appearing billboard advertisement which portrays a young lady reading a letter to the effect that girls who seek pleasure in smoking are flocking to that given brand of cigarette , is an advertisement which merits strong disapproval and censure , because it is a flagrant luring and seductive effort to entice the girlhood of America to the habit of smoking . <P> " We commend to each of the million Boy Scouts of our country that he adopt as his ' daily good turn ' the creation of a sentiment disapproving of such unpatriotic efforts as the enticement of our girls and young men . " <P> The nation 's press , as everyone knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which helps to make profits to buy publishers fat cigars . The sentiment put forth in the name of Cleveland 's Boy Scouts , caused a flurry of japes , jibes and ridicule in the nation 's press . All Boy Scouts suffered when journalistic smartcrackers suggested ways and means for Cleveland 's Boy Scouts to accost women on the street , ask them if they smoke , beg them to refrain . <P> Soon , however , James E. West , Chief of the Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America , wrote a letter to rebuke President Floyd A. Rowe of the Cleveland Boy Scout Council , whose idea the cigaret crusade apparently was . Executive West told Executive Rowe that the provincial council had a " misunderstanding as to the real aims and purposes of the Boy Scout movement . " The real aim , he said , is to make better boys , not to preach to others on matters of private conduct .
