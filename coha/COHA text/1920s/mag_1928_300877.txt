Along many a U.S. highway run parallel telephone and telegraph wires . Last week it appeared probable that future U. S. highways will have but one line of posts and wires . Reason : President Walter Sherman Gifford of A. T. &; T. announced the signing of important nonexclusive contracts with Western Union . Telegrams may now be sent over long-distance telephone wires . Also at the service of Western Union for transmission of facsimile messages , is A. T. &; T. 's telephoto system . To many , these contracts presaged the gradual scrapping of the Western Union plant and ever-increasing reliance on the service of A. T. &; T.
