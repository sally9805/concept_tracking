DURING all the last two thirds of the eighteenth century Horace Walpole held a mirror to the faults and follies and fascinations of the great world . He devoted his time mainly to keeping the mirror bright , polished , and gleaming , and to enjoying mirror and reflection both . Few human beings ever had better opportunities for living such a life . Born in 1717 , he stepped almost at once into the atmosphere of kings and courts . His father was a favorite and popular prime minister and a most curious and striking figure . He was a rough English squire who hunted foxes , told dirty stories , laughed , and , by judicious political corruption , governed England wisely and peacefully for twenty years . The son took little direct part in politics , had no taste for them , or indeed for any active intervention in the world 's affairs . But he moved daily and always among the most prominent people , knew them not only hi their state garments and ceremonial manners , but in all their fireside and bed-chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece married one . Peers were as familiar and as indifferent as other folks . When he was over seventy and tottering toward the grave , he became a peer himself . Authors and artists courted and flattered him . Great scholars corresponded with him ; and he corresponded with them and with everybody , and made his letters , next to Voltaire 's , the most remarkable epitome of a historical epoch that has ever come down to us . Not that there was any profound philosophical consideration in Walpole 's view of things . He made plenty of reflections , but they did not go very deep . Nor had lie the passionate ardor with which Saint-Simon probed human souls . But all that the most quick and vivid curiosity , watching from the most favorable angle , can do to portray the huge spectacle of the world Horace Walpole has certainly done . The great events which stirred the eighteenth century can all be studied in his pages , at least in their English and in their superficial aspects . The Rebellion of 1745 ? that last desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he shows most clearly the attitude of a loyal and somewhat terrified adherent of the House of Brunswick . The vicissitudes of the Seven Years ' War are indicated in the midst of London gossip and the daily doings of the crowd . The long-drawn agony of the American struggle appears in all its length , and it is to be noted that Walpole 's sympathy was often with the colonists . Finally , the lurid shadow of the French Revolution hangs over the closing volumes , and here , with the conservatism natural to age , Walpole 's hopes and fears were for the members of his own class and the old order of civilization , which seemed to him , as to so many others , utterly imperiled by the wild Gallic frenzy . Not one of the prominent actors in all these tumultuous doings fails to make his figure on Walpole 's wide and variegated stage . The show personages are there , the popes and emperors , the kings and queens and princes . ' They are all handled gaily and with precious little respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The writer 's nearness to royalty is insinuated , though slighted : " How strange are the accidents of life ! At ten years old I had set my heart on seeing George I , and . . . I was carried by the late Lady Chesterfield to kiss his hand . . . and now , fifty years afterward , one of his great-grandsons and one of his great-granddaughters are my great-nephew and niece . " But royalty is a petty thing , not only in the English Georges , but in the Louis of France and the rhyming , fighting Fredericks of Prussia , and in that curious , murderous , lecherous , fiendishly clever Tzarina Catherine , who ruled a vast acreage beyond the confines of the civilized world . Then there are the statesmen , who move these royal puppets , at any rate in civilized England , statesmen who live to serve their country , when they happen to be our own relatives , or mainly to serve their own ambition , when they happen to be our relatives ' enemies . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too often wily tongues and oily hands . And Walpole paints them at full length , every one . There is his own father , and the son 's energy and ingenuity in his father 's defense are always commendable and usually dignified . There is the great Pitt , later the great Chatham . It is interesting to see how Walpole 's personal grudge checks and colors his laudation of the mighty minister . Yet through the grudge , the energy , the large ambition , the passionate earnestness , the unfailing genius , are always to be seen . And there is Fox , all gifts and no stability . And there is Rockingham , with little more stability and no gifts . And there is North , that strangely winning yet fatal spirit , so auspicious to America , so disastrous to England , whom Walpole gibbets , perhaps justly , as " a had minister and a selfish man . who had abilities enough to have made a very different figure . " Beside the great and serious statesmen there are the freaks and oddities who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectator , like Walpole , naturally takes great delight in these , and his picturesque account of them compels the reader toshare his amusement . The wayward and fantastic figures dance across the stage , those of greater note and importance , like the witty and brilliant Charles Townshend , or the social Selwyn , with his strangely mortuary tastes , and those less familiar but often more piquant , like Scrope or the Duchess of Kingston . Most singular , most clownish of all , at least in Walpole 's presentation of him , is the ever-reappearing Duke of Newcastle , with his extravagant silliness , his inevitable gesture of colossal ineptitude . Take him crying , capering , cowering at the solemn ceremony of the interment of George the Second in 1760 . " This grave scene was fully contrasted by the burlesque Duke of Newcastle . He fell into a fit of crying the moment he came into the chapel , and flung himself back in a stall , the Archbishop hovering over him with a smelling-bottle ? but in two minutes his curiosity got the better of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass to spy who was or was not there , spying with one hand , and mopping his eyes with t' other . Then returned the fear of catching cold , and the Duke of Cumberland , who was sinking with heat , felt himself weighed down , and turning round , found it was the Duke of Newcastle standing upon his train to avoid the chill of the marble . " Such scenes , with or without conspicuous historical figures , are scattered everywhere through Walpole 's pages , and prove what theatrical delight lie took in the vast , disordered show to which he had such intimate access . There are the elaborate trials and executions of the rebel Stuart lords in the beginning , there are the Gordon riots in the middle , there is the superbly picturesque trial of Warren Hastings at the end . And all between there are vivid incidents of every kind : a public wedding or a public hanging , a hot debate in the House of Commons , perhaps an earthquake , which jars the observer as well as the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement out of it afterward , and recording odd occurrences and clever speeches . So , from the eager , hurried jumble of his crowded days and nights the man drew an ever-renewed satisfaction for his insatiable curiosity , and commented on it with a certain breadth , if not depth , of historical generalization : " If I have tired you by this long narrative , " he writes of one singular incident , " you feel differently from me . The man , the manners of the country , the justice of so great and curious a nation , all to me seem striking , and must , I believe , do more so to you , who have been absent long enough to read of your own country as history . " With the historical personages and events , there were the authors and the artists . Walpole , indeed , had little to do directly with any Bohemian society . Actual Grub Street would have offended his delicate taste and aristocratic cor reetness . But constant whiffs of that slovenly , unhandsome world came betwixt the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lordly nose , he was careful to set them down . Lady Mary Wortley , to be sure , was an aristocrat as well as a writer ; but she was dirty as any Bohemian , and Walpole , who disliked her , noted her dirt as well as her cleverness . Doctor Johnson was not strictly Bohemian , but he certainly inhabited Grub Street , and worse still , he was a Tory , therefore not likely to get Walpole 's good word : " Prejudice , and bigotry , and pride , and presumption , and arrogance , and pedantry are the hags that brew his ink , though wages alone supply him with paper . " Actors and singers and painters also find their place , Garrick and Mrs. Siddons and Sir Joshua and many another ; for London , after all , was a small town , and there was not a corner in it that Walpole 's eager human instinct could not penetrate . Yet , undoubtedly , he was most at home in the polished , courtly social world into which he was horn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandals , its diversions , its laughter , form the background against which his painting of larger things and people necessarily stands out . The love affairs of all these idle men and women charmed him , their marrying and giving in marriage , their running about after pretty faces and mighty fortunes , then squandering the fortunes and crowding the forgotten , old , worn , pretty faces into the gutter . What a part the two beautiful Gunnings play for him , with their wooers and their triumphs and their mishaps and their fading away ! Then there are the diversions of all this noisy , futile , vanishing mob . There is whist , which comes in like a mania and takes possession of society , charming dukes and dowagers and brides and bullies out of their sleep and their money and their wit , if they ever had any . There are the public places of entertainment , Vauxhall and Ranelagh , where everybody goes because everybody else goes , and comes away bored because everybody else was there . And over all the medley of honeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented , or borrowed , or begged , or stolen , sometimes trivial , sometimes dirty , but almost always amusing and often worth carrying away . Only it is the gay world , the wealthy world , the happy , or should be happy world , that makes the substance of all this . The vast foundation of common human labor and privation and suffering is singularly absent . When particular cases of misery were called to his notice Walpole could , no doubt , be sympathetic enough . But the herd , the million , the grubbers below Grub Street , as individuals , were left out of his pages because they were left out of his thoughts . They existed because God had made a queer world . Probably they served their purpose . Even , if you reflected upon it , their lot was desperately pitiable , and you wished something might be done for them . Meantime , you thanked God you were not horn one of them , and forgot them , till the French Revolution most indecently forced them upon your attention , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the way to treat existence was to dissipate yourworthless self in the swift , shifting , flashing , distracting pageant of life and death . You might not get happiness out of it : " I have a. million of times repented returning to England , where I never was happy , nor expect to be . " You might feel that your appetite for excitement and diversion was so endless that even that wild world could not fill it : " I who love to ride the whirlwind can not record the yawns of such an age . " Yet yawning in company was better than yawning alone , and to see and to hear and to tell some new thing was all that could make you quite sure that you were out . of the grave . As to the material side , it is hardly necessary to say that Walpole was always luxuriously provided for . His health , also , though not robust , was at least such as to enable him to enjoy life . As to the finer spiritual sides and needs , Walpole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When he wrote , at a period considerably past middle age : " I have a more manly resolution , which is to mend myself as much as I can , and not let my age be as absurd as my youth . I want to respect myself , the person in the world whose approbation I desire most , " he was unquestionably sincere . At the same time his natural drift was toward the surface of things , and his natural instinct was to play with the deeper thoughts and passions , to shuffle them off and forget them . In other words , he was all his life essentially and in the highest degree a dilettante , that is , a person who somehow takes great matters in their petty aspects because lie is incapable ' of taking them in any other way , even with the best will in the world . He looked like a dilettante , little , finical , airy , insubstantial ; and to the day of his death he was one . The saving virtue in it all was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was more serious or more lofty than he really was . So you may follow Walpole 's dilettantism through everything . No one will deny that he was a dilettante statesman . His father 's influence and position took him into Parliament . He attended regularly for a good many years , and sometimes spoke . But it can not be said that he affected the destinies of England , nor was he desirous to do so . His own summary of his political life can not be improved : " I go to balls , and to the House of Commons ? to look on ; and you will believe me when I tell you , that I really think the former the more serious occupation of the two . " He was a dilettante author . His novel , The Castle of Otranto , set a fashion of mystery stories ; but it is pasteboard , like his own castle and like himself . His one tragedy was rather horrible than tragic . His verses were trifles , and were meant to be nothing more . His memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not profound , But in authorship , as in other things , he made no claims , and while he would havedisliked to have others say what he said of himself , his modesty must be counted to his credit , even if it were not absolutely sincere . Underneath , there was always the obscure feeling that authors belonged in that horrible Grub Street , and never , never would lie take up his abode in such a region , or have posterity imagine that he did . But what he could write were letters , and he knew it , and was proud of it . To be sure , they are literary and conscious letters , do not bare soul to the extent to which Lamb 's do , or Flaubert 's , or Voltaire 's ; but then there was little soul to bare , and what there was was hardly worth baring . At showing off the great , motley , glittering surface of the world , who could beat hi &; So , when he was eighteen years old , an age when surely most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You have made me a very unreasonable request , which I will answer with another as extraordinary : you desire I would burn your letters ; I desire you would keep mine . " For a dilettante author that was beginning young . The same spirit affects all Walpole 's dealings with art and artistic matters . He himself did not paint , but he was a wide and curious connoisseur . His father was a great collector of pictures , and there are moments when something like actual passion seems to flicker through Horace 's own collecting , as when he writes of a work of Domenichino , " I think 1 would live upon a flitch of bacon and a bottle of hill , rather than not spare the money to buy it myself . " Then we read , " I forgot that I was outbid for Oliver Cromwell 's nightcap , " and we see what it all means or does not mean . In rural surroundings and charms Walpole 's interest was much less intense and sincere than in the fine arts . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " especially if it had a temple in it or a rustic bridge or grotto , with a few naked nymphs squatting about in verdant umbrage . He liked a pseudo-pastoral background to a pseudo-pastoral festivity . But of solitary rambles in the fields and woods , with birds and flowers and thoughts , there is not a trace in all his fifteen volumes of letters . " I hate the country , " he says frankly . It was simply a place to get away from the city and whet your appetite for going back again . With this idea of the country in mind , he made himself the toy castle of Strawberry Hill , near enough to London to get all the gossip and far enough to get a quiet nap if you needed it . All Walpole 's dilettantism was poured out on this dainty little residence . There were bits of Gothic and bits of classic , stained glass and cathedral monuments , altars and fragmentary god-desses and curiosities like Cromwell 's nightcap thrown in for good measure . Royalties and peeresses and foreign beauties came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his apologetic compliment and witty embroidery , and cuddled and petted his dilettante delight in it all , and then wrote to Mann what a bore it was , and generally enjoyed himself to the fullest extent . As it was an amusement to cultivate the arts with the distinguished case of a gentleman of quality , so it was diverting to patronize authors and artists . And Walpole 's real kindness must not be forgotten here . He liked to help and did help . If there was some carelessness and more misunderstanding in his treatment of Chatterton , it was certainly not intentional . And he did not overrate the position and the value of a Maecenas . Yet the glory of printing Gray 's Odes at Strawberry was worth having . It was pleasant to be appealed to for a subscription and to give it , pleasant to be asked to speak a good word for a struggling playwright . One did these things , and they much increased one 's sense of being far , far above that odious Grub Street . It was pleasant to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire it . Walpole delighted to write dilettante books about history , and he collected curious anecdotes and bits of gossip often illustrative and of permanent value . The reputation of being a learned man was the very last which appealed to this butterfly-flitter about the bright blossoms of the world . It would be worse even than Grub Street ; " Gray says ( very justly ) that learning never should be encouraged , it only draws out fools from their obscurity ; and you know I have always thought a running footman as meritorious a being as a learned man . " On the other hand , there is this to be said for the intellectual attitude of , the dilettante : it is compatible with independence , with forming one 's own judgment , such as it is , without regard to the pedantry of professors or the dogmatism of the academic mind . Why should a gentleman praise a poem or a picture because he is told to ? These things are made for him , not he for them . If they please him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are ? Thus . Walpole often has an interesting and stimulating freshness of judgment , where a deeper thinker might be stuck fast in a rut . If Virgil bores him he says so , and even those whom Virgil does not bore may be grateful to him . Something of the same adyantage attends the dilettante in matters of abstract thinking on religion and politics . It would be preposterous to consider Walpole 's ideas on such subjects as of serious importance . He would have been the first to smile at such a thing himself . He had a sort of set of fixed opinions , when you delved down to them , or rather captured them ; for they fluttered high rather than were hidden deep . He wrote Madame Du Deffand , with solemnity , " I believe firmly in a God , all powerful , all just , abounding in love and pity . " In politics he considered himself a moderate , enlightened liberal , believed in government for the people of course , by the intelligent class to which he himself belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it was seriously threatened . He liked to quote , if he did not originate the saying , " This world is a comedy to those who think , a tragedy to those who feel . " He did not wish the game of thinking , as he knew it , to be turned into tragic feeling by those who would infuse passion and bitterness and cruelty into the things of men or the things of God . Walpole 's dilettantism is less obvious in social concerns than elsewhere , because the whole social world in which he moved was chiefly governed by 4 dilettante spirit . It was not a world of real affection or sympathy , or even of a profound human interest , but simply curiosity and gossip and the haunting , , unappeasable desire to escape from one ' self . Dancing gave place to cards , and cards to love-making , and love-making to scandal , the whole seasoned with a perpetual chatter , spiced at times with . Wit , . often clouded and clogged with illimitable boredom . And Walpole danced and chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he enjoyed it as much as anyne could , being apparently built by nature for that sort of thing . Sometimes even he yawns behind his hand , sometimes the noise and clatter grow so repellent that he mistakes himself for a misanthrope and really announces a wisr to wiLdraw altogether . " I am so far , fromgrmiying used to mankind by living amongst them , that my natural ferocity and wildness does but every day grow worse . They tire me , they fatigue me ; I fling open the windows , and fancy I want air ; and when I get by myself , I undress myself , and seem to have had people in my pockets , in my plaits , and on my shoulders ! " He was young when he wrote this , but it represented a mere passing mood or fancy . He returned to the throng , he could not keep away froM it . Old age , of course , meant a decent assumption of repose , gave an excuse for doing nothing that you did not wish to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilettante enjoyment of them were his life , and always continued to be so . " I have been out three times , and to-day have made five-and-twenty visits , and was let in at six ; and , though a little fatigued , am still able , you see , to finish my letter . " Not a bad record for a man of seventy-three . Walpole 's dilettantism is less manifest where his affections are concerned than anywhere else . It is impossible to deny him a certain large kindliness and human sensibility . This appears , at least hi words as regards the more general aspects of suffering : " I welcome pain ; for it gives me sensibility , and punishes my pride . Donatello loses his grace when I reflect on the million of my fellow creatures that have no one happiness , no one comfort . " Such reflections should be credited , even when they do not color a life , or give rise to much accordant deed . Also , Walpole loved his friends , so far as he was capable of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity . His mother 's memory he adored , and we have seen that he was always loyal to that of his father . The rest of his family were not very much to him . But for the two Mantis , for Montague , for Chute , for Selwyn , he cherished a tenderness which even occasionally was realized in self-sacrificing action . For his cousin , Henry Seymour Conway , he had a peculiar affection and an admiration perhaps not quite so preposterous as Macaulay deemed it . Yet , after all , his own understanding of his own nature peeps out even in the warmest utterance of this special regard : " If I ever felt much for anything ( which I know may be questioned ) , it was certainly for my mother . I look on you as my nearest relation by her , and I think I can never do enough to show my gratitude and affection to her . " One would not expect from a temperament like Walpole 's any great display of love in the more erotic sense . Such love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even where one looks for it least ; but one could hardly be more surprised at it anywhere than here . There is certainly very little trace of love affairs in Walpole 's correspondence . He was intimate with hosts of women , laughed with them , gossiped with them , analyzed their foibles , and on occasion commended their merits . But even when lie was twenty-four he preferred crockery : " For virtu , I have a little to entertain you : it is my sole pleasure ? I am neither young enough nor old enough to be in love . " As to marriage , the following passage does not display what can be called enthusiasm : " I own , I can not much felicitate anybody that marries for love . It is bad enough to marry ; but to marry where one loves , ten times worse . It is so charming at first , that the decay of inclination renders it infinitely more disagreeable afterward . " Yet when this gay , superficial , unloving , unloved life had extended to fifty years there came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old French woman of seventy , Madame Du Defiand . This lady was the opposite of Walpole in nearly every element of character . She was cynical and bitter where he was flippant and diverted . She found everything false , and far worse , hollow where he found everything amusing . In her youth she had lived in a blind whirl of dissipation under the Orleans regency , a whirl which made Walpole 's lively surroundings seem like soberness . Yet it is doubtful whether in the gayest madness of it all she found amusement or even oblivion . She had princes to make love to her , poets to sing for her , great wits to laugh with her . In her age she was blind , and though certainly not deserted , by no means the prominent figure she was in her youth . Yet it does not appear that her dissatisfaction and disgust with life were a matter of circumstances at all : they sprang rather from some deeper source within herself . At any rate , disgust there was , vast , enduring , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life meant nothing and led nowhere . Worse even than the hatefulness was the tediousness and emptiness of it . Of all people who have ever lived , Madame Du Deffand seems to have suffered most from ennui ; at any rate , no one has described it so elaborately , and . it must be said , so interestingly . The long afflicting days and longer nights seemed to cover her with a pall and smother her . Could one express negation more effectively than thus ? " I hear nothings , I speak nothings , I take interest in nothing , and from nothing to nothing I fare onward to the moment close at hand when I shall become nothing . " Yet when you delve under the surface-veil of cynicism and indifference to the deepest depths of this woman 's soul , you find a singular nobility , a strange , haunting , searching , yearning tenderness . Like so many passionate pessimists , she was but an idealist upside down , one who asked so much of life , made so many lofty demands upon it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy her . She went patiently , obscurely seeking for something , and because the something could not be found , the sun lost its luster and the stars their charm . Here she tells the story , as she does so often : " I do not know why I was fated to grow old : apparently it is so that there might be an individual who had known all the miseries of every age : I know well what was needed to make them all delightful , but it is what I have never found . " It was love she wanted , some one to he devoted to her unselfishly , some one still more to whom she could pour out the rich treasures of her passionate woman 's heart . Hear her tell it herself : " Everyone loves in his own way : I have only one way of loving , infinitely or not at all . " Yet always beside the throbbing heart was the cold , questioning , mistrusting intellect . The final word of her whole life sums it up . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was dictating her last letter to Walpole , " You love me then ? " And who shall say whether she had loved most or doubted most ? So at seventy she fell in love with Horace Walpole , the fluttering , the mocking , finical , critical Horace Walpole . Was there ever a more singular freak of Eros ? And how did Walpole take it ? On the whole , not so badly . He was a vain creature , an intensely social creature , and like all such , he feared ridicule above all things . What would the mocking wits in Paris and London say to this sentimental , Platonic infatuation of an old woman for his gay , irresponsible , loveless maturity ? So he tried all he could to restrain her ardors , laughed at her a little , petted her a little , sympathized when it was absolutely necessary . Yet , with it all , he was fond of Madame Du Deffand , speaks of her with tenderness unusual for him , and evidently felt obscurely that in his frivolous and artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precious a thing to be altogether rejected or neglected . But what she felt about him is a far more interesting study . Her judgment of him is profoundly curious , for she was one of the most acute observers of the soul that ever lived , where her own passions were not concerned . When she read him calmly she saw his weaknesses and noted them . His vanity as to his letters ? Howell ildish it is : " Nothing is more annoying than your eternal excuses about the insipidity of your letters . Why should they be insipid ? Can the letters of a friend be so ? " ( Ridicule ? Why fear it ? Why bother about it ? Be yourself , be sincere , and let the ridicule go : ) " You fear mortally being found fault with , and above all , being ridiculous . " Yet , in spite of these rare moments of insight , generally she sees him with the coloring , magnifying glasses of her devoted affection , and he appears to her a superior being . Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She praises his common sense , his insight , his knowledge of the world , his knowledge of himself . She compares him to Henri Quatre , which would seem to he start ling enough . Then she goes farther still , and compares him to God , to be sure with a slight touch of sarcasm : " You have a thousand points of resemblance to the Divinity , but particularly that with both one never knows whether one is worthy to be loved or hated . " It will probably be admitted that anyone who could make a deity out of Horace Walpole must be very far gone . What would Gray have thought of it ? The poor lady was far gone . No schoolgirl of sixteen could have cherished an infatuation more complete . She asks his advice , wants him to guide and counsel her out of his exhaustless wisdom and experience , as indeed , for all her acuteness , she was always anxious for advice and help . She is afraid of offending him , of boring him with the ardor and tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , can not understand his coldness and indifference . Is love like hers such a cheap commodity that lie can afford to throw it away ? There are times when she is driven to the despairing resolution of breaking off altogether : " You write me , " she says , " that I desire only to make slaves , that I love only myself , and that as you also love only yourself , we can never agree . Very well , sir , let us disagree , and let us end a correspondence which for you has long been nothing but a persecution . " But how could such a love break off ? And in one of the very last letters she writes before her death , in 1780 , is this exquisite phrase : " You will regret me , because it is a beautiful thing to know that one has been loved . " So the dilettante was profoundly and strangely worshiped . Then , as the years slipped by and Time 's whirligig brought in his customary revenges , the dilettante came to worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , as Madame Du Deffand had been at the beginning of her attachment , lie net the two Miss Berrys , Mary and Agnes . Immediately his thoughts and interests became , centered upon them , as the French lady 's had been upon him , except that Walpole 's affection was hardly capable of her wild ardors and immense despairs . But the girls were charming , and the gay old merrymaker of Strawberry Hill was completely charmed by them . In fact , if it was a question of ridicule , he was much more exposed to it in this affair than in the earlier one . Not , it must be said , that he made himself really ridiculous . He was too intelligent and too widely experienced in the world to do anything that the world would brand as senile , or even as quite undignified . " If you were really my wives , I could not be more generally applied to for accounts of you of which I am proud . I should be ashamed if , at my age . it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace and color to the fading years . Love had always seemed a toy , a trifle , like all the other serious interests of life . It was no better now ; but in its way it was exquisite . " I do pique myself on not being ridiculous at this very late period of my life ; but when there is not a grain of passion in my affection for you two . . . I am not ashamed to say that your loss is heavy to me . . . Adieu , my dearest friends : it would be tautology to subscribe a name to a letter , every line of which would suit no other man in the world but the writer . " Elsewhere be signed himself " Horace Fondlewives . " What would Madame Du Deffand have said ? And , since he could not well marry both , it is said that he at least offered to marry one , simply that she might have the benefit of his late acquired title and be Countess of Orford after him . She had the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the great dilettante of a dilettante century going out of existence with a dilettante love affair ? It cannel be denied that there is something to be said for Horace Walpole 's spiritual attitude . The spectacle of the moving world is inexhaustible in interest and diversion , an endless comedy for those who take it from the thinker 's angle . Perhaps the best chance of being happy , or of avoiding unhappiness , is to lose oneself in it . Yet it is a damnable reflection upon life , personal life , your life and my life , that the best thing to do with it is to forget it . And there is something to be said also for living with intense personal passion , to.aehieve success , to achieve glory , to help others , to make the world better . Such a passion is full of disappointment and failure and bitterness . It means tired limbs and nerves and sleepless nights . Others disregard our efforts and we ourselves despair over them . Yet , after all , if we were made for any purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . Persons of Walpole 's type trifle forever and do not live at all .
