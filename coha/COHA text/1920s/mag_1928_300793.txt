Amiable , boyish Percy Aldrich Grainger , 46 , was sternly rehearsing the Hollywood Bowl symphony orchestra . He was for the first time in his life to do three things at Hollywood this week , and he must do each with clat . The Hollywood crowd , although it pays only 25 a seat , is exigent . The last week in July they jeered and cat-called at soloist Aaron Copland because they did not like his Jazz Concerto . That must not happen to Percy Aldridge Grainger . <P> One new thing for him was to conduct the orchestra in the Hollywood Bowl , vast amphitheatre built in a scoop of Hollywood 's hills . <P> Another new thing for him was the premire of his new composition , " To a Nordic Princess . " His first public concerts were at the piano , when he was 10 , in Melbourne , his birthplace . His mother taught him the instrument . Later she accompanied him on tours on all the continents . In Norway he became the friend of the late Edward Hagerup Grieg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Leeds Festival ( 1907 ) , and after Grieg 's death he played Memorial concerts for him at Copenhagen and London . To Grieg , Percy Grainger owes his start in folk music . He has made more than 500 phonograph records ; has composed more than 60 pieces for piano , voice , orchestra , chamber . But , he fondly repeats , his mother was the chief artistic influence in his life . She died in 1922 ; and he never married . <P> The third new thing for him to do in the Hollywood amphitheatre was to marry a Viola Strom . " To a Nordic Princess " was written for her . After its rendition , Australian Percy and Nordic Viola would take each other respectively for man and wife , with orchestra for altar , vast audience for attendant friends and in the glare of light .
