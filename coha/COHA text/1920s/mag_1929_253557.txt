Many a man has gone muzzy-minded over the writings of Gertrude Stein . Architecturally , linguistically , they hold meaning only for introvert imaginations . To " normal " minds they are just a loose jumble of words which induce mystified laughter and not much curiosity . <P> Strange indeed have been the noises issuing from the Copland-Sessions Concerts in Manhattan since last spring , when Composers Aaron Copland and Roger Sessions inaugurated them as a clearinghouse for untried music of their contemporaries . Formidably foolish , almost awesome , appeared the prospect of a Copland-Sessions concert next week , with music by Virgil Thomson , text by Gertrude Stein . <P> The opus is a sort of chant for four men 's voices with piano accompaniment . Its title is Capital , Capitals . It is supposed to represent a conversation among the four capitals of Provence-Aix , Aries , Avignon and Beaux-and according to Composer Thomson " is not about anything any more than any pleasant conversation is about anything .

That makes four . These that begin with B. Barcelona . Those that begin with M. Marseilles and Mallorca . You mean Palma . Yes P. Palma da Mallorca . . First Capital : Egypt .

His purpose in choosing a text done in Gertrude Stein 's way was , he says , to concentrate all attention on the linguistic problems by getting rid of all meaning . <P> Writer Stein is a doughty Pennsylvanian of 55 who has lived in Paris for 20 years , writing , experimenting , playing hostess to scores of queer artistic folk who , with herself , have made her salon famed . Among her books are Three Lives , The Making of Americans , Geography and Plays , A Birthday Book , As a Wife Has a Cow , Tender Buttons . Her letter head carries a figure like a fleur de Us and underneath " It 's a rose , it 's a rose , it 's a rose . " A large rose gob is her seal . She is a sister of Leo Stein , famed art critic , with whom she is not on speaking terms .                   @ @
