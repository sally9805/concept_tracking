With splendrous pomp and a majesty almost Byzantine , the common peasants who have recently arisen to dominate the Rumanian Government ( TIME , Nov. 19 ) convoked a newly elected parliament , last week , and proceeded briskly to the business of the Realm . <P> Splendrous was the preliminary singing of a grand Te Deum in the National Cathedral at Bucharest , with the Patriarch of Rumania , bearded Miron Cristea , presiding in his twinkling medieval mitre . Lustily sang the new peasant Deputies and Senators , clad in immaculate white homespun blouses and white legging trousers . For them the Te Deum was a stately song of triumph . Good honest fellows-some could not forbear to skip a bit for joy as the procession moved from Cathedral to Parliament . There it was quickly seen how complete had been the triumph of Peasant Prime Minister Juliu Maniu at the Parliamentary elections completed last week . Of : he 376 seats in the Chamber of Deputies 561 are now held by Maniu peasants , whereas last year the now ousted Dictator Yintila Bratiano had 318 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated Rumania since the creation of the Kingdom ( 1881 ) , controls but 14 Chamber seats . Similarly in the new Senate , Prime Minister Juliu Maniu holds an overwhelming majority of 168 over the 36 followers of Dictator-Reject Vintila Bratiano . <P> Last week , tall , aristocratic , big-boned M. Bratiano sat as a mere Deputy , disconsolate , while a broad , confident peasant grin spread under the small , black moustache of M. Maniu . Just prior to the opening of Parliament , the black moustache brushed ever so lightly and reverently the hand of Her Majesty the Dowager Queen <P> Marie . Though she had no part in the ceremony , her motherly and grandmotherly heart could not be otherwise than quickening and aglow . The Speech from the Throne ( of her six-year-old grandson King Mihai ) was about to be read by Prince Nicholas of Rumania ( her slightly weak-chinned 25-year-old son ) , thus opening the first freely-elected Parliament in the history of the Kingdom . <P> On the whole Prince Nicholas acquitted himself well . He spoke in his official capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two being Patriarch Miron Cristea and Chief Justice G. Buzdugan , both aged gaffers . Reading in a loud , penetrating voice His Royal Highness declared from the Throne that the policy of Peasant Prime Minister Juliu Maniu will be sixfold : <P> First , to convert Rumania into a democracy of authentic , Anglo-Saxon stamp , retaining constitutional monarchy . Second , to accord to Rumania 's national minorities a just and lawful share in government , whereas they have been exploited and oppressed . Third to debureaucratize and decentralize the Government , granting more authority to provinces and municipalities . Fourth , to reform the notoriously corrupt and unscrupulous Police , Gendarmerie and Secret Service . Fifth , to reconstruct the nation economically , providing broad measures of agricultural and industrial assistance . Sixth , to reverse the Bratiano policy of shutting out foreign capital , and rather welcome " peaceful penetration " of Rumania under appropriate and lenient restrictions .
