The full text of President Coolidge 's budget speech follows : This is the eighth regular meetinZ of the business organization of the Government . These meetings are probably unique in the history of nations . We have found them to be most profitable . They are necessary to the conduct of the business of the Government in a business way . This fiscal year will mark the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How successful these efforts have been can be summarized in very few words . In the fiscal year 1021 we spent $5,538,000.000 . It is estimated that we will spend this fiscal year $3,534,000,000 . This will show a reduction in out- expenditures of $2,004,000,000 . The four years will show a reduction in the public debt of approximately $3.198.000.000 . This means a reduction in the annual interest from $999.000,000 to $365,000,000 , saving of 8134.000.000 each year . In the same period of time the people have been benefited by a material reduction in taxes of about $2.000.000.000 yearly . This is certainly an enviable record . It is a record in which the executive branch of the Government shares credit with the legislative . The Chief Executive is pledged to economy in the requests which he makes upon Congress for funds . This Pledge iras been kept in the several budgets . In its considerations of these budgets the Chief Executive has had the support of Congress . As I am pledged- to economy in my ; requests for funds , so are you pledged to economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Con. greys . No longer are the funds appropriated by Congress regarded as the minimum amount which is to be expended . Every dollar that is saved by careful administration adds to the amount by which taxes may be reduced in the future . It Is , practical economy which I have in mind and . which we must practice .. had rather talk of saving : pennies Wand save them than theorize in millions and save nothing . Will Continue Efforts to Save . The people of this nation have been not only patient under the heavy burden of war taxation , they have been heroic . Their burden of taxation has been greatly lightened , but our fight must be for further reduction of the burden of the people . This campaign for economy has no other object . So . far as it is within may power , I prepose to continue my efforts for economy in Federal expenditures . What we have done must be considered only the beginning . We have proved that we can reduce the cost of Government , and I propose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look to you for loyal support When you leave this meeting tonight carry with you a pledge to bend ever , - effort to carry on your activities with less money . Take with you the determination to guard against each and every unnecessary expenditure . Take with you the determination to close the year with unused balances of appropriations . These are efforts in Which you should take pride . Sacrifices will be required . I want to see the sacrifices of those who are charged with the expenditure of the money of the Government somewhat commensurate with the sacrifices that have to be : . ede in the home by the taxpayers who furnish the money for the Government . If you are in doubt as to the wisdom of such sacrifices , resolve the doubt in favor of economy . I am speaking to you in the interest of the taxpayers . Their interests are our only interests . It is our duty to serve them , and serve them well and faithfully . They are the main support , the chief and only foundation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by reducing their burden of taxation . If you become weary under this constant call and pressure for economy , think of the beneficiaries of your efforts . Think how they have borne unco plainingly their burden . This will hearten you to ' renewed effort . Our nation is prosperous . Its prosperity is due largely to the economy which has been effected in the cost of gover- - ent . Business Encouraged by Economy . It is this economy that has encouraged business , abolished unemployment , made wages high and work Plentiful . It is this economy which has enabled uz since 1921 to reduce our public debt so materially . It is this economy which has enabled the reduction in taxes . It is estimated that our expenditures this fiscal year , excluding postal expenditures , will amount to $3,534,000 , - 000 . Included in this estimate is $471 , - 500.000 required by IL to be applied to the reduction of our national debt . It is my desire that our expenditures this year . exc- ding this amount for the public debt retirement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our expenditure program by $G2,000,000 . With your full cooperation I believe that we can effect this further reducthe in our expenditure program for the : year . I ask your cooperation and effort to this end . Our estimated expenditures for the next fiscal year are Welt under the $3,000,000,000 mark , but I desire to reach the goal this year . Here is a concrete objective . Revise your expenditure programs so as to contribute your share to the saving . At our meeting last June I called your attention to the necessity of reducing the Government payroll . The matter of personnel should be kept constantly in mind . It is the heaviest single item of our expenditures . In 1913 the average salary of Government employes in the District of Columbia was $1,134 . On July 1 . 1924. the average salary was e1.749 . This shows an increase in the average salary of $615 within this period . I do not think any one can claim that the cost of living has increased $615 in the same time . This is more than a 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salaries of all employes in each class reach the average rate authorized for the class the average salary would be $1 , S09 per year . We can not look to a reduction - in pay to effect a reduction in the Government payroll . What we are looking for is a reduc- ton . in the number of employes . Let me remind you that the Government payroll for 1924 reached the staggering total of $1,650,000,000 . This includes the active personnel of the Federal service , the several retired lists , the pensioners and other beneficiaries of the Government . This staggering total should cause concern  --  not only to us but to every thinking citizen . While there can not be , and should not be , parsimonious withholding from deserving pensioners who have a just lien on our gratitude and purse , and while inadequate compensation for necessary and worthy employes should not be advocated ; not -a dollar should he asked from the taxpayers for superfluous personnel . We have superfluous employes . It is an unpleasant and difficult task to separate people from the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . I advise Federal administrators to plan to operate with a smaller personnel than is now employed . The President is not lacking in appreciation of the high class of service rendered by Government officials and employes . He has knowledge of the technical . professional and scientific equipment of personnel in the Government service and the high average of ability , devotion to duty-and industry of the Government employe . If it were not for the intangible spirit of service . love of performance for the Government . devotion to its interests and complete commitment to projects and Interest into which many of these officials have built their worthy lives , the Government would be in a bad way . As it is. the Government service is training interests , for personnel for commercial nterests , and will always continue to be . A review of the Federal payroll discloses great administrators , learned scientists . skilled technicians and talented professional men , in many cases submerged , laboring diligently , intelligently and devotedly , and contributing the best that is in them ? and that best incomparably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service . And faithful , capable performance is not confined to these particular classes , for service of high character and value is being given the Government by the great mass of Federal employes in Washington and in the field . The disloyal and incompetent are the exception . No more devoted , patriotic and efficient employes can be found anywhere than Government servants . Their loyal effort and intelligent cooperation is making economy with efficiency possible , and their familiarity with the operations and policies of their various activities make them indispensable to administrators of the Government . The President of the United States , the members of his Cabinet , and the heads of the independent establishments and the great bureaus of this Government are dependent upon these devoted dependable Federal employes for the efficient conduct of the business of government entrusted to them . At our last meeting I had occasion to call your attention to the fact that , under the law , the only lawful estimates are those which the Chief Executive transmits to Congress . My reason for then calling the matter to your attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the Government advocated before the committees of Congress the appropriation of amounts in excess of those recommended in the executive estimates . Both the letter and the spirit of the budget and accounting act prohibit such action . There is nothing , however , in the nor any intent on the part of the Chief Executive . to preclude the officials who appear before the committees of Congress from giving the committees full and complete information on any item contained in the estimates . There is a marked distinction between advocating an increase in the executive estimates and furnishing Congress with full and complete information concerning them . The former is prohibited by law , as- it should be . The latter is a fulfillment of the right of Congress which has never been questioned nor should ever be questioned . Again Urges Economy . Before - we meet again you will have your appropriations for the next fiscal year . III formulating your expenditure program under these appropriations. keep ' , constantly in " mind the . ' Thq Tan/v.7 , , your apportionments of these appropriations , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This course has helped you in the past . It has enabled you to meet ordinary emergencies without interfering with your regular program . It has helped us to save . For the next fiscal year , 1926 , our financial outlook as presented in the budget for that year is most encouraging . If the budget program is sustained by Congress at this session I will be able in the next budget to recommend a further reduction in taxes . The outlook for 1926 is that we will have a surplus ? that year of more than $373,000,000 . Any increase in receipts will swell this surplus . And any decrease in expenditures will again add to the surplus . By economy in operation you can help swell this estimated surplus . Each dollar that you add to it should go to the benefit of the taxpayer in reduction in taxes . This intensive drive for economy is increasing the efficiency of Federal business . Let those who are inclined to scoff at it , those who are inclined to refer to it as cheese-paring , look at the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is complete and overwhelming . If the practice of economy is not popular , the results of it are viewed with tremendous satisfaction . Your own closer scrutiny of your requirements , the searching revision of your estimates by the bureau of the budget , and the further searching inquiry by Congress of the budget estimates , all lead to efficiency of operation . They separate the necessary from the unnecessary . They lead to the grant of funds sufficient only for the necessary . This meeting tonight is being broadcast .. What 1 ' say to you here is being beard by the invisible audience in whose interests we are gathered . They are watching our efforts in their behalf . We have not failed them in these last four years . We will not fail them in the four years to come . These next four years will be years of continuous pressure for economy . There must be no retreat . Foresees increasing Prosperity . We are evidently entering upon an era of increasing business activity and material prosperity . With increasing business we can surely depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . growing revenues shall not be absorbed in unwarranted increases in Federal expenditures . As the country grows an honest , reasonable increase in cost of government is expected . That increase , however , must not be timed to keep step , dollar for dollar , with the increase in revenue . Necessary increases in the cost of government , due to legitimate Federal growth . must be offset by reduction in costs of existing activities and the elimination of projects and the discontinuance of operations that can be dispensed with without interference with Federal efficiency . We are occupying fields that should be abandoned . We must reduce the cost of government to a point which will reduce taxes to a point where they cease to be a burden . Loyalty to the taxpayers of this nation demands that we secure this result . Before turning this meeting over to General Lord , the Director of the Bureau of the Budget . I wish to express to him appreciation of his disinterested and faithful service . The law has not provided a more important office than that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? truly devoted to the promotion of the welfare of the people . I wish also to express my appreciation of your efforts and my faith in your loyalty and - devotion to a continuation of the economy program which we are following .
