At a dinner tendered to members of the " Sheriffian Escadrille " *by the American Club in Paris , Colonel Charles Sweeney , Commander of the Escadrille , commented upon the activities of his airmen . " Flying in the Riff is hard , distasteful work and not adventure . . . . When the war started we knew . . . that Morocco was on top of an abscess ... a revolt of brown subject races against European civilization . ... So we went in . ... <P> " The Moroccan war is the most humanitarian war I have ever seen . The least harm possible is done to the enemy , and it is astonishing how much care is taken to deal as mildly as possible with the tribesmen in order to bring them back to peace and prosperity . It is a war of medieval times . <P> " It is also a war between the <P> French and individual tribes , each a unit in itself . . . . Whenever a tribe surrendered to the French , the procedure was as follows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be laid at the feet of the French and a sickly bull brought up for a peace offering . The French commanders would wave them away . Then more and newer rifles would be brought and a better bull prepared as an offering . The French still waved them away . At last many modern rifles would be piled at the feet of the French commanders and a fine bull would be led to slaughter . Then the French would grant the peace . <P> " . . . . We were asked to come in uniforms to this luncheon , but we did n't want to , because we have no right to wear them . We are nobody . We are just Americans and only ordinary men now . " <P> It was recalled that U. S. Secretary of State Kellogg warned the Sheriffians that they were violating U. S. statutes in fighting against a foreign power ( TIME , Sept. 28 , THE CABINET ) . But President Percy Peilotti of the American Club at Paris toasted his much criticized guests as follows : " As friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are proud of you . " <P> <P> * " The Sheriffians , " U. S. volunteer aviators , fought with the French against Abd-el-Krim until the present torrential rains in the Riff made air warfare impossible until spring ( TIME , Nov. 16 ) .
