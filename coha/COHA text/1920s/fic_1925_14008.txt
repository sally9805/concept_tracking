SCENE : The office of Lehmac Productions , Inc . It is situated in any one of the buildings that sprinkle Broadway above Forty-second Street . The Lehmac office has been only lately taken possession of . A pile of miscellaneous junk from an old office occupies a large part of the rear wall . There are great bundles of newspapers , most of them copies of Christmas issus of " The Morning Telegraph , " containing Mr. LEHMAN 's advertised seasonal greetings to all artists everywhere ; there are a few mouldy box files , part of a stray , bespangled costume , and even a ballet dancer 's slipper . Except for a huge and shining and obviously new desk , the pile is the most prominent object in the room . The other furniture is likewise new ; a swivel chair at the desk left center , a visitors ' chair in front of it , a smaller chair left . There is a filing cabinet right of center door , but from the outside it looks as if there were nothing in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy photographs of artists are on the walls in interesting disarray . They are all inscribed . " With love to Joe , " " To Joe from La Belle Marguery , " " To the Greatest Agent in the World "  --  inscriptions , plainly , that bespeak a business affiliation rather than a personal bond . There are two doors ; one to a small office at the Right , the other directly to the outer hallway . The door at the Right is unlettered ; when it is opened one catches a glimpse of the reception room without . The other door is exactly center , and is lettered as follows on the reverse side of its frosted glass : Across the hall , when the center door is opened , is another office door ; a door announcing that it is the office of " Stein , Birchfelder &amp; Blaumann , Attorneys-at-Law , " and setting forth , in a corner below , the additional names of " Leo Heymann " and " A. J. Carmody . " The rising curtain reveals Mr. LEHMAN and his confrre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . JOE LEHMAN is about forty . Except for a colored shirt , his clothes are not of the kind known as loud , and yet he has the knack of making them seem a bit exaggerated . He bulks large and forceful as he sits in his desk chair  --  cigar in mouth , derby hat on head , one clenched fist thoughtfully pounding an open palm . JOE LEHMAN gets his effects by solid driving . JACK McCLURE is a more ingratiating type . MAC , as a matter of fact , is even rather attractive . About thirty-five . His attire is up to the minute and a shade beyond it ; he wears a fashionable gray soft hat . The hats of LEHMAN and McCLURE remain on their heads throughout the three acts ; they are a part of them , and you could hardly imagine them bare headed . MAC discovered in chair R. of desk , lighting cigarette , straw hat on back of head . LEHMAN discovered sitting L. of desk , feet up , cigar in mouth , derby over eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets idea , snaps fingers , crosses to ' phone on upper end of desk , takes off receiver and jiggles receiver piece ) Get me Sol David . ( Hangs up ) He come through for that Jenny show last year . p. 3 MCCLURE Never got a nickel back . ( Tosses burnt match to ashtray on desk ) I saw the statements . JOE ( Crosses down L. ) Anybody comes in on this trick 'll clean up . I can do it for fifteen thousand . I 'd take twelve . MCCLURE You 'd take one . JOE ( Crosses to L. of desk ) You do n't say ? Let me tell you this , Sweetheart  --  there ai n't going to be no bargains , not if I have to throw  --  ( ' Phone rings )  --  it in the ashcan . ( Picks up ' phone , takes off receiver and holds mouthpiece against chest as he still talks to MAC ) This show 's a pipe , and any bird that comes in is going to make plenty . ( Speaks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ?  --  This is Joe Lehman talking . Oh  --  no . ( Hangs up . ) Bermuda . Beats hell how far away they can get when you 're trying to raise coin . ( Crosses down L. ) MCCLURE Here 's a slant ! Remember them income lists the papers published  --  taxes ? JOE We ai n't got no time to  --  ( Crosses up around desk to C. )  --  follow them up . I got to get a bankroll before morning or I ca n't rehearse no longer . ( Turns to MAC as he reaches C. ) Huh ! That 's Equity for you ! p. 4 MCCLURE Tough luck they had to grab Ackerman just when they did . JOE I woulda had his check this morning . ( Starts up around desk again to L. ) Then he has to go and get pinched with them four cases in the car  --  I do n't link up with no more bootleggers . ( Crosses down L. and hold . ) MCCLURE ( Thoughtfully ) There 's a fellow makes lithographs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOE A bowl of cherries . When you going to meet this other bird ? MCCLURE Lots of time  --  it 's right downstairs . Anyway , he wants a musical  --  you know  --  girl stuff . JOE Ten thousand , I could do this trick of mine for . ( Looking front . ) MCCLURE Say  --  there was two fellows named Levi , in ladies ' shirtwaists  --  JOE They got bit . ( Crosses up to L. end of desk ) When I think they way  --  ( Leans over upper end of desk )  --  them ham managers can go out and get bank accounts for bum shows  --  and here I got the best proposition in twenty years . p. 5 MCCLURE ( Still seated ) You know what that downtown bunch got set back for half of Sid Ehrman 's show ? I got the inside on it  --  ninety grand . JOE ( Crosses away to L. ) You 'd think they 'd get wise after awhile , with them shows they put on . Ai n't nothing but luck puts half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other night . ( Crosses back to L. of desk ; leans over on C. ) You seen it . MCCLURE A turkey . JOE Junk scenery  --  ( Crosses L. ) . Bunch of costumes I would n't send over the Pan time . But he gets away with it . Dumb luck ! ( Cigar in mouth , looking front . ) MCCLURE The public 'll get on to him some day . JOE Comedy bits they kicked off the  --  ( Leaning over C. of desk )  --  Columbia Wheel ten years ago . And here I am with a compact little drama , up to the minute , and I ca n't grab even eight , ten thousand to get the curtain up . ( Sits L. of desk . ) MCCLURE ( Leans over in chair ) Listen , Joe  --  on the level , ca n't you get it out of Fanny ? ( Turns to L. on chair. ) p. 6 JOE Do I look like a sap ? Ai n't I told you me and her was up to six o'clock this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some law against a wife having a lot of property in her own name . ( Looks front L. , elbow on arm of chair , cheek resting on palm of hand . ) MCCLURE But look what you done for her . You took her out of that five-a-day and put her on Broadway . Did n't you tell her that ? JOE I did n't tell her nothing else for four hours . And she ai n't only got the shack in Freeport  --  she 's got a hunk in the bank come due on a bond or something , and she 's going to buy another slice of Long Island with it . Beats all how them vaudeville hams ai n't happy unless they 're buying up a bunch of bum lots . ( Feet on table . ) MCCLURE ( Rises ; crosses up to door ) Well  --  it 's about time for me to slide down . JOE Do n't bring nobody up here without you ring me . ( FANNY knocks once off C. ) Open up  --  it 's Fanny . ( MAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman in the late thirties , perhaps , with an enormous poise and an insolent assurance acquired in years of touring the South Bends and the Wichitas . She does not even give MAC a contemptuous glance . Instead , her eyes go to LEHMAN , who is leaning far back in his swivel chair , his feet on the desk . FANNY drifts down to the desk and plants herself squarely in LEHMAN 's line of vision . She has fortified herself with evidence with which to continue the battle begun at home , and she feels pleasantly sure of herself . There is a world of insolence in her opening speech. ) p. 7 JOE Well ? ( MAC stays up C. by filing cabinet . ) FANNY I just been taking a peep at that trick troupe of yours . JOE Yeh ? Well , you keep out of them rehearsals , you hear me ? ( Rises , crosses down L. ) FANNY You got a show there that 's going to make history , do you know it ? They 're going to date things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of desk )  --  open this one . JOE ( Looking at her ) I ai n't asked you what you think about it . FANNY ( Still leaning on R. end of desk ) I caught that bit where the leading lady was supposed to be sixteen or something and climbing up apple trees . The thing to make them trees out of is reinforced concrete . JOE All right . It ai n't your money , is it ? FANNY No . You bet it ai n't , dearie . ( Puts purse on table ; crosses in front below desk ) And I gather that so far it ai n't nobody else 's . ( LEHMAN crosses to water-bottle up L.C. ) p. 8 MCCLURE Now , listen  --  ( Crosses down to her , below desk L.C. )  --  Fanny  --  Joe 's in a hole . FANNY Well , if it ai n't Close-mouth ! MCCLURE ( To FANNY at L.C. ) I only want to help you both . Now , Joe 's got a nice little entertainment  --  that 's all it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up L.C. , fills glass . ) Ai n't it , Joe ? And he can ring up on it for ten thousand . Now , you 're his own wife and he 's your husband , and you got all this property  --  FANNY Save your voice for the sucker . ( MAC starts R. ) JOE ( At water-bottle ) Let her alone . ( Up L.C. crosses to C. ) She do n't care nothing about me . That 's women . ( MAC up R.C. ) You would n't ' a ' had a sou if I had n't dug you out of that Texas honky-tonk and steered you onto Broadway . I put you in regular vaudeville , that 's what I done for you . FANNY ( Leaning on front of desk ) Well  --  you got yours , did n't you ? All the acts is on to agents like you . Twenty-per-cent Joe . p. 9 JOE Fanita , the world 's greatest juggler ! Hah ! If it was n't for me you 'd be keeping four clubs in the air right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FANNY ( Crosses R. to JOE ) Do n't you fourclub me ! I done six clubs for the wow at the finish , and done it for years . JOE Aaah ! There ai n't a stage between here and California ai n't got dents in it from them clubs of yours . ( FANNY crosses to lower end of desk . MAC gets up in front of filing cabinet . ) They would n't let nobody sit in the first five rows . ( She gives LEHMAN a look . LEHMAN crosses up and back ) Fanita ! FANNY Yes , Fanita , And I 'm as good today as I ever was . JOE Just about . ( Crosses R. , hands behind back , cigar in mouth . ) FANNY All right , all right . I was a bum juggler and you were a great agent . But  --  I got the house and lot in Freeport and you 're trying to get it . ( She looks front . LEHMAN gives her a look and as MAC speaks turns his back to foots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What are you going to do with your money , Fanny  --  leave it to a home for jugglers ? p. 10 FANNY Say , listen , do n't you go worrying none about the jugglers . They can take care of themselves . ( Hold at desk ) They ai n't none of  --  ( Takes a couple of steps up , back to footlights )  --  them hanging on to the edge of show business , pretending to know all abut it just because they bum a lunch at the Astor every day . ( Angrily ) And what are you doing in here , anyhow ? Me and Joe can get along without you . MCCLURE ( At door C. ) I 'll go down and meet that certain party . ( Exits C. ) JOE ( Crosses up around desk . FANNY watches him . As she places hand on hip , he takes a startled step away , still crossing L. ) Why do n't you go home if  --  ( Sits ) you 're so crazy about it ? ( Cigar in mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of desk ) Joe  --  this ai n't your game . Why do n't you go back to agenting , where you know the ropes ? JOE Because I do n't want to ,  --  ( Slaps table ) see ? I 'm in the legit from now on . p. 11 FANNY All right . But you ai n't going to get anyone to sink any money in that junk show  --  I seen a rehearsal . ( Sits R. of desk . ) JOE I do n't want no advice : ( Rises ) Go on home . ( Crosses down L. ) FANNY All right , go on and produce it . Produce it with some butter-and-egg man 's coin and that dame of the Colonial Revolution that you got in the leading role . JOE ( Crosses below desk to R. ) Never you mind about Martin . She 's going to make the hit of her life . ( Looks front , cigar in mouth . ) FANNY I ai n't got nothing against her . I suppose she either had to join up with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Two Orphans . " ( LEHMAN gives her a look . ) Who tipped you off to her , the British Museum ? JOE Just because  --  ( Crosses back of desk ) you ai n't never heard of her , do n't say she ai n't good . ( Crosses to windows L. and looks out , smoking . ) FANNY Say  --  my not hearing of her do n't prove nothing . They did n't have no rotogravure sections in them days . What 's her name again ? p. 12 JOE Her name is Mary Martin and it 'll  --  ( Sits , looks front , cigar in mouth ) be up in lights . FANNY Mary Martin . And what a temper she 's got ! Why , I was n't even talking to her . JOE ( Turns and looks at her , takes ashtray and carefully places it on L. of desk ) You mean you let fly one of them wisecracks at that rehearsal ? FANNY I never opened my mouth . JOE What did you say ? FANNY I merely asked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born ? FANNY I told you I caught her in that scene where she 's mama 's little darling  --  playing around cherry trees . JOE Well  --  and what was your question ? FANNY I says to the Director  --  " What does she wear in that scene ? " JOE Go on . FANNY And he says  --  " blue pants . " JOE Then comes the gag . FANNY I just says  --  " Drop your curtain on that laugh . " ( Rises , crosses up R.C. ) p. 13 JOE ( Crosses above desk to FANNY R.C. ) Oh , you did , did you ? And if Martin goes and has hysterics on me , I suppose that do n't mean nothing to you , does it ?  --  But what about me ? I suppose you 're trying to see how much you can help , when here I am sweating blood trying to get this show on and worried all the time about  --  ( Cries and crosses away to L. ) ( JANE WESTON enters somewhat uncertainly from the reception room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the heroine of this fable , she is good-looking and neatly dressed . She is LEHMAN 's stenographer and office girl . She closes the door and stands . ) JOE I 'd think the least a  --  ( Crosses back to FANNY ) man 's wife could do  --  What is it ? WESTON ( At door ) Miss Martin is outside . FANNY Wheel her in . JOE ( Looks at FANNY ) Take them small time jokes and get out of here . ( Starts L. ; stops at C. ) Is she behaving all right ? ( Crosses L. to desk at upper end . ) WESTON Why  --  yes , sir . p. 14 JOE Not crying or nothing ? WESTON No , sir . FANNY Has she got a knife ? JOE ( Above desk L.C. and hold ) You get out ! Bring her in ! Go on , I do n't want no scenes in here ! ( JANE opens door R. ) FANNY ( Indicating distance from door to desk ) I want to see if she can make it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for MARTIN ) Miss Martin . ( MARY MARTIN enters R. She is the familiar type of slightly passe actress . She stops short as she sees FANNY ; draws herself up . ) FANNY ( Up to C. door ) Can you imagine ? Blue pants . ( Exits up C. JANE exits R. ) ( READY ' Phone . ) MARTIN ( After FANNY and JANE exit ) Well  --  JOE ( Crosses to back desk ) Do n't pay no attention to her . ( Sits ) She 's loco . What 's on  --  ( Looks at papers ) your mind ? p. 15 MARTIN ( Crosses to desk ) It 's a check of yours , Mr. Lehman . It just came back to me for the third time . ( LEHMAN looks at check . ) What does that entitle me to  --  permanent possession ? JOE ( Looking over check ) Wait a while and put it through again . ( Hands her back check . ) MARTIN I want the money . I need it . JOE ( Looking through papers ) All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got to wait . That 's all . MARTIN Mr. Lehman , I think a shoestring would be big for what you 're operating on . And unless I get fifty right now  --  ( Raps on desk with right hand ) I 'm going straight to Equity and tell the whole story . They 'll call out the company . ( Turns back on LEHMAN . JANE starts typing off R. and keeps it up until LEHMAN opens door . ) JOE ( Rises and leans on desk ) Now listen , Sweetheart . You got a great part in a great show and you 're going to be great in it . ( Pats her on left shoulder ) We 're all going to make a pile of coin , and if you just string along with us  --  p. 16 MARTIN ( Angry ) That 's what you said the last time . This time I want the money . JOE Well , you do n't get it , see ? Not till I 'm good and ready . ( Sits ) A lot of real stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . ( ' Phone rings . ) ( ' PHONE . ) MARTIN Well , if that 's the way you feel about it  --  ( Crosses R.C. ) JOE ( At ' phone impatiently ) Yes ? Mac ? What is it ? She 's gone . What is it  --  a live one ? Bring him up . Where are you , downstairs ? Right ! Hey , keep a hold of his arm . ( Hangs up ) Now clear out . ( Rises , crosses to MARTIN ) I got business . MARTIN ( Crosses to LEHMAN ) And the money ? JOE Listen ! You 'll get your money . We 're taking in a partner , a millionaire . See ? ( Starts R. ) Miss Weston  --  MARTIN When do I get it ? JOE ( Crosses down R. to door ) Come back in half an hour you can have all the money you want . I tell you he 's a big millionaire . Miss Weston !

Then I 'm coming back . ( Exits up C. ) JOE ( Crosses L. to desk ) Clean this place up . There 's a big butter-and-egg man coming . WESTON Yes , sir . ( Shuts door R. and crosses to up R.C. ) JOE And shake a leg . ( Clears desk , putting papers in drawers . ) WESTON Yes , sir . ( Crosses up C. Picks up papers from floor ) Who did you say was coming , Mr. Lehman ? JOE ( Busy at desk ) A butter-and-egg man . Do n't you know what a butter-and-egg man is ? A millionaire ! A millionaire ! He 's going to put money in the show . WESTON Oh , I 'm glad of that . ( Picking up papers and puts them in drawer of filing cabinet. ) p. 18 JOE I thought you 'd get it after a while . ( Sits , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shuts drawer . ) WESTON ( Crosses down to R. of desk ; she has three or four sheets of typed paper ) Yes , sir . ( Slight pause ) Does that mean you 'll pay me my salary then ? JOE ( Stops , takes cigar out of mouth ) You 're going to begin , too , huh ? WESTON I 've been here four weeks . JOE ( Closes drawer , which he has left open on down stage end ) All right . You 'll get it . WESTON Thanks . ( Crosses up to filing cabinet again . ) JOE ( Gets idea as he closes drawer , crosses to JANE at L. of filing cabinet ) And look here  --  when this guy 's been in here a while , you make an entrance with a piece of paper , see ? A letter , anything  --  make it busy . Put it on my desk . WESTON Yes , sir . ( Holds position up R.C. ) JOE Do n't stop to take no bows  --  just exit .

MCCLURE I 'm waiting for this other bird when up blows Sid Bloom with this kid in tow  --  He 's just a kid . I seen in a minute he was our oyster , and a second later he tells me he 's looking to get into show business  --  ( Pause . He extends his hands , as though indicating a platter ) With watercress . JOE Shoot him in . ( Crosses around above desk ; sits ) All right , you ! ( JANE crosses to R. door ; holds it open . ) And do n't forget that letter stuff . ( Sits at desk , feet up . ) MCCLURE Come right in , Mr. Jones . ( PETER enters R. , hat in hand , rather timidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be said without exaggeration that there are some things he does not know about the world . For the rest , he is simple , likable , and just about average . His gaze is on the room at large , and his eyes never go to JANE WESTON . JANE , however , notices him . ) This is Mr. Peter Jones . ( JANE exits R. ) Mr. Lehman , Mr. Jones . ( R.C. ) p. 20 JONES I 'm very glad to meet you , Mr. Lehman . JOE How are you , Sweetheart ? ( PETER looks behind him . ) Sit down . ( Takes feet down .

JOE Listen , Sweetheart  --  ( Pulls chair closer ) I got a show that 's the greatest dramatic novelty in twenty years . There ai n't never been nothing like it , see ? MCCLURE ( At R.C. ) I was telling Mr. Jones that , providing he acts quick , maybe he could get in on it . p. 21 JOE Ever been in show business , Mr. Jones ? JONES Oh , yes . We put on two shows last year in Chillicothe  --  during the hospital drive . JOE I see . JONES During the second one I had charge of everything  --  told them what to do  --  the actors . Made over a hundred dollars . JOE Well  --  ( Leans back and humors him ) Then you know how them things are . JONES Yes , sir . JOE Of course , here in New York , it 's just like Mr. McClure says  --  you got to make quick decisions  --  think on your feet . JONES Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of ours could have bought in on " Abie 's Irish Rose " if he 'd snapped it up . He waited ' til the next day and it was too late . ( Crosses away a little . ) JOE ( Snaps fingers ) That 's the show game . JONES Well , I 'm a believer in quick decisions myself , if it 's an A-Number-One proposition . Only , of course , I 've got to be careful . p. 22 JOE ( Leans back ) Just the kind of man I like , Sweetheart . What line you been in ? JONES I was  --  in a hotel .

JONES ( Pauses ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got to be careful . JOE I ai n't asking you to go in blindfold . ( Puts hat on back of head ) I got a great gag and I ai n't afraid to show it . I got a show that 's going to catch everybody , see ? It ai n't highbrow and yet it ai n't lowbrow . JONES Sort of  --  medium brow ? JOE ( Humors him again ) That 's it . It 's the first good medium-brow show they 've had , and it 's going to be a knockout. p. 23 JONES How much money do you figure it 's going to make ? JOE Say  --  ask Sam Harris what he 's knocking down out of this " Rain " show . Ask that woman what she 's making out of " Abie 's Irish Rose . " Ask Bill Brady what he cleaned up out of " The Man Who Come Back . " ( Leans over desk to PETER . ) JONES You want me to ask them ? JOE I 'll tell you , Sweetheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only I 'd want it to be safe . JOE I 'll guarantee it personally . So will my friend here . Wo n't you , Mac ? MCCLURE Sure ! ( PETER looks at MAC . ) JOE Now  --  what do you say ? JONES Well  --  MCCLURE Think on your feet  --  that 's show business . JONES Oh , I could n't possibly decide that quickly . JOE You could n't ? JONES No , sir . I 've got to be careful . JOE Well , when do you think you could decide ? JONES I 'd want to investigate it first . Maybe I could read the play , huh ? p. 24 JOE Oh ! Well  --  think we could dig up a script for  --  ( PETER looks R. at MAC ) Mr. Jones , Mac ? ( He shakes his head for MAC to say " no . " ) MCCLURE ( Quickly ) No , afraid not .

So he asks a bunch of people to come around and hear him read his new play . Now  --  ( Rises ) he starts in to read , and he says , " The first scene is in an orchard "  --  and when he says " orchard , " instead of his going on reading , we work that new trick everybody 's talking about . ( PETER looks at MAC . ) MCCLURE We call it the " cut-back . " JOE Black out , quick change , lights up , and it 's this orchard . Get it ? JONES Um-hm . Just the way he said .

JOE She 's younger , see ? About seventeen and playing around the trees . Then along comes this guy  --  JONES Who ? MCCLURE The same fellow that was the playwright . JOE He makes love to her , only he 's too nice about it . She wants some bozo that 'll give her a lot of hot stuff . You know women . ( Leans over desk . ) JONES Say  --  ( Business of hand as if he knew all about them . ) JOE So this fellow does a getaway and in blows this other baby . From New York , see , and dressed sorta loud . He gives her an earful about how beautiful she is , and anyhow , she falls for him . MCCLURE Do n't forget the priest . JOE ( Over desk ) Oh , yeh .

MCCLURE The fellow she 's married to croaks the guy that insulted her . JONES That 's a good thing . I 'm glad of that . JOE That 's a good thing . I 'm glad of that . JOE ( Backs away ) Music stops , police ,  --  who done it ? ( Bends over desk ) She says she done it . JONES But  --  were n't there a lot of people around at the time ? JOE Sure they was .

JONES Well , I 'm not  --  JOE Wait for the surprise ! A lot of trial stuff , so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so  --  she keeps on saying she done it , and finally this judge he gives her fifteen years .

MCCLURE The father used to be a lawyer . p. 28 JOE Yeh . Anyhow , it goes back and forth , and she gets crying , and more and more , and goes crazy sorta  --  and finally they drag her off , cursing like a trooper . That 's your first act . ( Starts up C. ) JONES It 's a great start , all right . ( Puts hat on table . LEHMAN takes off coat and throws it up C. ) MCCLURE The name of it is " Her Lesson . " JOE ( Crosses down to C. ) Yeh  --  " Her Lesson . " It 's a big moral play , see  --  we get all the women . JONES Good . JOE Second act . Ten years later , and she 's just getting out of jail .

She do n't know his name , see ? And who does it turn out to be but this other guy that wanted to marry her . p. 29 JONES What 's he say ? JOE He gives her a long spiel , and she makes up her mind to go straight . But she ca n't . She tries it on the next guy and he wo n't stand for it . So she says what the hell , and men is all alike , and me for the easiest way . ( Standing feet slightly apart , palms turned out , hands down . ) JONES That was the name of a play . MCCLURE Made half a million . JOE Sure fire . And now comes the big punch .

Everybody 's standing around , he opens up on her , then zowie !  --  she comes back at him . JONES That 's fine . I thought she would . ( Starts to rise. ) p. 30 JOE That 's where we bring in the strong talk . She calls him all kinds of names  --  we go the limit . Then she says , " you priests and missionaries  --  ( Shakes finger in PETER 's face ) is all alike . You do n't give a girl no chance , " and so  --  ( Backs away to R. ) and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so  --  she faints dead away , and somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sick . " That 's your second act . MCCLURE ( Rises ) Want me to tell the rest ? JOE No !  --  Act Three is her dream . She 's delirious , see , and dreams she 's dead and gone to Heaven . Here 's where we got all these angels coming down the aisles  --  ( Indicates aisles . ) MCCLURE With long veils over them . JOE There was a show done it last year and it was a wow . ( Points up with thumb ) Everything 's all mixed up in this act . Her father 's up there , the Judge , see  --  only he 's supposed to be God . JONES Is that all right to do ? JOE There was a big hit done it . Anyhow , we do n't really say it , see ? MCCLURE Do n't forget the priest . p. 31 JOE Oh , yeh . This priest comes in and he 's got a rabbi with him , see ? And they talk about how everybody 's the same underneath , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as they 're staring to execute her , she wakes up . And this fellow , the good one , has got her in his arms , and she says " the bluebird  --  ( Hands clasped ) of happiness was at home all the time , " kiss , lights out , finishing reading the play , everybody says great , the fellow and the girl gets married , fade out , and curtain .

You ca n't lose with it , Sweetheart . Can you imagine what a picture it 'll make for this Swanson baby ? ( Leaning over desk to PETER. ) p. 32 JONES Would it take very much money to produce it ? JOE ( Sits quickly in chair . MAC crosses up to end of desk . Quickly ) Here 's the angle . We 're willing to let you half half of it , see  --  forty-nine per cent . JONES Of course , I 'd be a producer , too ? JOE Sure . Now  --  how much was you thinking of putting up ? JONES I 'd rather you 'd tell me , first . JOE I 'll let you in on the ground floor . You can have forty-nine percent for  --  thirty  --  ( His head comes forward just a little ) thousand dollars . JONES ( Turns in his chair . MAC puts his hand on his shoulder ) Oh , I could n't think of paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shave that a little , Joe , for Mr. Jones ? JOE ( Considers ) I 'll tell you what I 'll do . Give me a quick Yes and I 'll take twenty-five . JONES I guess we 've got to let the whole matter drop . ( He starts to go. ) p. 33 JOE ( Rises and both move as if to stop PETER ) Hold on ! This coin of yours  --  you ai n't got it some place out West , have you ? JONES Why ? JOE Because if it was where you could dig it up in a hurry , maybe we can do business . JONES It 's right down the street  --  in a bank . ( LEHMAN and MAC give a sigh of relief . ) JOE I was n't going to let it go for this ,  --  ( Sits ) but you give me your check for twenty thousand and forty-nine percent of the show is yours .

Get out of here ! Get out of here ! ( UP to C. PETER partly rises , MAC reassures him , PETER sits. ) p. 35 FANNY Listen , you four-flushing bum ! JOE Now , Fanny  --  ( Tries to hush her . ) MCCLURE Fanny , for the love of  --  ( Indicates to PETER to sit down ; that it is all right . ) FANNY I just come from my bank . And the paying teller says there was a guy around there this morning with black hair and a checked suit and a trick tie trying to find out how big my balance was .

Starts to write , then looks around again . MAC and LEHMAN eye PETER. ) p. 36 JONES ( Starts to sign check ) Did she say rotten ? JOE She was n't talking about this show . ( Crosses to L. of desk . ) MCCLURE It 's another one we got . ( Crosses L. to PETER . ) JOE She do n't even know nothing about this one . JONES Who was it ? A friend of yours ? JOE My old lady . JONES Oh , your mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listen , you got judgment of your own , ai n't you ? A smart guy like you . I told you about the show . Do n't it sound like a wow ? JONES But you see  --  there are reasons why I do n't want to lose this money . JOE You ai n't going to lose it . Did I tell you about the bookings ? ( To MAC ) Did I tell him about the bookings ? MCCLURE Not yet . ( Crosses to back of upper end of desk . ) JONES Bookings ? JOE The towns we play in  --  the theatres . ( Takes out route sheet of top drawer in the down end of desk. ) p. 37 JONES Oh ! JOE We got the cream . Look ! We open in Syracuse . A great show town . And we play there a full week . JONES A week , eh ? MCCLURE Most shows only get three days . JOE Then we go to Providence , Worcester , Albany  --  all them soft spots . JONES I guess they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES But you see  --  it 's just as I was telling you  --  I got a special reason why I would n't want to lose this money  --  ( JANE enters R. , slamming door , with typed paper ; crosses above desk to LEHMAN , lays paper on desk , smiles at PETER , exits R.

Give you a desk right in here . JONES ( Looks at door R. ) Well  --  either here or  --  out there . JOE Whatever you say . ( JANE types outside of door R. PETER looks at door R. MAC and LEHMAN exchange looks. ) p. 38 JONES ( Signs check . As he tears it out of checkbook LEHMAN grabs it ) Look out ! It 's wet ! JOE ( Rises . MAC shakes PETER 's hand , both in hurry to get away ) I 'll dry it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt ) There 's your receipt and we 'll draw up the papers later .

Now , Mac and me 'll be right back . You wait here , see ? Right in this room . ( Crosses up a little . ) JONES But should n't I go with you to the bank ? JOE You look after things here , see ? JONES But you see , my check  --  MCCLURE ( Is holding door open , hand on the outside knob . They start again ) The bank knows us. p. 39 JONES But that is n't what I meant . I  --  JOE Now do n't worry . Just stay right here , because we want to talk to you when we get back , see ? I 'll tell you what ! ( Starts to door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weston !

( Starts up C. ) Come on , Mac . ( Exist up C. MAC looks at JANE , Exits up C. , closing door . A pause as JANE and PETER face each other . ) WESTON ( Smiles ; is thoroughly at ease ) It was n't much of an introduction , was it ? JONES I do n't mind if you do n't . WESTON ( At C. ) Mr. Lehman says you 've invested money in the play . p. 40 JONES Yes , I  --  did put some in  --  a little . ( Picks up checkbook from desk . ) WESTON I hope it 'll be very successful . JONES ( Rather stiffly ) Thank you . ( They come closer together C. ) WESTON I 've often wondered how it would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a producer ? WESTON Anyhow , to have enough money to be one . JONES ( Is a bit at a loss as to how to proceed ) It  --  does n't feel any way in particular yet . ( Looking at checkbook . ) WESTON ( At R. ) Then if I had a great deal of money  --  well , like you  --  I might go ahead and be one . JONES ( Not quite getting the full implication , but coming close enough to be disturbed ) How 's that ? WESTON I say , if I could afford to risk part of the money , I 'd be a producer . JONES Risk it ? ( Crosses to her a little ) Do n't you think it 's a good business , putting plays on ? p. 41 WESTON Well , of course , it depends . You see  --  JONES ( Grows a little panicky ) But this  --  this play of Mr. LEHMAN 's  --  it 's good , is n't it ? You think it 'll be a hit ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; regards him ) Tell me something . JONES Do n't you really ? WESTON ( Now sparring for information ) It  --  it will be a hit , of course . But  --  I 'm sure you would n't care could you ? A millionaire like you ? JONES Like me ? I 'm not anything like that . It was all I could do to  --  ( Crosses up around desk to L. of desk ) Well , I hope it turns out all right . WESTON ( Still sizing him up ) You 're not a New Yorker , are you , Mr. Jones ? JONES No , I 'm from Chillicothe . WESTON Oh  --  you  --  you have n't been connected with the theatrical business before , then ? JONES Oh , yes . In a way  --  we made several productions last year in Chillicothe , sort of . p. 42 WESTON ( Sits R. of desk L.C. ) I see . JONES It 's all right , is n't it ? Mr. LEHMAN 's play I mean ? You do n't think anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that , but  --  ( Leans toward him . ) JONES It sounded great , I thought . But it 'd be terrible if it was n't a go . WESTON What I was going to ask you was  --  of course it is n't any of my business , but  --  I was wondering how you happened to be here . In this office , I mean . How you ever happened to pick the theatrical business to invest in . JONES Oh , it 's always kind of appealed to me . WESTON ( Pauses ) Did you give Mr. Lehman  --  much money ? JONES Why ? There is n't anything the matter , is there ? ( Over desk . ) WESTON No , no . The only reason I asked  --  JONES Oh , if there were  --  ( Turns head away and back ) Plays do make a lot of money , do n't they ? WESTON I 'm sure it 'll be all right . You must n't worry . p. 43 JONES All right . If you feel that way about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I appreciate your trusting me , of course , but  --  JONES Why  --  you 're being here is one of the reasons I went into it . Partly . WESTON How 's that ? JONES I felt pretty sure it was all right or you would n't be connected with it at all . WESTON I 'm not sure that I understand . JONES Well , when you came in  --  while they were here , you  --  sort of smiled at me . ( She looks away ) Maybe you did n't . I thought you did . WESTON You did it because I smiled ? JONES I did n't mean  --  WESTON Oh , it 's all right , only  --  it just makes me feel a good deal of responsibility , that 's all . Was it all your money that you invested ? JONES Oh , no , I 've got  --  some left . A little . WESTON Money you 'd saved ? JONES No , we could n't save much . I was n't earning enough . Grandfather had this money he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left the money to us  --  mother and me. p. 44 WESTON Was it much ? JONES Um-huh . Twenty-two thousand four hundred dollars . WESTON How much did you invest ? JONES Well , first I want to tell you . You see , if you just take the interest on that , why , it is n't very much to get along on . Because , of course , I was n't getting very much . Then Mr. Madden  --  that 's the man who owns the hotel  --  he heard I was getting this money , only he thought it was more ,  --  and he was sort of tired of running the hotel , anyhow  --  and he said if I could pay him fifty thousand dollars he 'd let me have it . It makes a lot of money . WESTON I see . JONES That 's when I thought , if I could take this money we had  --  and make more out of it , quickly  --  everything would be fine . So , of course , I thought of the theatrical business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . Mother thought too it would be a good thing , and so I left fourteen hundred dollars with her , and I came to New York to look around . That was last week . WESTON You brought twenty-one thousand with you ? JONES Well , the bank there put it in a bank here for me . So all I had to do was give Mr. Lehman a check . WESTON For  --  all of it ? p. 45 JONES Oh , no . Only twenty thousand . WESTON ( Rises angrily . Crosses C. , looking at door where LEHMAN has just left ) Oh ! JONES What 's the matter ? WESTON Nothing . ( Starts R. ) JONES You 're not  --  going , are you ? WESTON ( Still half afire with rage at LEHMAN ) Yes , I  --  I think I must . JONES Thank you very much for coming in and talking to me . WESTON ( Turns to him , her mind still half on LEHMAN ) I hope again that it 's a big success . The play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you talked to me . You see , it 's the first time I 've talked regularly with anyone since I left home . I mean , you 're the first person that 's  --  ( MARY MARTIN enters at R. ) MARTIN Sorry . Mr. LEHMAN 's not here , I see . WESTON He 'll be back soon , Miss Martin . MARTIN I 'm afraid I ca n't wait . It 's important . I told him I was coming back . ( Starts to go ; takes hold of doorknob. ) p. 46 JONES Is it  --  ( Crosses to R. of desk )  --  something to do with the firm ? MARTIN How 's that ? ( Stops at door . ) JONES I say , if it 's something to do with the firm , maybe I can do it for you . MARTIN Oh ! ( Crosses to PETER C. ) I wonder if this is the young man Mr. Lehman spoke about ? That was  --  coming into the company ? JONES Yes , ma'am . MARTIN Oh  --  then of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . JANE starts to go . ) JONES You need n't go , Miss Weston .

MARTIN I 'm Mary Martin , Mr. Jones . ( She puts her hand out and he takes it ) I 'm with the show . p. 47 JONES Really ? Our show ? MARTIN Yes . So you and I will probably see a good deal of each other . JONES We will , huh ? MARTIN Oh , indeed , yes . JONES ( Pauses , embarrassed ) Which one are you ? In the show  --  ( Let go of hands ) I mean ? MARTIN Oh , the lead . JONES The what ? MARTIN The leading part . JONES Oh , yes , that 's a great role . I mean , she gets in a lot of trouble . MARTIN I hope you 're coming to rehearsals soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get your ideas . JONES My ideas ? MARTIN Of course . I do particularly . JONES Oh , I do n't know that I 'd be much good at  --  MARTIN You 'd be wonderful . ( Looks at him ) And I can tell . JONES Oh , I did make a few productions out in Chillicothe . MARTIN ( Flatters him ) There , you see ! I knew the minute I saw you . Now I want you to promise you 'll come to rehearsals and that whenever you have any suggestions for me you 'll tell me. p. 48 JONES All right . MARTIN ( Crosses to C. ) I ca n't tell you how relieved I am that you 've come in to take charge of things . JONES Oh , I 'm not going to take charge . MARTIN Oh , yes , you will . ( Snaps fingers as if remembering something ) I knew there was something , Mr. Jones . ( Crosses to PETER ) I wonder if you 'd do me a very great favor ? JONES Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I left my checkbook at home this morning . And just now I saw the darlingest frock and they wo n't hold it . ( Puts on air . ) JONES Why  --  that 's all right . ( Sits R. of desk ; starts to write check . ) MARTIN That 's lovely of you . I hate to bother you . It will be taken out of my salary . Just a hundred . ( Looking over his shoulder . ) JONES Just a hundred . ( Starts to write a check . ) MARTIN Just make it to cash . I think it 's wonderful , your coming in with us , Mr. Jones . It makes everything seem so different . ( After he finishes and tears check out ) Oh , that 's just fine . ( He rises and blots check on desk pad ) I 'm ever so much obliged .

And you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something  --  when they were  --  Oh  --  I was thinking , a little while ago  --  that is , if you 're sure you do n't mind ? MARTIN Mind ? I 'm crazy for suggestions . ( Backing away from him to R.C. ) ( WARN Curtain . ) JONES You know that part where you 're in  --  that place ? MARTIN Place ? I 'm not sure just which scene  --  JONES You know . The place  --  that you go to  --  ? MARTIN You do n't mean the Heaven scene ? JONES No , ma'am . Just before the Heaven scene . MARTIN Oh , the brothel . JONES Yeh . ( Coming C. ) That 's the place . That 's where , if I were you , I 'd really do some of my best acting  --  where you bring in the strong talk  --  " You priests and missionaries are no better than a lot of rabbis  --  " MARTIN Oh , yes  --  indeed I will , Mr. Jones .

( Opens door C. ) MARTIN It 's been a great pleasure , Mr. Jones . JONES It has been for me , too . MARTIN ( They shake hands ) Something tells me we 're going to be very good friends . Because I know you 'll produce other plays , too , wo n't you ? JONES I do n't know . MARTIN Of course you will  --  a man like you . JONES Well , maybe a couple .

" It is in all respects a typical hotel room , from the heavy maroon hangings on the windows to the picture of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the wall . There is but a single door , set in an alcove up left , and when it swings wide enough you can read the room number , 726 . Across the outside hall the edge of another door is barely visible . The room is our hero 's , of course . Being the gentleman who made the production possible , he has been favored with ample quarters . At the right are two windows , and between them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , is a clothes closet ; adjoining it on the left is a chiffonier , and then comes the inevitable bed , set at right angles to the footlights . There is a writing-table against the wall at left ; there are two or three small chairs and one more comfortable . It is evening  --  eight o'clock or thereabouts . PETER discovered in evening dress , tie around collar but not tied . Dress coat hanging on hall tree up R.C. , He has dress vest on . He is standing down R.C. , and as the curtain rises crosses hurriedly up stage to closet up R.C. and hangs up top coat which he has already on a hanger to save time .

I want to know whether  --  some day  --  you think you could ever  --  marry a theatrical producer ? WESTON Please  --  JONES I do n't mean just a producer with forty-nine percent of one show  --  but there 'll come a time when I 'll have my own theatre  --  and  --  WESTON Peter , do n't !

When it rises the room is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table is lighted . Immediately the sound of a key is heard in the door . The door opens , and for a second the figure of PETER , stick , high hat and all , is silhouetted against the brightly lighted hallway . He presses the lights on ; leaves the door open behind him and comes into the room , whistling gaily . Still whistling , he hangs up his coat . LEHMAN , a disconsolate figure with hands in pockets and eyes on the floor , comes slowly into the room . He is followed , at a respectful distance , by MAC  --  a much repressed MAC . LEHMAN drops onto the bed , with a sigh , and MAC slumps into the chair at the writing table . PETER is vastly puzzled . He regards them for a second , then finally gets up courage to ask LEHMAN a question . JONES Is something the matter ? I thought it was all right . Except  --  here and there , maybe . JOE ( Rises , crosses to chair R. ) Oh  --  ( Sits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANNY ( Enters up L. , clears throat , crosses to C. and plants herself ) First  --  p. 65 JOE ( Rises ) Now , one thing we ai n't going to have none of is wisecracks .

BENHAM ( A calm , reserved and dignified Englishman , who is even able to wear a monocle without suggesting musical comedy . Coming down L.C. , hat in hand ) I beg your pardon ?

MCCLURE ( To BENHAM ) Now , that 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernie Sampson is my name . BENHAM It 's quite possible that you do n't know who I am . SAMPSON That 's only part of it . BENHAM I was associated for ten years with Sir John Hare , and I 've been with Sir Charles Wyndham and Sir Beerbohm Tree . FANNY ( Looks at BENHAM ) And where are they now ? BENHAM I am not accustomed to having my direction described by that adjective .

MAC lays a restraining hand on his shoulder ) Well  --  JOE ( To BERNIE ) Never mind , Bernie ! What 's this scene you got ? p. 81 SAMPSON Well , I 'll tell you . It 'll drop right in where your cabaret is , see ? It was a wow scene , but the show never come to New York , so it 'll be new . There 's never been anything like it . It was a hop joint in Hongkong . BENHAM ( With great dignity ) It would not possibly do . JOE We got to stick to the story , Bernie . We ca n't throw away the whole play . FANNY Why not ? ( Drinks at end of laugh . BERNIE crosses up R.C. between bed and serving-table . ) JOE Now , I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts glass on arm of chair . MARTIN knocks at door up L.

FANNY applauds and rests head on hand . ) MARTIN ( At C. ) Now , before anything is said  --  that stage wait was not my fault . p. 82 JOE All right , all right . ( PETER crosses to R. of bed again . ) MARTIN Maxwell gave me the wrong cue  --  a cue out of the third act . So , of course , I had to stop and think . FANNY ( Rises a little and leans on arm of chair ) Well , you certainly had a lovely evening for it . MARTIN ( Turns to BENHAM at L. ) And then  --  you 'd think there 'd be someone in the wings to throw me a line . But no . BENHAM That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the line distinctly . MARTIN ( Angry ) Well , I certainly did n't hear it . ( Crosses to BENHAM . ) MARLOWE ( Sitting up ) Oh , goody , a scrap  --  ( Then sits up on bed . ) JOE Now , stop  --  MARTIN ( PETER gets up R.C. , above LEHMAN , R. of MARTIN ) Besides  --  I 've had a raging headache all day . And if you think it 's easy to give a performance of a star part , with people coming back into your dressing-room all the time  --  ( She eyes PETER ) trying to tell you what to do  --  ( ALL eye PETER and he backs away a couple of steps. ) p. 83 JONES You said if I had any suggestions  --  ( FANNY nearly finishes glass of wine . ) MARTIN Well , really , Mr. Jones  --  I 've been in the profession longer than you have . FANNY ( Drops arm and glass over R. arm of chair , holds glass ) And that 's no fairy tale . MARTIN ( BERNIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BENHAM sits in same chair again . MARTIN is angry ) I beg your pardon ! ( MAC crosses up and puts cigarette on ' phone table . ) JOE ( Rises ) Oh , stop it  --  you two ! Sit down , Mary .

She sees everything that comes here , and I slipped her a couple tonight . Now  --  p. 84 JOE Good idea . Get her up . Anybody but that nut Fritchie . ( Sits at table R.C. ) MCCLURE Right ! MARLOWE Did he say on the switchboard ? ( Crosses down R.C. to L. of LEHMAN . MAC talks pantomime at ' phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one operator in this hotel ? SAMPSON Never mind .

Make a note  --  Prologue O.K. JONES ( Up . R.C. ) O.K. ( ALL look at him . ) MARTIN ( In chair L. ) May I say something ? JOE ( To MARTIN ) What is it ? MARTIN ( Rises ; crosses to C. ) The trouble with your play is that the leading character does n't have sympathy . I 'm fighting the audience all the time . I feel it . They do n't like me . FANNY ( Rises slowly ) Well , I think you were fine . I really do . ( Sits slowly ) That 'll give you a rough idea of my condition . ( Settles self in chair. ) p. 86 MARTIN ( Furious tapping of toe , trying to control herself ) Really , Mr. Lehman , if I 'm to be required  --  JOE Shut up , Fanny ! ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. of bed ) I 'm trying to tell you that I 'm not getting sympathy . Something ought to be put in to show that I 'm really all right at heart . MARLOWE ( On lower end of bed ) How about giving out pamphlets ? SAMPSON Hey ! Baby ! MARTIN ( A glare at PEGGY , then turns to LEHMAN again ) If I could have a scene early in the play that would show me in a more sympathetic light  --  say a scene with a baby . JOE We 'll come back to it . ( To JANE ) Make a note . Sympathy for Miss Martin . JONES If it 's early in the play , Mr. Lehman , it ca n't be a baby , because she is n't married then . JOE All right . ( Loud knock by WAITER off U.L. ) All right . See who that is . ( PETER goes up . ) Now we 're going ahead from the prologue . ( PETER opens the door . The WAITER enters with food , crossing around bed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ) Ah ! The troops !

Straight from the shoulder . Now , you see all the shows that come here . We want to know your real opinion .

HUMPHREYS ( To the people on her R. ) It 's a hard town to please , sort of  --  because you see we get all the new shows . The managers all bring their shows here , because they know if it goes here , it 'll go any place . You see , the people here are funny , sort of . If they like a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it  --  they won't. p. 89 JOE Well , that 's a hot lot of news . WAITER ( Crosses to L. of LEHMAN ) Excuse me .

WESTON It is n't anything . p. 100 JONES It must mean something . WESTON It 's  --  it 's just a man that invests money that 's all . That puts money into something . JONES Oh !

I gave him about everything I had left and  --  that 's all there is to it . It 's gone . I guess I 'm done for . ( Crosses up R.C. and to chair at table . ) WESTON Peter , you 're not . JONES ( At table R.C. ) No . It 's gone , all right . And she expected me to do such big things  --  I 'm not ever going home again . WESTON Peter ! Do n't say that !

But I 've got you into an awful mess . I did n't mean to , but I have . And that 's why I ca n't  --  JONES Well  --  ( Crosses away to L. ) I 'll get out of it some way . You just see if I do n't I 'll get the money some place and  --  the play  --  ( Crosses back to her in front of bed ) It might be a success in New York , do n't you think ? WESTON It  --  might .

The assistant manager . p. 104 JONES ( Crosses to JANE ; JANE crosses a couple of steps to PETER ) He 's the man that got us the champagne . ( A couple of steps to door ) What do you want ? FRITCHIE Can I come in ? ( PETER looks at JANE ; she nods " yes . " PETER crosses up and opens door . OSCAR enters up L. ) JONES The door was n't locked . WESTON I was just leaving .

You know how it is  --  ( Turns to them ) You get a liking for something  --  the theatre  --  All my life I 've  --  I 've just kind of liked to talk about it , that 's all . I guess maybe it 's because I 've always had a sort of feeling that some day I might get into it  --  ( Puts hands in pockets ) myself . ( OSCAR looks front . PETER has hand to head during this speech . ) JONES ( Takes hand from head , crosses a little to C. Long pause ) Would you mind saying that again ? FRITCHIE The show business . I say  --  some day I 'm going to get into it . p. 107 JONES ( A couple of steps to OSCAR ) You do n't mean  --  as a producer ? FRITCHIE ( Pleased , looks front ) That 's what . ( Pause .

( Sits . ) WESTON ( Crosses to L. of table ) You  --  you said you were the assistant manager ? FRITCHIE Yah . Mr. Hemingway is the manager . JONES ( Crosses to R. of table ) I used to work in a hotel , before I went into the theatre business . FRITCHIE That so ? p. 108 JONES ( Hand on back of chair R. of table ) That must be a fine job you have here . You must make a lot of money ? FRITCHIE Oh , I do n't suppose you folks would call it much . WESTON Oh , yes , we would . JONES Look , Mr. Fritchie . Have you  --  that is , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got any saved up  --  I mean money ? FRITCHIE Huh ? WESTON Mr. Jones has known so many hotel men who did n't save . He just hopes you 're different . FRITCHIE That 's right . A lot of them do n't . JONES ( Bending over OSCAR ) I know . But you do , do n't you ? That 's what we want to get down to . FRITCHIE You bet your life I do . JONES That 's fine . ( Turns R. ) FRITCHIE What 's the matter ? WESTON Not a thing . JONES Nothing . ( Alone ) Would you like a glass of champagne ?

JONES ( At OSCAR 'S R. with glass of wine ) Here , drink this first . ( Puts glass on table and stands by dresser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinks . PETER salutes toast . ) WESTON ( As he finishes ) Some more ? ( Crosses up ; gets champagne . ) FRITCHIE I 'm not robbing you ? JONES No  --  no  --  it 's all right .

( Finish pouring . ) Oh , thanks . ( PETER puts bottle back up stage after OSCAR ends drink . PETER crosses around and to OSCAR , at his L. ) JONES ( Puts hand on OSCAR 'S shoulder ) Er  --  p. 110 FRITCHIE Huh ? JONES ( Worried ) Nothing  --  yet .

It 's going to be much better . It 's a big drama , see , with this girl in it and  --  and  --  do you know how much money a lot of shows have made ? FRITCHIE You bet your life I do . " Madame Sherry " made seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars . " Potash and Perlmutter " made half a million . " Within the Law " made  --  JONES There you are ! Is n't that wonderful ? WESTON Mr. Jones 'll tell you what a wonderful play this is , Mr. Fritchie . And he has a chance to get hold of the whole thing  --  all of it . It 's a real chance  --  the chance of a lifetime . p. 111 JONES Do you know what a brothel is ? Do you ? FRITCHIE ( Looks at JANE , bashful ) Huh ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) JONES Well , we 've got one in this play and it 's great , see ? A priest and a rabbi come into it  --  it 's a great big scene . ( OSCAR looks at PETER . ) It 's going to be a knockout  --  everything happens to this girl  --  she marries a fellow and there 's another fellow and she gets into a lot of trouble  --  only she 's got to have more sympathy  --  so she 's going to have a baby  --  it 's going to make millions of dollars  --  thousands . FRITCHIE ( Rises ) I do n't think I want to  --  JONES Everything is changed around  --  it 's going to have Hong Kong in it  --  in place of where the trial scence is now  --  it 's going to be a hop joint in Hong Kong . It 's a wow , and he turns out to be her father  --  with a long beard on  --  that 's where we bring in the strong talk and so and so , and so and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . ( Crosses over to foot of bed , taking off dress coat as he goes , throws coat on bed , crossing back to OSCAR ) Then we go on from there . p. 112 FRITCHIE Now  --  now  --  you got to stop , if you want me to  --  ( Considers ) Go into the theatrical business , eh ? It would be fun . JONES Oh , it 's an awful lot of fun  --  you have n't any idea . FRITCHIE Would it cost much money ? JONES No . You can have half of it  --  that is  --  forty-nine percent  --  for thirty thousand dollars . ( Crosses away toward C. ) FRITCHIE ( Crosses to PETER and PETER back to L. ) Thirty thousand dollars ! JONES Twenty-five thousand ! FRITCHIE Twenty-five thousand ? JONES Twenty ! Fifteen ! WESTON And that 's  --  ( Slaps table ) the very lowest , Mr. Fritchie ! FRITCHIE ( Crosses to table ; sits ) It 's a lot . WESTON Oh , no , it 's a bargain . JONES ( Reads fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the man that decides right away  --  I mean standing up  --  ( Motions up with hands . OSCAR rises slowly . ) You see , Mr. Fritchie , everything in the show business is done like that  --  ( Makes a poor attempt at snapping fingers ) We read about a fellow who could have bought some of the " Follies " once , only he did n't  --  and look , it 's all gone now . p. 113 FRITCHIE Now , wait . I  --  I do n't know what to say . I know I 'd like the theatrical business , and I been  --  ( Looks front ) getting kind of tired of the hotel lately  --  JONES Of course you would . You 're not the kind of man to stay cooped up in a hotel all his life . WESTON Mr. Jones got out , and look at him . JONES ( Backs away toward C. a couple of steps ) Yes . Look at me . WESTON It 's going to make an awful lot of money . FRITCHIE ( Looks front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I thought of him . JONES ( Crosses to OSCAR ) That 's the stuff ! WESTON Then why do n't you ? FRITCHIE I 'm scared . JONES Well , this is your chance . WESTON A chance to leave this old hotel behind you . JONES I guess  --  ( Crosses away to L. again ) when he looks back at an opportunity he 's missed , like this , it will make him feel pretty terrible . When it 's a big success in New York  --  p. 114 FRITCHIE ( Crosses to PETER C. ) Now  --  now wait . I have n't said I would n't , yet . JONES You 've got to act quick with us , if you want it . FRITCHIE You say it 's  --  a good play ? JONES ( At L.C. ) Good ! There 's never been anything like it . FRITCHIE ( At C. ) There are certainly some things I 'd tell Mr. Hemingway , the big stiff . JONES ( Crosses to JANE at R. quickly ) Make out a receipt , Jane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . Starts writing receipt . ) FRITCHIE ( Crosses back of table ) Now , wait . JONES ( At R. of table ) No , unless you can give us your check right away , we ca n't do it all . Can you ? FRITCHIE I have n't said I was going to at all , yet . WESTON ( Play very fast . Turns to OSCAR from dresser ) But if you do it right away , you can go to Mr. Hemingway tonight and tell him all those things . Just think . ( Continues writing receipt. ) p. 115 FRITCHIE ( Behind table R.C. ) He made me work twelve hours a day . JONES You do n't have to work at all in the theatre . FRITCHIE He 'd be sore , all right . JONES There 's no reason why we have to produce just this one show . We could go ahead and do a lot more . FRITCHIE ( Takes out checkbook from inside coat pocket and stands with it in his hands , undecided ) Could we ? JONES Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES ( At R. of table ) Why , we can be the biggest producers there are . All kinds of shows  --  Can I open that for you ? ( Starts to open . OSCAR scans checkbook . ) FRITCHIE ( Sits at table ) No . No . JONES ( At OSCAR 'S R. ) Well , here is ink and pen and everything . You just make the check out to me  --  Peter Jones . ( WARN Curtain . ) WESTON What 's your first name , Mr. Fritchie , and how do you spell this one ? p. 116 FRITCHIE Oscar Fritchie . F-r-i-t-c-h-i-e . JONES ( Crosses to JANE ) F-r-i-t-c-h-i-e . Got it ? FRITCHIE ( Continues as PETER spells name ) But I have n't made up my mind yet . JONES How are you coming here ? Have you started yet ? FRITCHIE I do n't know . You got me all excited  --  but  --  WESTON ( Reads fast ) Here 's the receipt . ( Crosses to R. of table ; puts the receipt on it ) It just says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . ( Crosses to L. of OSCAR ) Is that all right ? JONES That 's fine . Here 's the receipt . Now all you have to do is to sign the check , see ? Here , I 'll help you . Oscar , it should be  --  FRITCHIE ( As PETER starts to help him , OSCAR stops ) Do you think I ought to ? JONES Of course you ought to . It 's a great big drama , and there 's an orchard in it , and Mr. Hemingway comes in , and he 's got a long beard on . Oh ! Did I tell him about the bookings yet ? Did I ? We go from here to Providence , then Albany , and Seattle  --  p. 117 FRITCHIE Look out  --  ( Tears out check and PETER grabs it . ) It 's wet . JONES I 'll dry it . ( Ring curtain . ) It 's going to be a whale of a hit , Sweetheart , a whale of a hit . ( As curtains falls , OSCAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PETER ad lib. as curtain falls. ) @x SCENE : Same as Act I ; a few weeks later . All that is missing is the overwhelming pile of papers that had stood against the rear wall . WESTON ( Is seated at the desk at rise , looking over newspaper notices . ' Phone rings as curtain is up ; it is out of her reach ; she gets up to answer it ) Hello  --  No , Mr. Jones has n't come in yet  --  Well , if you try a little later  --  Yes , it looks like a very big hit . At least , they seem to think so at the theatre , but of course it 's a little early to tell  --  Good-bye . ( There is a knock at R. She hangs up ) Come in ! ( Crosses C. , but the door is opened before she reaches it . It is A. J. PATTERSON who enters , with brief case . ) PATTERSON ( Is a middle-aged business man , rather formidable in manner .

WESTON Mr. Fritchie ? No . I 'm expecting them any minute . p. 119 PATTERSON ( Considers ; nods ) I 'll return . WESTON Is n't there any message ? Ca n't I give them your name ? PATTERSON ( Turns as he is about to go out ) Oh , this new play of theirs  --  I understand that it 's successful . Is that right ? WESTON Yes , sir  --  I think so . But of course it only opened last night . PATTERSON I see . Thank you . ( Turns to go ; puts hat on . ) WESTON You  --  you still wo n't tell me who it is ? PATTERSON ( Left hand on doorknob , turns back ) You need n't worry . I shall return .

Remember  --  ( Crosses to hat tree up R.C. , just puts cane on it ) I told you it would be , when it came to New York ? ( Crosses back to her . ) WESTON Yes , Peter ! I can hardly believe it . People are lined up over at the theatre , buying tickets . Is n't it wonderful ? JONES Oh , I do n't know . It was n't any surprise to me . ( Crosses to L. of desk ) Is there any mail ? ( Puts hat on desk and starts piling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah  --  why , no . Some people have been telephoning , and there was a gentleman here just now , but he would n't leave his name . JONES ( Business-like ) Did he state his business ? WESTON No , he did n't . JONES Always ask them to state their business . And  --  ah  --  if anybody else comes , bring in their cards first , please , to see if I 'll see them . ( At C. of desk ; looks at papers. ) p. 121 WESTON All right . JONES You see , Jane , the reason you must n't ever be surprised at a play like this being a hit is because it 's so full of heart interest  --  that 's what the public wants  --  heart interest  --  and menace . The moment I first heard of this play I knew it would be a success . ( Picks up newspapers again and holds them in his hands . ) WESTON ( Crosses to desk ) I 'm terribly happy , Peter , that you were right . JONES It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably all of my productions will be successes now . ( He starts reading through two or three different papers . ) WESTON That would be nice . JONES ( Looks at JANE ) Did you read these  --  the criticisms ? ( Pointing to criticism in paper . ) WESTON Yes . JONES This fellow missed the whole idea of the play . ( Stands and puffs cigarette ) And he thought the performance was only adequate . A lot they know about it  --  the critics . I 'm thinking of not letting them come at all the next time . ( ' Phone rings . Picks ( 'PHONE. ) it up quickly ) Hello  --  Yes , this is Mr. Jones speaking  --  Thank you  --  Yeh , I guess it 's about the biggest that 's ever been produced  --  Huh ? ( Sits on desk ) Oh , no  --  I 'm going to produce it myself in London . Budapest , too  --  Yeh  --  a sort of international producing company .  --  Well , it would n't be any use of your coming over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Good-bye . ( Hangs up . Rises from desk ) I 'm going to produce it all over the world . p. 122 WESTON Do you want anything more from me now ? ( Starts R. ) JONES ( Crosses front of desk to JANE ) What 's that matter , Jane ? WESTON ( Crossing to R. ) Nothing . JONES Are n't you glad the play 's a success ? WESTON Of course . I 'm very happy for you . I wish you just all the success in the world . ( Back turned to him . ) JONES ( Crosses to her ) It means an awful lot to us , Jane . WESTON ( Turns to him . Eagerly ) Does it , Peter ? JONES ( At C. ) Oh ! I forgot to tell you about a man I met this morning . He wants to build a theatre for me  --  the Peter Jones Playhouse . WESTON I 'll hardly know you , will I ? JONES ( Just R. of C. door at C. ) Jane , what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that they 're out of it ? Do n't you think it would be simpler to have it just Jones Productions , Inc. ? p. 123 WESTON Yes , I suppose it would be simpler . JONES Do you think  --  do you think my picture would make a good trademark ? WESTON If you  --  want it . JONES And oh , Jane  --  ( OSCAR enters R. Pauses , hat in hand ) Well ? FRITCHIE Good morning ! WESTON Good morning , Mr. Fritchie . FRITCHIE Good morning , Miss Weston ! JONES How do you feel now ? FRITCHIE What are all those people doing over at the theatre ? JONES The play 's a big success . FRITCHIE Who says so ? JONES Everybody . We 're nearly sold out for to-night . FRITCHIE Yes  --  who 'll come tomorrow night ? JONES ( Crosses up , then to L. of desk ) Wait till you hear all the plans I 've got . Get Jane here to tell you about the Peter Jones Playhouse . ( Throws papers in waste-basket . ) WESTON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Crosses to door R. in front of OSCAR. ) p. 124 JONES Well , do n't forget about bringing in their cards . ( Sits at desk . ) WESTON ( In door ) I wo n't . ( Exits R. , closing door . ) FRITCHIE ( Crosses to desk ) Now on the level , how are things ? JONES ( Smokes cigarette in holder ) It 's one of the biggest successes ever produced . FRITCHIE ( Leans over desk ) She 's gone  --  you can tell me . JONES People are calling up to buy it for London and every place . FRITCHIE ( Over desk , speaks quickly ) How much did you get ? JONES I would n't sell it . FRITCHIE Now look  --  I think if we can get any money we ought to , because  --  I do n't feel just right yet , see ? ( Turns away . ) JONES When we go ahead and produce the Peter Jones " Follies " you 'll feel right . FRITCHIE ( Turns back ) Do you think we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm seeing a man about the Hippodrome . ( Smokes . ) FRITCHIE I think  --  ( Crosses to C. ) maybe I ought to get out . ( Picks up hat from table . ) JONES ( Puts cigarette down , picks up pen and receipt book ) All right . I can handle it myself . FRITCHIE ( Crosses back to desk quickly ) Would you be willing to buy my share back ? JONES ( Opens receipt book as if to write ) You bet I would . FRITCHIE Well  --  then I do n't know . ( Crosses away a couple of steps . ) JONES ( Rises , crosses to OSCAR C. ) Do you know what I 'm going to do if you stay with me ? I 'm going to get all the playwrights there are in this country , and put them under contract , and then we 'll tie up all the foreign plays . FRITCHIE But suppose something happens ? JONES What can happen in the theatrical business ? ( Puts cigarette on tray on desk ) Now , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the thing to do is to get all the theatres . p. 126 FRITCHIE You do n't think it could go wrong some place ? JONES No . You ca n't make a mistake  --  all you got to do is to give the public what they want . FRITCHIE Yah , but  --  but  --  but how do you know what they want ? JONES It 's easy . They always want the same thing . FRITCHIE ( Shakes his head ) Sure as I went into it they 'd change their minds . JONES We 'll put another  --  ( JANE enters R. with a card )  --  company in Chicago  --  ( Sees JANE ; crosses to her in front of OSCAR ) See ? A card ! People are starting to come in already . WESTON It 's the gentleman who was here before . JONES Yah ? I 've never heard of him . ( Crosses to OSCAR ) Did you ? FRITCHIE ( At R.C. , looking at card ; shakes head ) No . And I do n't know why , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES ( Reading card ) A. J. Patterson. p. 127 FRITCHIE ( Also reading ) Attorney-at-law . ( Quickly ) That 's the part I do n't like . ( Takes step L. ) JONES Did he say what he wanted ? WESTON No , he did n't . JONES ( To OSCAR ) Oh , well , he 's probably just come to make an offer . Huh ? FRITCHIE No  --  they do n't make offers , attorneys-at-law . JONES You 're getting me nervous now . FRITCHIE I bet we 've got the show in the wrong theatre . JONES ( To JANE ) Will you tell him to come in ? WESTON Yes , sir . ( Crosses to door , opens and holds it open ) Will you please come in , Mr. Patterson ? ( He enters and she closes door and stands with back to same . PATTERSON enters R. , comes in a few steps and holds . ) JONES Did you want to see me ? PATTERSON ( Looks at OSCAR ) Which is Mr. Peter Jones ? p. 128 FRITCHIE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATTERSON Is this Mr. Oscar Fritchie ? FRITCHIE Yep . PATTERSON I called on you gentlemen earlier and left word that I would return . FRITCHIE Yah ? I  --  wish I 'd known . ( Another step L. ) PATTERSON You have my card ? JONES Yes . PATTERSON My name is Patterson . JONES ( Looks at card ) That 's right . PATTERSON I 'm an attorney-at-law . FRITCHIE A lawyer , huh ? ( Steps toward PATTERSON . ) PATTERSON ( Sternly ) An attorney-at-law . FRITCHIE ( Turns and steps away to L. one or two steps ) Oh ! JONES Is there something we can do for you , Mr. Patterson ? PATTERSON There is . May I  --  ( Indicates desk L.C. ) p. 129 JONES ( JANE steps down below door R. and holds ) Yes . Surely . ( PATTERSON crosses to upper end of desk , puts on glasses , takes documents from case , magazine , arranges them . Long pause . PETER and OSCAR look at PATTERSON , then each other , worried . PATTERSON clears throat , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lehmac Productions , Incorporated , Fourteen Hundred and Sixty-eight Broadway , New York , New York . A New York corporation . ( Looks at PETER . ) JONES We are . ( Raises R. hand . ) FRITCHIE He owns most of it . ( Indicates PETER . ) PATTERSON ( Crossing L. ) Said corporation being the producers of a dramatic composition or play , entitled " Her Lesson . " JONES Is it s-something about the play ? ( Crosses to PATTERSON in front of OSCAR . ) PATTERSON ( Back of desk ) In November , Nineteen  --  ( Picks up magazine , reads year and date from magazine ) Hundred and Sixteen there appeared in this magazine , " Peppy Tales , " published in New York City , an article of fiction , or short story , entitled " A Woman 's Honor . " Said story  --  ( Crosses to L. ) having been written by my client , Mr. Rodney Rich , of Northampton , Massachusetts  --  ( Crosses back to desk ) and , as we shall duly prove in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine on desk and again picks up legal paper ) In court . FRITCHIE I thought you said court . PATTERSON The said story was , on  --  ( Reads from legal paper ) January Eight , Nineteen Hundred and Seventeen , accepted as the basis of a play by one Harley Thompson , since deceased . JONES ( OSCAR looks to PETER to explain ) Dead . PATTERSON Subsequently , as we shall prove , the said play was purchased , or acquired , by one Joseph JOE  --  ( PETER looks at OSCAR ) and by him duly produced . It will be shown that the said dramatic composition , or play , is similar to the aforesaid short story at  --  ( Looks at legal paper again ) one hundred and forty-six points . JONES One hundred and forty-six ? ( Turns to PATTERSON again . ) PATTERSON And that no less than six characters in the aforesaid play bear the same names as those in the aforesaid short story . ( Looks at PETER. ) p. 131 JONES ( A few steps to PATTERSON ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Crosses down on R. side of desk ) My client , Mr. Rodney Rich , has received no payment for this play , nor has his permission been sought in any way . ( Stops at lower end of desk ) It is , gentlemen , a clear case of plagiarism  --  ( Crossing up on L. side of desk ) and one of the most flagrant that it has ever been my privilege to encounter . ( Arrives again at upper end of desk . ) FRITCHIE But  --  but  --  but  --  look here  --  JONES We did n't know anything about it . I bought it from Mr. Lehman , and then Mr. Fritchie here  --  PATTERSON Unfortunately  --  ( Looks at legal papers again . ) FRITCHIE That 's a bad word . PATTERSON ( At upper end of desk ) My client can not take that matter into account . His composition has been produced in dramatic form without his consent . Not unnaturally he seeks redress . p. 132 FRITCHIE Seeks what ? PATTERSON ( OSCAR looks at PETER for him to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing these facts before you , prior to bringing suit  --  is to afford you the opportunity ,  --  if you so desire , of adjusting the matter outside of court . ( Places legal paper on desk . OSCAR indicates PETER to do something . ) JONES Well  --  well  --  what are we supposed to do ? ( Crosses a couple-of steps to PATTERSON . ) PATTERSON My client will accept sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of all profits derived from said play , when , if and as produced , and in those circumstances will permit the play to continue . Failing to receive sixty-six and two-thirds per centum  --  FRITCHIE ( Nods head to PETER ) That 's money , too . PATTERSON He will apply for an injunction and cause the play to be closed at once . JONES He 'll close it ? PATTERSON He will close it . FRITCHIE Close it ? p. 133 PATTERSON ( Very firm and fierce ) You understand me . ( Turns and puts magazine and papers in case and shuts it , puts glasses in pocket . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see ? I do n't know much about law , see ? You  --  do something , and I 'll go over and see if the theatre 's burned down yet . ( Puts hat on , exits R. , closing door . ) JONES ( Crosses U.R . after OSCAR 'S exit ) What are we going to do ? WESTON ( Crosses to C. ) Must Mr. Jones give an answer immediately ? PATTERSON I regret that he must . JONES ( Crosses down R.C. on JANE 'S R. ) But  --  I have n't had time  --  WESTON ( At C. ) Ca n't we  --  even talk it over ? That is , Mr. Jones and I ? PATTERSON ( Crosses down to them R.C. ) This young lady is your adviser ? JONES Yes , indeed . PATTERSON ( Crosses R. to door ) At best , I could allow but a brief time . ( Opens door. ) p. 134 JONES Well , that would be better than  --  PATTERSON ( In door ) Shall we say  --  fifteen minutes ? JONES Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall return for your decision in fifteen minutes . ( Exits R. , closing door . ) JONES Oh , Jane ! WESTON Oh , Peter , you must n't worry . JONES ( Crosses L. to R. side of desk ) Oh , Jane  --  just when everything was going along so fine , to have  --  WESTON ( At C. ) But you must n't get discouraged . He  --  may not be right at all . JONES ( At lower end of desk , his back to her ) Oh , yes , he is . I remember Mr. Lehman said something about its being a story , that very first day . WESTON ( Crosses to PETER at his R. ) But this may not be it . Now , when he comes back we 'll make him show all his proofs  --  JONES It 's no use , Jane  --  Sixty-six and two-thirds per centum  --  And I was going to do such big things . ( Sits R. of desk. ) p. 135 WESTON You will yet , Peter . JONES I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of naturally do big things , and others that  --  like  --  I would n't care if it were n't  --  ( Puts elbows on table , rests chin in hands ) for  --  everything . WESTON ( Pauses ; backs away a step ) Peter  --  may I tell you something ? I love you . JONES ( Rises ; crosses to her ) Do you ? WESTON ( At C. ) I wanted to tell it to you now , when things are  --  looking black . It  --  it may be wrong , but  --  I 'm glad this has happened . JONES ( Takes her hands ) Glad ? WESTON Of course  --  I 'm sorry about the money , but I 'm awfully glad for you . JONES How do you  --  mean , Jane ? WESTON I did want you to be successful , but somehow you lost something that was you . It 's just as you said , Peter  --  you 're not that kind of person  --  you never could be . You belong back in Chillicothe , in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really like all this , do you ? p. 136 JONES I do n't know . I thought I did , but  --  I do n't know . ( Turns away ; she still holds his R. hand . ) WESTON Do n't you see  --  how little it amounts to , really ? You 're too fine for it , Peter . JONES ( Turns to her ) Did you mean that , about  --  loving me ? ( Hands on her arms . ) WESTON More than anything that ever was . ( Head on his shoulder ; pause ) I thought  --  ( Raises head ) for a while you 'd gone away from me , but now I know you never can . It made me so unhappy to think that  --  but now it 's all over . JONES ( Crosses to lower end of desk ) It 's over , all right . Being a success is all over . WESTON You must n't mind . JONES I wanted it to go on account of you , and now there is n't anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But suppose you gave him what he wanted  --  what difference does it make ? JONES I could n't . I hardly have a thing left . Besides , I got Oscar to go into this and  --  ( JANE crosses to C. Knock on C. door . ) He would n't be here already , would he ? p. 137 WESTON ( Crosses up ; opens C. door ) Mrs. Lehman . FANNY Hello . ( Enters up C. ) JONES ( At lower end of desk ) Oh  --  hello . FANNY ( Crosses to C. ) Hello ! Well , you ought to be peppier than this . Do you know you 've got a hit ? JONES ( At FANNY 'S L. ) Yes , ma'am . FANNY Yes , sir  --  a hit . I do n't know what that proves about the public , but it 's certainly something . WESTON ( Crosses down to FANNY 'S R. ) You 've come to tell us something . FANNY You 're pretty cute . WESTON Well ? FANNY You 've got company coming . WESTON Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . JONES What 's he want ? FANNY He 's smoked out a bankroll and he wants to buy back the show . p. 138 JONES No ?  --  Oh  --  ( To JANE ) S-a-y  --  ( Then R. and back down R.C. ) Look . You do n't think he will get here pretty soon  --  ( Looking at watch ) in less than fifteen minutes , do you think ? FANNY What 's going on ? JONES Do you ? FANNY ( Nods ) I just shot ahead of him to tell you that he 's picked up a little tip . JONES Huh ? ( Together ) WESTON What is it ? FANNY You know I got a kind of a fool liking for you two . Somehow , suckers always did appeal to me . JONES You were going to tell us ? He might get here , and  --  FANNY It 's this . You 've got about three times as big a hit as you think you have . JONES No ! FANNY You know that brothel scene ? JONES Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the show . That means you 'll be hanging ' em up on the rafters . p. 139 JONES Gosh ! ( LEHMAN knocks up C. door . Backs away . ) FANNY Joe raised the money on that tip . He 's got it on him in certified checks . WESTON How much ? FANNY I do n't know . ( LEHMAN knocks again . ) JONES A butter-and-egg man .

JOE ( At C. ) I 'll give you what you paid for it  --  twenty and ten  --  thirty thousand . You wo n't lose a thing . JONES ( Laughs ) You wo n't either , will you ? JOE What ?

That 's ridiculous . Why , even Mr. Lehman offered that much . MCCLURE He did ? JONES Do you want to go any  --  ( Turns to MAC ) higher ? It 's a great play  --  there 's a priest in it  --  MCCLURE ( Turns to LEHMAN ) How about you , Mr. Lehman ? JOE ( Steps up C. a little . To FANNY ) I 'm going to brain you . WESTON I know a way to fix things . Mr. Lehman has fifty thousand dollars and so has Mr. McClure . JOE ( Steps down again ) Well ? WESTON Why should n't they  --  buy it together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an idea . Very good . ( Pats her on shoulder ) A hundred thousand dollars . JOE What ? WESTON That 's the price , Mr. Lehman .
