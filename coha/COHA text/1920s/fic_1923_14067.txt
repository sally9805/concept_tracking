Interior of MATT HUNT 's home in the Carolina mountains . The walls and ceiling are of rough boards , smoked and stained with age . The furniture is old and hand-made . The place is neat and home-like in the old-fashioned way . At the left , toward the rear , is a rough staircase with crude balustrade . Under the staircase , facing the right wall , is a small door opening into the cellar . To the right of this there is another door leading into the kitchen . The outside door is in the rear wall and opens directly on a porch covered with flowering shrubs . A " Red Rambler " rose hangs over the doorway on a trellis . There are windows on each side of the door , through which you catch a glimpse of a river valley with mountains in the background . To the left of the door is a gun rack with ancient and modern firearms . It is late afternoon and the bright sunlight , visible through the doors and windows , is tempered by the lengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half concealing the distant peaks of the mountains . Old DAVID HUNT enters from without . He is a rugged , well-preserved man of eighty . His snow-white hair and beard contrast vividly with the ruddy glow of his face . The peculiar radiance of countenance that comes with serene old age is heightened in him by the brilliant sunlight , which brings into full relief a personality that is rich , humorous , and mellow without a touch of sentimentality . He carries an old muzzle-loading rifle , which he places in the gun rack after removing the percussion cap . A moment later his daughter-in-law , MEG HUNT , a strong , active woman of forty-odd , enters from the kitchen , carrying an earthenware bowl full of garden peas . MEG HUNT Whew ! I declar  --  it 's hot enough in that kitchen to brile bacon ' thout a fire ! ( She sits down and begins to shell peas. ) p. 3 DAVID HUNT ( mops his face ) . It 's hot ' nough everywhar to-day . MEG HUNT I reckon it 'll storm ag'in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll miss a good chance . MEG HUNT Whar you been ? DAVID HUNT Up along the river . I thought I might run across that hawk that 's been after your young turkeys . MEG HUNT Did you see it ? DAVID HUNT ( seats himself and helps her shell peas ) . Not close enough to speak to him . But I did n't foller him fur . I thought I 'd kinder like to be around when Sid gits home . MEG HUNT ( glances toward the door uneasily ) . Seems quair they hai n't come yit . With Matt a-leavin ' here at daybreak they 'd ought ha ' been home two hours ago . DAVID HUNT Well , it takes time on a day like this . Matt ai n't a-goin ' to push them colts up the mountain this weather . An ' Sid , apt as not , did n't git thar on time . He never wus a lad to be governed by clocks ( chuckles softly ) ner nothin ' else under the sun ' at I ever hyeard of ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mebby the war 's changed him ! p. 4 DAVID HUNT Mebby so . MEG HUNT When it fust started I mind they wus lots in the papers about our soldiers a-goin ' into battle a-prayin ' an ' readin ' their Bibles . Sid always wus good about readin ' his Bible . DAVID HUNT ( chuckles slyly ) . Yeh , ' specially the fightin ' parts . ( She starts slightly and a shadow crosses her face . ) But do n't you worry about Sid . He 'll settle down . They 's plenty o ' time fer that . ( Beaming with unconscious pride . ) I use to be jist like him when I was a lad , an ' now look at me . You do n't see me a-tearin ' around the country on hossback a-cussin ' an ' raisin ' Ole Ned . MEG HUNT No ; but I would n't put it past you if you had the strength . DAVID HUNT Hey ? MEG HUNT It 's your flesh that 's got religion , not your sperit . DAVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it , though I reckon you 'd like it better if I'us ashamed o ' havin ' been young an ' strong . You 're jist like all women , Meg . When they find a man 's got a little sap in him they think he 's headed straight fer the devil . ( Horses are heard in the distance . MEG springs up excitedly. ) p. 5 MEG HUNT Thar ! I know that 's them ! DAVID HUNT It sounds like it  --  from here . ( Shading his eyes with his hand , he looks up the river , while she peeps over his shoulder . ) It 's Matt , all right , but I do n't see Sid . MEG HUNT ( turns away querulously ) . Well , it 's no more'n I expected ! I 've had a feelin ' ever sence they took him across that ocean that I 'd never see him ag'in ! ( SID , dressed in civilian clothes , with khaki shirt and hat , enters from the kitchen , eating a large piece of pie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unmistakable slouch of the mountaineer . ) SID HUNT Hello , Mam ! MEG HUNT Sid ! ( She hugs him , with tears in her eyes . He laughs and pats her on the back , taking another bite of pie . ) What 'd you sneak in through the kitchen an ' skeer me like this fer ? I thought you had n't come ! SID HUNT I did n't sneak . I jist nachelly come around to the place whar the cookin 's done . ( Shaking hands with DAVID . ) H'lo , Gran'pap ! How air you ? DAVID HUNT I can still lick any eighty-year-old man my size in the mountains if I can ketch him . p. 6 SID HUNT ( laughs and turns his attention to MEG again ) . Well , Mam , it seems right nachel to see you ag'in . How you been makin ' out ? MEG HUNT I 've been jist about as common . I worried lots about you . An ' you ai n't a-lookin ' none too fat . I 'll bet you hai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . SID HUNT Shucks ! I 'm all right ! Better'n when I went away . DAVID HUNT You ' pear to me to be about as sassy as ever . I reckon you knowed you ' us a hero ? SID HUNT Yeh , I read about it in the papers . DAVID HUNT ( makes a face and spits ) . The things they 've printed about you 's enough to make a healthy man spew ! I 'll bet if the truth ' us knowed you did n't do half as hard fightin ' as I done in the Confederate war ! SID HUNT ( grins mischievously ) . You did n't have as many notches on your gun when you got back . DAVID HUNT Mebby I wus n't as big a liar afore I went . SID HUNT You did n't have to be ; you wus n't a-goin ' to as big a war . DAVID HUNT Size ai n't everything in a war ! They was bigger men in the one I went to ! p. 7 SID HUNT Well , I du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAVID HUNT ( contemptuously ) . Pershin ' an ' Fotch ! Chiggers an ' seed-ticks ! Knee-high to a gnat ' longside o ' Stonewall Jackson an ' Robert E. Lee ! MEG HUNT Lord ! Sid hai n't no more'n stepped in the house , an ' you start fightin ' your ol wars all over ag'in ! DAVID HUNT ( chuckles wisely ) . She 's dis'p'inted in you , Sid . You 're too robustious to suit her . She 's been hopin ' you 'd come back sorter peakin ' an ' pinin ' so she could mammy you an ' fatten you up . MEG HUNT ( looks at him quickly with a startled expression ) . What ever put that notion in your head ? DAVID HUNT Well , I 've noticed that you allus pay more attention to the runts among the pigs an ' chickens than you do to the healthy uns . ( RUFE appears at the top of the stairs , unobserved by the others . He is thirty , of medium height , with pale face and shifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  jist like humans . When the Saviour was on earth he ministered to the halt an ' blind an ' did n't bother about t'others . What 's the use in doin ' fer folks like you an ' Matt ? You 've neither of you ever been sick a day in your life . p. 8 DAVID HUNT I ai n't complainin ' . A man cai n't have everything in this world . An ' as a constancy I 'd rather have a good stomach an ' sound sleep as affection from women . RUFE PRYOR ( comes downstairs , smiling at DAVID with an expression of great compassion and humility ) . I reckon that 's a hint that I 'm bein ' treated too well here . DAVID HUNT No ; I did n't even know you was in hearin ' distance , Rufe . I thought you ' us out thar ' tendin ' the store . RUFE PRYOR Well , whether you meant it er not , I want you to know ' at I agree with you . I know I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a woman in it that 's as good to me as my own mammy that died when I ' us little ! If she 'd ha ' lived I might ha ' been more deservin ' . MEG HUNT Sid , you rickollect Rufe , do n't you , that use ' to work fer Joe Bedford down on Sandy Fork ? SID HUNT Shore I do . You 're the feller that 's been a-helpin ' Pa while I ' us away . ( He shakes hands cordially . There is a suggestion of constraint in RUFE 's manner . ) How 's your health ? RUFE PRYOR I cai n't brag on myself much . SID HUNT What 's the trouble ? You 're lookin ' all right . p. 9 RUFE PRYOR Yeh , I am , on the outside . The thing 's in here ( taps himself on the stomach ) , whatever it is . I tried to git in the army after you left , but they would n't have me . DAVID HUNT Fust I ever hyeard of it , Rufe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 's not the fust I 've hyeard of it . Rufe do n't tell his business to everybody . DAVID HUNT What post did you go to to git edzamined  --  if ' tai n't no secret ? RUFE PRYOR I wus n't edzamined by no army doctor . I wus a-goin ' to be , but a man down at Pineville looked me over an ' said it wus n't no use . DAVID HUNT Wus he a doctor ? RUFE PRYOR ( evasively ) . Not edzackly ; but he had worked fer one an ' knowed how to edzamine folks . DAVID HUNT ( chuckles ) . Oh , I see ! Like the man by playin ' the fiddle : he 'd seed it done ! Well , them army doctors would n't ha ' been so pertickler , jedgin ' by some o ' the samples I seen that got by ' em . RUFE PRYOR I hyeard they let the bars down toward the end . But I 'd jist as soon stay out of a fight if I cai n't git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the best time to git in . RUFE PRYOR ( looks at him in surprise ) . Did n't you like fightin ' ? One o ' the papers here said as how you took to it like a fish to water . SID HUNT ( laughs ironically ) . Shore I did ! It ' us pie to me ! DAVID HUNT That 's another lie , Sid ! ( SID laughs . ) RUFE PRYOR Well , I reckon a man can have too much o ' anything . But I b'lieve I 'd like war if I had the health to stand up under it . ( DAVID grunts incredulously . ) I du n no why , but my mind seems to run nachelly to fightin ' . DAVID HUNT That 's because your legs'ld run nachelly t' other way . MEG HUNT ( annoyed ) . You 've never seed ' em run , have you ? DAVID HUNT No ; but he comes of a peaceful family . I mind his gran'daddy durin ' the Confederate war . He wus so peaceful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite the ends offen the paper cater'ges we used then , so he would n't have to go . RUFE PRYOR He did n't b'lieve in fightin ' about niggers ! He 'd ha ' fit all right if he 'd had as much to fight fer as Sid had ! p. 11 DAVID HUNT What did Sid fight fer ? I 'll bet he do n't know . SID HUNT Then you got another bet comin ' . I fit to lick t' other side ! DAVID HUNT Well , you 're the fust un I 've seed that knowed , an ' I 've axed lots of ' em . An ' I reckon our men wus n't the only ones . That gang o ' Germans that you got a medal fer ketchin ' must ha ' been kinder hazy in their minds about the needcessity o ' fightin ' . ( He pats himself significantly on the stomach . ) I 'll bet they had some sort o ' inside trouble  --  like Rufe . SID HUNT ( laughing ) . I know dern well they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid ? You could n't talk their talk , could you ? SID HUNT No , but I could tell by the way they acted . Soon as each seed t' other we both started to run . But I looked back first . When I seed they wus a-runnin ' away , too , I tuk after ' em a-hollerin ' an ' shootin ' like hell had broke loose , an ' the whole bunch surrendered ! RUFE PRYOR An ' they give you a medal fer it ! Why , I could ha ' done that ! DAVID HUNT You might , Rufe , if you 'd ha ' thought to look back . ( He turns to SID . ) I reckon their army had found out they wus peaceful folks an ' put ' em out thar to git ketched . The dam Yankees use ' to do that . An ' from what I 've hyeard o ' these here Germans they 're jist a bastard breed o ' Yankees . p. 12 MEG HUNT Whar is your medal , Sid ? SID HUNT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last button offen my drawers while ago an ' I got ' em pinned up with it . ( MATT HUNT , a vigorous mountaineer of forty-five , appears on the doorstep and begins stamping the mud off his boots . He carries a lap robe and a " slicker " across his arm . ) SID HUNT But here comes Pap . He 's got sompen I can show you . ( To MATT . ) Ha ' you got that package fer Mam ? MATT HUNT ( fumbling under the lap robe ) . Yeh , it 's here som'ers . MEG HUNT What is it ? MATT HUNT ( throwing the package into her lap ) . You 'll have to ax Sid . He fetched it . SID HUNT It 's some sort o ' female sompen that a French gal asked me to bring you . I du n no what you 'd call it . MEG HUNT ( turning the package over doubtfully ) . Umn ! If all I 've hyeard about them gals over thar 's so , I dunno 's I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Le ' me see it . MEG HUNT ( taking it away from him ) . Yeh , I 'll bet you 'd take it ! ( She opens the package gingerly and takes out a beautiful lace brassire . ) La ! Did she knit this herself ? p. 13 SID HUNT I reckon so . She ' us allus a-piddlin ' at sompen like that . MEG HUNT ( holds it up to the light admiringly ) . Umn-umph ! It 's purty enough , but I hai n't the least notion what it 's fer ! DAVID HUNT Ahem ! Does she look anything like her knittin ' , Sid ? SID HUNT Yeh , some . MEG HUNT Well , hope you cai n't see through her as easy . ( SID laughs . ) You did n't let her fool you up with her good looks , did you ? SID HUNT Well , I did n't fetch her back with me , like some of ' em done . DAVID HUNT If you had , I know a gal here that'ld ha ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses the room . MEG glances at him sympathetically . ) MATT HUNT Whar you goin ' , Rufe ? RUFE PRYOR Nowhere . I jist got tired o ' settin ' in one place . DAVID HUNT ( laughs knowingly ) . Rufe allus gits tired o ' the place whar he 's a-settin ' when you start talkin ' about Jude Lowry . MEG HUNT I do n't blame him . You talk so much about gals they ai n't nothin ' new left to say about ' em . p. 14 RUFE PRYOR I reckon they air jist about alike the world over . Wus the French uns after you all the time , Sid , same as them here ? SID HUNT I cai n't say ' at I ' us bothered by ' em much . DAVID HUNT I 'll bet you wus n't lonesome . An ' you wo n't be here . They 're lots bolder'n they wus when you left . They 's times now when I do n't feel safe myself . If I ' us your age I 'd marry Jude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman every time to fight a woman . ( At mention of JUDE LOWRY , RUFE gets up again and moves toward the door aimlessly . ) MATT HUNT Air you jist changin ' your settin ' place ag'in , Rufe , er air you goin ' out to the store ? MEG HUNT ( with a sudden flare of temper ) . What difference does it make to you which he 's a-doin ' ? MATT HUNT None in pertickler . Only I thought if he ' us a-goin ' out thar he could fetch Sid 's pack in when he comes back . RUFE PRYOR ( with an expression of martyrdom ) . All right , Matt , I 'll fetch it . O ' course what you hired me fer wus to tend the store . But I 'll be a nigger fer Sid  --  er anything else you ax me ! MATT HUNT ( rises angrily ) . What 's that you 're a-bellyachin ' about now ? p. 15 RUFE PRYOR I ai nt a  --  MATT HUNT ( storming impatiently ) . Air you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRYOR Why , I jist told you I wus ! MEG HUNT Did n't you hear him say it ? They ai n't no need in bawlin ' at him like that ! He 's got feelin 's , like the rest of us ! SID HUNT Hold on , Paw . I do n't want to be the cause o ' no fracas . I 've toted that ole pack all over the world an ' ' tai n't a-goin ' to hurt me to fetch it this much further . MATT HUNT No , you stay whar you air ! He 's got out of enough work here ! RUFE PRYOR I ai n't a-tryin ' to git out o ' nothin ' ! I 'm a-tryin ' hard to do anything you ax me , no matter what it is ! ( He goes out . ) MATT HUNT I never knowed nobody to git me r'iled up like he does . ( To SID . ) That 's the kind o ' help I 've had while you ' us away . SID HUNT Yeh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUNT It 's enough to make him tetchy , with your paw an ' grandpaw a-pickin ' on him all the time jist ' cause he ai n't as big an ' strong as they air . p. 16 DAVID HUNT You do n't ketch me an ' Matt a-pickin ' on chil'en jist ' cause they ai n't as big an ' strong as we air . I 've noticed when folks gits picked on it 's gene'ly ' cause they deserve it . MEG HUNT You could git along ' ith Rufe if you tried . MATT HUNT Yeh , I expect we could if we laid awake nights figgerin ' how to keep from hurtin ' his feelin 's  --  like you do . ' Tai n't only he 's tetchy  --  though God knows I 'm sick o ' hearin ' him bellyache  --  but he 's lazy er born tired , I du n no which . Why , he ai n't wuth his salt ! DAVID HUNT ' Specially sence he got that campmeetin ' brand o ' religion . I 've never seed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRYOR ( enters with the pack and sets it down ) . Thar ' t is , Sid . SID HUNT Much obliged , Rufe . ( He takes the pack and opens it . ) RUFE PRYOR No ' casion . I 'm glad to do anything I can to please Matt . MATT HUNT Well , I got jist one thing more fer you to do . I want you to pack up your duds an ' make tracks away from here . ( RUFE is dumfounded . He looks at MEG appealingly. ) p. 17 MEG HUNT Matt ! You ai n't a-goin ' to turn him off at this time o ' year ? MATT HUNT Course I am . I did n't adopt him fer life when I hired him . I told him he could stay tell Sid come back . MEG HUNT But he cai n't git another clerkin ' job . An ' it 's too late to start a crap now . MATT HUNT He 'd orter thought o ' that before . He 's knowed fer a month that Sid wus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meg . I might ha ' knowed this ' ld happen . ( He goes toward MATT with a malicious expression . ) But I 'm a-goin ' to tell you sompen fer your own good , Matt . God so loved the world that he give His only begotten Son to die so ' at everybody ' at wanted to might be saved . But you 've never took advantage o ' His offer . I cai n't understand that in a close trader like you , Matt . If the offer o ' free salvation ' us a box o ' free terbacker fer the store you 'd never let it git by . ( MATT makes an angry move . RUFE backs away . ) Understand , I 'm a-sayin ' this in a true Christian sperit  --  fer your own good . The Scripture says to love our enemies an ' do good to them that despitefully uses us . MATT HUNT Dadburn you , I do n't want you a-lovin ' me , ner doin ' good to me , nuther ! p. 18 RUFE PRYOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cai n't help it  --  an ' you cai n't , neither ! That 's one thing you ai n't the boss of ! MATT HUNT ( menacingly ) . Go on up an ' pack your duds an ' git out o ' here ! RUFE PRYOR ( backing away toward the stairs ) . All right , Matt . You 're the boss o ' that . You can hector me an ' bully me about the things o ' this world , but you cai n't keep me from lovin ' your immortal soul . An ' you cai n't take away my reward which is in heaven . An ' you cai n't escape yourn  --  which ai n't ! ( He disappears upstairs . MATT glares after him , his right arm trembling significantly . ) MEG HUNT It 's the truth that hurts , Matt . Your reward ai n't in heaven . MATT HUNT ( raging inwardly ) . I wish he 'd go thar er som'ers an ' git hisn ! DAVID HUNT I cai n't make him out . If he ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him . But he ' pears to honestly b'lieve everybody 's got to be like him afore they 're saved . MEG HUNT Mebby they has got to be different from you an ' Matt . SID HUNT Pap , if you do n't want him in the store , does it happen to be so 's you could let him finish out the summer at the sawmill ? p. 19 DAVID HUNT Shucks , Sid ! Do n't waste no worry on him . They ai n't money enough in the county to hire him to stay at a sawmill a week . MATT HUNT No , it 's too much like work . If he wants a job let him go to them city folks that 's a-puttin ' in that dam out here . They 'll take anything that comes along . An ' he 'd mix in fine with them furriners . MEG HUNT You know he ai n't strong enough fer that sort o ' work . SID HUNT This is your business , Paw , an ' I reckon you can ' tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisht you could see your way to keep him awhile longer . MATT HUNT What fer ? SID HUNT Well , I got some private affairs to look after . MEG HUNT An ' you 'd orter have a chance to rest up , too . SID HUNT Yeh , I would kinder like to spree around a little fer a change . MATT HUNT Well , if you want some time to yourself , I 've stood Rufe two years . I reckon I can stand him another month . But I du n no what sort o ' private affairs you 've got to look after . SID HUNT If I told you they would n't be private . ( He glances at DAVID with a humorous twinkle . ) Fer one thing , I need time to think up some tales to tell about how I won the war . p. 20 DAVID HUNT I reckon you 've got enough thought up already . SID HUNT I admit I got the makin 's o ' some good-sized uns . But I want to try ' em out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afore I swear to ' em . ( He takes a large bottle from the pack and gives it to DAVID . ) Here , Gran'pap ! Any time you git in a fight an ' want to ketch t' other feller , jist take a swaller o ' that . MEG HUNT ( disapprovingly ) . What is it  --  licker ? SID HUNT It 's one breed of it . The French call it cone-yack . DAVID HUNT ( sniffs the cork ) . It smells like it might be that . MEG HUNT Wus licker the best thing you could think of to bring your gran'pa ? DAVID HUNT ( laughing ) . She 's afeard you 're a-startin ' me on my downward career , son . An ' you may be . I knowed a man once that started when he wus about my age  --  an ' he drunk hisself to death when he ' us a hundred an ' two ! MEG HUNT Well , jist the same , he might ha ' thought o ' sompen better to bring you . ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible I give you ? Did n't you find room to fetch that ? p. 21 SID HUNT Somebody stole it . MEG HUNT Not your Bible ? SID HUNT Yeh . They 'll steal anything , in the army . MEG HUNT Why , I never hyeard o ' sich a thing ! An ' you went through the whole war like a heathen , ' thout so much as a Testyment ? DAVID HUNT The Baptis ' preacher here said they ' us men over thar a-givin ' ' em away to anybody ' at wanted ' em . SID HUNT Yeh , but they never got up whar we wus till after the fightin ' ' us over . An ' I did n't need one so bad then . ANDY LOWRY ( outside in the distance ) . Hello ! MEG HUNT That 's Andy ' ith the mail ! SID HUNT ( goes to the door and waves to him ) . H'lo , Andy ! ANDY LOWRY Well , I 'll be derned ! Is that you , Sid ? SID HUNT A piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' swop lies ? ANDY LOWRY I 'm skeered you 'll want too much boot jedgin ' by the size o ' them they 've been printin ' about you . SID HUNT Do n't let that worry you none . ( ANDY , a healthy young fellow , comes in . His face is slightly flushed with whisky , but he is not drunk. ) p. 22 ANDY LOWRY ( shakes hands cordially ) . You look healthy as a hell-cat ! SID HUNT Yeh , I can still eat  --  an ' drink some too when I can git it . ANDY LOWRY Do n't let not gittin ' it bother you . That 's all talk . I reckon you 're derned glad you went over ? SID HUNT I am now . But they ' us once er twice while I ' us thar I 'd jist as soon ha ' been back . ANDY LOWRY You 're lucky . They hai n't been no time I wus n't sorry I did n't go . SID HUNT What ' us the trouble ? Would n't they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ha ' jumped at me ! But Mam an ' Paw wheedled me into claimin ' edzemption so 's I could help cut that patch o ' timber up the river fer the gov'ment . An ' now I 'm totin ' the mail . SID HUNT Well , do n't be so down-hearted . Somebody 's got to tote it . ANDY LOWRY But , dam ' it all , I want a job that gives me more elbow room ! Every time I look at that piddlin ' mail sack an ' think o ' what you 've been through , I git so goddern mad at myself an ' everybody else ' at I feel like startin ' a war o ' my own right here in the mountains ! ( While ANDY is talking , RUFE comes downstairs with a small bag in his hand . At ANDY 's suggestion of starting a war of his own he stops suddenly and stands as if rooted to the spot . MEG also moves uneasily and exchanges significant glances with MATT and DAVID. ) p. 23 DAVID HUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sp'ilin ' fer a fight ! ANDY LOWRY Rufe ! Good Lord ! If he ' us in hell he would n't fight fire ! RUFE PRYOR Thank God , I 'm not headed to'ard hell , like some folks ! ANDY LOWRY I know you claimed edzemption when you j'ined the church . Well , every man to his likin ' . But hereafter I 'm a-goin ' to take what 's comin ' to me in this world an ' the next ! An ' that ' minds me , afore I fergit it : have you got any forty-five ammynition in the store ? RUFE PRYOR Ax Matt . I ai n't a-workin ' here no longer . ANDY LOWRY What 's the matter ? Lost your job ? SID HUNT That 's all fixed up , Rufe . I wo n't be workin ' much fer a while an ' Paw says you can stay another month . MATT HUNT ( looks at RUFE questioningly ) . That is , if he wants to stay bad ' nough to tend to his business ? RUFE PRYOR They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay . I got nowhere else to go . As fer ' tendin ' to my business , I 'll do what I 've allus tried to do , render unto Csar the things that are Csar 's an ' unto God the things that are God 's ! p. 24 SID HUNT Then that 's settled . I du n no whose department the ammynition belongs to . But go ahead an ' git them caterdges fer Andy an ' I 'll come out an ' beat you both shootin ' ' ith this popgun here . ( He takes a German pistol out of the pack . ) ANDY LOWRY ( looks at the pistol ) . You do n't call that thing a gun , do you ? SID HUNT No , it 's a Dutch peace-pipe . DAVID HUNT I do n't believe I ever seed any like that . How does it work ? SID HUNT ( hands him the pistol ) . It 's automatic . You pull the trigger and it goes right on spittin ' like a man chawin ' terbacker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Huh ! I would n't be ketched dead in the woods with it . SID HUNT Why not ? DAVID HUNT Because it 's a insult to shootin ' - men , that 's why ! It 's built on the notion that you 're a-goin ' to miss all your fust shots ! ANDY LOWRY How 'd you git aholt of it , Sid ? SID HUNT I smoked a Dutchman outen it by provin ' to him that I ' us a peacefuler man ' n he was . p. 25 ANDY LOWRY Does it shoot any better ' n ourn ? SID HUNT That 's what I want to find out . ANDY LOWRY Hell ! Hai n't you tried it yit ? SID HUNT Not from the hind end . The feller I got it from missed me the first shot . MEG HUNT ( eagerly , with a slight catch in her voice ) . Did he surrender , Sid  --  an ' give it to you  --  after he 'd shot at you ? SID HUNT N  --  no , not edzactly . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use fer it , so I stuck it in my pocket an ' fetched it along . MEG HUNT ( with a sudden revulsion of feeling ) . Thou shalt not kill ! ANDY LOWRY Ner git killed if you can help it ! ( He starts toward the door . ) Come on , Sid ! We 'll soon find out whether this thing hits whar you hold her er not ! MEG HUNT ( with intense emotion ) . No ! Sid ai n't a-goin ' ! SID HUNT ( looks at her , puzzled ) . Why , Mam ! What sort of a graveyard rabbit has crossed your path ? Me an ' Andy use ' to have shootin ' matches ' thout you makin ' no fuss about it ! p. 26 MEG HUNT I do n't keer ! I 've seed enough shootin ' an ' fightin ' in my time ! An ' I 've hyeard enough talk about war ! SID HUNT ' Tai n't a-goin ' to do no harm fer us to shoot at a spot on a tree ! MEG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

ANDY LOWRY If he had been to as many shootin ' matches as Sid , mebby you 'd be the one that 's a-feelin ' that way ! RUFE PRYOR It wus n't the shootin ' matches that saved Sid . It ' us the will o ' God . SID HUNT Mebby so , Rufe . But I 've noticed , other things bein ' ekal , God generally sides ' ith the feller that shoots the straightest . MEG HUNT Oh ! Cai n't you talk o ' nothin ' but shootin ' an ' killin ' ? I wish I could go some place where I 'd never hear guns mentioned ag'in as long as I live ! RUFE PRYOR You can ! We can all go thar if we live right ! ( He hesitates and looks at MATT out of the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys : if I ' us you I would n't have no more shootin ' matches .

RUFE is conscious of this , but continues with a show of innocence . ) An ' they ' us both fetched home on stretchers , ' long ' ith lots more o ' your kin on both sides , afore it ' us patched up .

SID HUNT You need n't pester your mind about me an ' Andy , Rufe . We 've knowed all about the war ' twixt our fam'lies sence we ' us knee-high . An ' it 's never made our trigger fingers itch none . Has it , Andy ? ANDY LOWRY Not a durned bit ! We nachelly hai n't talked about it , but I reckon we could if we had to . SID HUNT I do n't reckon nothin ' about it ; I know it ! Me an ' you could talk about anything ' thout fightin '  --  ' cept religion ! p. 28 ANDY LOWRY Ha , ha , ha ! I 'd even take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got about the same sort ! SID HUNT Well , my mouth ai n't no prayer-book an ' I do n't try to make it sound like one . ANDY LOWRY Me nother ! You cai n't make a sheep outen a wild cat by tyin ' a bunch o ' wool to its tail . DAVID HUNT You two young jackasses think you 're mighty smart a-runnin ' down religion ! But I want to tell you sompen : I 've lived in this ole world longer ' n both of you put together , an ' they ai n't nothin ' to be ashamed of in bein ' a Christian ! RUFE PRYOR I 'm glad to know you feel that way about it ! DAVID HUNT Hey ! What 's that you said ? ANDY LOWRY ( slyly , with an amused twinkle ) . You hyeard what he said . He 's a-hintin ' that he did n't know , from the way you behaved , that you wus a Christian . ( DAVID grips his stick and glares at RUFE . ) DAVID HUNT He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he does , dad-burn him , I 'll show him whether I 'm a Christian or not ! SID HUNT ( laughs ) . What 'll you do , turn t' other cheek ? p. 29 DAVID HUNT I might  --  once ! Consoun you , I b'lieve you agree with him ! You an ' Andy are so puffed up ' ith pride an ' wind that you think nobody but women an ' runts ever gits religion ! But I 'm here to tell you that I seed a preacher once right down thar in the Baptis ' church that could pick you both up by the scruff o ' the neck an ' shake you down to your nachel size ! MATT HUNT An ' he did n't ' pologize fer havin ' religion , nuther ! DAVID HUNT No , sir-ee , not by a jugful ! The fust day big meetin ' started he picked out the wust sinner they wus in the congregation an ' p'inted his finger at his nose an ' told him right out in meetin ' that he ' us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' us shot out of his own gun ! SID HUNT An ' d' you mean to say , Gran-pap , that you set thar an ' took it all ' thout a word ? DAVID HUNT Who told you it ' us me ? SID HUNT ( laughing ) . Nobody , but I ' lowed it wus . DAVID HUNT Well , you ' lowed right ! But I did n't set thar an ' take it . No , I ' us jist as much of a jackass as you an ' Andy . I riz up an ' walked out on the platform where he ' us a-standin ' an ' sez to him , sez I , " You 're a mighty big preacher ! I can see that by lookin ' at you . But what I want to find out is whether your religion 's in proportion to your size ! " An ' ' ith that I hauled away ' ith the flat o ' my hand an ' smacked him like all possessed on the right cheek ! ( He pauses dramatically. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool-proof ? DAVID HUNT I 'm a-comin ' to that . I seed him grit his teeth an ' trimble from top to toe jist like a steam engine in britches ! But he ketched hisself in time an ' turned t' other cheek ! ( He pauses again . ) SID HUNT An ' what 'd you do then ? DAVID HUNT I done jist what you er any other young jackass ' ld ha ' done ' ith Satan aggin ' him on : I smit him ag'in ! SID HUNT Ha , ha , ha ! I reckon he turned ag'in ? DAVID HUNT I jedge not , fer when I come to they wus two men a-rubbin ' me , an ' he ' us a-goin ' right on preachin ' an ' explainin ' Scripture as cool as if nothin ' had happened ! He said the Saviour never told us what to do after we 'd turned t' other cheek once , for he took it fer granted any durn fool ' ld know ! ( RUFE shifts uneasily and starts to say something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' ' ith that fer a text he whirled in an ' preached the best sermon I ever hyeard on the person o ' Christ ! He said the reason so many folks thought Christ ' us a weak an ' womanish sort of a man ' us because they ' us runts theirselves an ' wanted Him to keep ' em in countenance . Then he took the Scripture , passage an ' verse , an ' proved jist the sort o ' man Christ wus ! Now I 'll bet every one of you here thinks he used speritual power when he drove the thieves out o ' the temple ! ( He looks around at them triumphantly . ) But , ' ey ganny , he did n't ! p. 31 RUFE PRYOR How do you know he did n't ? DAVID HUNT B'cause he did n't have to , that 's how ! I never seed a man yit appeal fer speritual power when he could do it his self ! RUFE PRYOR An ' did he turn the water into wine the same way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if he 'd ha ' been a weak , water-drinkin ' man it stands to reason he would n't ha ' turned water into wine ! You 'd know that if you 'd read your Bible the way you 'd orter , ' stid nosin ' aroun ' in it fer the texts that suit you . RUFE PRYOR I 've read it from kiver to kiver ! I know it back'ards . DAVID HUNT That 's the only way you do know it ! You 'd have to have the right sort o ' religion to read it for'ards ! RUFE PRYOR They 's only one right sort ! That 's the sort Jesus had ! An ' , thanks to Him , I got that ! DAVID HUNT Shucks ! Jesus would n't know your religion if he met it in the road ! He did n't wait till the war broke out an ' skeered Him afore He got His ! He wa' n't that sort ! I did have hopes that Sid might start preachin ' the real Jesus religion when he got back , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these here piddlin ' ' Piscopalians that run that mission school over thar . He ai n't got no sort at all ! An ' as fer the sort o ' religion most folks has got around here , it 's a stench in the nostrils o ' God ! p. 32 RUFE PRYOR You need n't look so straight at me ! I know who you 're a-hittin ' at ! DAVID HUNT I wus n't a-hittin ' at nobody in pertickler ! But I 've allus hyeard you could tell who 's hit by who hollers . RUFE PRYOR I 'm satisfied ' ith my religion ! DAVID HUNT That 's a shore sign God ai n't . MEG HUNT La ! I 'd jist as soon hear you talk about war as religion ! DAVID HUNT It always has been a peacefuler subjec ' . MEG HUNT Cai n't you think o ' nothing else ? David , I thought you said you ' us a-goin ' to rob a bee-gum fer Sid afore supper .

Looks like a shower afore long . ( He goes out . ) DAVID HUNT Yeh , kinder feels like it . Come along , Meg ; you can hold the smudge . p. 33 MEG HUNT ( looks at SID and ANDY significantly ) . I 'd orter be startin ' supper . I reckon Sid can help you . DAVID HUNT Sid ! He ai n't no hand ' ith bees , an ' you know it ! Look here , Meg , if he covered hisself up from head to toe he would n't be as safe as he is right here ' ith Andy . So come on an ' stop your frettin ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEG . ) ANDY LOWRY ( getting ready to go ) . I reckon I 'd better be tappin ' the sand .

ANDY LOWRY Well , I got a bottle o ' blockade out here in the mail pouch , if you  --  RUFE PRYOR ( eagerly ) . Where 'd you git it , Andy ? ANDY LOWRY That 's my business . RUFE PRYOR I 've hyeard that new stuff they 're makin ' now 's so fiery that it 'll burn your insides out . ( He looks around and lowers his voice confidentially . ) You ought to see some I got . ANDY LOWRY You ! I thought you 'd gone prohybition ! p. 34 RUFE PRYOR This is some I had afore I j'ined the church . It 's over twenty year old . ANDY LOWRY Oh , hell ! RUFE PRYOR I swear it on a stack o ' Bibles ! SID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how 'd it ever live to be twenty year old ? ANDY LOWRY That 's what I 'd like to know !

ANDY LOWRY That do n't count fer no twenty years ! RUFE PRYOR I ai n't claimin ' I had it in my possession all that time . D' you mind that tale ' bout the revenue raid way back yonder , when Bob Fortenbury buried all his licker in the bed o ' Buck Spring Creek an ' never could find it ' cause it come a rain an ' washed his marks away ? ANDY LOWRY Yeh ? RUFE PRYOR Well , me an ' Bill Hedgpeth unkivered a ten-gallon keg one day ' bout three year ago when we ' us dynamitin ' fish .

Is they any left ? RUFE PRYOR Some . Why ? ANDY LOWRY Why ! Ha , ha ! Did you hear that , Sid ? He wants to know why ? ' Course you do n't want to sell it ? RUFE PRYOR Well , my advice to everybody is to let licker alone . But if folks is bound they 're a-goin ' to drink the stuff , I s'pose tai n't no more ' n right to help ' em git sompen good . ANDY LOWRY ( slaps him on the back ) . Spoke like a true Christian ! RUFE PRYOR That 's what I try to be , Andy . An ' ef that licker o ' mine 'll help you out I do n't want to make nuthin ' on it . The only thing is  --  I bought Bill Hedgpeth 's share , an ' if I 'm a-goin ' to be out of a job soon I would kinder like to git back jist what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have no trouble a-squarin ' yourself if it tastes anything like you say . RUFE PRYOR You do n't have to take my word for it . I got a sample bottle . ( He makes a move toward the stairs . ) Come on up an ' try it ! ANDY LOWRY ( hesitating ) . I 've had about all I can tote . But I reckon one more drink like that wo n't load me down .

ANDY LOWRY Trouble ! Jude 's got religion sence you left  --  like Rufe ! An ' she has a jeeminy fit every time she smells licker on me ! But drive on , Rufe !

Right an ' left ! The shoo-fly swing ! Sash-i-ate ! ( SID sashays toward the kitchen door . ANDY rushes after him. ) p. 50 RUFE PRYOR ( seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams with terror ) . Oh ! Do n't  --  ! ANDY LOWRY ( raises the pistol and covers SID ) . Wait ! Swing your partner ! ( SID turns and looks into the muzzle of the pistol . ) That 's right ! Face the music ! ( SID wipes the perspiration from his forehead , but gives no other sign of fear . JUDE appears from the kitchen . ) JUDE LOWRY Andy ! What are you  --  ANDY LOWRY Git to hell out o ' here if you do n't want a bullet in you ! ( JUDE rushes forward with a piercing scream . SID springs under ANDY 's arm , thrusting it upward with a twist . The pistol falls to the floor . SID releases ANDY and seizes the pistol . ) RUFE PRYOR Thank the Lord ! JUDE LOWRY ( rushing between ANDY and SID ) . Do n't kill him ! SID HUNT I ai n't a-goin ' to . ANDY LOWRY That 's a lie  --  you air a-goin ' to . Come on ! You got me . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' ld equalize things any , Andy . p. 51 JUDE LOWRY What 's the matter with him , Sid ? ( MEG and DAVID enter hurriedly from the kitchen . ) SID HUNT You 'll have to ax somebody ' at knows . He 's a-settin ' out to kill as many more Hunts as the Hunts killed Lowries in a feud fifty years ago ! MEG HUNT ( with a shudder of horror ) . Oh ! It 's all beginnin ' over ag'in ! DAVID HUNT This is your work , Rufe ! SID HUNT Now do n't go packin ' it on Rufe ! He done all he could to ca 'm Andy ! DAVID HUNT Mebby so ! ( He looks at RUFE , who stands with an expression of martyrdom . ) I b'lieve in givin ' the devil his dues ! But he knowed Andy ' us a-drinkin ' when he started that talk about the feud ! SID HUNT My experience has been that a man do n't take fire at a notion like that when he 's drunk ' less he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sober ! ( He puts the pistol in his pocket and takes hold of ANDY 's arm . ) Come on , Andy ! I 'm a-goin ' to put you on your horse now an ' send you home , where you ought to be ! JUDE LOWRY ( steps toward him with an apologetic air ) . I 'll take keer of him , Sid ! p. 52 SID HUNT He 's sober enough to go home by hisself . You stay here . I want to talk to you ' bout this . ( He leads ANDY out . ) MEG HUNT ( to David ) . Go on out thar with ' em an ' see ' at they do n't start fightin ' ag'in ! ( DAVID follows them . MEG lifts her apron to her eyes and sobs despairingly . ) It 's all a-startin ' over jist like it did the first time ! I 'll never see another minute 's peace now as long as I live ! JUDE LOWRY I never thought my brother ' ld act like that ! MEG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us help what our folks do ! ( She goes into the kitchen , weeping . ) RUFE PRYOR They ai n't no use grievin ' about it . I 'd druther see everybody live together in peace . But fer all we know , this may ha ' been so ordered . If it wus it 'll all work out fer the best in the end . JUDE LOWRY How 'd Andy ever git started quarrelin ' ' ith Sid ? RUFE PRYOR Trouble do n't generally start all on one side . But I 'm a friend to both of ' em an ' I 'm a-goin ' to keep my mouth shet . JUDE LOWRY I know Sid would n't ha ' crossed him a-purpose when he 's a-drinkin ' . p. 53 RUFE PRYOR Well , as I said afore , I ai n't a-takin ' sides neither way . But Sid can be mighty overbearin ' when he 's a mind to . JUDE LOWRY What 'd he say to Andy ? RUFE PRYOR Some folks do n't have to say things ; they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her significantly . ) But you 'll understand what I mean when you marry Sid . JUDE LOWRY I hai n't said yit I ' us a-goin ' to marry him ! RUFE PRYOR ( eagerly ) . You hai n't said you was n't ? JUDE LOWRY ( with simple dignity ) . No ; an ' I dunno 's I have any call to say it now . I do n't know what 's a-goin ' to happen now ! RUFE PRYOR If you do marry him you 'll find out lots o ' things about him that you did n't know before . I know you think I 'm a-sayin ' this fer selfish reasons ! But I ai n't ! Sence I first told you I loved you , Jude , I 've learned to sing " less o ' self an ' more o ' Thee " ! It 's not my own good I 'm after now , but your good  --  only yourn ! An ' I tell you , Jude , ef you marry Sid I know you 're a-goin ' to rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suppose you an ' Sid found out you both knowed the same thing about me ? p. 54 RUFE PRYOR The question is , which is right an ' which is wrong . JUDE LOWRY An ' who 's a-goin ' to settle that ? RUFE PRYOR Him  --  up yonder ! JUDE LOWRY Do you think He bothers his head much about who 's a-goin ' to marry who ? RUFE PRYOR I know He does ! I 'll tell you why ! JUDE LOWRY I 'd ruther not hear it now ! I got too much else to think about  --  with killin ' in the air ! RUFE PRYOR But I want to explain afore it 's too late . I want you to know that my love fer you wus ordained from above . The first time I ever thought o ' marryin ' you , Jude , ' us when I seen you in church the day I got religion ! JUDE LOWRY Mebby you would n't ha ' thought of it then if you 'd been a-studyin ' ' bout your religion like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jude ! That 's jist the p'int ! The whole thing ' us spiritual ! I mind it jist as well as if it ' us yistidy ! Preachin ' ' us over an ' they ' us singin ' " None but Christ . " When they come to the verse , " I sighed fer rest an ' happiness , &nbsp; &nbsp; I yearned fer them , not Thee ; But while I passed my Saviour by , &nbsp; &nbsp; His love laid hold o ' me , " I looked across the aisle an ' seen you a-settin ' thar a-singin ' ! An ' sompen hot swep ' over me jist like fire ! At first I thought it ' us Satan a-temptin ' me , an ' I tried to look t' other way . I do n't never look at the women 's side in the meetin ' - house . Anybody ' at knows me 'll tell you that . But I could n't look no other way then . Some power greater an ' stronger ' n me seemed to have holt o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ' us absolutely helpless , jist as helpless as a child ! But I did n't know what it wus till they got to the last verse . You know how it goes : " The pleasures lost I sadly mourned , &nbsp; &nbsp; But never wept fer Thee , Tell grace my sightless eyes received , &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy lov-li-ness to see . " It ' us then that the scales dropped from my eyes ! An ' I seen the truth ! An ' when I did , everything in the whole world ' us changed fer me ! I loved everybody an ' everything ! An ' I ' us so happy I felt jist like I ' us a-floatin ' away on a ocean o ' joy ! p. 55 JUDE LOWRY If you felt like that you 'd better let well enough alone . I could n't make you no happier by marryin ' you . RUFE PRYOR Yes , you could , Jude ! ( With a mystical suggestion . ) The half has never been told ! JUDE LOWRY The half o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chants ) . " I 've hyeard of a beautiful city , &nbsp; &nbsp; Fur away in the Kingdom o ' God ; I 've hyeard how its walls are o ' jasper , &nbsp; &nbsp; How its streets are golden an ' broad ! In the midst o ' the street is life 's river , &nbsp; &nbsp; Clear as crystal an ' pyor to behold . ( Rolling his eyes mystically . ) Not half o ' the joys that await ' em &nbsp; &nbsp; To mortals has ever been told ! Not half has ever been told ! &nbsp; &nbsp; Not half o ' the joys that await ' emTo mortals has ever been told ! " You know how the rest of it goes ! JUDE LOWRY Yeh , but that 's heaven . An ' they ai n't no marryin ' ner givin ' in marriage thar ! RUFE PRYOR Yes , they is , Jude ! They 's spiritual marriage ! That 's what I mean ! JUDE LOWRY No , that ai n't the sort you 're a-thinkin ' about . p. 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sort I ever think about ! I can say truthfully , Jude , that I 've never had a thought about you ner no other woman that I 'd be ashamed to tell to the angels in heaven ! SID HUNT ( enters at the front , laughing ) . Angels in heaven , eh ? JUDE LOWRY Sid ! Did Andy git off home all right ? SID HUNT Not yit . I left him out thar behind the store . JUDE LOWRY Is he sick ? SID HUNT Yeh  --  but he 'll soon be over it . He was throwin ' it off purty fast when I left . JUDE LOWRY You did n't give him back his pistol , did you ? SID HUNT No . They ai n't nuthin ' to worry about , Jude . He 'll be all right when he 's sober . Besides , Grandpap 's out there with him . So I thought I 'd come in an ' have a little talk ' ith you ; that is , if I ai n't a-cuttin ' short a preachment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sompen ' bout angels in heaven . JUDE LOWRY He says he can tell ' em all his thoughts about women . An ' that 's more ' n you can do , I expect ! SID HUNT Ha , ha ! Well , I had n't thought about tryin ' jist yit ! p. 57 RUFE PRYOR ' Tai n't nothin ' to laugh about ! A man hai n't got no right to look at a woman , much less marry ' er , tell he can think right thoughts about her ! SID HUNT How 's he a-goin ' to know what sort o ' thoughts he can think about her tell he looks at her ? RUFE PRYOR All my thoughts about ' em are right thoughts . ( Maliciously , with his eyes on JUDE . ) But o ' course I hai n't never seen them French gals you ' us a-tellin ' about while ago ! JUDE LOWRY What ' us he a-sayin ' about French gals ? RUFE PRYOR Do n't ax me . I ai n't a-carryin ' no tales . SID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move toward him half angrily , then stops with a puzzled expression . ) I cai n't quite make you out , Rufe . I du n no whether you 're a trouble breeder or whether you 're jist teched in the head with religion . But whichever it is , I want you to git this much straight : Me an ' Jude 's a-goin ' to be married , an ' anything I want her to know about them French gals I 'll tell her myself . JUDE LOWRY I 've never said I ' us a-goin ' to marry you ! SID HUNT Well , if you 've got any doubts on the subject I 'll clear ' em up ( he glances at RUFE significantly ) as soon as I have a chance to talk to you by yourself ! p. 58 RUFE PRYOR You need n't knock me down with it . I 'm perfectly willin ' to give you your chance with Jude . I guess she can jedge whether she could be happy yoked up to a unbeliever . ( He puts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( laughing ) . Religion certainly does take a quair turn ' ith some folks ! JUDE LOWRY It do n't seem to be a-troublin ' you none . Sid , how 'd Andy ever come to think o ' shootin ' you ? SID HUNT You got me ! He 'd been mixin ' his licker , I reckon . JUDE LOWRY That do n't ' count fer it ! What 'd you mean while ago when you said a man did n't act like Andy when he 's drunk ' less he 's been studyin ' some about it when he 's sober ? SID HUNT Jist what I said . He do n't generally . JUDE LOWRY Then you think Andy 's been holdin ' a grudge ag'in ' you ? SID HUNT I cai n't account fer him flarin ' up like he did no other way . Has he ever said anything to you about evenin ' up the score between the Hunts an ' Lowries ? ( She starts and takes a step away from him with instinctive distrust . ) You need n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to tell nobody the truth ! ( With suppressed emotion . ) It 's a lie I 'd be afraid to tell  --  er to act ! ( She sees from his expression that he does n't understand her . ) I b'lieve you know more about what started Andy 's tantrum ' n you purtend to ! p. 59 SID HUNT Jude , you do n't think I picked a fuss ' ith Andy ! JUDE LOWRY I du n no what I think ! But I know Andy did n't bear no grudge ag'in ' you ! SID HUNT The chances are he would n't ha ' told you if he had ! JUDE LOWRY An ' I would n't tell you  --  if you did ask me ! SID HUNT Why would n't you ? JUDE LOWRY ' Cause Andy 's my brother ! That 's reason enough , ai n't it ? SID HUNT But I 'm the man that 's a-goin ' to marry you ! JUDE LOWRY That 's what you 've been a-sayin ' . SID HUNT Well , you are a-goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wus mebbe  --  before . But now  --  I du n no . SID HUNT Now see here , Jude ! If this trouble with Andy is a-standin ' between us we might as well settle it right now . JUDE LOWRY ( with a flare of passion ) . You got no right to make me take sides ag'in ' my own flesh an ' blood ! SID HUNT I ai n't a-goin ' to try to make you . That 's sompen you 'll have to decide fer yourself . The Bible says a man an ' woman ought to leave their daddy an ' mammy an ' all the rest o ' their kin an ' stick together in spite o ' the devil  --  at least , that 's the sense of it . I do n't purtend to pattern after Scripture like Rufe , but that part always hit me as bein ' jist about right . An ' if you do n't feel the same way , I want to know it now . p. 60 JUDE LOWRY But I  --  ( She looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no room fer " buts " here , Jude . If you 've got any doubt about whose side you 'd be on in a fight between me an ' your folks , you 'd better give yourself the benefit of ' em . JUDE LOWRY I could n't never go back on my own kin ! SID HUNT Then that 's settled . ( He turns away . ) We do n't belong together . JUDE LOWRY You do n't actially think our folks are a-goin ' to start fightin ' ag'in , do you , Sid ? SID HUNT Not if I can keep ' em from it . But that ai n't the p'int ; if they do start , I do n't want no weak sister fer a wife . If a woman ai n't fur a man she 's purty apt to be ag'in ' him . They do n't come a-settin ' on the fence . JUDE LOWRY You mean I got to  --  take sides ag'in ' my own folks ? SID HUNT I mean you 've got to stand by me if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He meets her gaze firmly , without flinching . ) JUDE LOWRY ( breaks down , sobbing ) . But it ai n't right ! You know it ai n't right to go ag'in ' my own blood ! p. 61 SID HUNT Well , nobody ai n't a-makin ' you marry me . JUDE LOWRY ( turns on him angrily ) . What do you keep on a-sayin ' that fer when it ai n't so ! You know I cai n't do nothin ' else ! ( She sobs incoherently and puts her arms about him . ) SID HUNT ( embracing her tenderly ) . I sorter hoped you could n't , Jude . But I wanted you to find out fer yourself . JUDE LOWRY ( still sobbing ) . I 'm a-goin ' to do what 's right , but it 's terrible hard . Andy 's my own brother ! ' Tai n't in human nacher to  --  SID HUNT Do n't you worry about that ! They ai n't a-goin ' to be no trouble . I jist wanted to find out whar you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that to me . Nuthin ' ai n't a-goin ' to happen to Andy ner nobody else . ( MATT and DAVID are seen coming toward the front door . SID and JUDE separate . JUDE turns away toward the kitchen to hide her tears . ) DAVID HUNT Sid , me and Matt  --  ( Sees JUDE and hesitates . ) Step out here a minute , Sid . SID HUNT Is it about Andy ? p. 62 DAVID HUNT Yeh . SID HUNT Well , you can talk afore Jude . Me an ' her 's decided to git married . DAVID HUNT Well , I 'm glad o ' that ! MATT HUNT Mebbe it 'll help to keep the peace . SID HUNT It ' d orter . Go right ahead an say what you 're a-mind to . Jude knows all about the row with Andy , and they ai n't no doubt where she stands . DAVID HUNT Well , Matt and me 's been a-talkin ' it over an ' we think you 'd better ride up an ' ax Andy 's daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ' ith Paw ? DAVID HUNT We want to talk to him ' bout Andy . SID HUNT Why n't you wait tell Andy 's hisself ag'in an ' let me an ' him talk this over ? I never knowed no good to come o ' one o ' these fam'ly talkin ' - matches yit . Me an ' Andy can patch things up if you 'll jist let us alone . DAVID HUNT This ai n't no time fer patchwork . I want to git Jim Lowry right here on the ground , face to face ' ith you an ' Andy , an ' tell him edzactly what happened afore the tale has a chance to grow . I 've allus found him reasonable enough . ( RUFE enters at the front. ) p. 63 RUFE PRYOR Jude , Andy said tell you he ' us ready to start home now an ' to ax you if you ' us a-goin ' with him . JUDE LOWRY ( to DAVID ) . Do you want him to wait tell you send fer Paw ? If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice , but I do n't want to be pig-headed about it . SID HUNT I do n't neither . Mebby your way 's the best . But if Andy 's reached the state o ' ' countability ag'in , I 'd like to know how he stands on it afore we send fer his daddy . I know if I ' us Andy it ' ld jist make me mad . JUDE LOWRY I 'll talk to him an ' see what he says . ( She goes out . ) SID HUNT How is he now , Rufe  --  sober enough to ride his horse home ? RUFE PRYOR Yeh , I reckon so . I never seed licker go to nobody 's head like it did to hisn . When a man talks as wild as he did while ago , I believe it ' ld be better fer everybody concerned  --  hisself included  --  to put him behind bars . If I ' us in your place I 'd certainly have him bound by law to keep the peace . DAVID HUNT Folks that can be bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . They 're blood kin to them that looks around fer somebody to hold ' em when a fight starts . Andy belongs to t' other breed . ( Goes to window , turns to MATT and SID . ) They must ha ' been a reg'lar toad-strangler up the river last night . She 's a-b'ilin ' like a kittle o ' fish ! p. 64 MATT HUNT I noticed it ' us risin ' purty sharp as me an ' Sid crossed the bridge . SID HUNT ' Tai n't out o ' banks yit , is it ? DAVID HUNT Nowhere ' cept in the low places . She soon will be , though , if she keeps on ! I never seed the ole sow a-gittin ' her bristles up so fast ! RUFE PRYOR They 'd be a camp-meetin ' time if that big dam busted , an ' they 's one wing of it that ai n't finished yit . DAVID HUNT You need n't lose no sleep over that . I ' us up thar t' other day , an ' they ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wall . Nothin ' short of a box o ' dynamite ' ld ever make a dent on it . RUFE PRYOR It would n't surprise me much if some o ' the folks that fit so hard to keep ' em from puttin ' it in tried blastin ' to git it out . They 's one of ' em that 's been a-send-in ' to town by me fer a mighty heap o ' dynamite to dig wells with . DAVID HUNT In my opinion , Rufe , you 've been usin ' a good part o ' that dynamite yourself . RUFE PRYOR Me ! I 'd like to know what I 'd be usin ' it fer ! DAVID HUNT To kill fish . I 've seed you come back several times lately ' ith a fine string o ' trout . An ' I never noticed no hook marks in their mouths . p. 65 RUFE PRYOR I allus fish ' ith a tiny little pin-hook , to keep from tearin ' their mouths ! I 'm thankful to say I can ketch ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blast ' em out ' ith dynamite ! ( He goes out . ) MATT HUNT ( glances in the direction that he has gone ) . Somebody 's been a-blastin ' ' em lately . I 've seed lots o ' little uns a-floatin ' downstream dead . ANDY LOWRY ( in the distance ) . I 'm all right  --  you do n't need to help me . ( JUDE is seen coming toward the door with him . He is much sobered , but still slightly unsteady on his legs . There is a moment of constrained silence as he enters and looks about him . ) SID HUNT Here , Andy , have a cheer ! ANDY LOWRY ( hangs his head shamefacedly ) . No . Much obliged . I can stand all right . Jude said you axed her to marry you . SID HUNT Yeh , that 's right , Andy . ANDY LOWRY Well , I reckon they ai n't no use in tellin ' you that I made a fool o ' myself while ago . You ' us all here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it , and  --  ( He stops , unable to find suitable words. ) p. 66 SID HUNT Fergit it , Andy . That 's what I 'm a-go-in ' to do . Somebody done some purty tall talkin ' , I admit . But I expect it ' us the licker you drunk , instid o ' you . ANDY LOWRY I du n no ' bout that . But I know it ' us me that drunk the licker ! DAVID HUNT ' Tai n't none o ' my business , Andy , but if I found out they ' us truck I could n't put inside o ' me ' thout addlin ' my brains , I 'll be derned if I would n't keep it out er bust ! ANDY LOWRY I 'm a-goin ' to keep it out hereafter if I know myself ! SID HUNT Then here 's sompen you can take home with you when you start . ( He takes ANDY 's pistol out of his pocket and offers it to him . ) ANDY LOWRY ( starts to take it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other time ! SID HUNT ( puzzled ) . Why do n't you want to take it now ? ANDY LOWRY I du n no whether I 'm sober enough yit ! SID HUNT Ha , ha ! If that 's all ' at 's worryin ' you , I 'll run the resk ! ( He drops the pistol in ANDY 's holster . ) JUDE LOWRY ( nervously ) . We 'd better be goin ' , Andy ! p. 67 SID HUNT Wait till I saddle a horse an ' I 'll go a piece with you . I want to see how it feels to have my feet in stirrups ag'in after walkin ' all over the world . DAVID HUNT ( who has been looking at the weather signs ) . I do n't want to hurry nobody off , but from the way the clouds air a-b'il-in ' over the mountain thar it would n't s'rprise me if we had fallin ' weather ag'in afore night . ( MATT goes out to look at the clouds . ) SID HUNT Well , I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) DAVID HUNT I ai n't , nuther . But I 'm like all Baptists ; I abominate havin ' it sprinkled on me . JUDE LOWRY ( looks into the kitchen , then turns to DAVID ) . Where 'd Miz Hunt go ? DAVID HUNT I expect she 's out thar a-roundin ' up her young turkeys . ' Bout half of ' em got draggled in the rain yistidy , an ' they 're droopin ' an ' dyin ' like good children . ( JUDE goes out through the kitchen . DAVID follows her . ANDY sits gloomily , his face in his hands . RUFE enters at the front and looks at him furtively . ) RUFE PRYOR ( comes forward ) . Well , Andy , I jist hyeard Matt say everythin ' is all smoothed over an ' they ai n't a-goin ' to be no more trouble . p. 68 ANDY LOWRY ( grunts , without looking at him ) . Yeh , that 's right . RUFE PRYOR I certainly hope it is . ANDY LOWRY I ai n't a-goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! An ' I guess he wo n't , now that he 's a-goin ' to marry Jude . RUFE PRYOR ( starts ) . Oh , is he a-goin ' ter marry her ? ANDY LOWRY Yeh , they got it all fixed up . RUFE PRYOR That 'd orter help some . ( Then with a nervous laugh . ) I see you got your pistol back . ( Comes toward ANDY , lowering his voice guardedly . ) Andy , if I tell you sompen as a friend , will you swear on the Bible never to breathe it to a soul ? ANDY LOWRY My word 's as good as my oath ! RUFE PRYOR I know it is ! An ' that 's all I want ! ANDY LOWRY Then consider ' at you 've got it ! RUFE PRYOR ( comes still closer to him ) . You value your life , do n't you , Andy ? ANDY LOWRY I reckon I do . I 've had plenty o ' chances to throw it away , an ' I hai n't took none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got another now ! ( Significantly . ) If I ' us in your place I 'd make myself as scarce as hen teeth around here ! ANDY LOWRY What are you drivin ' at ? Have they got a bullet salted fer me ? RUFE PRYOR ( gives him an eloquent look ) . If they have they hai n't told me ! ANDY LOWRY I do n't want to know what they 've told you ! I want to know what you know ! RUFE PRYOR As man to man ? ANDY LOWRY Yeh , as man to man ! RUFE PRYOR I 'm a-takin ' a big chance to tell you ! But you 've always been my friend , Andy ! An ' I 'll stick by a friend tell Jedgment . They 're all I got left in the world ! ANDY LOWRY ( impatiently ) . Well , come on ! What are they up to ? RUFE PRYOR Jist now  --  afore you come in  --  ANDY LOWRY Yeh ? RUFE PRYOR Sid an ' his daddy an ' the ole rooster ' us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquest ! RUFE PRYOR That 's what I 'd call it ! p. 70 ANDY LOWRY What ' us the verdick  --  death from nachel causes ? RUFE PRYOR They did n't edzackly say that . ANDY LOWRY But you know what they meant ? RUFE PRYOR We never know nothin ' in this world . But my advice to you is not to let Sid ketch you by yourself in a lonesome spot in the woods ' less you want to wear a wooden overcoat . ANDY LOWRY If that 's his game , why did n't he let daylight through me when he had a good excuse ? ( Lays his hand on his pistol . ) An ' what 'd he gim me back my pistol fer ? RUFE PRYOR You do n't know Sid like I do . He 's deeper ' n he looks . If he 'd ha ' killed you while ago when he had a chance , Jude ' ld never ha ' married him . But he 's made hisself solid ' ith her now by lettin ' you off . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ai n't nobody a-lookin ' , though that ai n't a-pesterin ' his mind much , fer he knows the law cai n't tetch him . ANDY LOWRY Why cai n't it ? RUFE PRYOR ' Cause you threatened his life in the presence o ' witnesses . ANDY LOWRY Has he got all that figgered out aforehand ? RUFE PRYOR That an ' more . ( He hears footsteps outside and glances toward the door . ) Here he comes now . You watch him ! He 'll be so smooth with you that butter wo n't melt in his mouth ! ( SID enters briskly. ) p. 71 SID HUNT I 'm ready , Andy , if you are . Where 's Jude ? ANDY LOWRY I du n no ! She went out thar to look fer your mammy ! SID HUNT Jist set still . I 'll call her . I hope your head ai n't a-feelin ' top heavy , fer I expect we 're a-goin ' to have to do some hard ridin ' to keep ahead o ' that cloud . It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the kitchen . ) RUFE PRYOR Thar ! What 'd I tell you ! ANDY LOWRY Well , I 've done all I could ! I admitted to ' im ' at I ' us wrong to breach that ole fight ag'in ! RUFE PRYOR I know you did , Andy . An ' ' tai n't a-goin ' to do you no good to eat more dirt fer ' em ' less you 're prepared to eat six feet of it . Fer I hyeard Sid tell his daddy that you wus n't the sort o ' man as could be bound by his word to keep the peace . ANDY LOWRY That 's sompen I ca n't understand , Rufe ! If I had it in my heart to kill a man , I could n't act toward him like I ' us his friend ! RUFE PRYOR Me nuther . I b'lieve in speakin ' my mind an ' lettin ' whatever comes up come out . But you have to fight fire with fire ; you ca n't afford to take no chances when your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if you ' us in my place ? p. 72 RUFE PRYOR I ai n't a-sayin ' what I would do , but I know one thing I would n't : I would n't wait fer him to git the drop on me ! I 'd be the early bird ! ANDY LOWRY No ! I wo n't shoot first , ' less he starts it ! But I 'm a-goin ' to keep my eyes glued on him , an ' the first suspicious move he makes ( he pats the handle of his pistol caressingly ) one or t' other of us 'll be buzzard 's meat ! RUFE PRYOR ( insinuatingly ) . That 's all right  --  if he do n't take a crack at you from the bushes ! ( It has grown suddenly darker . A gust of wind strikes the house , followed by thunder and lightning . SID , JUDE , DAVID and MEG enter from kitchen . ) SID HUNT Andy , looks like it 's a-tunin ' up fer a reg'lar harrycane ! What do you say to havin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer ? ANDY LOWRY No , I guess I 'll be movin ' along . SID HUNT You might jist as well stay . DAVID HUNT Yeh , why not ? ANDY LOWRY I got to go ! SID HUNT Andy , I hope you ai n't got a notion ' at they 's any hard feelin 's ( claps him on the shoulder ) , ' cause they ain't. p. 73 DAVID HUNT ' Course not ! SID HUNT Jude 'll stay . Wo n't you , Jude ? JUDE LOWRY I reckon I 'd better . They wo n't expect me back in a storm . They wo n't expect Andy , neither . ANDY LOWRY I 've told you ' at I 'm a-goin ' , storm er no storm ! SID HUNT Well , you know your own business . Ef you 're sot on goin ' , let 's git started . ( Starts out . ) MEG HUNT ( stopping him ) . Sid , they ai n't no need o ' your goin ' ! SID HUNT Yes , they is . Whatever Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a better one . I do n't intend to waste no time a-gittin ' things settled with Jude 's paw . An ' I could n't ha ' picked a better time . If he makes any objection , I 'll have the ups on him while she 's waterbound ! JUDE LOWRY I dunno 's water ' ld help you keep me here ef I did n't want to stay ! SID HUNT ( laughs ) . Well , anyway , I 'll tell your folks not to expect you tell you git thar . Are you ready , Andy ? ANDY LOWRY You bet your boots I am ! I 'm ready fer anything  --  hell er high water ! SID HUNT ( glances at the sky ) . It looks like we might have a little o ' both afore long ! ( Calls back . ) I 'll be back fer supper if nothin ' happens ! ( He goes out with ANDY . MEG follows them to the door and looks after them anxiously . Pause. ) p. 74 RUFE PRYOR ( goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry ! If any harm 's a-goin ' to come to ' em , worryin ' wo n't stop it ! MEG HUNT I wus n't thinkin ' ' bout that so much as this everlastin ' rain ! I 'd think it ' ld git out o ' water some time an ' stop ! We hai n't had three hours o ' sunshine on a stretch in over a month ! DAVID HUNT Well , I would n't lose heart jist because you 've had a few turkeys drabbled ! Think what a time old Noah 's wife had a-roundin ' up her menagery ! ( MEG goes to the fireplace and begins fumbling with the kindling . ) What in the nation are you a-buildin ' a fire fer ? You ai n't cold ? MEG HUNT No , but the air feels damp . An ' everything in the house molds so if I do n't dry it out once an ' a while ! DAVID HUNT Then lemme start it fer you ! ( He takes the kindling and proceeds to lay the fire . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ' thout gittin ' it catawampused ! JUDE LOWRY I 've noticed that all the things that men want to do are a man 's job ; an ' them they do n't , like washin ' dishes an ' milkin ' , are a woman 's . DAVID HUNT Then how do you count fer it that when I tried milkin ' fer you a long time ago the ole cow kicked so I could n't ? She seemed to know it wus n't a man 's job ! p. 75 MEG HUNT She had room to kick . You pinched her teats to make her ! DAVID HUNT Lord forgive you , Meg ! How 'd you ever come to think a thing like that ? MEG HUNT I did n't think it . I hyeard you a-braggin ' about it to Sid one day when you thought I wus n't a-listenin ' . DAVID HUNT That 's the trouble ' ith women these days : they 've been a-listenin ' to men 's talk till they 've got too smart fer comfort ! If they keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live ' ith the next generation of ' em ! JUDE LOWRY I dunno 's I 'd live ' ith one that pinched my cow to keep from milkin ' her . DAVID HUNT Then you 'd better warn Sid as soon as you marry him , fer it ' ld be jist like him to try it ! MEG HUNT ' Course it would , now ' at you 've put him up to it ! DAVID HUNT Well , as long as the women tell the gals all they know , it 's nothin ' but right that men should give their kind the benefit o ' their experience . If they did n't , the women ' ld soon be on top ! RUFE PRYOR I dunno 's that ' ld be sich a calamity . If women had their way they 'd be less fightin ' an ' drinkin ' an ' more folks a-workin ' fer the comin ' o ' the Kingdom o ' Heaven on earth ! p. 76 MEG HUNT At least they 'd be fewer a-pinchin ' pore dumb brutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Men ai n't perfect . I can think o ' lots o ' ways o ' improvin ' the breed . DAVID HUNT It 's a quair thing to me that woman , ever sence the Lord made her out o ' man 's crookedest part , has allus considered it her main job to keep him straight ! MEG HUNT If that 's her main job , she 's made a purty pore job of it ! DAVID HUNT Well , a man 's got to stay on top , somehow . RUFE PRYOR Yeh ! By hook er by crook ! DAVID HUNT Edzactly ! The strong uns do it by hook an ' the weak uns by crook ! That 's the only difference ! ( A shot is heard in the distance , followed almost instantly by a second . They all start and look at one another in alarm , as if afraid to put their fear in words . DAVID continues with pretended indifference . ) Wus that somebody a-shootin ' ? MEG HUNT Yes ! ( She rushes to the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEG HUNT ( with a half-dazed expression , her eyes in the distance ) . Up the road ! p. 77 DAVID HUNT Oh , I reckon it 's Andy a-lettin ' off steam ! RUFE PRYOR Yeh , that must ha ' been what it wus . MEG HUNT It could n't ha ' been Andy ! He hai n't got his pistol ! JUDE LOWRY Oh ! ( She sinks into a chair . ) MEG HUNT ( pityingly ) . Now they ai n't no use in that , Jude ! I know what you 're thinkin ' ; but if Sid had wanted to harm Andy he 'd ha ' done it here while ago ! JUDE LOWRY That ai n't what I 'm skeered of ! MEG HUNT ( with sudden change of expression as the idea dawns on her ) . Did Sid give Andy back his pistol ? JUDE LOWRY ( almost inaudibly , nodding her head ) . Yes ! MEG HUNT ( looks first at JUDE and then at DAVID with blazing eyes ) . What 'd he do it fer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plum tarryfied ! They ai n't no sense in makin ' things no wuss ' n they are ! ( A horse is heard approaching at a gallop . ) MEG HUNT ( turns eagerly in the direction of the sound ) . What 's that ? p. 78 DAVID HUNT It 's Sid a-comin ' back . I reckon he must ha ' forgot sompen . It beats me the way you can make a bear outen a bush ! RUFE PRYOR ( sympathetically ) . She cai n't help her thoughts ! MEG HUNT ( who has stepped outside on the door-step , utters a piercing cry ) . Oh , God ! ( RUFE runs to the door and looks out . MEG turns and staggers blindly into the house , her face covered with her apron . DAVID and JUDE catch her as she is about to sink to the floor . ) DAVID HUNT Dern it all , Meg , what 's the matter with you ? ( As they place her in a chair . ) I declare I never seed a growed-up woman as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ominously ) . That does look bad ! DAVID HUNT What looks bad , you dad-burned fool ! RUFE PRYOR Nothin '  --  only that ' us Sid 's horse ' ith the empty saddle that she seed a-turnin ' in at the barn gate ! DAVID HUNT Well , what if it wus ? RUFE PRYOR Nothin ' ! I jist do n't like the looks of it ! That 's all ! p. 79 DAVID HUNT Well , I hope it 's all from you ! MEG HUNT ( rocks back and forth , sobbing ) . They ai n't no use in foolin ' ourselves ! It 's happened ! He 's dead ! Andy 's killed him ! DAVID HUNT Now stop your ravin ' , Meg ! They 's a thousand ways that horse might ha ' got loose ! It might ha ' throwed him ! ( MATT enters at the front , grim and determined . ) MATT HUNT No , it did n't ! It 's not a buckin ' horse ! You know that as well as I do ! An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sence I got it ! ( He takes the shotgun from the rack and starts out . ) DAVID HUNT ( takes the rifle ) . Wait ! I 'm a-goin ' with you an ' see what 's happened ! MEG HUNT Matt ! Do n't take the guns ! If Sid 's dead , fightin ' wo n't bring him back ! MATT HUNT I never said it would . If he 's dead , my business is ' ith the man that killed him ! RUFE PRYOR Vengeance is mine , saith the Lord ! I will repay ! DAVID HUNT He has to have a instrument to work through ! Even God cai n't smite evildoers ' thout a fist ! ( He goes out with MATT . MEG sways back and forth despairingly. ) p. 80 MEG HUNT If they is a God an ' He 's almighty like they say , I cai n't see why He do n't stop things like this ! RUFE PRYOR Mebby He do n't want to stop ' em ! MEG HUNT Then He ai n't a just God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would n't say things like that , Meg ! All His jedgments are just an ' righteous altogether ! JUDE LOWRY Do you call it right fer Sid to go through the war an ' then be struck down by Andy the minute he gits home ? RUFE PRYOR That ai n't fer us to say . ( Piously . ) He knows what Sid done while he ' us away in the war . We do n't . JUDE LOWRY Andy ai n't a God-fearin ' man , neither ! ( A vivid flash of lightning illumines the scene . ) RUFE PRYOR I know he ai n't . An ' vengeance is on his track , too . It 's writ that the heathen shall rage an ' the wicked destroy one another . That 's a part o ' God 's plan . JUDE LOWRY That do n't make it right ! RUFE PRYOR God do n't have to jestify his ways to man . Let Him be right if you have to make out everybody else wrong 's what I say , an ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 's Scripture fer everything ! Job 's wife told him to cuss God an ' die ! ( A loud clap of thunder shakes the house . RUFE shrinks away toward the stairs . ) RUFE PRYOR If you 're a-goin ' to talk blasphemy , ' ith a thundercloud a-comin ' up , I 'll have to leave you ! ( He goes halfway up the stairs and stops . MEG puts on her bonnet and throws a shawl about her shoulders . ) JUDE LOWRY Are you a-goin ' out ? MEG HUNT Yes ! I cai n't set here ! ( JUDE prepares to follow her . ) JUDE LOWRY I cai n't neither . I 'll go with you and see if they 've found him . Ef Sid 's dead , I 'll kill the man ' at killed him  --  if it 's my own brother ! MEG HUNT That wo n't bring Sid back , but it ' ld leave the Hunts ' hands clean . An ' mebby it might keep the war from startin ' ag'in . ( Hopelessly . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood 's thicker ' n water . JUDE LOWRY ( with resolution ) . I will  --  I 'll kill him ' ith my own hands ! ( They go out together . RUFE creeps down the stairs in a state of intense excitement. ) p. 82 RUFE PRYOR It ' ld be awful if she killed her own brother ! I could n't marry a woman that had done that ! ( He goes to the door and makes a move as if to call to JUDE , but stops . ) She wo n't do it . She could n't . It would n't be nachel . They 'll see him first , anyhow . O God ! Do n't let her commit a sin that she could never git fergiveness fer ! ( The kitchen door opens and SID enters . RUFE recoils with a cry of terror . ) A-a-a-ah ! ( SID looks at him in amazement . ) Is that you , Sid ? SID HUNT I sorter thought mebby it wus ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? Are you havin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ! You come in kinder ghost-like an ' I thought mebbe you might ha ' been killed ! SID HUNT You thought right . I might ha ' been . RUFE PRYOR What 's happened to Andy ? SID HUNT I du n no . Where 's all the folks ? RUFE PRYOR I hai n't seen ' em . I jist now come downstairs . SID HUNT They ai n't all out o ' the house in this storm ? RUFE PRYOR They must be out at the barn , lookin ' after the critters. p. 83 SID HUNT Yeh , I reckon that 's it . RUFE PRYOR Sid , you did n't do nuthin ' to rile Andy , did you ? SID HUNT Not to my knowledge I did n't . My saddle geart wus loose an ' I got off my horse to fix it . He seed me reach in my back pocket fer my knife , an ' afore you could say scat he jerked out his pistol an ' put a bullet through my hat ! RUFE PRYOR I shore am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' not you ! SID HUNT Well , I ai n't sorry , myself . ( He pokes his finger through the bullet hole in his hat . ) It 's a good hat , but a air-hole er two wo n't hurt nothin ' this sort o ' weather . RUFE PRYOR What ' d he do after he shot at you ? SID HUNT I did n't stay to see . When I found out he meant business I turned my horse loose an ' cut fer the bushes . I 'd like to know what 's got into Andy . RUFE PRYOR ' T is quair the way he 's actin ' ! SID HUNT ( comes toward RUFE thoughtfully ) . What ' d he say to you up thar while ago when you give him that licker  --  afore it all started ? RUFE PRYOR ( starts violently ) . Nothin ' ! He did n't say nothin ' , I tell you  --  not a word ! ( SID looks at him suspiciously . He flares up in a fit of anger . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up to it ! ( Sobbing . ) O God ! I wish I ' us dead ! Every time anything goes wrong it 's me ! I 'm to blame ! p. 84 SID HUNT I ai n't accusin ' you o ' puttin ' him up to it ! What I want to know is how his mind got to runnin ' so strong on that old war ' twixt the Hunts an ' the Lowries ! RUFE PRYOR You hyeard what I said about it here ! That 's all I know ! SID HUNT Then what are you a-gittin ' so excited about ? RUFE PRYOR It 's enough to excite anybody , to have a thing like that throwed up to him ! An ' you need n't ax me no more questions , fer I ai n't a-goin ' to answer ' em ! SID HUNT All right ! I 'll ask Andy when I see him ! RUFE PRYOR If you do he 'll only tell you a mess o ' lies ! You cai n't believe him ! SID HUNT Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RUFE PRYOR Any man ' ll lie to save his own skin , ef you git ' im in a tight corner . SID HUNT Well , I 'm a-goin ' to ax him , ' cause I 'm curious to know jist what them lies air that you 're afraid he 's a-goin ' to tell . ( Going to window . ) You say the folks is at the barn ? They ai n't no light thar . Did my hoss come back ? RUFE PRYOR I du n no ! SID HUNT Have they gone after Andy ? p. 85 RUFE PRYOR I told you I do n't know ! SID HUNT ( glances at gun rack ) . The guns are gone ! Jist what I thought ! ( Starts to rush out . ) RUFE PRYOR ( stopping him ) . Hold on , Sid ; you cai n't do nothin ' ' bout it now ! They must ha ' left afore you come in , and they 'd natchelly go the short way and be halfway over the mountain by this time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SID HUNT By God , you do n't want me to stop ' em . I believe you knowed all along where they wus , only you ' us afraid o ' what Andy could tell . RUFE PRYOR That 's right ! Blame it on me ! I do n't wish him no harm ! I do n't wish nobody no harm ! SID HUNT Does that telephone wire along the river run from the dam to the settlement over thar ? RUFE PRYOR Why ? Are you a-thinkin ' o ' phonin ' from the dam to head off Matt an ' your gran'daddy ? SID HUNT That 's my business . As I mind it , the phone 's in that tool house on a ledge right down under the dam ! RUFE PRYOR You 'd never git to that house now ! You 'd have to walk out to it on boards across that sluice o ' water ! It 's dangerous when the river ai n't up ! You might jist as well commit suicide as try it now ! I would n't do it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at had tried to kill me ! An ' all you 'll git out o ' Andv is a passel o ' lies about me ! Natchelly he 'll say I agged him on  --  p. 86 SID HUNT ( seizing him by the throat ) . An ' , damn you , I believe that 's jist what you did do ! RUFE PRYOR ( screams hysterically ) . No , I did n't , Sid ! I swear to God I did n't ! All I said wus that you ' us a dangerous man an ' not to cross you ! That if you got started  --  SID HUNT ( tightening his grip ) . So ! I 'm right ! You wus at the bottom of it . Did you do it apurpose ? RUFE PRYOR God forgive you , Sid , fer sich a thought ! SID HUNT An ' God damn you ! ( He hurls RUFE into a corner of the room and rushes out at the front . A blinding flash of lightning envelops him . RUFE lies on his elbow , cowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then suddenly he rises to his knees and clasps his hands in prayer . ) RUFE PRYOR Did you hear what he said , God ? I can put up ' ith his insults to me , but when it comes to blasphemin ' Thy holy name it does look like it 's time to call a halt . But You know what You 're a-doin ' , God , an ' I do n't . I 'm only a ignerunt sinner . You know more in a minute ' n I could ever know in a million years . It bothers me , though , Lord , that You let the wicked prosper more ' n the righteous . They git the best o ' everything in this world now . It wus n't so in Bible times , Lord . Then You cut the wicked down afore the congregation o ' Israel . An ' the dread o ' You an ' the fear o ' You wus on all people . But now Your name is a byword among sinners . You hyeard that Yourself jist now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it culminates in an emotional climax . He rises and goes to the door , trembling in every limb . ) I ai n't presumin ' to give You advice , Lord ! You know Your own business . But if You 'd make an edzample o ' this blasphemer  --  if You 'd strike him down in the abomination of his wickedness by a bolt o ' lightnin ' , it ' ld serve as a warnin ' to all like him . An ' they 'd be sich another revival o ' ole-time religion in these mountains as You 've never seed since the earthquake . ( He pauses again as if struck by a new thought . His knees gradually give way beneath him and he sinks to the floor . ) In Your Holy Word , Lord , I know You commanded your servants to slay all blasphemers . Mebby You think that 's enough .

But I want You to understand , God , that I ai n't no coward . If it do n't suit You to do it Yourself  --  I 'll do it fer You  --  I do n't keer if they hang me . You died fer me once , an ' I 'm willin ' to die fer You if You want me to . They wus a time , Lord , when my proud heart said , " All o ' self an ' none o ' Thee . " Then You come a-knockin ' at the door o ' my sinful soul an ' I whispered , " Some o ' self an ' some o ' Thee . " But that 's all changed now , Lord . I 'm Yourn an ' You are mine .

An ' the fear o ' You an ' the dread o ' You ' ll be on all nations ag'in ! ( A heavy gust of wind strikes the house , followed by terrific thunder and lightning . RUFE rises to a standing position , his knees trembling . As the noise of the thunder dies away his fear is transformed into joy . He stands firmly on his feet and looks toward heaven , his voice ringing out triumphantly . ) I hear You , Lord ! An ' , like Joshua o ' old , I go to do Your will !

There are still occasional flashes of lightning mingled with the distant rumbling of thunder . MATT appears at the front door , driving ANDY before him at the point of a gun . DAVID follows them into the house , shaking the water from his hat at the door . ANDY seats himself , laughing defiantly in a mood of reckless despair . MATT HUNT ( glances about the room , then calls upstairs ) . H'llo ! H'llo , Sid ! ( Looks at ANDY . ) Hm ! DAVID HUNT ' Parently they ai n't nobody here . MATT HUNT ( goes to the kitchen door and calls ) . Sid ! H'llo ! ( Comes back , his eyes on ANDY ) . Jist as I expected ! ANDY LOWRY ( tauntingly , in a spirit of bravado ) .

ANDY LOWRY ( enigmatically , after a brief silence ) . He turned his toes out too fur when he walked . ( MEG and JUDE turn away angrily . ) MATT HUNT ( restraining himself with difficulty ) . Is that the best reason you can think of ? ANDY LOWRY It 's good enough , ai n't it ? MATT HUNT ( brings the gun to bear on him ) . What do you want us to tell your folks ? ANDY LOWRY Jist say I got drunk an ' turned my toes up too fur ! DAVID HUNT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here ! You tie his feet .

A little more an ' Matt ' ld ha ' fixed things so 's you would n't ha ' needed ' em . p. 97 MATT HUNT It would n't ha ' been no mistake , nuther . If he did n't kill Sid , he tried to !

I du n no what it is . ( RUFE is seen rushing past the window . He flings the door open and stands with his hands above his head , pointing toward heaven , his eyes rolling in a fine frenzy of excitement. ) p. 98 RUFE PRYOR It 's come ! It 's come ! DAVID HUNT What 's come ? RUFE PRYOR The day o ' His Wrath  --  when the saints an ' the sinners shall be parted right an ' left !

That 's all I know  --  an ' all I want to know  --  on this earth ! MEG HUNT ( despairingly ) . I reckon that 's enough fer any of us . But I would like to know what happened to Sid .

Come here ! ( RUFE turns and looks at him . ) Quick ! Take my knife  --  it 's in my right-hand pocket  --  an ' cut these things !

RUFE PRYOR If it ' us jist mine you ' us a-trampin ' on I would n't say a word ! But it ai n't ! It 's His  --  up yonder ! ANDY LOWRY Ha ! ha ! I did n't know you ' us a-standin ' in His shoes , Rufe ! RUFE PRYOR You 'd a heap better ' umble your proud heart an ' quit mockin ' an ' revilin ' , Andy ! The Good Book says that them that reviles God 's handiwork shall die ! ( With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ANDY LOWRY Yeh , when their time comes  --  like you an ' me an ' everybody else .

MEG HUNT ( provoked beyond endurance ) . That ai n't what he means , an ' you know it ! RUFE PRYOR Have patience with him , Meg . We may snatch him like a brand from the burnin ' yit .

( He seats himself in the armchair , his gun across his knee . ) Arter all , Meg , the Lord 's will 's too big a thing fer any one man to git a strangle hold on it . Rufe 's dead certain that God always sees eye to eye ' ith him on every question . Fer all we know , God hisself may consider that more blasphemous ' n what Andy 's a-doin ' .

MEG HUNT If you 'd ever experienced real religion yourselves , you 'd know what 's the matter with him ! DAVID HUNT Humph ! What makes you think what he 's got 's real religion ? MEG HUNT By their fruits ye shall know ' em . When I mourned fer Sid you an ' Matt did n't bring me no comfort . All you thought of wus vengeance . But I feel comforted some now ( she pats RUFE 's hands protectingly ) an ' Rufe done it . DAVID HUNT Shucks ! If comfort in time o ' trouble ' us religion , most folks could git more of it outen a bottle o ' licker ' n they could outen the Bible !

I du n no whether it 's licker er religion . ANDY LOWRY What difference does it make ? One 's jist as dangerous as t' other when it gits into a cracked head . JUDE LOWRY The time ' ll come , Andy , when you 'll wish you 'd prayed ' stid o ' scoffin ' ! p. 105 MEG HUNT Yeh , you 'll be beggin ' Rufe yit fer a drop o ' water to cool your tongue in Torment !

MEG HUNT ( credulously ) . Have you seen a vision , Rufe ? RUFE PRYOR ( rolls his eyes mystically toward ANDY ) . What I 've seen I 've seen ! He that hath years to hear let him hear ! ( He pauses and gazes about him impressively in the fashion of one " possessed of the Spirit . " ) An ' , lo , there wus a great earthquake ! An ' the sun become black as sackcloth o ' hair an ' the moon become as blood ! An ' the stars o ' heaven fell into the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is a-shaken of a mighty wind ! An ' the heavens parted as a scroll when it is rolled together !

MEG and JUDE have been swaying rhythmically in tune with his voice . They now join in shouting " Halleluyah ! " " Amen ! " " Blessed be His Name ! " etc . Inspired by this , he continues with increasing fervor , losing all control of himself )  --  that sitteth on the throne  --  ah ! An ' from the wrath o ' the Lamb  --  ah !

Well , what do you want me to do ? MEG HUNT I do n't keer  --  jist so you git him out o ' my sight ! RUFE PRYOR Why n't you put him in the cellar ? ( He catches ANDY 's eye and gives him a significant look . ANDY , who is about to speak , interprets this to mean that RUFE has decided to help him escape , and remains silent . ) MEG HUNT We can . That 's more like the place whar he 'd ought ha ' been put in the first place . DAVID HUNT ( starts untying ANDY ) . All right , Meg , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the key to the outside door , so I can lock him in , case he breaks loose . ( She goes into the kitchen . ) ANDY LOWRY ( looks at RUFE significantly ) .

Do n't you worry about that , Andy . I 'll pray fer you  --  an ' do anything else I can . ( MEG returns from the kitchen . ) DAVID HUNT Did you git that key ? MEG HUNT Yeh , here ' t is . ( Vindictively to ANDY . ) An ' I hope you lock him in tight ! ANDY LOWRY ( sings as DAVID starts toward the cellar with him ) . Wonderful love !

DAVID HUNT No , I reckon it 's jist a wet-weather spring ! ( RUFE goes to the door and looks out . He is evidently pleased by what he sees . JUDE , puzzled by his manner , goes to the door and turns back , startled and alarmed. ) p. 109 JUDE LOWRY Look ! The river ! Did you see it ? RUFE PRYOR Yeh , I seed it ! JUDE LOWRY It 's ' most up to the porch steps ! RUFE PRYOR Well , ' tai n't nothin ' to git excited about . We 're safe . An ' Andy 's all right , too . It ' ld have to come lots higher afore it could harm him . ( The outside cellar door is heard to slam . JUDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the noise . ) JUDE LOWRY ( calls ) . Whar you a-goin ' , Meg  --  out to the barn ? MEG HUNT Yeh . JUDE LOWRY Wait a minute an ' I 'll help you . DAVID HUNT No , Jude , you stay under shelter ! ( JUDE stands on the porch , gazing out into the darkness . RUFE glances at her , then goes over to the cellar door and opens it cautiously , keeping an eye on JUDE . ) RUFE PRYOR ( calls softly ) . Andy ! Is the water comin ' in ? ANDY LOWRY ( guardedly , from the cellar ) . Yeh , it 's jist startin ' . You 'd better hurry an ' turn me loose afore they git back ! p. 110 RUFE PRYOR I cai n't right now . I think I hear Matt comin ' . Do n't worry ' bout drowndin ' .

RUFE PRYOR Nothin '  --  Jist more cussin ' . Do n't grieve about him , Jude . Everybody cai n't be saved . Some are born fer glory an ' some fer shame . Andy seems to be one o ' them that ' us born fer shame . JUDE LOWRY ( sinks on the bed and sobs despairingly ) . ' Tai n't Andy I 'm a-grievin ' about ! RUFE PRYOR Then it 's him  --  Sid ? JUDE LOWRY ( nods brokenly ) . Yeh ! RUFE PRYOR ( closes the outside door , then seats himself on the bed beside her ) . Do n't grieve ' bout him , Jude . He wus n't born fer glory , neither . You ought to build your hopes on a firmer foundation . They 's still treasure in heaven if you 'll seek it the right way . p. 111 JUDE LOWRY ( half sobbing ) . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all my faith  --  everything  --  seems gone now ! RUFE PRYOR ( moving closer , gradually ) . That 's a good sign . The darkest hour o ' the sperit is allus jist afore dawn . Think , Jude , what a friend we have in Him ! Oh , what peace we often forfeit  --  oh , what needless pain we bear  --  all because we do not carry everything to Him in prayer ! JUDE LOWRY I want to carry it to Him , but I cai n't ! Seems like I 'm froze up inside ! RUFE PRYOR ( working himself into an emotional singsong again ) . I know what 's the matter ' ith you , Jude , you ai n't a-trustin ' Him ! ( He touches her on the shoulder , gradually stealing his arm around her . ) All you got to do is to trust Him  --  fully trust Him  --  sweetly trust Him  --  JUDE LOWRY ( swaying with the same emotional ecstasy as before ) .

Jist imagine you 're a-leanin ' on the everlastin ' arms ! ( She lays her head on his shoulder in a state of half consciousness . ) That 's the way ! He 'll comfort you ! ( He has gradually inclined his face toward hers as if fascinated by the singsong of his own voice . Suddenly he kisses her passionately on the lips . She awakes from her stupor and stands gazing at him with an expression of intense surprise . ) RUFE PRYOR Do n't look at me like that , Jude ! It 's perfectly all right ! ( Dropping into the emotional cadence again . ) The Scripture says fer the brethren an ' sisteren to greet one another with a holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jist a holy kiss !
