THE CABINET <P> Andrew W. Mellon , Secretary of the Treasury , last week proposed . Congress may or may not be disposed to dispose as he proposes . The proposal has to do 1 ) with the disposal of the property of Germans seized by the U. S. during the War ; 2 ) with reimbursing various U. S. citizens for damages done to them by Germany at War ( claims that have been allowed by the U. S.-German Mixed Claims Commission ) . <P> The history of these two factors : Alien Property . The property in the U. S. of individual Germans was seized when the U. S. entered the War and handed over to the Alien Property Custodian . This property or its equivalent ( some of it has been sold ) now amounts to about $300,000,000 and is in the hands of the Alien Property Custodian . In addition he has about $30,000,000 of the income from this property . When the peace treaty with Germany was made , it was formally agreed that Germany should reimburse her citizens for the seized property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy the claims of individual U. S. citizens against Germany . Recently Senator Borah and others have proposed to return the seized property to the German owners , contending that it is unethical to seize the property of foreign individuals . <P> U. S. Claims . U. S. citizens who suffered War losses ( in the sinking of the Lusitania , etc. ) have claims against Germany which the peace treaty declared should be adjudicated by a mixed claims commission . This has recently been done . The claims allowed amount to something over $200,000,000 . These remain unsatisfied . Under the Dawes Plan the U. S. is to get reparations of about 45,000,000 gold marks a year to pay off these claims . But these payments , although supposedly all that Germany can make , are insufficient to pay off the claims . <P> Mellon Proposal . The U. S. Government also has a share of 55,000,000 gold marks of German reparations annually as repayment for the costs of the U. S. Rhine Army . The Treasury proposes to take all the German reparations to the U. S.-totaling 100,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trustees . The trustees would issue $250,000,000 of 5% 25-year bonds which the reparation payments would take care of and pay off . The U. S. claimants would be paid off partly in the bonds themselves . The German owners of seized property would get it or its equivalent returned to them . The U. S. Government would pay nothing directly , would however guarantee the bonds and would have to make good if Germany failed on reparations payments . The U. S. Government would also give up part , perhaps all , of the reparations it is to receive for the Rhine Army costs . <P> The Treasury announced that the U. S. and German citizens interested have agreed to the plan . The third party to the proposal plan-the U. S. Government-has still to make up its mind .
