txt As the ink of the American signature on the Paris financial accord over the Dawes reparations payments was drying today , the Allies began to give thanks that after five Years ' absence the United Stes9 Gov ' ernment had at last returned to their sides in a compact scheduled to last half a century . For , remarkably enough , the - delegation signed not only that part of the agreement relating to the payment of the American claims but the whole document , which approved payments of sums due to the Allies under the Treaty of Versailles . In the opinion of the Allies this maims Gm United States a party to the Dawes plan , and it is recalled that only a short half year ago the American State Department refused to lend its machinery for the distribution of the text of the Dawes plan agreement to American newspapers for fear it might make . t look official . Completely changing their tune from that of three weeks ago , when they were complaining of the illegality and unfairness of the American , claim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the partnership ' of American interest in the working of the Dawes plan they count worth far-more to them materially , morally , politically and every other Way than the theoretic share they allow the United States . During the negotiations the American delegates showed marked reluctance to discuss this phase of the situation and not a great deal was said by the allied diplomats ; but today with the sealing of the bond the Allies were more frank . Churchill Expresses Gratification . Winston Churchill , the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , at the signing today devoted practically all of a speech he made to the great significance of America associating herself once more with the Allies in Europe 's greatest problem . " I charge myself with commending to the conference the arrangements which have been made for meeting the wishes of the United States to be included effectively within the scope of the Dawes reparations scheme , " he said . " When this proposal was first advanced the .. ritish Government felt bound to bring to the notice of our American friends certain serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equity . " We felt it our duty to maintain for some weeks an attitude of reserve . In fact , I do not think 1 should be exaggerating if 1 described it as an attitude of almost active reserve . The conversations We have had with our American friends have been both lively and prolonged . They have been characterized throughout by absolute frankness and good feeling . The distinguished citizens who represent the United States here are men with whom every point of aspect can be thrashed out without risk of misunderstanding or loss of temper . " I feel it is my duty above all to offer th sincere congratulations of every member of the British delegation to Ambassador Kellogg upon the momentous announcement which has been made during the sittings here , of his selection to be Secretary of State of the Uniteu States . No one can defend the enduring interest of his own country better than the man who comprehends minat is right and reasonable in the views of others . . The ' personal explanations and friendly interchanges of opinion which have - taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach-a solution of the questions at issue without pressing our objections to principle . " The United States delegation has made it clear - that their claim does not impose any onerous burden on the general finances of the Allies . They have shown themselves ready to shape their proposals in such a way as to assist all the powers concerned . In fact , under their scheme , the burden upon the Allies will be actually less in the early and more difficult years than it would otherwise have been . And , although , if the Dawes reparation scheme marches unswervingly to its full normal conclusion there will be a very substantial advantage to the United States , this advantage will only be gained in periods and circumstances when all the Allies will be in a far better and easier position than at the present time . America 's Share in Payments . " Coming to actual figures . the United States had , under the ' Wadsworth agreement , the unquestioned right to recover the cost - of the army of occupation by a series , of priority payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks per annum for twelve years . Owing to the arrears which have accumulated these annual Payments might easily have reached 120,000.000 gold marks through all this anxious period . " In place of these important and unchallenged rights the United States will now-receive for her army cost only 55 , - 000,000 gold marks per annum over a Period of about seventeen years . For , the rest she will draw a 214 , per cent . share of the Dawes reparation annuities , taking a chance for good or ill with the rest of the Allies . Until and unless these annuities are paid , the maximum yield to the United States therefrom will be substantially less than the amounts by which she has diminished the annual payments under the Wadsworth agreement . I feel , therefore , that upon the broad view we shall be helped and not burdened by the new arrangement " But , taking the longer view , there are I other and greater advantages which present themselves . The formal participa tion of the United States in the proceeds of the Dawes scheme indisputably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme stands , and once again , after six years marked by misunderstanding and divergences , we find I the Allies and the United States working together within the limits of the Dawes scheme in most complete hat , : norm and that to me and , I am sure , 1 to all my colleagues here , is a cause of very real and justifiable satisfaction . , " It should constitute a definite stage ' in the march away from the confusion which followed the great victory and toward that general consolidation and reconstitution not only of Allied but of ; European affairs which must ever be our goal . " Kellogg Sees Beginning of New Era . Mr. Churchill expressed the appreciation of the British delegation at the spirit of compromise and accommodation shown by all the Allies . In an address responding to Mr. Churchill , Ambassador Kellogg said the outstanding events in the rehabilitation of Europe last year were.the Dawes report , the London conference and the Paris conference . He expressed pride that Americans had had a part in the making of the Dawes plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " mark the beginning of a new era for Europe which will have a reflex action on all the nations of the world . I know there are many who have been skeptical about the working of the Dawes plan . I for one believe it will work . It is being carried out , and I am sure will be carried out , because it is based on sound business principles , and I am sure the people or rite United States are deeply interested in its success . " After predicting that the difficulties in the way would be surmounted , Mr. Kellogg said : " We can not expect at one stroke , as if by magic , permanently to settle all the problems confronting the great as well . as the small nations of ' Europe . All great cosmic disturbances are followed by smaller disturbances of less activity . And this is so in great social and civic upheavals . " One can not expect that after a war of unparalleled extent and severity , bringing v-itnin its cometary ' weep the ' leading nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records of all history , that Governments can be restored , trade and commerce rehabilitated and peace and prosperity brought back by a single treaty or by many treaties in the course of a year or two .. " The pathway of restoration is a thorny one , but If we have a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles lying at the base of these national disagreements and political and economic disturbances , if we are animated by a spirit of patriotism and tol2 erance toward the rights of all peoples and the participants in the war , there Is no reason why we should not bind up and heal the wounds of the conflict and restore Europe again to a basis of prosperity and security . " In closing his speech the Secretary of State designate suddenly shifted from the first person to the second when he said : " I have not time , and it would be Improper for me to attempt to discuss your many problems . I believe you are capable of solving them yourselves . It is important , however , that we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Ambassador closed with a tribute to the cooperation of his foreign colleagues . Clementel Extends Congratulations . Finance Minister Clementel of France congratulated the conference on its successful conclusion . Then adverting to the rOle of America he said : " We all congratulate ourselves that the operation of the Dawes plan has , . brought again in our midst , not as friendly observers but as actors , official representatives of the great Republic of the United States , whose tradition of idealism and spirit of solidarity permit us to face the future with confidence . For the first time since 1919 are met here official delegations of all countries which grouped themselves in tragic days about the same ideal and whose sons - fell side by side upon our battlefields . They are united all to work together for the realization of the plan their experts conceived and which has not deceived their hopes . " At the close or the meeting Premier Herriot carne in and with much feeling bade farewell to the delegates . To the Americans he said : " I turn toward Mr. Kellogg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and who was our friend in most difficult times . I give him all hopes for success in the ' high office to which he has been called and extend my thanks to . : assador Herrick , who is our old precious and faithful friend . " Of the twenty-nine allied conferences held since the end of the war none ever Wound up in such a spirit of mutual Satisfaction as this one has . French Press Comments . Commenting on the settlement of the American claim , the Temps says : Americans should not forget that this represents a financial sacrifice on the part of the Allies , but adds : " However , to have associated the United States closely with the problem a reparations has considerable political Importance . It is the first time since the American Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles that Washington assumes officially collaooration with the allied Governments for the settlement of peace . " Are we now permitted to hope that , being financially interested in the execution of the Dawes plan due to American initiative , the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all circumstances to oblige Germany to fulfill her obligations ? Can we now hope that American public opinion will henceforth have a larger conception of the great ensemble of the peace problem and of all that is needed for the political and economic reconstruction of Eu-rope ? " The Sommal des Mats can not imagine that after e action of the Allies the ' United Stat s will not remain united with the Allies xo oblige Germany to carry out the Dawes plan . It says any other stand would be immoral . The editor of the Paris-Midi writes : " You can think - what you want about it , but today my outlook is rosy , for in the avidity of Uncle Sam I now find happiness . Believe me , it is -a good thing that Uncle Sam becomes officially a creditor of Germany . As we have reason to know , he is no slouch as a creditor , and the Germans will find it out as well and think twice before they defy that heavy-eyebrowed person . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
