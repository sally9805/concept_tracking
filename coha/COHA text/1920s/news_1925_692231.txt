txt The eyes of the steej trade are being turned more and more to the South as the scene of future developments of importance in the industry . This section of the country , until a few years ago comparatively unimportant in steel . now looms large both as a consumer and producer . Ana its development appears to have only begun . It is even possible that Birmingham may eventually usurp - Pittsburgh 's proud place as the Steel City of the world . As an illustration of the change in soutnern consumption can be cited the experience of one large iron producer of the Birmingham district . Until a comparatively few years ago this producer sold about 60 ' 2. of its annual melt north of the Mason &; Dixon line . Today the South consumes SO " 2 of all the melt . And presumably this cast . is typical of all producers . Southern consumption of steel today is. and has been for some time . considerably in excess of the production of local mills . The South has room for more steel mills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be IMIC MAY EXPAND THERE Principal steel producers in the South are Tennessee Coal . Iron 8 : Railroad . a U. S. Steel subsidiary , and Gulf States Steel . Pig iron is made by Sloss-Sheffield Steel Iron , Republic Iron &; Steel and Woodward Iron , as well as by some smaller concerns . Rumors have been current from time to time that one or other of the purely iron producers planned to erect steel furnaces and mills . Of the three iron producers Republic Iron &; Steel seems the logical one to enter the steel end of the industry . Republic is already an important steel maker in the North . Its entrance into the South would not be a new departure . Erection of plants in the Birmingham district would not only give Republic a standing in a large and growing steel market but would put it in position to compete in export trade on an equal basis with other steel makers , enabling it to ship by water to Mobile and thence abroad . Republic , so far as can be learned , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills , but improvements it is now carrying on at its iron furnaces in that district seem to be a preliminary to expansion in steel there . It might also be pointed out that the practical completion of Republic 's plant improvement program in the North puts it in a better position for developing in new territory . Tennessee Coal &; Iron is not letting grass grow under its feet and is expanding to take care of growing southern business . Tennessee is now engaged on an important program . building new furnaces and rolling mills . Sloss-Sheffield. apparently , has no intention whatever of going into the manufacture of steel . But Sloss should benefit indirectly from steel making activities of other companies . Already Tennessee Coal 's growing production of steel is reducing the amount of iron it has available for sale to outside consumers and helping to strengthen the pig iron market . Employment by other southern iron makers of their melt in making steel would still further strengthen the hand of Sloss and other merchant iron makers in that section .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
