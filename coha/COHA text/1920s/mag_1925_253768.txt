In the days of yore , the good citizens of Athens filed past the urns and as they passed each one dropped a white shell or a black . If the black shells were more numerous than the white , then woe be to the man concerning whom the shells were cast , for he was ostracized and for ten years under pain of death must remain an exile from his native city . <P> No urns were erected in Rhode Island , no black shells were dropped therein , but nonetheless 21 of her citizens went forth , last June , into exile , saying they feared for their lives . Last week , the exiles returned , their Odyssey completed , though one had visited Erebus never to return , and another tarried with the Lottophagi-in Worcester , Mass . <P> The story of their going was this : The Senate of Rhode Island is composed of one man from each town in the state . Providence , with nearly 300,000 inhabitants , has one Senator . West Greenwich , with 367 inhabitants , has one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the small towns are more numerous . At the election preceding the recent one , the Democrats gained a comparative victory . They gained 17 seats of the 39 in the Senate . They elected the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor . <P> With the aid of the Lieutenant Governor , Felix Toupin , a fiery little man of French descent who presided over the Senate , the Democrats began a filibuster a year ago to compel the Republicans to agree to a Constitutional Convention to do away with the " rotten borough " system . The filibuster lasted from January to June , with frequent clashes , several of which went to the point of physical violence . Finally in June , at the end of a heated session of 50 hours ' duration , someone placed a bromine gas bomb behind the Lieutenant Governor 's chair . The Democrats said it was a plot to kill Mr. Toupin . The Republicans said that their lives were not safe . <P> Of the 22 Republican Senators , 21 incontinently fled the state . They settled just across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bartlett House , where they were staying in the summer , found it worth while to put in steam heat to accommodate them when winter came on . One Senator died . Another , a former divine , became a lecturer at Worcester and is not expected ever to return . The others lived amicably in sun and shade at the expense of the Republican State Committee-an expense estimated at from $25,000 to $100,000 . <P> Meanwhile the Rhode Island Senate met regularly four times a week and adjourned for lack of a quorum . No bills were passed , although it was the only legislature of Rhode Island which ever was continuously in session for an entire year . Funds failed the state . Many state employes got no salaries . <P> In November , an election was held . The Republicans carried the state . They defeated Mr. Toupin , who was running for Governor ; they elected 67 of the 100 Representatives and 33 of the 39 Senators ; 13 of the exiles stood for reelection . They did not return to their districts but were reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Senate expired . It adjourned in the presence of three members-two Democrats , and the one Republican who had remained behind to make the point of no quorum . Home came the wandering Odyssei , back to their Penelopes . But they formed a club " The Exiles " to recall for later days the joys of their exile .
