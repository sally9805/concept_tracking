While the official ratification of the Experts ' Plan settlement is being ratified with the usual parliamentary oratory in Paris and Berlin , Wall Street has turned to other topics of discussion . The New York financial centre will be looked to for about $100,000,000 to finance the German part of the plan , but that amount of bonds has long since ceased to be considered a particularly large operation in Wall Street . Financial men privately state that the American share of the bonds has been practically underwritten already . The question of how readily the underwriting syndicate will be able to sell them to the American public , however , remains to be seen . For this reason the terms of the loan are awaited with great interest . An attractive offering is generally anticipated . It is sometimes said of J. P.

Germany and Europe generally are short of working capital . It is to be expected that many foreign cities and private companies may seek U.

A German loan is in consequence somewhat of a " curtain-raiser " to a period of numerous and extensive foreign loans .
