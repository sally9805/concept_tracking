Out again , in again , out again , in again : such was the nerve wracking experience of Prime Minister Andrei Liapchev , during the past fortnight ( TIME , Sept. 17 ) . <P> Last week his twice fallen Cabinet was reformed , after Tsar Boris had called to his palace and rebuked quarreling , cabinet busting politicians . <P> To them His Majesty said in effect , according to reliable reports : <P> " You must support the Cabinet of M. Liapchev , must ! It is necessary that financiers abroad shall not think that the Bulgarian Cabinet is always falling , or they will not lend us the money for which we can give good and safe security . " <P> Keen , well informed observers of Bulgaria deemed that Tsar Boris , able , potent , had spoken the exact truth . Bulgarian security is good and the country sound , despite frequent cabinet upsets , which always seem to end in a resumption of power by Prime Minister Andrei Liapchev.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
