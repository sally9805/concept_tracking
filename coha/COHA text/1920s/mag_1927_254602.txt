In Vancouver <P> Sirs : <P> TIME is read in the office of the Vancouver Sun , from cover to cover , by five of our executives . We get from it editorial ideas and news leads and a news presentation that is right in line with modern journalism . <P> TIME has developed a fast moving telegraphic style all of its own that is extremely informative and entertaining . Speaking as a newspaper owner and publisher , I would say that if circulation and advertising departments will thoroughly promote and " merchandise " what you are selling , TIME has ahead of it a very successful career . <P> The old didactic style of writing has gone ; people are no longer content to read a full column editorial and then wonder what it is all about . The reading public today wants brevity , variety and versatility , and they want facts . <P> Try and get in a little more Canadian news . And also try and get in some common-sense understandable health news , which the public is today hungry for . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by M. E who are using their space not to give the public common-sense health knowledge , but they have been using that space as free advertising for pills , pellets , serums and surgery . <P> Health is a matter of publication and education and today I look on it as newspaperdom 's best bet . . . . <P> <P> R. J. CROMIE <P> Publisher Vancouver , B. C. <P> <P> Mudhooks <P> Sirs : <P> While nearly all other newspapers in the States are publishing silly , sentimental rubbish on the situation in China , fatuously extolling the " enlightened American Policy in the East , " you continue to give accurate and unvarnished descriptions of conditions here . You deserve heartiest congratulations from Americans here , who are constantly faced with the fact that the present diplomatic policy , which was first staged , and is still sponsored , by first the American Government , is a ridiculous farce and largely responsible for the deplorable state of affairs existing here . <P> Of course I am aware that in your Peking correspondent you have a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> On . p. 15 of TIME , Sept. 13 , you mention that an American destroyer , the Elvano , was fired on while steaming up the Yangtze . You probably refer to the small gunboat U. S. S. Elcano which is stationed at Ichang . It is easy to believe that she was fired on , but much harder to conceive her steaming up the Yangtze . <P> The Elcano is an old Spanish gunboat captured by Admiral Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay . Some years ago she was refitted and sent to occupy a station of the Yangtze Patrol Gorges at Ichang , just below the Yangtze Gorges . The trials and tribulations the Elcano met with in navigating the comparatively quiet stretch ot river between Hankow and Ichang make a legend dear to the hearts of the merchant skippers at Ichang . Some say she was towed up by hundreds of Chinese trackers , and others that she came up under her own power , making sometimes as much as 15 miles a day . Yangtze rivermen frequently express the opinion that if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift right down to Shanghai , unless her crew were able to get a line ashore .
