When the clerk of the U. S. District Court in Salt Lake City , Utah , began to read the court minutes one morning last week , no one took much notice of a plain middle-fortyish woman who sat on the front bench , apparently listening . Most eyes were engaged in watching Judge Tillman Davis Johnson settle himself behind his bench for a morning 's work . Judge Johnson is 69 and not undistinguished in appearance . Few of the people in the courtroom even noticed the plain lady when she rose from her seat and approached the bench with a folded magazine in her hand . <P> The lady gained everyone 's attention , in another two seconds , however , by whisking an automatic pistol from her magazine and firing two peremptory shots at Judge Johnson . The courtroom banged with noise . Splinters flew from the woodwork and a blackboard behind Judge Johnson , whose reflexes made him huddle down into his chair so suddenly that the next moment he tumbled down the bench step , though as yet unhurt . <P> Muttering hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more shots fly at the terrified old jurist . A bullet in the right hip knocked him down a second time . A bullet in the left thigh knocked him down a third time . A bullet grazed his knee just before bailiffs over-powered his would-be murderess . <P> Who would want to kill Judge Tillman Davis Johnson ? Mrs. Eliza Simmons , widow , was one person . " I 'll show you how to get justice ! " was what she had screamed as she shot . At her home , Widow Simmons produced a rambling document penned by her , in which she declared war on the Utah Copper Co. , for whom her husband had been a brakeman until his accidental death in 1910 , and on " hardboiled " Judge Johnson . <P> Mrs. Simmons sued the Utah Copper Co. for $10,500 for herself and four children . State courts awarded her $850 . In 1924 , it occurred to her to ask a new judgment , for $25,000 . Judge Johnson dismissed the case in his court . <P> Convalescent in hospital , Judge Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , declared Widow Simmons irresponsible , crazy , hallucinated . So did U. S. Senator William H. King of Utah , who was surprised to hear that Mrs. Simmons , whom he had never met , would rather have " gotten " him than Judge Johnson for assistance she fancied he had rendered the Utah Copper Co.
