" <P> The auctioneer dropped his hammer and a boy trotted out behind the curtain to lift The Harvest Waggon off the stage and replace it with Frans Hals ' A Young Cavalier . Sir Joseph Duveen had just bought the Gainsborough for a price that set a record for U. S. picture auctions . The painting , a large canvas into which the artist had put portraits of two of his daughters as well as a wagon , a team of horses and a broken shower of golden light , was indubitably the finest single piece offered in the sale of the collection that had belonged to the late steel tycoon , Elbert Henry Gary . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctioning to $1,154,650 , the record for a single sale ; most of the paintings brought a little less than they were worth . <P> There were exceptions to this tendency , notably the high price of $52,000 which was offered for Jean-Honor Fragonard 's glittering and beautiful self portrait , and the $16,000 brought by Josef Israls ' pretty painting , Her Treasure .

The last was by far the most spectacular ; this brought the total for the entire sale to $2,297,763 , the largest amount ever returned at a U. S. art auction . The most notable piece purchased on the last afternoon was a small marble bust by Jean Antoine Houdon ; the head was that of a plump and imperious baby girl , the daughter of the artist . The woman who got the bust was later discovered to be a buyer for M. Knoedler &; Co. , who in turn were probably buying for Mrs. Edward Stephen Harkness . <P> Sir Joseph Duveen did not come away empty handed .
