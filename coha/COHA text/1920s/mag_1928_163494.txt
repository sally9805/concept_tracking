Willis v. Barleycorn <P> Sirs : <P> It seems that TIME has a hard time to reconcile itself to the candidacy of our Senator Willis for the Republican nomination for President . . . . <P> I am writing from his home town- " A prophet is not without honor , etc . " Not so , Senator Willis as a student in the University here had the love and respect of his teachers and all who knew him best . His unusual intellectual capacity as a mere boy was recognized by the faculty and students as nothing short of remarkable . . . . Willis advanced by leaps and bounds in college ; and while yet in knee pants , so to speak , became a teacher and professor of law . His neighbors sent him to the legislature of his own state , then later to the lower house of Congress and so proud of his career were the people , that they put him in the seat occupied by the beloved William McKinley as Governor . The one time he was defeated for office was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barleycorn-just before this sum total of all things iniquitous was kicked into his grave . The fact that John had once knocked out " our Frank , " was so hotly resented by the good people of Ohio that they urged him thereafter to spend most of his time in Washington , D. C. , as Senator from the state now known as the Mother of Presidents . <P> Willis has never been a pussyfooter . He is dry in theory and practice , and a born leader of men . In this , his home town , in a room where he taught rhetoric and grammar , and where he inspired students as did Garfield at Hiram , Ohio , there was organized the Willis-for-President Club . Those present and forming the club were of every political complexion and religious creed . Its slogan is , " The Largest Willis-for-President Club in the State . " <P> What a good thing it would be for this bumptious writer of cheap stuff in TIME to attend the Willis-for-President rally on the evening of March 7 , where Hardin , Allen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine counties in the state will be represented and do some " booming " for Willis , something which seems to hurt TIME terribly . There is not a thug , saloon parasite , grafter , bootlegger , and not a " big wet " in the state of Ohio who will not welcome with glee the slurs which TIME has spread out before the people . If I am not mistaken , the thousands of women voters in Ohio who know that Willis has fought for their homes and firesides against the blackest beasts that ever annoyed human kind ( the liquor gang ) will lose no chance of resenting these insults of TIME . . . . <P> It is to be hoped that TIME will become the mouthpiece of a better brand of Americanism . <P> J. M. RUDY <P> Pastor of Church of Christ <P> Ada , Ohio <P> P. S. Yes , Cincinnati , the paradise of booze , bootleggers and the home of Remus , will black both their eyes by voting against Willis . But " we love Willis because of the enemies he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no brand 's mouthpiece. - ED . <P> Froth Parody <P> Sirs : <P> The letter printed in your issue of Feb. 27 , from William J. Turner of Wilkinsburg , Pa. , concerning the Penn State " Froth " parody of TIME , contained several statements decidedly erroneous . To quote from his letter : " The editor was asked to resign from the local literary fraternity , the subject of the front cover caricature threatened libel suits , " etc.
