Torpidly mechanical though the G. 0 . P. Convention was , three days passed before observers could be sure that the reputed agricultural unrest beneath it was too watered-down with cheap politics to be explosive . <P> Farmers . One of the first duties of alert newsgatherers after their arrival in Kansas City was to visit Electric Park , an abandoned amusement resort on the city 's southeastern outskirts , which had been designated as the campground for the widely-advertised farm crusade ( TIME , June n ) . After the convention had been going 24 hours and the fight on the farm plank was at its hottest in the Resolutions Committee , the register at Electric Park bore the signatures of less than 100 farmers . On a grassy hillside behind a weatherworn grandstand were parked 15 cars , most of them expensive-looking Buicks , Steams-Knights , a Packard . <P> In the compact flag-flown hotel district near Convention Hall a straggling line of men-about 300 of them-with genuine sunburns but guilty smiles , paraded the streets , filed through hotel lobbies , massed outside the convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the farm debate finally got there after party chieftains had labored two nights long with the farmers ' friends , the true nature of the farm problem became apparent . <P> Delegate Earl C. Smith of Illinois , a tall , dark , quiet-spoken man who had been most persuasive in committee sessions , presented the plea personified by Candidate Lowden : a minority report to amend the farm plank ( see page 10 ) and pledge the party to the McNary-Haugen bill with its equalization fee ( TIME , May 14 ) . Like Candidate Lowden , Spokesman Smith did not argue that McNary-Haugenism was infallible or perfect , but that no better remedy had been advanced to date . <P> Frank Murphy of Minnesota , a rangy figure in a smart tan suit with features of Lincolnian cast , was farm spokesman No. 2 . He called the farmer his brother . He reminded the Party that its 1924 promise had yet to be carried out . His eloquence had a noble ring-until he cracked a sacrilegious joke to liven things up , and introduced a huge map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party chieftains ' strategy was to let the Farmers ' Friends talk themselves out . Third to speak was Dan W. Turner of Iowa , a little man with a curious nose and the nasal , lithurgical intonation of a revivalist . " The farmers will march in November , " sang Mr. Turner . Governor Adam McMullen , well-fed , prosaic , contributed a few words of protest which were as the baaing of a lamb compared to his leonine call for the Crusade the previous fortnight . No one discussed the actual provisions of the McNary-Haugen bill , but all used it as a sounding cymbal , clanged and clashed to sway convention politics . <P> Deliberate , deep-lunged Senator Borah of Idaho , past-master of the final word , made the main rebuttal speech .
