Henry L. Stimson , onetime ( 1911-13 ) Secretary of War , concluded last week a visit to the Philippines , departed for China , issued a statement . Said he : <P> " The American government has proof of its attitude toward the Filipinos in the fact that it sent Gen. Leonard Wood to the islands . No one living has made such a distinguished record of patient , high-minded service in guiding a people along the difficult road to self-government as he has . . . . <P> " I have witnessed also that wherever I went in the southern islands , there is almost pathetic reliance on and devotion to the , governor general by the leading Moro chiefs . Throughout the rest of the islands there has been perfect respect for him . . . . <P> " But in the group of leaders who assume to represent the political voice of the . islands , I regret that I have not always found an attitude toward General Wood which can be thought either adequate or fair to the United States . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood is the personification of democratic simplicity , approachable by every one . Neither he nor his advisers appear for business in military uniforms or make the slightest show of military formality . <P> " The whole attack is a skillful attempt to create a political bugaboo . . . " <P> Last week was announced a change in Colonel Thompson 's proposed itinerary . The emissary has abandoned his proposed three weeks ' visit to China , and will now lea , ve Manila on Oct. 6 on the Steamship <P> President Wilson , bound for Honolulu via Chinese and Japanese ports . Thence , two weeks later , he will proceed to San Francisco . <P> Likewise last week it was announced that the Radio Corporation of the Philippines was constructing two of the largest radio stations in the Far East with the idea of maintaining direct Manila-San Francisco service .
