txt The Debt of France to England . I can not for the life of me see what reason the United States has to find fault with the tentative agreement Great Britain has made with France , because It is an exact copy of what is being done every day in- the United States and In every other country . A debtor finds himself in the position that ho can not meet his liabilities and he goes to his largest creditor or one whom he conelders the most generous and puts before him a statement of his affairs . The matter is talked over fully and the creditor , if a common-sense business man , states that he will give an extension of time conditionally. , the condition being that the other creditors agree to the same time arrangement . Now , that is what Great Britain has , offered France . Would n't Great Britain 's Government be little better than imbeciles if they allowed the other creditor nation to insist on its pound of flesh , which ? it might possibly get , but at whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will venture to say that there has not been less than a thousand arrangements of this kind carried out in the United States in the last year . and I will venture to say that there are probably hundreds entering into such an agreement today .
