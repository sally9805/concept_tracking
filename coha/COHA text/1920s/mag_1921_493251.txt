" Neither the present condition in the world nor the course of events in Egypt since the armistice , " says General Allenby , " permits a modification in the disposition of the British forces . Egypt is a part of the empire 's communications . " T thus appears that the negotiations broke down on a matter which has been covered by repeated and solemn promises of Great Britain , the evacuation of Egypt . According to General Allenby : " We must insist on effective rights and powers to safeguard both Egypt 's interests and our own until the Egyptian people have shown the capacity themselves to preserve their country from internal dis order and from intervention by foreign powers . " Another promise . But so long as General Allenby and Lord Curzon remain the interpreters of it the time of its fulfilment will be never . General AL . lenby is further reported to the effect that 90,000 troops will be needed to hold Egypt . The financial cost can be calculated in pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Denshawi atrocity . Bernard Shaw has given an account of this detestable result of the superior race theory in the preface to John Bull 's Other Island , a great passage of modern English prose , worthy to stand beside Zola 's J'Accuse .

ONE of the recent and scarcely heralded triumphs of medical science has been the discovery that the hideous scourge of the hook-worm may be removed from the human body by a single application of X-ray treatment .

From a close study of symptoms of the hook-worm disease we are convinced that this is the mysterious malady from which those called to the intellectual life in- America most commonly suffer . Healing , like charity , should begin at home . // The Irish Settlement T HE London negotiators ended , as was in evitable , in bringing the whole Anglo-Irish question to a head . By agreeing to " the common . citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain " they presented Dail Eireann with the necessity of deciding to haul down , at this time , the flag of Irish independence in order to achieve a reasoned modus vivendi with Britain , or else to raise it once more in an insanely desperate and certainly fruitless war . This choice , which will have been made before this paper is published , is a choice that goes to the roots of Irish national being . It involves some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It involves their spiritual intention , their reading of their own history and destiny . It i5 a momentous decision to be proposed to the representatives of any people , and it has the merit of being proposed without evasion or equivocation . In presenting Ireland with its dilemma the British negotiators acted with wisdom and solicitude . They attenuated as far as possible the claims that Britain makes on Irish fidelity . They minimized in every direction the degree to which the Irish must be subject either to crown or t ? imperial control , and they yielded apparently every ' thing that the Irish negotiators requested in regard to the Northern establishment . What they faced was the crux of the whole Anglo-Irish struggle for ever and aye ? the question whether there Were any terms conceivable upon which Britain and Ire ' land could ' agree on " common citizenship " after a history of conquest and wrong . But the question was not brought forward in a crude or passionate form . As a result of the fundamentally sound and democratic device of consultation , the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Britoil ' direct . They came from trusted and unassailable Irish negotiators . President de Valera 's position directly before the meeting of December I.4.th seems to us quite under ' standable . He can not be easily dismissed as a die ' hard whose judgment went into eclipse behind all immovable doctrine . From the beginning he el ' ' pressed his readiness to make terms with Britahi , to accept the status of Cuba and to come into closer association with the British commonweal ? group of nations , on condition that N. E. Ulster declare allegiance to Ireland in acknowledgeolellt of this concession . He even , under certain circus ' stances , admitted the possibility of partition . 14.15 deepest difference with the negotiators , we take it ' concerns the principle of common citizenship . Be ' , hind the ambiguity of the phrase " free association , de Valera quite evidently retained the idea Of ? ' separate citizenship and a separate sovereignty . To qualify that sovereignty he would consent , but he was not ready to merge sovereignty with Britain even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-Ireland parliament . His conception of sovereignty as all-important is , under the circumstances , a very natural one . If Ireland had not possessed such a conception , the Irish people would have long since succumbed to conquest and lost their heritage forever . And de Valera evidently believes that to lower the flag of Irish independence now , to give fidelity to King George , is to admit , if not conquest , the result of conquest , and to impair the title to independence for all time . A wider view , we feel , must already have prevailed over this limited view of de Valera 's . For while the sovereignty of Britain is in a sense in. sisted on in the proposed treaty , that is by no Means the whole truth of it . The proposal is basically a proposal of equal partnership between two peoples who have inseparable common interests . Phrased imperialistically , if you will , it is nevertheless an offer of common citizenship and its real object is to secure not the " allegiance " but the cooperation and goodwill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these peace terms . . For when British parliamentarians say " Canada " Or " governor-general " or " allegiance , " they know all too well that these words connote practical independence . The crown , it is true , does distribute honors and to that extent is socially influential . Imperial control is exercised over all the dominions in matters of constitutional change and in foreign affairs . The " right to secede " was a bogey raised D.7a Bonar Law and does not exist . But the fact t at the British commonwealths are in flux overrules everything else . To admit Ireland as a full 1 , l'etriber into the British association of nations is ' ? accelerate the process of change and to empha- 4'ze the principle of consent . It is to end the li ? tion that the empire is an empire of territory and to enhance the notion that it is a cohesion of P ? Pulations . Egypt and India have more to gain from the inclusion of Ireland in the commonwealths than from the resumption of a struggle doomed to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hiP is in effect , a long democratic advance . More than anything else that Britain has ever done , it - marks the disintegration of the imperial point of view . So far has Britain gone as a result of the pressure tL of circumstances , the pressure of ideas and tt'ie Pressure of conscience . And we firmly believe at Ireland must meet Britain half-way . We can understand the Irish Republicans who still insist 04 the right of Ireland to come Britain only on terms of absolute liberty and pure consent . Such a frame of mind , judged dispassionately , is the frame of mind that makes perfect loyalty possible . It is a noble frame of mind . It is , however , deficient in practical imagination . It proposes a respect for one 's own pure ideals which the world at large never accords . And , in point of fact , the men and women who insist upon absolute liberty prior to making an agreement usually manage to deny that a similar title to liberty inheres in those with whom they are in conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ulster die-hards are as noble , as righteous , as impeccable as themselves . Hundreds of years of history are invoked to support the title of the Republicans and to refute the title of the Orangemen . But , history or no history , we deal here with men whose immovable convictions take no account of changing circumstances . They clearly invite the fate of Red Indians . So Britain has recognized in dealing with N. E. Ulster . Where Mr. Asquith gave so poor a measure of home rule to Ireland that it paid N. E. Ulster to stand pat , this treaty forces N. E. Ulster to indulge its immovability at the expense of its own interests , not only within N. E. Ulster but within Ireland and within the empire . For , by refusing to participate in the affairs of Ireland in conjunction with the Southern Protestants , N. E. Ulster foregoes the chance it has to hold the balance of power . Before this advantage is definitely abandoned , the Orangemen will think twice . What was lacking in 1914 , Britain 's desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed the Irish settlement with such a spirit that the Ulster question settles itself . What the Orangemen will now seek is privilege inside Ireland , but there is no reason to believe they will secure it . Granting that the majority of the Irish people follow Collins and Griffith in accepting the peace terms , a magnificent victory has been won for rational man . So hard a conflict as this between Celt and Saxon has for long appeared insoluble . The most strained and inverted views on both sides have masqueraded under high names to perpetuate hatred , misunderstanding and strife . But now Britain has purged herself of wrong and Ireland of suspicion . Common citizenship calls both to a new life of mutual help . Some men in this country , whose vested interest in hatred is permanent , must refuse to recognize the true nature of the settlement . Others , who take the extreme position in all sincerity , can not help opposing the settlement until they are convinced it is wholesome . For such men we can only hope that they will be convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the men and women who have a right to speak accept the peace treaty , the true friends of Irish freedom will be those who set about perfecting its new constitution and winning for Iteland the place among the nations of the earth that it has always deserved . The Far Eastern Concert PRESIDENT HARDING had some justifica- tion when recently he expressed an expectation of the success of the Washington Conference . It may not be as much of a success as he thinks , but up to date a partial and even a considerable success it certainly is . He called it in order to insure the limitation of armaments against unnecessary risk by removing through negotiation certain festering political sores of a kind which in the past were allowed to become worse until they required the barbarous surgery of war . The Conference may or may not do something effective to eradicate these sores . Its success in dealing with the Chinese problems still remains doubtful . But it has cleared away one grave obstacle to the eradication of the sores without war . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the other insular peoples in the . Pacific against attack . It has killed and buried national defence as an excuse for Japanese militarism and navalism or for American militarism and navalism in their relation to the Pacific waters . It has raised the grade of the negotiation from the military to the political level , which may in the end enable an understanding to be reached on a basis of human rights and political principles rather than of exclusive national interests . As the safeguard of peace the Conference has created a Concert of Pacific nations which , in so far as it functions successfully , will become the supreme authority in the western Pacific . It will preserve order in that region and by unanimous consent legislate with respect to relationships of its peoples one to another . It supersedes in this respect the Anglo-Japanese alliance , but it substitutes for that alliance a different association with a better function . The Anglo-Japanese alliance turned over the western Pacific waters to the Japanese fleet , but without in effect placing Japan under bonds to use the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has taken advantage of the license in order to establish many strong political , economic and military outposts on the Asiatic mainland . The new Concert whatever it does will prevent this encroachment from spreading . The Japanese fleet remains in possession of the western Pacific waters , but Japan agrees sub-// stantially to do nothing more which will affect the peace of the Far East without consulting the other members of the Concert . In return she is safeguarded against attack . The guarantee applies only to insular territory , but Australia , the Philippines and Japan are islands . It will create an atmosphere of general security which will permit armaments as an instrument of national policy ill the Far East to be abolished . The New York World calls this guarantee an Asiatic Article X. The comparison is disingenuous . If the American government had accepted Article X of the Covenant it would have assumed at least a partial responsibility for a large number of doubtful land frontiers and boundaries . But the territories guaranteed by the Washington treaty are separated from one another by water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Japan is delegated to furnish the necessary police force , to keep that police force small and to agree not to use it hereafter except as an instrument of political purposes approved by France , Great Britain and the United States , on condition that her insular possession be guaranteed against naval and military danger . That is a fair , a clean and a generally profitable bargain . There are some minor objectionable aspects to it , but unlike Article X Of the Covenant , it can not conceivably involve the United States in dangerous boundary disputes which raise extremely doubtful questions of prink ciple . In order to justify the comparison between the Washington Conference and Article X of the League , the guarantee would have to include far panese and British possessions on the Asiatic main ' land , which is precisely what it does not now do . The strength and , from another point of view ' the weakness of the treaty consists in its failure to include China in its , advantages and responsibill ' ties . The-conferees at Washington can allege many plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power Concert . The Concert 15 intended to enable Japan and Great Britain t ? 1 abandon their alliance without loss of prestige all to provide a political agency to accomplish the political purposes which naval armaments in the Pacific were ostensibly created to accomplish . 13 ' .1 China does not possess any navy or any islands if the Pacific . Japan has already deprived her ? both . There is , consequently , no reason for 111 ' eluding her in the Concert . All this is perfectly true . China has no territory of importance except on the continent and she does not count among the l naval powers in the Pacific . But the same st3te , ments are true of France and France was includeuci The real reason was , of course , that Japan al% Great Britain did not want to deal with China a Copyright of New Republic is the property of New Republic and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listsery without the copyright holder 's express written permission .
