THE Navajo Indians are supposed to be able , with concerted incantation , to make corn or cactus grow by the minute instead of by the month . Around the seedling they hold a screen of blankets , while they sing their spell . When they move away , the seedling is a few inches high . And so it goes , spell by spell , until the plant or flower is complete . I have seen their ritual and am a disbeliever . This kind of magic is for children , young or old , so credulous of miracle in the outside world that they will always lend themselves to the sorcerer . Poetry is another kind of magic . A true poet is supposed to make a flower of life grow in the heart . It may be a flower of good , it may be a flower of evil . It may be the morning-glory , it may be the deadly nightshade . The true poets are the priests of the inner miracle , and I have seen their ritual , and I believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers in the heart and the flowers of paper or wax , or even metal , which are fabricated by the craftsman . Dust gathers fast on the flowers of the craftsman , but the inner flowers are fadeless , and breathe their own clarity . Like most of us who have been schooled in this western world , I was afforded in my youth a study of culture flowing mainly from two sources , the Greek and the Hebrew . I had come to feel that poetic literature must contain streams from one or the other of these two sources : on the one hand the clean objective symmetrical athletic beauty of the Greek , on the other hand the turgid subjective distorted elaborated beauty of the Hebrew . Like my fellow students , I had been offered nothing of the literatures of the Far East . I am still doubtful that I could ever feel any real adherence to the ornate and entranced literature of India ; but I have come by accident into as close touch with Chinese poetry as a westerner is able to come without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction , that in the matter of poetry I have begun to receive a new , finer , and deeper education than ever came to me from the Hebrew or the Greek .  | Centuries ago , cultivated Chinese had reached the intellectual saturation which has tired the mind of the modern European . The Chinese gentleman knew the ancient folk-songs , compiled by Confucius . He knew also , all about him , a profoundly rich civilization , a more poised and particularized sophistication than we westerners have yet attained . Through the Asian centuries , everyone has written verse . In fact , from early imperial days down to these even worse disordered days of the republic , the sense of poetry has lasted among the Chinese people as a natural and solacing part of life . Whether or not the individual may form or enjoy his poetry in metrical shape , he is constantly aware of the kinship between the beauty of the world and the beauty of imaginative phrase . On any Chinese mountain-climb toward a temple , rock after rock with its terse and suggestive inscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street-cries of the peddlers , or the names of the tea-houses , and , on many hilltops and lakesides , the casual but reverent jottings of this or that anonymous appreciator of natural beauty . When Whitman said , " To have great poets there must be great audiences too , " he must have had in the back of his mind enriched generations like the Elizabethan in England ? or like almost any generation in China . In those great audiences , each man , to the limit of his capacity and with natural ease , was a poet . There is a simple secret in these generations . It is told in a pamphlet written by a venerable Chinese scholar still living in Peking , and still with infinite passion adhering to the precepts of his ancestors , and with infinite patience , acceptably expressed by the way among foreigners , adhering to his conviction that foreigners impair the health of China . His name is Ku Hung-ming . His pamphlet , written in English , one of the five languages of which he is master , is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the eternal youth of the Chinese people in the fact that the average Chinese has managed to maintain within himself the head of a man and the heart of a child . On this brief he is absorbingly interesting , explaining the continuance of Chinese culture , the only ancient culture still racially existent . My immediate concern with his brief is more special . I detect in it something that he does not specify : a reason for the continuance of poetry alive among his people , and , more than that , the best reason I  | know for the existence of poetry anywhere among cultured races . Music may be the most intimate of the arts , I am not sure . Except for simple melodies , music is beyond the reach of any individual who is not a technician . Painting and sculpture are obviously arts expressing themselves in single given objects , which , although they may be copied and so circulated , are for the most part accessible only to the privileged , or to those who make pilgrimages . Poetry , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about by a man either in his own remembering heart , or else in compact and easily available printed form . It belongs to any one . It is of all the arts the closest to a man ; and it will so continue to be , in spite of the apparent shocks given it by the noises of modern commerce and science and jazz . It has been an age-old custom in China that poets , even the best of them , should devote their earlier years to some form of public service . Century after century , Chinese poems reflect this deep devotion of their authors to the good of the state ? their unwavering allegiance to righteousness , even when it meant demotion or exile or death . In these modern western times , there have been periods when poetry has seemed to be a candle-lit and closeted occupation . I venture to surmise that poetry written in that sort of atmosphere grows with time less and less valid , less and less noticed . As a matter of fact , the outstanding English poets have been acutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given themselves warmly to public causes in which they believed . Similarly , present-day poets in America , with amazingly few exceptions , have clustered to the defence of noble souls at bay like Eugene Debs , or have been quick to protest against doubtful justice as in the case of Sacco and Vanzetti . This sort of zeal may not result in poetry of a high order immediately connected with the specific cause ; but there is no question that , but for this bravery , this heat on behalf of man 's better nature , there would not be in the hearts of the poets so fine a crucible for their more personal alchemies . Let me say a general word as to the characteristic method of the best Chinese poetry . I am not referring to the technical tricks by which a Chinese poet makes his words balanced and melodious . The discovery which has largely undone my previous convictions as to the way of writing poetry has rather to do with p 300 use of substance than with turns of expression . Mencius said long ago , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who explain the Odes , must not insist on one term so as to do violence to a sentence , nor on a sentence so as to do violence to the general scope . They must try with their thoughts to meet that scope , and then they will apprehend it . " In the poetry of the west we are accustomed to let our appreciative minds accept with joy this or that passage in a poem ? to prefer the occasional glitter of a jewel to the straight light of the sun . The Chinese poet seldom lets any portion of what he is saying unbalance the entirety . Moreover , with the exception of a particular class of writing ? adulatory verse written for the court ? Chinese poetry rarely trespasses beyond the bounds of actuality . Whereas western poets will take actualities as points of departure for exaggeration or fantasy , or else as shadows of contrast against dreams of unreality , the great Chinese poets accept the world exactly as they find it in all its terms , and with profound simplicity find therein sufficient solace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of another , but are able enough and sure enough as artists to make the ultimately exact terms become the beautiful terms . If a metaphor is used , it is a metaphor directly relating to the theme , not something borrowed from the ends of the earth . The metaphor must be concurrent with the action or flow of the poem ; not merely superinduced , but an integral part both of the scene and the emotion . Wordsworth of our poets comes closest to the Chinese ; but their poetry cleaves even nearer to nature . They perform the miracle of identifying the wonder of beauty with common sense . Or rather , they prove that the simplest common sense , the most salutary , and the most nearly universal , is the sense of the beauty of nature , quickened and yet sobered by the wistful warmth of human friendship . For our taste , used as we are to the operatic in poetry , the substance of Chinese poems seems often mild or even trivial ; but if we will be honest with ourselves and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find these very same poems to be momentous details in the immense patience of beauty . They are the heart of an intimate letter . They bring the true , the beautiful , the everlasting , into simple easy touch with the human , the homely , and the immediate . And I predict that future western poets will  | go to school with the masters of the T'ang Dynasty , as well as with the masters of the Golden Age of Greece , or with the Hebrew prophets , or with the English dramatists or romanticists ? to learn how best may be expressed , for themselves and others , that passionate patience which is the core of life . It is not necessary that culture bring about the death of poetry , as it did in the Rome of Virgil . The cynics are wrong who see in our future no place for an art which belongs , they say , to the childhood of the race . The head of a man and the heart of a child working together as in the Chinese have made possible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in the thick of the most intricate culture , the continuance of the purest poetry .  |
