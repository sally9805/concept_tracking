MODERN decorative art has seized on nothing less than humble household furniture . From elegant shops in the Fifties you may now order bookcases that look like the Ritz Tower and dressing tables that arc a replica of the Equitable Building . But the abortive taste of this sullen writer will never be sated till he is provided with a bathtub designed after a subway excavation . THE LAST note in social horror has been sounded by a lady giving a formal dinner this week , who , in distracted mood , tells that she not only finds her invitations have unwittingly included a lady and her present and her former husband , but that she has also just discovered that the lady 's first husband was a Princeton graduate and her second a Harvard man . THERE appears to be a maniacal 1 tendency toward roast-beef fireplaces in sandwich shop windows these crisp days . There are cobble-stone , brick , tile and oyster-shell fireplaces and papier mache , tissue-paper , electric or gas flames and fire  --  but the mantelpiece never varies . There where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are smoking legs of lamb , dripping rare roasts of beef , pink hams studded with cloves , and every other sort of red-blooded meat . And above the mantelpiece , instead of the painting of one 's ancestor , is a hog-butcher in an apron smeared with blood and a tousled chef 's cap sawing away with an enormous carving knife at the tempting viands of the steam-table mantelpiece . Any vegetarian would faint at the sight . IIS only at the rarest moments 1 that we are conscious of a sense of citizenship . Such a moment came after we strolled into the trained-flea circus on Forty-second Street after the theatre . Preliminary to the performance a special flea , attached to a small wire , is passed around the audience , and this particular evening , at one point in the circuit , the flea disappeared . A row was made , and the thief  --  a greasy youth  --  was intimidated into producing the valuable insect . " Some low-life tries to get away with a flea once in every twenty days , " said the flea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself and we jotted down the information and mailed it to the Statistical Department in Washington . WE HAVE recently attended sev- eral exhibitions by the younger school of unsuccessful painters , and have noticed a dangerous decline in the number of paintings of sky line water tanks . We Canna be sure whether the growing tendency of architects to conceal water tanks is responsible for the movement , but if this is the case , the matter needs serious consideration . The first thing weknow , our younger artists will be painting pictures of something pretty . EFTEST of book arrangers is I- the person who placed three books in the window of a little arty art shop downtown . The books , from left to right , are : " Frigidity in Women , " " Desire Under the Elms , " and " The United States . " HOW much longer are our sensitive writers and artists going to be able to compare New York to jazz and escape the charge of pulling old stuff ? As far as we are concerned , not one minute longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman remarks that the world is a small place after all , and up and down Olympus echoes the laughter of the gods . The Babbitt is allowed about four repetitions of a sentiment or a joke and then the kidding begins . But let one of the boys on the Dial evolve an idea such as that , after all , New York City is just a great , glorified , baffling jazz composition , and , for at least five years it is good for a lead to every article written in the more enlightened journals , and for no fewer than eight hundred very bad paintings . Double THERE is an anecdote only com-paratively new , probably , about two financial men who were lunching with George F. Baker , Jr. , just a week before the directors of the UniTHE NEW YORKER ted States Steel Corporation were to meet .

" What are the chances , " he asked , as calmly as possible , " of a dividend at the meeting next week ? " Silence for nearly a minute then Mr. Baker smiled and drew his cigar-case from his inside pocket . " Here , " he said , " have one of these . " Not only was this taken as a termination of the luncheon but as a sly tip as well ; for , so it is told , the two gentlemen each dashed for a telephone booth . " Quick ! " gasped the first . " Buy all the steel my account will carry . I 've got the hottest . . " " Quick ! " shouted the other . " Sell all my steel and sell a thousand short ! I 've just got first-hand information . " Horse Show THE NEW Madison Square Gar- den acquires another tradition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Armory , opens there on Monday . This year there will be twenty-five hundred entries , the added color of foreign officers in uniform , and , in many other ways , more of a " show " than for a number of years . On the Sunday morning preceding the opening , the exhibiting gentry will gather at a horseshoe-shaped table , this year again at the Biltmore , for the traditional " champagne breakfast . " Prohibition has done for the champagnenow , of course , and morning-coats and Piccadilly collars have been succeeded by cut-aways and top hats , but otherwise this event will be in the manner of the past . The Horse Show 's popularity has waxed and waned many times since that fall in 1883 when Mr. William Wharton sought Mr. J. P. Morgan 's help to buy Gilmore Gardens , change the name to Madison Square Garden and hold a horse show there , on a site which had long been the stables of the N. Y. , N. H. &; H. hack horses .

In place of the breakfast around the horseshoe table , there was a coach race from Arrowhead Inn to the Garden the Sunday before the opening . A ND THEN coaches and horse -- El drawn vehicles went out ; Mr. Vanderbilt went down with the Titanic , the war took first the foreign entries , then the young men , horses and enthusiasm , and only during the past few years has the interest begun to recoup .

Added WE HAVE just read the proof sheets of Mr. Charles MacArthur 's admirable Profile on Mr. Campbell , the undertaker , on a near-by page , and find we are able to add a note . It has to do with Mr. Camp-bell 's advertising effort a few years ago to impress upon the public mind his telephone number , Columbus 8200. 11,1r . Campbell spent several thousand dollars to accomplish this purpose , and Dr. Baer , his poet , wrote many daily verses requiring a rhyme for 8200 , a difficult feat . The feat was accomplished , but just as the publicity campaign was adjudged a howling success , the telephone company changed the number . Vogue DARTS is ancient as a divorce cen- I ter , and Yucatan has collapsed as another , following a mild boom ( because the decrees were recognized hardly anywhere in this country ) and now there is a new , a very new , Mecca for people in marital difficulties .

Clients in distress go to him personally and he gives helpful advice and assistance , even providing an American attorney to draw up property agreements , etc. , essential to the separation , as well as a power of attorney  --  necessary if only one of the couple is going to Sonora , as is usually the case . This power of attorney is then forwarded , via Mexico City , to the town of Hermosillo , which is described as being directly south of Tucson , Arizona .

" Report WE WENT to a professional football game last week , almost a year after Mr. Grange 's debut first filled the polo grounds . We found a sober crowd of interested initiates who yelled at the right moments . The at-tempt made by the managers last year to simulate collegiate atmosphere with hunting , colored feathers , and even an embryo cheering section has been almost abandoned . The game is fast . Little time is taken out . Whole teams do not pile on a runner when he is tackled . In almost every department the professional players , as might be expected from All-American material , excel ; most spectacularly in the precision with which complicated forward-passing plays are executed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball-carriers . It is such a good game , to watch that we may yet see such great crowds gathered for it as watch professional football in England . A good contest nowadays draws 30,000 spectators . At present there is something funny about it , of course , the minor gods of a year ago playing for money , the hot partisanship more or less missing , the atmosphere lacking ; and , perhaps , the professionals are too well oiled . Mr , Herbert Reed informs us that the players could do better . But we thought they played well enough . ? THE FIRST spontaneous declaration of the unknown playwright whose play is successful is always worth recording , and that of Mr. Phil Dunning , co-author of Broadway , the season 's biggest success so far , is no days later , meeting up with the member of the couple appearing in person .

" Macbeth T WAS always the mildly derisive 1 anecdotes about the late James K. Hackett which persisted in circulation , for although , in his later years , he went in for the solemnities of the theatre on an extensive scale , he always remained , among the knowing , a figure of fun . Hackett was tremendously majestical about his art ( he was given to referring to it in ordinary conversation as " my art " ) and when , by one means or another , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , and also , even if only for a single benefit performance , in Paris , his na  --  ve satisfaction in that rather costly achievement was so great that he went about beating his own drum indefinitely , with the simple earnestness ( and something of the same effect on the nerves ) of a child along towards dusk on Christmas Day who had found a nice , new shiny drum reposing under the holiday tree that morning . I T IS quite true that when Hackett , ensconced recently at the Meurice in Paris , noted a gratifying reference to himself in some stray issue of The Billboard , and immediately decided that so intelligently edited a magazine must come to him regularly , he instructed his secretary to see that its subscription address should be : " James K. Hackett , Chevalier of the Legion of Honor .

" And it did n't to him . He was that kind of Macbeth . It is quite true that when he inherited that incredible $2,000,000 from a pious , high-toned niece , who would have writhed in her grave had she dreamed her fortune went to this actor fellow , he suddenly turned coinposer on an astonished world and used to show up at banquets with a nine-piece orchestra to be led affably in his own composition . But it is equally true ( and this was the kind of story about Hackett which somehow never did get into circulation ) that he was extraordinarily generous with that inheritance and that his first act on coming into it was to give a banquet to all the creditors who , some years before , had lost large sums by his going into bankruptcy .

Gramercy Park NCE more we call upon our tear N -- .1 ducts to relieve our emotion . And this time it is for the treading down of quaint old Gramercy Park by the foot of progress . The park is still there , let us hasten to reassure you ; but the quiet , drowsing atmosphere that once hung about the enclosure is now gone forever . ? The dibdcle began last year , when the splendid old mansions of Stanford White , his sister and Robert G. Ingersoll  --  once an imposing row of houses ? were torn away to make room for the apartment hotel which stands at No. 2 Lexington Avenue . And now the workmen are standing in the bare plots of ground where lately five other mansions regarded from their austere facades the tulips and the willow trees beyond the iron palings of the enclosure . F THE finest house on the park is -L that owned by the Players  --  built by Stanford White for Edwin Booth and by him willed to the fellows of his craft  --  then the next finest was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite side of the park . That has been razed , and in its place will he built a hotel of incalculable stories . At the Irving Place corner they have torn down the old mansion that was built by Luther C. Clark in 1853 . The building was the home of the Columbia University Club in 1905 , and , during the war , of the Army and Navy Officers ' Club . The Gramercy Park Squash Club , adjoining the ? THE NEW YORKER 21 Clark house , has been razed as well . On this corner , which was sold in 1831 by Samuel R. Ruggles , the founder of the park , a seventeen-story apartment hotel is being erected . The lot was one of the original sixty-six which were subdivided by Ruggles when he bought the site for a few hundred dollars . Squirarchy EVEN the moving picture haute aristoeratie is not immune to servant trouble . We have in mind Mr. Marcus Loew , who , like all patricians , manages in person his old family estate , acquired some time ago from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the place is Pembroke . Its sixty acres spread about Hempstead Harbor and perhaps ? remembering the many outbuildings , as well as the Manor House  --  Pembroke was well worth the two millions of dollars paid for it . In the course of his household reorganization , Mr. Loew had occasion to discharge one of his high ranking butlers . The man asked if he might stay on for a week or so until he could make arrangements to move elsewhere . " Where are you living ? " his employer inquired , and was informed that the fellow occupied quarters in a house some distance away , but plainly visible from the veranda where the interview took place . " I do n't care if the owner does n't object , " said Mr. Loew . " But you are the owner , sir , " mura inured the man . " It 's part of your property . It 's the lodge . " Mr. Loew , it appears , was too confounded to ask even what lodge . THIS Captain De Lamar must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine owner , and a director of many corporations . He was a Hollander by birth and his early life was spent upon the seas . His tide , they say , holds warrant in his one-time command of a tugboat . Besides his Long Island home so large that it is said the new owner , Mr. Loew , has not yet found time to visit thirty of the mansion 's many rooms  --  the late Captain had a town house at Madison Avenue and Thirty-seventh Street , which is now the home of the National Democratic Club . If you have visited there you will recall the ponderous marble staircase which meets your eye as you enter , and , perhaps , the heavily figured green wall paper in what is now the lounge room and was once the library . These , and other ornate features of the place , have been undisturbed since the original occupancy . There are those surly enough to wonder why . Probably it is fitting that ownership of one of his establishments should pass from a gentleman with tugboat beginnings to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came into the business of purveying entertainment by way of the penny arcade . He owned one in Fourteenth Street , and from it graduated to proprietorship of the first chain of nickelodeons . Now , as the moving spirit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and other interests , he controls a capitalization of one hundred millions and is responsible for an annual payroll of ten millions . Our growing squirarchy is not without its promise of an intensely interesting future . Two Tales WHATWHAT with the many tales of recent years , one assumes that Senators and such get their liquor free , but a shocking happening in Washington indicates that this may not be generally true . For years and years one of the noted clubs of our national capital had a steward who , upon the advent of prohibition , naturally became the club bootlegger . He supplied pre-war stuff ; high priced but pre-war , straight from the ships . He supplied it until a few weeks ago when the House Committee and the steward had a row . It was then discovered that down below the sub-sub-cellar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had installed therein a large still where he and his partner , the chef , made fresh every hour the prewar booze they sold to the distinguished politicians upstairs . NOT ONLY do we learn that the stomachs and the livers of these mighty men have been thus imperiled ? we hear that the White House itself is not safe from the alcohol menace . The wife of an eminent eastern statesman , knowing his love for Cointreau , thought of sending to him in Washington a bottle of this rare beverage . She chose as her messenger a certain political leader who was about to call upon President Coolidge . Arriving in Washington  --  the story runs  --  the emissary was met by a White House car and taken to dine with the President . Installed ii a room at the White House , he hid the Cointreau under the bed , the while he fervently implored the mercy of Heaven for such lese majeste . At dinner , the record has it , he ate very little and said rather less . And later still , he spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .
