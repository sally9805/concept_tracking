A dish of strawberries was the reputed agency which brought to an abrupt close , last week , the 45th session of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva ( TIME , June 6 ) . <P> The strawberries were eaten by Foreign Minister Aristide Briand of France . As everyone knows some strawberries have a pollen which can produce on certain pollen-sensitive persons an irritating rash . Soon such a rash broke out upon M. Briand . Impetuous , he scratched . The rash spread , attacked the patient 's eyelids , caused them to swell , to close one eye , nearly to close the other . <P> M. Briand 's physicians endeavored to persuade him that he had contracted a different sort of rash ( herpes zoster ) , but he insisted : C'est les fraises maudites ! " ( " It is those cursed strawberries " ) . . . . <P> Finally the afflicted French Foreign Minister retired to his bed in the Hotel des Bergues with a compress over both eyes . Into his bedroom came , daily , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain of Britain These " Big Three , " putting their heads together , and occasionally calling in lesser statesmen for political consultation , virtually made up last week , the Council of the League of Nations . . . . Their problems : <P> Rhineland Evacuation . M Briand , sitting up in bed , reputedly told Dr. Stresemann with great vehemence that France will not hasten her evacuation of the Rhineland until Germany carries out more fully her disarmament obligations ( TIME , Nov. 2 , 1925 ) . Dr Stresemann offered to produce photographs showing the destruction of German fortifications along the Polish frontier ; but returned an evasive answer when M. Briand insisted that a French military commission be allowed to investigate the destroyed defenses in question . <P> " Reds . " Sir Austen ChamberIain was known to have made every effort to persuade M. Briand and more especially Dr. Stresemann last week that France and Germany ought to support Great Britain in her severance of relations with Russia ( TIME , May 16 et seq . ) . Sir Austen succeeded only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unsigned interview in which he said : " It is a great pity that some citizens of Soviet Russia seem to be doing unwise things which strengthen the hands of their enemies .
