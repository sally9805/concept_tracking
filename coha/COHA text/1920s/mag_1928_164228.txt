Steelmen expected , last week , to find their industry in its customary , unalarming summer doldrums . With surprise and pleasure , therefore , they noted that mighty U. S. Steel Corp . reported unfilled orders ( traditionally significant ) on June 30 of 3,637,009 tons , an increase of 220,187 tons over May . They noted further that July production was at 75% of capacity , a high average for midsummer . And Carnegie Steel was anticipating even better business by raising prices of steel products $2 a ton , returning to the price levels of the early part of 1927 . <P> Seeking explanations of this happy situation , steelmen considered : 1 ) new automobile models ; 2 ) Ford Motor Co. expansion ; 3 ) record farm implement business ; 4 ) purchase of 65,000 tons of rails for Northern Pacific , Great Northern , etc. ; 5 ) active building construction , particularly in New York .
