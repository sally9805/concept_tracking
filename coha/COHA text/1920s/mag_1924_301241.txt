The anticipated attack by Russia upon Rumania over the Bessarabian bugaboo ( TIME , April 14 ) was fortified during the week by numerous rumors concerning Russian mobilization on the Bessarabian border . No clash took place , however , and none is likely to lake place , according to some reports . A deep-dyed irredentist propaganda onslaught against Rumania and all those countries who recognize the Rumanian annexation of Bessarabia was reported to have been begun . <P> Meanwhile , War Lord Lon Trotsky raged in Moscow . " We will never agree that the Bessarabian workmen and peasants shall remain under the iron heel of the Rumanian nobles . We will not make war and we will strive to avoid it by all means . This , however , does not mean that we agree to the present situation . The Soviet Government will use all its power to liquidate the conflict peacefully . If its efforts are unsuccessful , however , this will be due to a desire on the part of the other side to aggravate the situation . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
