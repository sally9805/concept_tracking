txt George W. Alger , special commissioner appointed by Governor Smith last Spring to investigate State prison and parole methods . recommended in the third section of his report , made public today , that James L. Long , Superintendent of Prisons , be supplanted as head of the State prison system after Jan. 1 , when the system will be reorganized and consolidated with the State Department of Correction . Pointing out that under the reorganization law the Commissioner of Correction will also head the Commission of Prisons , Mr. Alger said : " The new Department of Correction calls for a very higlP order of administrative abilities at its head if it Is to succeed as a constructive reorganization . The duties imposed upon the Commissioner are far greater than those of the Superintendent of Prisons.1 " The many serious and difficult problems which will confront this new department will require for their solu. tion far more than a willingness to follow uncritically the traditions of an established but archaic routine in a badly organized system . " I feel obliged to say that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of such administrative ability in the Superintendent of Prisons as , in my judgment , to make it desirable to place upon him the enlarged responsibilities and opportunities of this new department . First Step Important . " The quality of the Commissioner who at the beginning is placed at the head of the new department will determine to a very large extent whether or not there is to be in fact a great advance in the development of a modern prison system in this State under the new law , and whether we are to have a well articulated Department of Correction sufficiently organized to meet effectively its normal functions and also competent to obtain the maximum results from the expenditure of millions of dollars which in the next decade will be available for long needed improvements . " Removal of Superintendent Long has been anticipated since the beginning of Commissioner Alger 's investigation , which followed action by Mr. Long in deducting 924 days ' penalty for an escape from Great Meadow Prison from the sentence of Izzy Presser , a notorious gunman , and action by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presser 's parole . The first section of Mr. Alger 's report , made public on Dec. 5 , criticized Mr. Long 's attitude in the Presser case , and the second section , made public on Dec. 11 , called for reforms in the parole law . A feature of the report is a detailed recommendation for the expenditure of $8,675,000 from bond issues in improving our State prisons . Mr. Alger 's report asserted that the extension of the duties of the Commissioner of Correction under the consolidation scheme made the development of a central administrative system essential . " The present Prison Department lacks such a system , " he went on . " While we have four State prisons , which are fortunately all managed by efficient and competent wardens , they are operated in the main as separate units without much indication of a central organization of which they are a part and whose administrative plans and purposes control their operation . " Mr. Alger recommended more guards and more clerical employes for Clinton Prison , where dangerous , unruly and long-term prisoners are confined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped . He advocated discontinuing special privileges for Sing Sing prisoners , who may receive food packages from friends and relatives at any time , although inmates of other prisons may receive them only on four specified holidays . Mr. Alger urged that in all transfers from one prison to another the reasons be stated , because complaints of favoritism in transfers are more numerous than for any other cause . Mr. Alger recommended a central plan of prison classification . He said he found in Sing Sing sixty-nine inmates who were 16 , 17 or 18 years old when committed , in Clinton Prison sixty-four and in Auburn numerous others . These boys of " hero-worshiping age , " he said , were consorting with hardened offenders instead of being with other boys in Elmira Reformatory . In Elmira , he went on , he found thirty men who had been committed there between the ages of 26 and 30 , besides a large number of feeble-minded who should not have been sent there . He said conditions at Elmira were so bad that prison officials believed boys suffered Iess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , so that the educational and disciplinary facilities of Elmira might be used more effectively for their original reformative purposes . He also said the age limit- at Elmira should be reduced from 30 to 25 . Urging a greater appropriation for new construction and modernization of the State prisons than the $8,000,000 tentatively allotted to prisons from the newly ' authorized bond issues , Mr. Alger said the present condition , of the prisons was a disgrace to the State . Cells Called Atrocious . " Both at Auburn and Sing Sing , " he went on , " the wardens permit baseball , motion pictures and miscellaneous group amusements for the prisoners . Why ? Simply because the cells are so atrocious that the men should bo kept out of them except for the time actually required for sleep . Those who criticize prison amusements as a process of coddling should understand the reason why in some cases these amusements are permitted . " Discussing the possibility of an Increased mimber of prisoners as a result of the Baumes laws , Mr. Alger said an analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result in longer terms in many cases . He said 214 prisoners would be discharged from Sing Sing between 1926 and 1930 who would still be in prison at that time if they had been sentenced under the new laws . Whereas , Sing Sing has two life prisoners sentenced as habitual criminals , he went on , it would have ninety if the law providing life imprisonment for fourth offenders had been in effect when the other eighty-eight had been sentenced . In ten years , he pointed out , this ratio would add 880 life prisoners to the number of Sing Sing inmates . The same ratio applied to the whole prison system of the State , he continued , would mean an increase of 1,250 life prisoners In ten years , or enough to fill a new prison . He expected , however , that the effect of the new laws would be felt gradually , rather than suddenly , and that there would be plenty of time in the future to provide for new prisons if needed . At present . he said , the prisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is approaching its capacity . Building Requirements . Mr. Alger listed the following " major requirements " of the prisons which he thought should be provided for as soon as possible out of the State bond issues : Sing Sing Prison To complete the cell blocks and other buildings on the hill at Sing Sing , Which will produce in con , nection with the new buildings already erected a total number of cells of 1,400 *2,775,000 I Auburn Prison To rebuild certain parts of Auburn Prison , to make new cell blocks and to provide for a central power plant 2,500,000 Clinton Prison To destroy existing cell blocks at Clinton Prison and replace same with reinforced concrete cell blocks With 200 additional cells with proper plumbing and toilet facilities , 7,00,000 To build power plant at Clinton for which the appropriations have thus far been made which are only sufficient to build foundations and tunnels to connect same with prison plant Women 's Prison To build at Bedford a plant for a women 's prison to take the place of the Auburn Prison for Women . with cells to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed 350,000 Elmira Reformatory To build at Elmira a building to take the place of the twice condemned foundry plant 100,000 To build at .
