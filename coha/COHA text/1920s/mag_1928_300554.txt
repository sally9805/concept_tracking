Because the Congresses have refused to obey the Constitution and reapportion popular representation to fit the changes of U. S. population since 1910 , many a State has more Representatives than it is proportionately entitled to and many another has less . Representative Fenn of Connecticut has long and often proposed a bill which , in its present form , would keep the House membership at 435 and reapportion the seats on the basis of the 1930 census , when taken . Estimates are that California would benefit most , gaining six seats . Next would be Michigan , gaining four seats ; then Ohio , 3 ; New Jersey &; Texas , 2 ; Arizona , Connecticut , Florida , North Carolina , Oklahoma &; Washington , 1 seat each . Hitherto the States which are threatened with losing seats have been an organized bloc opposing Reapportionment . Now the would-be-gainers are organizing . Michigan 's McLeod arose last week and announced that a bloc of 100 votes had been formed " to take any measure necessary " to pass the Fenn bill promptly . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be necessary to filibuster . "
