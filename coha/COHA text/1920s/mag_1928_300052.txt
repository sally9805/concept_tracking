In a General Electric laboratory at Schenectady last fortnight people peered at the small 3 " x 3 " screen of Dr Ernst Frederik Werner Alexanderson 's television receiving set . They were waiting for the performance of the first playlet broadcast by television . It was J. Hartley Manners ' The Queen 's Messenger . There being only two parts , there were only two actors : <P> The screen glowed pinkishly ; a loud speaker in the same room susurrated A human head appeared on the screen , tiny and wraithlike : its lips moved ; simultaneously the loud speaker squawked words . Another head appeared ; more words . Hands replaced heads , gestured , poured a liquid , shot a gun , wound a watch ; the speaker gurgled , crashed , crackled . <P> The whole performance was gawky . <P> Yet it pleased Dr. Alexanderson and his guests , for it was another demonstration that television would some day become practical. * <P> ... <P> General Electric and Westinghouse . who are working hard to hasten the commercialization of television , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new entertainment . Last week Westinghouse 's Vice President H. P. Davis warned : " Television , in so far as present accomplishments warrant , has been ' overplayed . ' . . . Unfortunately , this has created the opportunity to foist on the public , much as in the early days of radio , a widespread sale of unsuitable apparatus , which those who purchase naturally expect will permit them to view television broadcasts , but which will only lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction . . . . The gawkish period in the development of television should be passed in the laboratories . " <P> General Electric 's Manager of Broadcasting Martin P. Rice was somewhat less admonitory : " The experimenter should guard well against ignorant or unscrupulous dealers . . . . With many hundreds dabbling in the new art , there is reason to expect that the record of television will parallel that of radio broadcasting . " . . . <P> Already television producers have discovered that a certain type of person appears best before their machines . Specifications : <P> Red hair , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light color , preferably blue ; <P> Perfect teeth ; <P> Cameo features of distinctiveness , so that in profile and in full view each will stand out clear-cut and on its own merits ; <P> A voice suitable for radio broadcasting . <P> * A description of the Alexanderson-G .
