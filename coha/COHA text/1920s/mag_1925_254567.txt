So , too , " Christian Endeavor , " from its crowded international convention last week at Portland , Ore. , beamed forth its simplicity ; the world beamed yonder . <P> History . Seventy-four years ago in the Province of Quebec , a son , Francis E. , was born to an obscure New Englander named Symmes . Two years later he was orphaned , was adopted by his uncle , Rev. E. W. Clark , changed his name , grew up as Francis E. Clark . Dartmouth College and Andover Theological Seminary having graduated him , the youthful parson accepted a call to a tiny church in Portland , Me. , and started a diary . Presently he wrote : <P> Feb. 2 , 1881 . " The boys and girls take tea with us , about 35 of them , and we form a young people 's society . " <P> Feb. 4 , 1881 .

Subjects discussed at the 44th annual convention included : <P> Is it necessary to be a Fundamentalist to be a Christian ? <P> Can the Church supply enough recreation for the average young man or woman of today ? <P> Does dancing indicate a serious defect in moral fiber ? <P> Is it immodest for a young girl to appear in public in a one-piece bathing suit ? <P> Should golf and other sports be engaged in on Sunday ? <P> How can enforcement of Prohibition best be aided ? <P> Can a Christian Endeavor girl wear rolled stockings and use a lipstick ? <P> Must all races mingle on an equality ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement-the old query whether a dancing foot and praying knee could be joined together . There was no final pronouncement on dancing except that no dance may be given under <P> Christian Endeavor auspices .
