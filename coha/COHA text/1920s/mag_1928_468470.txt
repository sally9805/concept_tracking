MANY things are wrong with our colleges . I have it on the highest and the lowest author ? ity ? that is , on the authority of Nicholas Murray Butler and Upton Sinclair . It has also been intimated to me by ath ? letic coaches and college presidents , who may be said to represent the alpha and the omega of reliability on such matters . As I happen to be both a college professor and a college trustee , I get the bombardment on both flanks . I have positive information that the colleges are no longer educating any ? body , and I have equally emphatic assurance that they are educating a lot of youngsters who ought to be left illiter ? ate for the benefit of the unskilled labor market . I hear that the colleges have completely lost the confidence of the business world , and I read in the editorial columns that more business men are sending their sons to college than ever before . I learn from presidents ' reports that the colleges have big deficits every year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing larger . In my spare moments ( of which every college professor has an abun ? dance ) I have answered no end of ques ? tionnaires and participated in at least a dozen educational surveys , each one of which has been able to demonstrate that the methods of instruction used in colleges , although widely diverse in character , are alike in being wrong . This recalls to mind one of the maxims of equity : to wit , that " there is no wrong without a remedy . " In the case of the colleges the remedies far out ? number the wrongs . They are literally uncountable , like the twinklers in the new heavens . Indeed , there is no species of quackery so popular to-day as the educational brand of hocus-pocus . The land is swarming with educational prestidigitators ? and no wonder , for to qualify as an educational expert one needs only to be a glib fellow away from home . Every one of these intellectual /Esculapians has his own favorite pre ? scription . He believes it applicable to all institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sex . The college of to-day , unhappily , is like a patient upon whom the allopaths , home ? opaths , osteopaths , chiropractors , men ? tal healers , and sun-bath zealots all demand the right to operate simultane ? ously . It is in a worse position , being beset by medicine-men who are ready t ( diagnose , prescribe , and cure withou license or fee . Out of this welter let us pick a fey of the remedial tonics which are beini most assiduously peddled at the presen time . Number one may be called th Job-Analysis Serum . It is designed t lower the high fever of those college which are excitedly doing a lot of thing without knowing what they are doing c why . In the language of the educe tional technician , the colleges have nc " clarified their objectives . " It ma seem strange that , although some ( our older institutions have been on ti job for more than two hundred year they have never thought to stop an " analyze it " ; yet such appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omission . The job-analysis treatment should be applied at once . First , count the patient 's pulse ? that is to say , be ? gin with a questionnaire . Every survey that aims to be both scientific and sociological ( queer combination ! ) must begin that way . Send the questionnaire to all the professors asking them why they teach . Send it to all the students asking them why they allow themselves to be taught . Send it to the alumni with a demand for information of sim ? ilar irrelevance . Then , when the replies come in , tabulate the data , find the median and the mode , figure out the coefficient of correlation , and the result will give you an atypical conspectus of the pattern of valuation , which is the true collegiate objective reduced to a conventionalized significance . ( Not be ? ing a psychologist , I can not be sure of my terminology , but that is the formula as I remember it . ) Having found its true objective , at any rate , the college can then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution for each and all of its problems ? of finance , housing , instruction , athletics , and the social distractions . It will tell you how un ? dergraduate mental vacuity can be transformed into genius as by the touch of a magic wand . There is no other serum like unto this one in its claim to curative accomplishment. neat , which has had a brisk sale during he past ten years . Its vendors begin iar assuring us that the job-analysts rave made a false diagnosis . The col ? eges know what they are trying to do , nit the students do n't . Every autumn ome thousands of freshmen come hronging through the academic gates . nd are helplessly whirled into the vor ? ex of an elective curriculum . These oung men and women should be romptly " oriented . " To that end hey should be bidden to arrive for a " freshman week " before the college opens . During this preview perform ? ance they can be told , in abbreviated form , all that they would ordinarily learn during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all very simple . They listen to speeches and they stand in line . They are addressed by the president on what they ought to do , and by the dean on what they ought not to do . The chair ? man of the faculty warns them in the morning that they came to the college to get an education , and in the afternoon the football coach confides to the mass meeting that an education is the last thing any red-blooded young man comes to college for . The freshmen should also be provided with advisers , both from the faculty and from the senior class . These advisers make the most of their opportunities , hence advice is the last thing that any freshman lacks when this curtain-raiser week comes to a close . If he assimilated one-tenth of it ? which he does not ? he would have enough to last him to the end of his days . It is my observation that among all forms of counsel the kind which is given by the senior student-advisers impresses the average freshman as the most interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neophyte finds out what courses in the curriculum are " snap courses , " where the college bootlegger resides , how to get bids to the sorority dances , and whether the dean is hard-boiled to the alibi of an alarm clock that did not go off in time for a nine-o'clock class . To the new ? comer this information is obviously more utilitarian than the assurance of his faculty mentor " that he must seek ad ? justment to his highest potential , re ? spond to his creative urge , seek to integrate what he learns into a universal harmony of knowledge , and strive to live the abundant life . " Not all the orientation ointment can be applied during freshman week , even with the most vigorous rubbing . Ac ? cordingly , this process should have a follow-up in the way of an orientation course given as part of the regular curriculum and counting towards a degree . This course should aim to be an outline of everything . It should begin with the origin of the cosmos and come down to the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks or thereabouts . To do this , it must cover six centuries per hour , although a little slowing up for the last three or four centuries is permissible in view of the fact that these are somewhat more crowded with happenings . It is said that light travels around the earth in one-seventh of a second ; but even at that it is no match for the speed of the orientation lecturer . He flashes through the Eocene , the Miocene , and the Plio ? cene ages , right down to the Obscene ? which is the contemporary era . The greatness and decline of Rome are master-stroked in seven minutes , the Darwinian theory is elucidated in four , and the industrial revolution gets by while the lecturer pauses for breath . The title of this course should be both dignified and designatory . It may be called , " The Story of Civilization , " or " The Universe and Mankind , " or perhaps just " Life and Its Problems . " But the official title does not much matter , for the undergraduate will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seeing Civilization , " or " The Educa ? tional Rubberneck Bus , " or , in ( Inc tribute to the high spots of the course , he labels it alliteratively as " Drink , Drainage , Divorce , and Democracy . " The orientation course , as given in various institutions which have fallen for this pick-me-up , has developed into a companionate miscegenation of his ? tory , politics , economics , pietisms , and sex hygiene . It has length and breadth without the third dimension . This means that the instructor must be a sociologist , in other words , someone who has spent his life learning less and less about more and more until he has be ? come intellectually unbuttoned . As a preparation for serious work in collegeor elsewhere these orientation courses have a value that accountants would express in red ink . Then there is Nostrum Number Three , the abolition of the lecture sys ? tem and the substitution of active participation by the student in the classroom exercises . The usual aca ? demic lecture , we are asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the notebook of the professor to the notebook of the student without going through the heads of either . So let it be amputated from the curriculum . Anyhow , the lecture is a survival of scholasticism , a medieval hang-over quite out of keeping with the genius of the twentieth-century American youth . In its place let us have creative participa ? tion by the student ? creative partici ? pation , that is the newest phrase , and it has an alluring sound without meaning much . No more shall some ex cathedra dogma ? tist deliver his pontifical discourses from the rostrum with no opportunity for the benches to hit back ; but teacher and pupil will exchange ideas , like Socrates and Plato . Encourage the freshman to assume a " challenging attitude " to wards everything which the instruetoi may say , be it an assertion that the earth is a sphere , or that the poles an colder than the equator , or that thi Dutch have captured Amsterdam . De velop his spirit of criticism , his propen sity to disagree . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will at least qualify him as municipal reformer . Everyone who is not himself a teache likes to scold about the kind of teachin his sons and daughters are getting . I makes them work too hard , or not har enough . It is too meticulous , or to superficial . It discourages thought b making the subject too simple , or dampens enthusiasm by making it to complex . It is too old-fashioned , or exemplifies some transient fad . Peda ? gogy is like politics in that anyone can tell you how to do things better than they are being done . Ideas about teaching , like those concerning govern ? ment , are all created free and equal . But teaching is an art , and a true art can never be enslaved to formal rules . Teaching is an intensely personal thing ; it can not be standardized any more than leadership can . To teach is to lead , to inspire , to create disciples . Every good teacher has his own way of doing it . Some subjects lend themselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are delivered in college classrooms , no doubt ; but I have a suspicion that poor sermons are also delivered from church pulpits at times . Why not abolish all sermons , therefore , and just leave the text to be discussed for an hour by the more garrulous mem ? bers of the congregation ? That would be " creative participation " in a service of worship ? and it would empty the churches . There is no best method of instruction , whether in the home , the school , or the college . Education does not succeed or ' =fail on the issue of methodology but on the capacity and the personality of the teacher himself . That ought to be commonplace , but it is not . Otherwise we should hardly have these perennial announcements from Rollins or Ripon , from Tucson or Tuscaloosa , that some-me has discovered in the two-hour 2onference , or the pro-seminar , or the socialized recitation , a new educational sichemy which enables the undergrad ? rate to get educated without exertion , io matter what kind of faculty the ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t consists of hard work outside the . ollege , given in regular doses to offset he lethargic habits that the student , cquires within . The undergraduates ttend classes for a stretch ; then for an qual interlude they go out and earntheir living as best they can . This al ? ternation is continued from entrance to graduation , which covers six years in ? stead of the usual four . The process , in a way , is reminiscent of the Scotch farmer who fed and starved his hogs on alternate days so that the bacon would be of prime quality , a streak of fat and a streak of lean . It aims at the intermingling of the manual and the mental in equal proportions . The hands go to work while the brain lays off ; then the intellect is oiled up for another run . There are some cynics who would ar ? gue , of course , that the boy who is both able and willing to do college work ought to spend all his time at it until the job is finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate months at gainful employment in order to make him appreciate his academic opportuni ? ties ? well , it is questionable whether he ought to be in college at all , even half the time . Half earning , half studying may be justified in the case of those whose straitened circumstances make it the only way to acquire a college degree . For others , it is a hybrid which sacrifices the highest values of academic training on the one hand and of industrial train ? ing on the other by the vain effort to combine them both . There has been too much deification of the boy who works his way through college . It is natural , in a democracy , that this should be the case . it few fel ? lows derive benefit from the experience of having to earn their way , but the vast majority do nothing of the sort . To them it simply means that these plastic years of young manhood are clouded by financial anxieties which haunt the soul and depress the spirit . It involves a de ? nial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest value . It compels the student to cut corners , to forego many cultural advantages which the college environment provides , and sometimes to undermine his health as well . Many a man does not learn the real cost of working his way through college until he has passed into the fif ties . Then he finds that there are pre ? maturely frayed-out nerves to be entered on the debit side of the account . It is my conviction , after having taught more than ten thousand college students during the past quarter of a century , that nine-tenths of those who had to earn their way to a bachelor 's degree would have been far better off without any such handicap . A strange doctrine it is , therefore , that young men and women whose parents can afford to edu ? cate them should , nevertheless , inter ? rupt their studies for the sake of the " experience . " They will get quite enough of it after college days are over . And so one might go on through the Tong category of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaugurate . Fraternities should be abolished . The students should not be taught but tu ? tored . They should be separated into sections on the basis of ability . They should study subjects and not merely take courses . They should devote a whole year , indeed , to a single subject like the civilization of ancient Athens , instead of rustling about in a mosaic of Bible , biography , botany , and business ? as they do in some colleges . They should read books for themselves and not be content with the professor 's ver ? sion of what is in the books . They should learn a little of everything and one thing well . ( The first part of that syllogism , by the way , presents no diffi ? culty in any American college . ) They should have required studies for disci ? pline and elective courses for self-expres ? sion . They should be objectively rated and psychologically tested . They should have personnel supervision and voca ? tional guidance . The colleges should impose a limitation upon the number of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular among the endowed colleges . But the state-sup ? ported institutions can not employ it , so they make use of an emetic instead . They throw out those whom they should never have admitted . The catalogue of panaceas , indeed , is far too long for insertion here . There is the Johns Hopkins plan for a senior college , the Wisconsin plan for an experi ? mental college , and the Michigan plan for a university college . There is the Swarthmore idea , the Claremont idea , and the Wabash idea . It is a rare thing to have even two or three months pass without the launching of some new scheme of educational rapid transit ; some way of getting to the top of Mount Parnassus without climbing there . A few of them have meritorious features , but for the most part they merely reflect the age-old and utterly futile attempt to gain the end without the means , the whole without the parts , the victory without the battle . There is no substitute and there never can be any substitute for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? thusiastic , capable men in the faculty and in the student body . Given these , you have a great college ; without them , all the newfangled methods will never avail an institution much . Nearly all the problems of collegiate education merge into two fundamental ones ? hand ? picking the student body and recruiting the faculty . The college that does both these things well is on the high road to ultimate distinction ; and the one that relegates them to a secondary place it its program , while it goes philandering after mirages , is inexorably headed to the rear of the procession . It is men , not methods or measures that determine whether a college shall b. first-rate or second class . Or , to put i more accurately , first find the men an the methods will take care of themselves I should like to find some college wit the right men and the wrong methods c education . I do n't believe there is one Is it not time to rise and suggest the ac visability of less quack-doctoring in th matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital issue of personnel ? of my throat , while the other two cages unloaded and the miners trooped away . The heat was nothing short of infernal , in spite of the big fans , and the sweat ran off my body in streams . Never having worked in a mine before . I wore too many clothes . My idea of a mine , prior to entering this one , gained chiefly from going down into the family cellar , was that it must be a cool place , a very cool place indeed . That idea , along with many others , soon went by the board . Some mines , I admit , are very cool , and some arc the reverse . This one was doubly the reverse . Presently along came the shifter ( shift boss ) , and motioned for inc to follow him down the level , which was well lighted by electricity . At the foot of the manway ladder to stope seventy-seven he paused , adjusted a candle in his miner 's candlestick , lighted it , and ad ? vised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in a mine before , I had not thought to purchase a candlestick . This brought forth a lurid flow of pro ? fanity from the shifter . " ' Ere , take mine , " he said angrily , and shoved the thing at me , " an ' see that ' e bloody well buys one to-morrer . Fol ? ler me . " Up the ladder he went , with me after him . Not knowing the correct method of holding the candlestick while climb ? ing , I received a steady stream of hot tallow on my hands and face . On the fourth floor of the stope the shifter pointed to a huge pile of ore , a shovel , and the open mouth of a chute . " Bloody well ' op to it , me laddie buck , " he ordered sharply . " Forty-five ton to the shift , mind ' e . Shovel that thur hore in thur , an ' be bloody quick about it . " Then he left me . I stuck the candlestick in a post be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started my heart pounding and my blood throbbing , to say nothing of the sweat oozing from my brow and pouring into my eyes , blinding me . On and on I shovelled , expecting each moment my heart would burst . Water blisters wereappearing and breaking all over the palms of my soft hands . It is surprising how little light a miner can work by . More often than not he will be drilling or mucking or timbering in the faint glow of a single candle stuck in a post many feet away from him . Thus , while steadily shovelling into the heart of that pile or ore , I was working farther and farther away from my can ? dle , which meant nothing to me ? then . At length I paused , resting on my shovel handle . Happening to glance to the top of the pile I saw two green orbs staring directly at me . With my nerves somewhat frayed by that swift descent into the mine and by the eerie nature of this my first experience underground , I let out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manway , almost alighting on the head of a passing miner on the level below . I was immensely relieved to see him , and told him what had happened . He was a powerful , squat and hairy Cornish ? man , about sixty years of age . " Nowt but a cat , " he explained , laughing . " Aye , the mine 's full of ' em . The comp'ny puts ' em in ' ere an ' feeds ' em , so 's they 'll stay an ' ketch rats , an ' the bloody fool miners feeds ' em what 's left from thur buckets , an ' the bleedin ' cats pays no attention to the blinkin ' rats . Guts too full o ' grub , mind ' e . An ' the blarsted rats steals candles an ' powder , chaws it up an ' wads it in them thur cracks .
