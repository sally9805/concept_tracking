Scarcely more than a dozen of the 446,726,752 subjects of George V knew until last week that during His Majesty 's illness he has raved in delirium , suffered from a dry , cracked tongue , and turned a livid , bluish color-temporarily . <P> A statement to this startling effect and a masterly review of the Sovereign 's entire illness was issued , last week , by the Royal physicians , and printed simultaneously in the Lancet and the British Medical Journal . The thirteen days from Dec. 2 to Dec. 15 were mentioned as the most critical ; and His Majesty 's condition of last week was described thus : " It will be apparent to medical men that not only the severity and the length of the infection but the exhaustion resulting therefrom must make progress slow and difficult . <P> " At the same time the dangerous phases of the illness have been surmounted and there are increasingly solid grounds for hoping that recovery will result from this long and anxious struggle . " <P> The " first stage " of the Royal case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . a general infection . . . little or no cough ... a sense of illness-yet a wish , born of quiet courage and the habit of duty , to make light of the illness and hold on to work , thus adding to the wear and tear of the fever . " <P> " The second phase , " the report continued , " was one of increasing toxaemia poisoning of the blood with a dusky appearance , dry , cracked tongue , periods of delirium and exhaustion-in short , a clinical picture resembling that of a case of severe typhoid fever in the third and fourth weeks-but with the added anxiety of attacks of dyspnoea labored breathing due to ineffective action of the heart and cyanosis a disordered condition of the circulation , causing a livid , bluish color in the skin , due to strain on the heart . <P> " . . . later the temperature rose rather abruptly to a higher level and on Dec. 12 there was evidence at the extreme right base of effusion which had commenced between the lung and diaphragm . Drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same day under general anaesthesia-gas , oxygen and ether . . . . <P> " To stimulate the vitality of the tissues a brief , general exposure to ultraviolet rays from a mercury lamp has been made each day since Dec. 15 . There is reason to think that this employment of ultraviolet rays has , in combination with the treatment mentioned in previous statements , been beneficial . " <P> For the first time in over 30 days doctors and nurses withdrew , for go minutes , last week , permitting His Majesty and Her Majesty to be alone . <P> For the first time Her Majesty presided as Chairwoman of the Crown Council , despite the presence of Edward of Wales , who had been expected to sit as Chairman . Business before the Council consisted in routine exercise of the authority vested in the Crown . However , since the Council does not possess the King 's power of creating peers , the usual " New <P> Year 's Honors List " of new creations could not be issued on Jan. 1 , 1929 . <P> H. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last week ; and H. R. H. Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester , hove home from South Africa .
