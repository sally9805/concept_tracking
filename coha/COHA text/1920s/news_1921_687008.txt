TRIBUNE COOK BOOK I BY JANE EDDINGTON . Green Tomato Mince . Meat . It is difficult to recommend it recipe for green tomato mince meat , espe- : citify If you believe that such mixtures ns it represents should not be Put between crusts and baked for human consumption . And I believe that . Moreover , I have seen two inconceivably different products made from exactly the same recipe . And besides that , there , is not a single recipe to be found , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided after studying a good many recipes for this mince meat that the following was representative : " Wash and chop fine one peck each of green tomatoes and apples . Mix with them four pounds of dark brown sugar , two ? ounds of seeded raisins , two pounds of cleaned currants , one cup of vinegar , one cup of finely chopped suet , one teaspoon ground cloves , two tablespoons each of cinnamon , allspice , and salt . Mix well and cook until soft . " More rational than vinegar is boiled down cider , and soine ' people like Fome lemon juice . The above recipe would be much . too sweet for some tastes since the raisins and currants add sweetness . In one recipe , in an exceedingly rellabe source , only two pounds and a half of brown ' sugar per Pack of tomatoes area used , and two pounds of raisins  --  no currantsbut not nearly ' as much is needed in that case because only two cups of chopped apple instead of a peck is called for . ' People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quantities at this season . Two hours of slow cooking is recommended in one case . The blend in this case should be perfect . The common proportions of apples and to . matoes are one to one . You may sweeten and spice the mixture to your own taste .
