At Berkeley , Calif. , the University summer music session was officially closed by a concert of Henry Cowell 's funny ultra-modern oddities , presented in Wheeler Hall by the Berkeley Greek Theatre Management . The titles read : Amiable Conversation , What 's This , Advertisements , Piece for Piano With Strings . The performance was punctuated by snickers and guffaws on the part of the learned audience . This was just what Cowell tried to achieve . It is easy enough , he believes , to write music that will draw tears out of the emotional listener , but few composers have succeeded in pulling a laugh . Not even jazz can do it . Cowell thus promises to become the progenitor of a race of U. S. musicians exclusively devoted to the Comic Muse . France has already started such a line with Eric Satie and his followers , the " Group of Six . "
