The leaders of the new Nationalist Government of China ( TIME , June 18 ) are Sun worshippers . Last week they repaired to the Temple of the Western Hills , near Peking , and adored the cunningly preserved remains of their Sun-the late Dr. Sun , founder of the Nationalist Party . <P> Modern , materialistic Chinese prostrate themselves before the corpse of Dr. Sun Yatsen , just as modern , materialistic Russians venerate the embalmed remains of Nikolai Lenin . The writings of both men are , in effect , the new Bibles of two new , materialistic Civilizations . <P> The Nationalist Generalissimo who has conquered all of China proper , General Chiang Kaishek , is a brother-in-law of Potent Corpse Sun . <P> As such , Generalissimo Chiang , a slender high strung Chinaman , was first to fling himself upon the glass topped Sun coffin , last week , and loudest to sob . He controlled himself only when raised up and embraced by the towering Christian Marshal , Feng Yu-hsiang ( TIME , July 2 ) . <P> Subsequent ceremonies included reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples have conquered China . Incense was burned , dirges chanted . A table richly laden with food was placed at the disposal of the Dead-who sleeps in a coffin full of oil . <P> Finally the high , nasal voice of Chiang Kai-shek in triumphant recital of the last will of Dr. Sun Yatsen , ending ; " Fight on , my fellow workers ! Bring about a People 's Convention for the solution of our national problems and to abolish the unequal treaties with foreign nations ! " <P> Pregnant with significance was the continued harmony existing , last week , between the Nationalist Government and their great , voluntarily subordinate ally : the Christian Marshal , Feng Yu-hsiang , master of the largest personal army in the world . Whether Feng will remain subordinate to the Nationalists , seize power by a coup d ' tat , or quietly wangle* himself into control of their Government is a question only now beginning to be answered . <P> Feng successfully wangled , last month , the resignation of Nationalist Foreign Minister Huang Fu and his replacement by Feng 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference of the Nationalist Marshals in Peking last week Feng Yu-hsiang proposed that " all except the best disciplined " Nationalist soldiers should now be disbanded , since victory has been won . The Christian Marshal 's worst enemies will not deny that his troops are the best disciplined in all China ; and therefore his proposal seemed the week 's Perfect Wangle . <P> <P> *A special symbol was assigned to " the indispensable word wangle " in the diplomatic code of the British Foreign Office , by imperative request of Colonel T. E. ( Revolt in the Desert ) Lawrence ( See Yemen ) .
