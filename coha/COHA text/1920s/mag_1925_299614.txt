Yet , few women have ever risen to lead orchestras . Last week , in Manhattan , one did . Miss Ethel Leginska , famed pianist , composer , conducted the New York Symphony in Carnegie Hall . <P> Trig , bobbed , black-velveted , she waved the baton , now in her right hand , now in her left , worked furiously at the climaxes ; sometimes she shook her fist at the trombones .
