As it must to all wives , a measure of disillusionment came , last week , to Mrs. Stanley Baldwin , wife of the British Prime Minister . Her husband 's rise to head the State may well have seemed to her , pious , devoted , the visible workings of the Higher Power . Tenderhearted , she learned , last week , that some 62 miners had been entombed during the night at Cwm+ Wales , by a mine explosion . Soon Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Baldwin were speeding to Cwm by motor . If the State could further the entrapped miners ' rescue in any way , the presence of Premier Baldwin guaranteed every effort . As the Premier 's limousine entered Cwm , a score of Salvation Army workers were grouped about the fatal pithead singing , " O God , Our Help In Ages Past . <P> " The local Government inspector , J. M. Carey , approached , hat in hand , spoke in low voice to the Premier . The mine was full of poisonous gasses . Rescue work , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered that no one should go down in the mine until the fumes of explosion should be pumped away by the electric ventilators . Any other course was madness , said Inspector Carey , but the wives and families of the entrapped men were getting restless . He could not conscientiously advise the Premier to remain with his wife in that vicinity . . . . <P> Conscious of their good intentions the Baldwins stayed , went among the stricken families . To one Mr. Button , two of whose miner sons were killed by the explosion , Premier Baldwin said : " I have come to see you as man to man-not as Prime Minister . I feel very sorry for you in your great loss . " Meantime Mrs. Baldwin held Mrs. Button 's hand , urged Mrs. Button from the fervor of her own faith to seek consolation in prayer . . . . <P> As the Baldwins returned to their limousine a group of miners and their wives collected in half-hearted fashion . A woman , the wife of a miner still trapped in the mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Murderers ! ! You wo n't let them rescue my Tom . . . you-you rich beasts ! " <P> Affrighted , Mrs. Baldwin clung to the Premier 's arm . Imperturable , he looked at the crowd with level eyes , silently sucked at and puffed his famed pipe . <P> " Traitor ! What about the eight hours law ? " cried a burly miner . All knew that Premier Baldwin had sponsored and seen through the Commons a bill extending the one-time seven-hour miners ' day to eight hours ( TIME , July 12 ) . <P> " What about our men dying now in the mine ? Why do n't you put on a gas mask and go down the pit , Baldwin ? Coward ! Traitor ! Rush him ! Down him and his psalm-singing wife ! " <P> Mrs. Baldwin screamed . Was her conviction shattered then , perhaps - her belief in Mr. Baldwin as an agent of the Higher Power ? She paled . Then Mr. Baldwin took his pipe out of his mouth , nodded to his chauffeur . The starter buzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine 's powerful siren horn the crowd wavered . " Come on ! Down them ! ! " shouted some voices ; but the limousine broke through as one young miner shouted " Back to your hogs , Baldwin ! * You 're lucky to get away ! "
