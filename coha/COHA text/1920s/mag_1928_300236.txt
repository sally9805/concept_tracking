The new peasant-born Prime Minister of Rumania , Dr. Juliu Maniu , who has just ousted onetime Dictator Vintila Bratiano ( TIME , Nov. 19 ) , took characteristic action , last week , as follows : <P> Dismissed every one of the notorious 12,000 Secret Police , who won so many elections for the " House of Bratiano by terroristic methods . <P> Dismissed to their homes all youths who had come up for compulsory military training in 1926 . <P> Ended the " state of siege " and " martial law " which has been maintained since the War in a ring of Rumanian territory 35 miles wide encircling " the country just inside the frontier . But , prudent , the Peasant Prime Minister established a new 10-mile wide zone of " martial law " along the Russo-Rumanian frontier , since most Rumanians fear attack by the Bolshevist " Red Army . " <P> Addressed correspondents thus : " Today is a festival of liberty . The most important factor in liberty is the freedom of the press . Henceforth you are free to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed . " <P> Notorious , of course , was the always stifling and often stupid Bratiano censorship of the Rumanian press .
