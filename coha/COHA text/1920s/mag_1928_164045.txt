Mother Machree . William Fox has rediscovered that " Mother " is the sweetest word at the box office . A month ago he released Four Sons , maternal , Bavarian . This week , he released Mother Machree , an Irish valentine . It tells of Ellen ( Belle Bennett ) , who hears in her little Ballymore cottage that her husband has been killed in a sea tornado . With Brian , her son , she starts for the U. S. , meeting on the way Bozo ( Victor McLaglen ) , a lanky giant , and his harpist brother . The giant loves Ellen , follows her . He joins a circus , and persuades her to be a sideshow freak also . Ellen gives Brian to a school teacher for adoption , and there the lachrymation bursts forth . Years afterward the mother is a friendly charwoman , finally a nurse in a wealthy family . A youth comes courting , confiding to the old nurse his love for her charge . Thus mother and son meet ; padding back and forth in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policeman . War arrives ; the giant takes the boy to war ; they return , the young couple marry ; and Mother Machree and Bozo do also . For no matter what happens this little group of abused Irish stick together to swell the jubilation at the box office . <P> The Smart Set . William Haines is always the play boy , the smart aleck-sometimes in baseball uniform ( Slide , Kelly , Slide ) , sometimes in football paddings ( Brown of Harvard ) , sometimes in the pants of a leather neck ( Tell It To the Marines ) or even dressed as a cadet ( West Point ) . This time he is a polo grandstand player . Here Actor Haines , rich man 's son . flirts with Constance Howard , presses undesired kisses on her , steals her slippers at a dance , throws his shoes in the soup at a Park Avenue dinner party , salts and eats the carnations . None the less , this objectionable young man has a mount on the U. S. polo team . In the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knocks the winning goal , ending his baroque antics , closing a silly picture . <P> Finders Keepers . She was the godmother of the regiment , but the daughter of the regiment 's Colonel . He was only a buck private . She flirted with the officers . He peeled potatoes for them . The pair loved . To reach him for a hurried marriage ceremony before the outfit sailed for France , she put her slim young legs into a soldier 's uniform , but forgot the belt . When the pants slipped , the audience squealed . Doughboys may have shooting pains when they see the army scenes , but picture patrons will deem eye-worthy this implausible , happy comedy with Laura La Plante , pretty , funny , spontaneous as a sneeze . <P> If I Were Single . A sportive and decorative quartet of players make gay this comedy of a gentleman who picks yellow buttercups outside the marital fence . Ted ( Conrad Nagel ) and May ( May McAvoy ) were married only a year when a brunette ( Myrna Loy ) crinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vows . The brunette borrowed his cigaret lighter , a present from his wife , and May discovers all . Alarmed , she telephones a mauve musician ( Andre Beranger ) and the two slip under the lap robes of the car in which the philandering pair are taking a speedy moonlight , midnight drive .
