The possibility of the inheritance of acquired characteristics - that bone of contention around which so much of evolutionary conflict has raged for 100 years-has received new support from the work of Professor Paul Kammerer , of the University of Vienna , who has just demonstrated his findings before the Cambridge University Society of Natural History . The theory , first developed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck ( 1744-1829 ) , who held that changes in the individual due to altered needs and habits are passed on to descendants ( e. g. , the neck of the giraffe is long because its ancestors had to stretch to reach the foliage ) , was taken over in part by Darwin , who believed it to be one of the methods through which natural selection operates . Biologists then reacted from this doctrine until the opposite extreme was reached in August Weismann , whose theory that the germ-plasm of each generation is handed on and remains distinct from the body cells , logically excludes the transmission of acquired traits . Weismannism has held the field since 1890 and still dominates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been on fire salamanders with black and yellow spots . When taken from their natural habitat to yellow soil , they gradually lost their black color , and their offspring were all yellow . Kammerer also grew eyes in the sightless newt , which requires no eyes because it lives in greenish water depths . These results have been called in question by many biologists who claim that they are not instances of true inheritance , but merely of nutritive or chemical influences on the germ cells , the possibility of which is readily admitted . <P> The English scientists are apparently convinced , however . William Bateson , former professor of biology at Cambridge , and a confirmed Weismannist , visited Vienna and later made a public attack on Kammerer 's theory . In the interest of fair play , 50 Cambridge professors subscribed money to bring Kammerer to England for a hearing . He had worked unrecognized for 20 years , and since the war his salary has been approximately $150 a year .
