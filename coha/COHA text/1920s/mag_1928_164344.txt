One hundred potent citizens of Milan-bankers , industrialists and men of science - sat down to luncheon , with a U. S. guest of honor who piqued their curiosity . He was , they understood , a financier whose unusual hobby is to acquire control of clean , smart , pedigreed industries . At present Mr. Aldred and his associates are the bankers for the firms which produce razors stamped " Gillette , " silverware with the venerable Manhattan hall mark " Gorham , " and U.S.-made motor cars bearing the nameplate " Rolls-Royce . " Clearly this guest , this Signor John E. Aldred , was worthy of Italian observation . Especially so , because today the Manhattan financial house of J. E. Aldred is handling issues of dollar bonds totalling some $30,000,000 , on the basis of which extensive expansion of the Italian hydroelectric industry is taking place . <P> To sense the projects envisioned before the luncheon in Milan , last week , interested observers turned to a report on the Italian hydro-electric industry which was issued recently by Signor Giacinto Motta , managing director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Italians , namely the Edison General Italian Electric Co. of Milan . Brisk and explicit , Signor Motta keynotes thus : <P> 1 ) Italian current consumption has doubled within the past seven years , and now stands at an annual consumption of some eight thousand millions of kilowatt hours. * <P> 2 ) The total investment made thus far in Italian hydro-electric companies is roughly equivalent to half a billion dollars , a sum which would have to be doubled to attain " utilization of all Italy 's hydro-electric resources . " <P> 3 ) The new power plants must include not only hydro-electric but steam-driven generators . " We must mix the white coal water power with the black coal thermic power , " declares Signor Motta , " to make up for the deficiency of water power in years of minimum rain fall . " <P> 4 ) The Italian electrical industry is grouped about 12 major holding corporations , of which the Edison Company of Signor Motta in Milan is the largest , with the Hydro-Electric Company of Piedmont second and producing 17% of Italy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the 100 luncheon auditors of Financier Aldred , in Milan last week , they displayed a rational approval of his address covering Italo-U . S. co-operation in developing Italian power potentialities . <P> Naturally Mr. Aldred did not stress that his great competitor in the placing of Italian electric power securities is the house of Blair &; Co. , of Manhattan , who are handling more than $50,000,000 of such paper . <P> The Aldred interests are notably fostering a $10,000,000 bond issue for the Edison company of Milan and a $6,000,000 issue for the Adamello General Electric Co. operating throughout Lombardy . Not thus concentrated in Northern Italy are the operations of Blair &; Co. who are financing a whole series of companies in Northern , Central and Southern Italy . Most notable , of course , is their issue for the Hydro-Electric Company of Piedmont , the S. I. P. ( Societa Idroelettrica Peidmonte ) , famed because it is controlled by Il Duce 's Finance Minister Count Giuseppe Volpi.                   @ @
