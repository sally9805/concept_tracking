" Not a line or a word , an innuendo or a criticism from cover to cover , that can offend or displease . " <P> That is the new editorial policy of The Club-Fellow &; Washington Mirror ( society weekly ) , as announced by its new owners and Editor H. Gordon Duval , a fortnight ago . <P> Last week , searching for something inoffensive and pleasing , Club-Fellow found and published the following : <P> " Washington will talk about the President and Mrs. Coolidge . Rumors run rife that the President and the First Lady are estranged since he acted so badly to her before the newspapermen on several occasions while in the West last summer . <P> " Gossip even says that Mrs. Coolidge does not go out at night now because she does not wish to accompany the President . The truth , however , is that Mrs. Coolidge 's attack of grippe so weakened her that she is forced to be most careful and eschew night-time visiting . " <P> Citizens could well imagine the pleasure of President and Mrs. Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
