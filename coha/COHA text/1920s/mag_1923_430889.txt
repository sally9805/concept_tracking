At the end of the nineteenth century our American playwrights could be counted on the fingers of both hands . To-day there are one hundred and ninety-five members of the Dramatists ' Guild of the Authors ' League of America , each of whom has had at least one play produced professionally ; and this body does not , by any means , include all the men and women in this country who are actually earning their living by writing for the stage . In 1900 there were only about twenty first-class theaters in New York , and the theater season was restricted to about thirtyfive weeks of the calendar year ; but now , in 1923 , there are approximately sixty firstclass theaters in the region of Broadway that endeavor to keep their doors open throughout the entire fifty-two weeks of the year . This unprecedented expansion of our theater has offered an unprecedented opportunity to our native playwrights ; and the field for their endeavor was further widened by other alterations in the general theatric situation which occurred about the beginning of the twentieth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Richard Mansfield , who died in 1907 , were not at all interested in the encouragement of new dramatic authorship ; but , during the decade of the eighteen-nineties , the theater was quietly but swiftly renovated by one of those periodic revolutions that occur every now and then in the history of the drama , a revolution that resulted in a shift of emphasis from the actor to the author as the proper focus of attention in the theater . Thus , when the great actors of the old school died away and left no discernible successors , the hiatus was filled not by calling for new actors , but by calling for new authors , to keep the theater going . Because of this condition , the American dramatist can no longer complain that the dice are cogged against him . But , now that our native playwrights have their opportunity , what have they done with it ? Have they conquered our stage , or have they merely captured a tactical post behind the footlights ?  | In the immediate , time-serving sense , our native playwrights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scores of our home-made American plays have emphatically pleased the public ; and dozens of these compositions have earned fortunes for their authors . Also , in the artistic ? as distinct from the commercial ? sense , our new playwrights have succeeded signally in achieving their primary aim of providing the public with wholesome entertainment , and have managed also to reveal many glimpses of life which are both new and true . But should we , therefore , be justified in claiming that we have already established an American Drama , in the same strict sense of words that we employ when we refer to the French Drama , or the Norwegian Drama , or even the British Drama ? If a messenger from Mars should be dropped into the theater district of New York City and should suddenly ask us to name our accredited American dramatists of the present period , we should probably mention first Mr. Augustus Thomas , for the fact is that Mr. Thomas is , at this day , the one indubitable American dramatist , in the proper sense of the word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of Eugene O'Neill , who has already won , on two occasions , the Pulitzer prize for the best American play of the year . The word " dramatist " signifies something more and something different than the word " playwright . " A playwright is a maker of plays ; but a dramatist is a playwright who teaches while he entertains , and adds to the sum total of current thought by evolving , formulating , and expounding many truths that have lain latent and unexpressed in the subconsciousness of the general public . He must be not a craftsman only , but a seer also not a follower merely , but a leader as well ; he must master the stage as a medium of expression , but he must also use it to express enlivening ideas . In this high sense , JIr . Thomas remains to this moment our only living dramatist , with the possible exception of the gifted Mr. Sheldon and the even more promising Mr. O'Neill . In justice to Eugene Walter , it should perhaps be said that when he suddenly flared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " The Easiest Way " he earned a right to  | be regarded as a veritable dramatist ; but , unfortunately , the years that have elapsed since those efforts have brought no fulfilment of the early promise . Perhaps our greatest difficulty in the matter of developing a worthy native drama is the fact that the large American public has not yet learned to make any distinction between the drama and the theater , between the art of the dramatist and the craft of the playwright . Our public is enormously interested in the theater ; but , considered as a whole , it does not seem to be particularly interested in the drama . Our public flocks to the theater to see " a good show , " but it does not care whether the " good show " is a contribution to the drama . We can find no better definition of the purpose of the drama , as distinguished from other types of theatric entertainment , than a formula which was set forth , several years ago , by the English playwright Mr. Henry Arthur Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama is , first , to represent life and , secondly , to interpret life in terms of the contemporary stage . Consequently , in attempting a critical appraisal of any current play , we should first inquire whether the author has set forth a truthful representation of life , and should , secondly , inquire whether the author has also revealed a wise interpretation of life . A play that passes the second test may logically be regarded as a great drama ; but a play that does not pass either of these  | tests is not a work of dramatic art , but simply a theatrical entertainment . Judged by these high standards , our American Drama still lags far behind our American Theater . Our theater is now the most efficient , the most successful , the most cosmopolitan , and , considered all in all , the most brilliant of all the theaters of the modern world ; but our drama remains still hoping for an imagined future . It is mainly in view of these considerations that Mr. David Belasco , whose career has been almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be acclaimed not only as one of the most outstanding but also as one of the most definitive figures in our theater . In the decade of the eighteen-nineties , he made several contributions to the American drama of that period , most of which were written in collaboration with the late H. C. de Mille ; and since the dawning of the twentieth century he has , more or less spasmodically , continued his activities as a playwright . His most important pieces are " The Heart of Maryland , " a play of the Civil War ; " The Darling of the Gods , " an extraordinarily effective Japanese drama in which a note of poetry was struck again and again ; " The Return of Peter Grimm , " written in collaboration with Cecil B. de Mille ; " The Girl of the Golden West ; " and the skilful dramatization of " Madame Butterfly , " a  | story by John Luther Long . But , in launching these and other pieces , Mr. Belasco has been less interested in the art of authorship than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now appear unfair to say that this so-called " wizard " of the theater is more notable for his comprehension of the craft of effective production than for his apprehension of the great art of the drama . Our younger American playwrights may be praised whole-heartedly for their adventurous and surprisingly successful excursions into new regions of dramatic technique . For instance , Roi Cooper Megrue , in " Under Cover , " was the first playwright in the world to upset the ancient theory that a dramatic author can never carry a play to success by keeping a secret from his audience until the latest moments of the final act ; and Elmer L. Rice , in " On Trial , " was the first playwright to demonstrate the practicability of telling a story on the stage through the backward-pointed medium of a pattern of reverted time . But these adventurous experiments had been already stimulated by the inspiring example of George M. Cohan . By his  | skilful dramatization of " Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford " Mr. Cohan delivered a new formula to the American stage ; and became , unwittingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more ingenious dramatization of " Seven Keys to Baldpate " this same theatric craftsman erected an altogether new standard of technique for the emulation of the cleverest playwrights in America . Winchell Smith has gathered a large fortune by writing , or helping to write , such signally successful plays as " The Fortune Hunter , " " Turn to the Right , " and " Lightnin ' . " The popular acceptance of these homely but ingenious entertainments is an admitted fact ; but our fabled messenger from Mars might still ask whether these entertaining compositions should be regarded as permanent contributions to American Drama . If the verdict of the box office were the only test of dramatic merit , Avery Hopwood would have to be crowned as the prince of our contemporary playwrights , for he has confessed that he has already earned more than a million dollars in royalties from his various plays . Most of these have been farces , like " Fair and Warmer , " in which he has displayed deftness as a skater over thin ice , but several of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superlatively popular mystery play which he concocted in collaboration with Mary Roberts Rinehart . Our native playwrights , at the present time , often equal or excel their European competitors in farce and melodrama . But our authors rarely attempt tragedy , and they seldom succeed on the lofty level of high comedy . Eugene O'Neill is almost our only tragic dramatist ; and the fact should carefully be noted in his case that his inspiration is not at all derived from the current doings of the theater district in New York , but from a vivid reminiscence of a stinging contact with life itself in  | those years when , as a runaway from college , he roamed the oceans of the world as a seaman . Jesse Lynch Williams , one of our native living playwrights , has risen nearest to the mark of success in the difficult and delicate task of writing comedy , with his brilliant satire called " Why Marry ? " which won the Pulitzer prize , and with his more recent companion piece entitled " Why Not ? " A delightfully delicate but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originated and developed with considerable success by Clare Kummer ; and James Forbes , who began his career with nothing more than an amplified vaudeville skit , entitled " The Chorus Lady , " has grown in stature through the composition of such clever pieces of reporting as " The Traveling Salesman , " until , in " The Famous Mrs. Fair , " he has succeeded in setting before the public a veritable comedy . Other shoulders upon which at least a little shred of the mantle of Clyde Fitch appears to have descended are those of A. E. Thomas , Thompson Buchanan , and Rachel Crothers . Mr. Thomas is notable for his harmonic combinations of the closely related moods of sentiment and humor , appearing at his best in such charming compositions as " The Rainbow , " " Just Suppose , " and " Come Out of the Kitchen . " Mr. Buchanan 's mood is more brittle and more cynical : it is revealed most brilliantly in " A Woman 's Way . " Miss Crothers is particularly notable because her dialogue is the most natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This verdict was delivered to me by Bronson Howard , directly after he had attended a performance of " The Three of Us . " Perhaps the merit that has been displayed by our younger American playwrights is the remarkable freshness , vividness , and accuracy of their observation of many interesting aspects of American life and character . They have clear and eager eyes for what is going on about them , but not a deeply penetrating vision . They have not yet mastered and revealed an understanding of American life . Understanding may be defined as apprehension plus comprehension . Our native playwrights evidence the former ; but they do not , as a rule , reveal the latter . Yet exceptions to this summary verdict must certainly be noted in favor of such authors as Mr. Frank Craven , who wrote The First Year , " and Miss Zona Gale , who wrote " Miss Lulu Bett , " which won the Pulitzer prize . These plays were both profoundly  | truthful in their intimate delineation of homely and familiar characters . Booth Tarkington has written many plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Man From Home , " which was concocted in collaboration with Mr. Harry Leon Wilson , and the comedy " Clarence , " a veracious and highly humorous chronicle of life in a typical American family . Montague Glass , with no great gifts for the theater , has achieved a success behind the footlights by virtue of his unique ability in creating two typical and ingratiating characters ? the pugnacious Perlmutter and the long-suffering Potash , who , perfectly impersonated , have reappeared in play after play , to the delight of an apparently indefatigable public . The most notable endowment of many of our American playwrights is a native gift for story telling . Under this heading might be mentioned such writers as Channing Pollock , the late Charles Klein , Harvey O'Higgins and Miss Harriet Ford , Edgar Selwyn , Miss Margaret Mayo , William C. de Mille , Porter Emerson Browne , George Middleton , Miss Zoe Akins , and others . There are ample indications that our younger American playwrights , or their followers in the succeeding generation , will be able to lift our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor to interest or amuse the public of the moment , to the loftier level of a serious endeavor to deliver a lasting contribution to the Drama of the World .  |
