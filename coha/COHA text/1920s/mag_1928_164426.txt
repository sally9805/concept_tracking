An airplane chauffeur , costumed in trim livery , was retained last fortnight by Mary du Cauroy , 62 , Duchess of Bedford . Recently she purchased a small , conveniently maneuverable " Moth " airplane , and transformed into a landing field the lawn in front of her home , Woburn Abbey , Bedfordshire . The chauffeur is the final touch . He now pilots Her Grace back and forth to London , where she is busily engaged in performing electro-physical researches . <P> Friends of the dynamic and air conscious duchess recall that she recently passed a vacation in Spain , dashing after mountain eagles in her plane . Not demented , she was merely seeking scientific data upon the flying characteristics of eagles and buzzards .
