The Fountain . Eugene O'Neill is generally pointed at with pride as the foremost dramatist in America . He works with color , feeling , fear , with realism and occasionally with bitterness . He has an uncanny gift of breathing life into his pen puppets . He is certainly a genius . <P> Accordingly when Mr. O'Neill turned for the first time in his life to romance , many people trooped wide-eyed to the little Greenwich Village Theatre . It had long been known that this play of his was based on the magnificent theme of Ponce de Leon and his search for eternal youth . Many people went away a trifle disappointed . The Fountain is a beautiful poem and often a tiresome play . <P> Robert Edmond Jones , who bows only to Norman-Bel Geddes as a native creator of stage pictures , did the settings . There were many of them and they were of surpassing beauty . There were many moments in the play when the audience sat spellbound by the magnificence of the writing . The acting of Walter Huston in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical show this season , with the possible exceptions of the extravagant Sunny and the cherished Chariot 's Revue , has excited more blissful anticipation than this return of the Marx Brothers . These four ingenious gentlemen first sprang into magnificent prominence two years ago with a noisy , nondescript and stunningly hilarious adventure called I 'll Say She Is . Whereupon Irving Berlin gathered them unto himself and agreed to write music for their next show ; George S. Kaufman ( Merton ; Beggar on Horseback ; The Butter and Egg Man ) was summoned to write the book ; and producer Sam H. Harris released $100,000 or so into circulation to pay for costumes , settings , subordinates . From this fertile pasture The Cocoanuts grew . <P> Mr. Kaufman conceived the idea that things in Florida had gone far enough . They must be kidded . Therefore he put his plot out in the sunshine and set the Marxes to splashing around in it . Hotels , real estate and climate are treated with extreme irreverence . Somewhere in the first act there is a diamond robbery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxes contribute scene after scene of rattle-brained revelry . Groucho ( with the cigar ) and Harpo ( he says nothing ) are the principal disturbances . Mr. Berlin has contributed two excellent tunes , " A Little Bungalow " and " Florida , " and Mr. Harris brilliant masses of costume and scenery . And the result of all this is that for some little time you will probably encounter considerable difficulty in buying tickets . <P> The School for Scandal . The all-star touring company presenting Sheridan 's play stopped off in Manhattan for a one-night stand and invited an imposing list of notables to witness its magnificence . In the lower boxes were Ethel Barrymore , Walter Hampden , Mrs. Samuel Insull ( now playing Lady Teazle elsewhere ) , Laurette Taylor . All this was rather gorgeous but detracted somewhat from the events on the stage . The events were somewhat at fault themselves and the evening was not conspicuously satisfactory .
