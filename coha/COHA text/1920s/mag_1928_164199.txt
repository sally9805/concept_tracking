Editors of Republican newspapers pointed with pride last week to " honest dignity " in Nominee Hoover . When his train paused in Montello , Nev. , a woman thrust her child upwards to be kissed . The Nominee took the child and held it , but said : " I will kiss no babies for publication . " <P> The pride-pointing Republican editors gave Nominee Hoover credit for something new in politics . But , as a matter of fact- . A few days before the Hoover-Baby incident , Nominee Smith had been asked by press photographers at Albany to pose in the act of laying bricks . Nominee Smith refused and said : " I ca n't lay bricks , and any bricklayer that saw it would know I could n't . That 's a baloney* picture and I 'm not going to stand for any baloney pictures in this campaign . " <P> Democratic editors pointed with pride and credited their Nominee with this new thing in politics . But , as a matter of fact- <P> Two weeks priorto both the Hoover-Baby and Smith-Baloney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , R. I. , where he was resting and yachting , and asked to pose for press cameras in the act of dirt-farming . Nominee Curtis ' reply was : " You 've got to take me as I am . I 'm not farming " ( TIME , July 9 ) . <P> Hasty editors might , from the above record , assign to Nominee Curtis the credit for eliminating " baloney pictures " from the 1928 campaign . But no editor would do so who is a journalist before he is a partisan . Because , as a matter of fact- It seems indisputable that the underlying cause for this year 's anti-baloney epidemic among politicians lies not in the politicians ' honest hearts , but in the alert U. S. press , whose newsgatherers , observers , commentators and editors have spent many years trying to divest U. S. politics and politicos of the more obvious political shams and absurdities . Journalism , having sown well the seeds of satire , itself deserves credit for making " baloney " forbidden fruit . <P> <P> *Sidewalk slang for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
