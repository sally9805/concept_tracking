txt Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg became the great idol of the German People in 7914 by his victories over the Russians at Tannenberg and the Masarian Lakes , and has been their idol without Interruption ever sine , . He was the only great war figure who did not fall into disfavor after the war . Hindenburg kept out of pchties and lived the life of a retired so.dier , but every time he appearea in public in Germany , he threw everybody else in eclipse . Big popular demonstrations have greeted him on every trip he has made from his home . In the thousands of account ? . that have been printed concerning Hindenburg , two opposing views have been taken of him . One is that he is the Incarnation of wisdom , strength and disinterestedness . The other is that he is a stuffed figure who was placed on a pedestal by luck and has been kept there oy luck . It used to be universa2y thought that Hindenburg wgs a great automaton and that the engineer inside cv , ie - worked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , Ludendorff 's enterprises have all been lamentable failures , while Hindenburg has been all that he ever was , indicating that perhaps Hindenburg was . no  --  c than a figurehead in the Hindenburg-Ludendorff partnership during the war . Called a Wotan and a Thor . In addition to his prestige as a soldier , there are many qualities in Hindenburg which have made their appeal to the German people . In the first place , he looks like one of the old Teutonic gods . The Kaiser called him a modern Wotan . Others have called him a Thor . With the massive , stern and dignified features of a Norse god , he has united the habits and ways of an ordinary German . For birthday presents they sent him from all parts of German warehouses of sausages , sauerkraut and barrels of ? beer . He is loyal to the old ways , loyal to the old religion and personally loyal to the House of Hohenzollern , although politically he has declared against a return of a monarchy . Had he tiled at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that age he was just one of many Generals who had been retired on account of age . His career had apparently come to an end in 1901 , when he was placed on the retired list with the rank of General and with the nickname of the " Old Man of the Lakes " because he was supposed to be a ? little cracked on the subject of the Blasurian Lakes . He tried to make everybody believe that the war with Russia , when it came , would be fought out amid the marshes of East Prussia , ' and he spent most of his leisure in the army , and after his retirement working out schemes on paper for trapping the invading Russians . When the war came , he had been retired seven years and had not been listed for recall . But in September , to save France , Russia threw Rennenltampf and Samsonoff into East Prussia with half-prepared armies . There was a panic throughout Germarty . Hindenburg was remembered as the great authority on the terrain where the fight to save Germany must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army of the East and Ludendorff was made his Quartermaster . Between them they tangled up the Rassians in the Intricate marsh country . enveloped them and destroyed the invading force in a great and clean-cut victory , which was not equaled again during the war . Whether Ludendorff or Hindenburg deserves the credit ? for accomplishing this feat is still uncertain . in his book after the war Hindenburg described his relations with Ludendorff as those of -a happy marriage , " and said that he gave always " free scope to the intellectual powers , the almost superhuman capacity for work " of Ludendorff ; while Ludendorff wrote that from Tannenburg to the armistice Hindenburg " always agreed with my views and approved my draft orders . " But the German people chose for their idol the man who looked like a Norse god . On the eastern front blow after blow was struck with success in the name of Hindenburg , while the Germans were held to a draw on the west front . The prestige of Hindenburg became so towering that in 1916 he superseded Falkenhayn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , with none over him but the Kaiser . His first big decision , according ; to Hindenburg 's own account in his reminiacences , was to break off the battle for Verdun . " The battle there . " he said , " exhausted our forces like an open wound . : Moreover , it was obvious that in any case the enterprise had become hopeless and that for us to persevere with it would coat us greater losses than those , we were able to Inflict on the enc  --  a. - . Our forward zone was at all points exposed to the flanking fire of superior hostile artillery . " on military grounds Hindenburg- said that he would have withdrawn his troops from the ground gained , but the home situation made It impossible to take such a step without creating consternation . Hindenburg favored the remorseless U-boat warfare and wrote of it as follows in " Out of My Life ' " In view of ' the fateful conclusion of the war . it has been suggested that the declaration of the unrestricted U-boat campaign was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a condemnation of our decision on political , military and even ethical grounds . It ignores the fact that practically all critical decisions , certainly not military decisions only , always involve a heavy risk . Indeed , the greatness of an action is mainly to be appreciated and measured by the question whether much was at stake . " When a commander on the battlefield throws in his lam reserves he is only doing what his country rightly demands of him . Ile accepts full responsibility and finds the courage to take the last decisive step without which victory can not be won . A commander who can not or will not stake his last resources for the sake of victory it committing a crime toward his own people . If his blow fails , he is certain to have the curses and scorn of the weaklings and cowards upon his head ! " That is always the fate of soldiers To act on absolutely safe calculations or win laurels which are not dependent on courage to take responsibility is to banish the very elements of greatness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old policy of holding the front lines in strength which had cost so heavily during allied bombardment on the Somme must be abandoned as well as the system of huge underground shelters in the front lines , which had enabled Nivelle to make heavy captures of prisoners . Instead he wanted a " fortified zone , " a " strongly knotted mesh " of positions . This was the origin of the new style of trenches , characterized by pillboxes and lightly held front.lines with an interwoven system further back which caused the Allies to give the name " Hindenburg line " to what the Germans called the " Siegfried line , " the new positions to which the German centre in France fell hack in February , 1917 . Hindenburg , who had said he would never shorten his line , had shortened it ; and it was said that it was by his personal order that the country abandoned was so completely devastated . His policy worked welt as was shown by the German attack in March , 191S , and it had shown that Hindenburg was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gave to the Berlin correspondent of the Vanguardia of Darc  --  lona an interview In which he expressed the belief that American aid " would not amount to much . " " Gold is no longer the most important factor in conducting wars , " he said , and expressed confidence that the submarines would prevent the shipment of any considerable American army . At the same time he said that so far as he could judge the American people dia not want war , but that ' aVilson and his business friends had to go to war to rescue the cnaangered capital they had invested . " In December , 1017. he told his favorite correspondent . Dr. Paul Goldman of the Vienna Neue Frei- Presse , that America would not ship any appreciable part of her army to Europe for fear of ' leaving the land without protection in case Japan should suddenly show an inclination to clear off her old score with America . " In the political agitation of 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff played a considerable , and indeed apparently a derisive , part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to the unrestriete ? submarine war of the extremists . and the year 's course showed them gradually drifting into the camp of the starkest Pan-German annexationists . The Great Offensive of 1918 . Meanwhile Russia had gone to pieces and Germany was taking in the East as much as she could chew at each Preparations were being made for the great offensive in the West : and in January of 1018 Hindenburg , according , to report , told a gathering of thirtya German editors that he would be in Paris by April 1 . However this may be , he was at the front with Ludendorff and the Kaiser when the offensive began . And whether or not he s was satisfied with it . his expressions became more and more truculent . In the beginning of the war he had held aloof from politics and had seemed to be moderately inclined . But in April of 1915 the voice of Hindenburg was rough and forthright . He wired to the Reichstag leaders in that month that he hoped they would decide for the " strong German peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millionaires ; " not a soft-peace , " said Hindenburg , " an honorable peace by the sword . " And to make it plain that this peace was not to be one of empty and unprofitable honor he added in a message to a congress of Chambers of commerce that that sort of peace would " assure fresh prosperity for commerce and industry . " Hindenburg 's views on war and politics present little of distinction , as correspondents have recorded them . To his ? Pet on The Neue Prete Presse he said in November , 1916. that Great Britain , Italy and Serbia were the " chief sinners " against the German-AustrianHungarian bloc and for the purposes of publicity . at least , lie kept up the fiction of England 's responsibility for the war long atter most Germans had ceased to be exercised about how it started . In December of that same year he said that he had " a personal antipathy toward England for plotting this war ; England alone was the wire puller . " To a NEW TORE TIMES correspondent in February . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that but for the development of railroad administration by American genius his victories would have been impossible . This unintentional American contribution to Germany , he said , more than outweighed all the American shipments of munitions to the Allies , though to other Americans later he spoke very bitterly of these . A story told of hint early in the war was that in conversation with his staff the suoject once turned to signs of nervousness . One man admitted that he showed - nervousness in one way and another , and the Field Marshal confessed that when he was nervous he always whistled . - But we have never heard you whistle , " said his officers . " You have never seen me nervous . " said iHndenburg . " When the fire will not burn , witen the servant slams the door , then 1 . am nervous : but in war what is there to be nervous about ? " It was again to . the Neue Frele Presse correspondent that Hindenburg said that after the war he would go ocacefully back to his home in Hanaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaiser fled to Holland it has been reported that Hindenburg was plotting to bring him back . The old soldier has denied that he favored such adventures . He ceased to be a firebreather In 191$ . In his speeches he has urged Germans to banish the thought of war from their minds and to try to build their future solely by German industry . While he was being urged to run as the Monarchist candidate for President of Germany the report was broadcast throughout the world that the ex-Kaiser had urged Hindenburg to run . This was denied by the Kaiser in what was said to be the only public statement which he has made since his flight from Germany . His Platform as Candidate . Hindenburg 's platform was summarized in the following appeal to the German people which he made fourteen days ago : " German People : Patriotic Germans of every district and elan have nominated me for the highest office in the Fatherland . I follow this call , after earnest meditation , ; in fidelity to my country . " my life is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did my duty during Germany 's bitterest period . if this duty calls me to act on constitutional grounds , without regard to party , person , origin or calling , as President , 1 shall not be found wanting . " As a soldier I had the entire nation in mind , not a party . Parties are necessary in a parliamentary-ruled State , but your highest Executive must stand above parties and rule for every German , independent of them , " I have never lost my faith in the German people and God 's help . I am no longer young enough to believe in sudden chafiges of affairs . " No war . no Insurrection within Germany , can free our divided nation , fettered . I am sorry to say , by discord . It will require a long period of quiet , peaceful work . The first necessary reforms are ridding the nation of those politicians who make politics a business . No State can prosper without order and Cleanliness of living . The President is especially called upon to exalt holiness " As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution . Herr Ebert never forgot that he came from the ranks of Social Democratic workers , so no one can demand that I give up my political beliefs . I hold the same belief as the honored Dr. Jarres , that not the form of Government but the spirit which governs is important . " I extend my hand to every German who thinks of the nation , who protects from within and without the dignity of the German name and who desires social peace , and beg him ' help to resurrect our Fatherland . ' " When he was asked during the campaign what he regarded as the basis for an ideal security compact , 1-lindenburg said : " I consider it very difficult to find measures of a guarantee nature which could really compel all nations to adopt a moral policy in State affairs . I should certainly be very happy if it should come to pass in my old age that the policy of nation 's were determined by sound common sense . But we are not that far as yet . " The Field Mancha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's international financial position , as the following questiops and answers indicate : Question ? " Would the fact that the Right Bloc in mainly under the leadership of **26;527;TOOLONG circles endanger Germany 's international financial interests In the event of the Right Bloc 's victory at the polls ? " Answer ? ' " ro begin with , it is not true that my candidacy has a partisan political character , As for the rest , I am eonvineed , and have positive data for my opinion , that financial world problems as they relate to Germany have nothing whatever to do with the election of the nation 's head . " Von Ilinderhorg expressed the opinion that Nationalist circles would not be able to exert a menacing influence upon his candidacy . when he was reminded that such a danger was feared in many quarters . " I am enough of a man , " he observed . " to shoilder responsibility myself and make my own decisions . That is what I used to do as a soldier . " To the question as to whether he believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied : " I am a believing Christian , and I desii'e that Germany 's affairs shall be conducted in a Christian spirit . " The final ' question was : " Is a momrchial State more conducive than a republican - to advance personal discipline . law and order and stable condiis the Field Marshal replied : tioTnos  --  tih ' " It does not depend on the form of State , but rather on there being personalities at the head whom one respects and who , through their authority , insure the conclusion of the formal intered v Marshal von Hindenburg 's atten ? A . ter tion was directed to a statement in a Berlin daily newspapers that the former Crown Prince intended to call on him and that an impressive reception had bean planned . Von Hindenburg burst into a hearty laugh and said he considered it the best joke of the season , and flatly denied the truth of the story . Hindenburg was born in 18.17 at Posen .

( hiring the talk of prosecuting the Kaiser as the man guilty of causing the war , Hindenburg offered to stand trial himself as a substitute for the Emperor .
