It is known in France how to honor even the greatest of heroes , not by many words , but with a few deeds less cheap . During the two days and nights that Marshal Ferdinand Foch lay in state , last week-beneath the Emperor Napoleon 's tremendous Arch of Triumph-the government suppressed and darkened every electric sign which might have profaned the scene . As thousands and tens of thousands filed past the bier , all night long the only light was that from funeral torches and the blue " Sacred Flame " which burns eternally beneath the Arch for the Unknown Soldier . <P> Men had sweated with pick and shovel , earlier in the week , uprooting all the police " safety islands " in the boulevards along which the cortege would pass . On his last ride the supreme generalissimo must swerve neither to right nor left , and so the ugly " islands " were uprooted , and straight down the centre of the long ribbons of asphalt passed Ferdinand Foch . <P> He had not so much loved as delighted in children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reserved pour les enfants des soldats de La Grande Armee . Alongside the children on other terraces were les blesses , crippled , blinded perhaps , but every man in shining uniform , rigid and silent as they gave the Last Salute , many with streaming eyes . <P> For the first time the President of the Republic-just now M. Gaston Doumergue-chose to ignore the inflexible protocol which decrees that the Head of the State does not follow the corpse of a citizen . For the first time the King of the Belgians-tall , chivalrous , heroic Albert I- came to Paris in the simple quality of general , kissed the hand of Mme. La Marchale Foch , looked for the last time on the Supreme Generalissimo , whose orders even His Majesty had obeyed as a subordinate , and returned to Brussels after only three hours in the French capital . <P> Excepting only the Unknown Soldier , the last hero to lie beneath the Arc de Triomphe up to last week was Victor Hugo , 43 years ago . The emotion of Frenchmen was keyed to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputies-men chosen for no other quality than their incorruptible honor-majestically lied when the Communist Deputies voted against a bill granting $12,000 to defray the expenses of the funeral . Though every Communist who had thus voted rose and blatantly proclaimed the fact , the official count showed that the bill had passed unanimously , and the President of the Chamber refused to entertain any appeal against the falsehood.
