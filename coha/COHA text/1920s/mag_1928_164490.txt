The smart set of Des Moines ( pop . 148,900 ) , biggest city in Iowa , often amuse themselves with a parlor game : a modern variation of famed tiddledywinks . An ashtray is placed on the floor . The players ( any number from two to eight ) , equipped with dimes and quarters , squat . In turn , they use their quarters to try to flick their dimes into the ashtray in a graceful arc . It is a game requiring firm thumbs , keen eyes . It was invented by that skillful player , John Cowles , 29 , who is to Des Moines what a dynamo is to a powerhouse . <P> Young Mr. Cowles and his father , Gardner Cowles , have a monopoly of the newspaper business in Des Moines . Their papers , Register ( morning and Sunday ) and Tribune-Capital ( evening ) , too big for Des Moines , circulate through all Iowa . They are read by more inhabitants of the state where the tall corn grows than any other publications , except possibly the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation from Harvard in 1921 , young Mr. Cowles has gradually taken over the direction of the two newspapers that his father built up with various consolidations . He has given them a distinctly metropolitan aroma , made their circulations soar , increased subscription rates . For he believes that " the larger the proportion of its revenue a successful newspaper receives from its readers the stronger is that newspaper 's position . " <P> Behind his amiable poker-face-and he is one of the better poker players of Des Moines and Manhattan-young Mr. Cowles masks his dynamic qualities . When asked " what 's up ? " he replies casually : " Not much . " Next day , he is apt to buy a newspaper or an airplane . <P> He did buy an airplane and , last week , it was delivered to his pilot by the Fairchild Aviation Corp . of Farmingdale , Long Island. * The plane is to be used by the Register and Tribune-Capital to get news and pictures , to promote aviation in Iowa . It has an enclosed cabin of six-passenger capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be folded , a Wright Whirlwind motor with maximum speed of 120 m.p.h . Readers of the Register and Tribune-Capital were offered $100 in prizes to suggest a name for the plane . <P> It is significant that the airplane , instrument of swiftest progress , was purchased by a " 24-hour newspaper " ( morning and evening combination ) and the only newspaper in its city . It is to be used as part of the regular equipment , not as a stunting device to outdo , for the moment , a competitor . <P> Newspapers throughout the land are becoming fewer and fewer . Many shrewd publishers believe that ultimately there will be only one newspaper in each city of less than 1,000,000 population , but that it will be no less progressive for lack of direct competition . Rather , it will reach out to get the last possible reader in its city and in the smaller surrounding towns . <P> <P> * The Fairchild firm manufactures an average of one airplane a day , including luxurious passenger planes and sporting flying boats .
