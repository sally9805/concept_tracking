President Harding advocated it , President Coolidge endorsed it , and Senator Lodge delayed it-that has been the approximate history of the proposal that the U. S. enter the Permanent Court of International Justice . Senator Lodge , as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , was in a difficult position . He was expected to do something and yet he was opposed to the proposal made by the last two Presidents of his own party . <P> As a result he advanced last week a separate proposal for a World Court , which may properly be called the " Lodge Court " in contradistinction to the existing court , which he calls the League Court . His proposal was in the form of a Senate resolution authorizing the President to invite other nations to a third Hague Conference to consider the Lodge plan . There is surprisingly little difference between the Court which Mr. Lodge dislikes and his own proposal . <P> Comparison : <P> 1 ) Name : World Court of International Justice ( Lodge ) , or Permanent Court of International Justice ( League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arbitration : Both courts are inde pendent thereof . <P> 3 ) Constitution of the Court : Twelve judges elected for nine-year terms ( Lodge ) or eleven judges elected for nine-year terms ( League ) . <P> 4 ) Selection of Judges : Each nation nominates four candidates , two not of its own nationality ( both plans ) . From this list judges are elected by two Committees acting separately , a General Committee composed of one representative of each signatory power and a Special Committee composed of ten members , one each from the U. S. , Great Britain , France , Italy , Japan and one each from five other nations to be selected from time to time ( Lodge ) - or from the list of nominees , judges are elected in separate meetings by the Assembly of the League of Nations ( composed of one representative from each of the powers signatory to the League of Nations Covenant ) and the Council of the League of Nations ( composed of one representative each from Great Britain , France , Italy , Japan and six other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ) Expenses of the Court ( including salaries of Judges ) are borne by the signatory powers ( Lodge ) or by the League of Nations ( League ) . <P> 6 ) Jurisdiction of the Court shall be voluntarily assumed by two contending nations or they may , by ratifying an optional clause in taking membership , obligate themselves to the jurisdiction of the Court in matters relating to the interpretation of treaties , questions of international law , or the breach thereof and the nature and extent of any reparation for the breach of an international obligation ( both plans ) . <P> In short , the two courts would be virtually identical , assuming that the same nations would join Mr. Lodge 's Court which have joined the League of Nations . The only difference of any importance would be that the British Dominions could not take part individually in the election of judges , but could participate only through the one vote of the British Empire . Presumably their share of the cost of the Court would be correspondingly lessened . <P> However , Mr. Lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. , instead of taking the usual course , appending these as reservations to U. S. ratification . The articles in question follow : ARTICLE LXV
