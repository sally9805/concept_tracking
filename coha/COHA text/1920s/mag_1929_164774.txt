( See front cover ) <P> A naked girl with sleek black hair against a bright halo , riding one of three large white camels beneath a great swirl of checkered cloth and amid a riotous procession of companions , awaits the inspection , through lorgnette and opera glass , of the first families of Chicago . <P> The girl and her companions , painted on the steel curtain of the Chicago Civic Opera 's new $20,000,000 opera house , compose an exciting pattern of " figures from familiar operas . " Familiar though the operas may be , the figures are unfamiliar . They toss fruit , banners , lanterns , cymbals . Among them strut farm animals . All is barbaric , lyric , crowded , for carnival is being made or perhaps a victory celebrated ; perhaps the victory of opera in Chicago . <P> Looking at their new opera curtain before it rises for the first time Monday night , Chicagoans may be reminded of another design , just as elaborate and colorful but more serious and a million times as big .

There is an irregular quadrilateral of it in North Carolina . A vast , nearly solid mass of it spreads east , west and south from Chicago . There are patches of it in Kansas , Oklahoma , Missouri . It almost blots out New Jersey and New Hampshire , parts of Pennsylvania and Kentucky . It is the design of the fields of operation of the public utility companies over which Samuel Tnsull , financial father of the Chicago opera , rules as power primate . <P> Compared to this second design , the fantastic curtain revel-in fact the whole Chicago opera organization-becomes no more than Punch- &-Judy.; Yet it is Punch- &-Judy; on the very largest scale .

And most things that Samuel Insull plays with are sooner or later made to pay . Thus , though Architects Graham , Anderson , Probst &; White had orders to stint nothing in making Chicago 's opera house second to none for luxury , they also had orders to surmount the edifice with a 21-story office building . In the auditorium are rose-velvet boxes , rose-brocade chairs , a gold and ivory proscenium arch , lush carpeting , amber lights , spacious cloak rooms , a rose-and-gold foyer with towering columns of Roman travertine . Around and over the auditorium are 739,000 square feet of office space , the entire income from which will be put to artistic account .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
