Three dozen productions will keep Mr. Anderson busy , which perhaps accounts for the postponement of the opening night in East Fifty-eight Street . The building for the new theatre has a background . It was the old German Conservatory of Music , and is remembered as the site bought by Mr. Gil Boag for a combined theatre and night club in which to star his wife , Miss Gilds Gray . Mr. Boag subsequently gave up the plan for the theatre when Miss Gray fared forth into moving pictures . Last March Mr. Anderson took over the site . MIIE Park Avenue Theatre will be a tiny affair , two hundred and ninety-nine seats . Mr. Anderson 's plans are interesting  --  dramas , musical comedies , a first John Murray Anderson Follies each to have a limited run in its birthplace , and then to expand to Broadway  --  if the box office line becomes long enough . But what is most appealing , beside the fact that audiences are not to be subscription , are the drawings for the interior of his diminutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old Weber and Fields Music Hall . There will be a balcony of five miniature boxes , curtained , from each of which one will retire , through a leather-padded door , to a cosy anteroom where coffee is to be served between the acts  --  perhaps , also , before the curtain , which is never to rise before the continental hour of nine . Mr. William Bottoniley has done the designing . The walls of the house are paneled with mirrors , over which draperies are to drop noiselessly during the performances . Oyster-white and vermillion , mid-Victorian coloring , with Eighteenth Century iron work , all arranged with charmed simplicity . Thus one finds Mr. Anderson associated with pleasing departures in both the theatrical and the moving picture worlds . There is no telling what nice thing he may do next .

It will be New York 's first really important aviation meet since 1920 , when the combination of general apathy and the unfortunate selection of Thanksgiving Day for the occasion resulted in the attendance being limited to a few chilled enthusiasts and a handful of bored official observers . Morley OLD MORLEY " still drives his dilapidated , low-necked hack , hunched on the blanket-draped box , a short , well-padded figure , reddish of face , enormously well-disposed towards life in general , but with that slightly waggish reservation which indicates that he knows what it is all about , is on the inside . Morley has become exclusively Racquet Club property , and he exercises a fatherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps he is subsidized ; at least when he was ill last Winter he found his bills " taken care of , " and little over which to worry his wise , old head . He will never quote you a rate , Morley .. . " what you like , gentlemen . " He is therefore always grossly overpaid . Never will he solicit custom by so much as a wave of the whip , but he seems possessed of an uncanny sense which tells him at once , as one comes out the door , whether one has need of him , and he gathers up the reins or leaves them fallen to nod pleasantly , as the manner of egress indicates . Morley will take you anywhere , on the most meagre directions , and he will wait without end , often on his own initiative . This particularly for those last remnants of bachelor dinners . One instance , I remember , when I had driven joyously about town until three a. m. and had alighted at the Beaux Arts , dismissed and paid him .

With all of Motley 's paternalism , he is almost invariably the butt of friendly abuse . " You old scoundrel , Morley ; rob us of our last penny , you will . " Such lie takes with easy humor , very much as William , the dear waiter of Shaw 's play , " You Never Can Tell . " And like William , Morley moulds destinies .

It was then that the complication , which interfered with all these choice offerings , intervened . . . thus : Final arrangements were being made at a " get-together " luncheon at the Astor and Chairman Albee was about to drop the gavel for adjournment when a small voice addressed the chair . " Excuse it , Mr. Albee , " it said , " but you should remember that Monday is September twenty-eighth ? " " Well ? " said the Chairman . " And that September the twenty-eighth is Yom Kippur , the holiest of days , when eighty per cent of the people you count on for support will sit quietly at home , in strict observance .

They pile out of buses and taxicabs ; they stand in groups each Saturday , waiting in our terminals for trains to take them to country clubs ; they rush into the cloistered quiet of Park Avenue apartment houses . They are omnipresent , these youths who furnish the madder music for which hostesses are forever crying . Season after season a new vogue is won by some master among their kind . It was Whiteman some years back , then Lopez , then Specht , and , last year , Ben Bernie , who was first to wrest recognition from the light-footed world through the medium of radio broadcasting . When they are established , these maestri form innumerable smaller orchestras labelled with their names and welded into shape under their batons , so that Long Island may have a dozen Whiteman orchestras over the same week-end and Westchester as many more under equally famous direction .

THE NEW YORKER Hostesses also turn for music to Eddie Davis , who disports betimes at the Club Lido , Whitstein of New Haven , whose vogue owes much to Yale , Markel , another collegiate favorite , the Commanders , out of Elsie Janis 's show , the California Ramblers , and Lary Siry of the Ambassador . No doubt there are many , many more , but these are the better known and will be most in demand until some youth with an odd sense of rhythm devises some fresh interpretation for the saxophone , or the fiddle .

" Pebbles are not visually dramatic . We 'll make it chess . " But , then , the property man interposed when this change in his list was ordered , where was one to get Arab chessmen ; what did they look like ? Nobody knew . Mr. Geddes deemed it best to summon one of the authors , Mr. Cloyd Head , who is an authority . " There are no Arab chessmen , " Mr. Head explained , drily . " Playing chess is forbidden by the Koran . " But the visually dramatic will not be denied ; Koran or no Koran , it 's going to he chess .

So the notion of a publishing center , if it did not actually die , grew wan . Now we have the prospect of a theatrical center in the Circle , which is a big improvement over the first idea. - And a project not without its mute justice . Mr. Hearst surely owes Columbus Circle something as retribution for the Maine Monument , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE best laid plans  --  and if you do n't know any convenient mouse who will verify these gangings astray , there is Mr. Chandler Ross , the miniaturist , to tell you all about his log cabin , if only he can control himself long enough to do so . This log cabin was to have been the log cabin of all Lake Placid ; something for the Summer tourists to send home postcards about , and for the more permanent residents to discuss all the year round . Mr. Ross planned it carefully . Its interior was to be of rough , hand-hewn logs , with never the blemish of a saw-ridge on their faces . To procure just the right logs , properly hewn , Mr. Ross made a tour of the lumber camps of New York State ; and from them pushed on into deepest Canada and darkest Maine . They were shipped , in ones and twos and threes , to Lake Placid , where an expensive interior decorator was supervising the building . Presently , he sent word to the explorer of the woodlands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation that his successful explorations justified , Mr. Ross returned . He entered his cabin , ready for the great gloat . There were his logs , all in place  --  and all carefully planed smooth and stained a gorgeous purple . There is an epilogue . When Mr. Ross entered the cabin , the decorator was perched on a ladder , performing the finishing as , indeed , they were ? touches . The ensuing explosion so rocked the surrounding country that he fell from his ladder and sustained a broken leg . Paterfamilias FOR the present season and perhaps as for many to come , Mr. Rudolph Schildkraut will bow to audiences in the Bronx , for his son , Joseph , has financed for him a converted nickelodeon in that region where Zionism flourishes so well .

When Joseph Schildkraut , a comparative unknown , was chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's dramatic library furnished the annotated script which Mansfield himself had used in preparing the role ; and the elder lavished on his son the long labors of coaching which made it possible for the youth to write his name on dramatic history . Those who saw Rudolph Schildkraut , in the times when he was young from the direction of Professor Reinhardt , possess , they say , a treasure of artistic memory such as the present does not furnish . He is still a consummate artist and his great ambition is to play " King Lear . " This dream may be realized , but for the time Rudolph Schildkraut will labor in the small Bronx house  --  and the younger will have Broadway to himself .
