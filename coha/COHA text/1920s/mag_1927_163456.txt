The Fascist Grand Council , Prime Minister Benito Mussolini in the chair , met last week to listen patiently to the great words of their frowning leader . <P> Signor Mussolini rapped the table for silence and , rising , unfolded to the assembled Fascists a plan for abolishing universal suffrage . In brief this is what he commanded : 1 ) Only members of the 13 Fascist corporations , which include all Fascist producers and workers , shall be eligible to vote , because they are active contributors to the advancement of the nation . <P> 2 ) Only one ticket will be presented to the voters and the whole country shall be considered as one electoral unit . <P> 3 ) The Fascist corporation shall select a certain number ( to be fixed later ) of candidates for election , most of them to be technical men well able to represent their art , craft or profession . Their names must then be submitted to the Fascist Grand Council , which will eliminate those whose Fascist faith is not considered strong enough and whose technical knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will nominate a number of its own candidates , who will represent the political interests of the party . <P> 5 ) The whole list will then be submitted to the ( Fascist ) electorate , which will have no other party from which to choose . <P> 6 ) The number of deputies will be reduced from 560 to 400 . <P> 7 ) Senators will continue to be appointed by the King on the nomination of the government .
