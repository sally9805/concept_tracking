txt Mr. Clarence W. Barron has been interriewed at the Carlton Hotel by a representative of the Ftnancial News concerning his views on business in the United States atid other topics . Mr. Barron is the publisher of the leading financial journal , o : the United States , The Wall Street Journal . Boston News Bureau . Philadelphia News Bureau . and Barron's. the National Financial Weekly . He is also the head of the financial bulletins in New York . Boston . and Philadelphia , and of the Dow-Jones Electri ? Page Printer Service in New York . " What do you think of business in the United States ? " asked our representative . " I should say that business is almost too good , " Mr. Barron replied . " I am only alarmee. when I ccetemplate the size of our prosperity . It seems almost uncanny . We have not only one-half the gold of the world , and more than one-third of the wealth of the work ' . but I thine we hate more than one-half the income of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred years of growth , and that we have one , 6 ' , of the land area of the world , and only 7e. of the population of the world . we may well be estonished . " Of course you people in Europe w ill as ' . if ne can maintain this prosperity without relation to the rest of the world . I ant one of the few people who answer we cat , . " We are 48 free-trading nations called States , the greatest free trade area in the world . and we can stand on a protective tariff basis because we have this large section of the world on a free trade basis . " Europe is making the mistake of imitating our protective tariff over small areas that have not the resources that we have to maintain their independence . Europe will be able to compete with the United States when it also has a wide free trade area without bat ricrs on this side of the water , and a protective tariff that will asai , t to give European manufacturers an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we hate : : . the United States . " If we had statistics showing the trade between our 48 Empires or States we should have people talking a lot of economic nonsense about balances in trade between Massachusetts and Texas . or Montana and Florida ; but , having no statistics , we have no theoretical economists dealing with the trade between our nation , . It is not nations that trade with each other ; it is the individual , within the nateons who put into a common international bowl their surplus productions and take front that bow I whatever they need . Nations ns units : do not trade with each other , and there is more nonsense talked about trade balances and more economic error concerning international trade than any other economic subject . " " What is the immediate outlook for next z cer ? " our representative asked . " Of course . " replied Mr. Barron , " nobody can see tie end of 1927 because we have the season 's crop with which to deal . Weather and crops may fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very poor one . and w e may have irregularity in prices . " But the fundamental thing to remember concerning the United States is that it has now the best banking sy -- tern in the world giving unlimited credit . Formerly we had fluctuations in trade and finance , based entirely upon Prosperity exhausting the volume of credit . Now our volume of credit is practically inexhaustible , unless ee have tremendous inflation of prices . " Under this inexhaustible supply of Federal Reser e/ credit individual trades move on an independent basis . " Formerly all our industrial and railroad stocks wee . up and down together according to the supply of money or credit . Now we are more upon the English basis , where You have ' Rubbers ' up or down and ' Rails ' up or down , and one without regard to the other . So now in the Unite. : States we can have depreciation in textiles without any injurious general effect therefrom . " We can have railroads , as at the present time . advancing because investors are beginning to appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad wars , and the cutting of transportation prices . Because of our very large industrial movement and our eery large wage fund railroads are having the largest business in their history . and the outlook is vera good in the railroad field . pnosrEn.oLs MOTOR TRADL . " We arc having continuously adjustment and readjustment in the motor field . At one time Studebaker takes the lead ; at another time Chryslet . Now Henry Ford . the country country is prosperous , recedes in his output , because people buy higher-priced cars . Next year Mr. Ford will probably do a larger business because he has abandoned the one color scheme and will sell his . cars in different eolors . He is also steadily improving the Ford car without advertising it . " This year General Motors has made the ' , cry great record , and , paradoxical as it may appear , its act earnings gained more than the gain in net earnings of all the motor companies in the United States , which , of course . mein ' , that outside General Motors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This shows the mditicluality trades and of movements within trades . In the first nine rrionths-of this year the output of motors showed a gain of 504,000 , of which the General Motors gained e84,000 units . The profits of all the companies in the nine months were $239,000,000. a gain of $59,000,000 , or 30re : but the gain in General Motors ' profits was $09,000,000 . This enabled General Motors this year to divide 3104,000,000 in dividends upon its 8.700,000 shares . and it will early forward to Surplus $80,000.000 . " The motor business in the United btatcs is leggin than the steel business . The 10 leading steel companies last year earned $179,000,000 and the 10 motor companies $209,000,000 . The motor business , with all Its accessories and connected expenditures , represents 812,000,000,000 a year ; but all the railroads of the United States collect only ; 6,000,000,000 a year . " You will thus get an idea of not only the progress , but the independence of the United States , and an idea of how one industry may rotate upon its own basis without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurt the railroads . They have rather helped the railroads to abandon unprofitable lines , and they have taken front the railroads the unprofitable short haul passenger business . Motors help us to stabilize industry and prevent goods accumulation . We have now SiSl , of the motors of the world . We grow by our expenditures . " We grow by consumption . Production in the United States would be impossible without our enormous consumption . This is the outlet for our high wages . " Now people say that our motor prosperity can not continue . You might as well talk about our railroad prosReproduced with permission of the copyright owner . perity not continuing . It is s . ro ply another form of transportation . " The United etale- and Canada mule . about 4 , e00,000 motors per annum . We export eearly half a million of these . Commercial Nehicles and tractors take another halfmillion motors . so that we make only about 3,300.000 pleasure vehicle : . We require more than two and a half million for replacement . And it i= only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are required to find new customers or new markets . You can thus see that our motor business on a pretty stable bases . I have been astonished to study these figures in conjunction with the fact that Ford cars and American cars appear to be disappearing from 1% our British highway , and front Paris . for the British and European output of motets is increaaing . But we do not find an decrease in our export trade for motors as a ? hole . " " Vi hat may we expect in respect to the export of capital from the States ? " asked our representative . " The leading bankers in New York tell me that the end of foreign financing for governments is in sight , " said Mr. Barron . " Scandinavia . Switzerland and other countries can not be induced ' to accept any more money . There will probably be a loan to Japan . and after France has settled with Washington there is expectation of a French stnbilication loan in the United States . " With less tnan half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for foreign nations is in sight . Then we expect easier rates for money , beginning early next year . a gradual appreciation of our bonds as the money rate Salle , and an improvement in sound imestment shares . I do not think ' that American capital will be tempted ranch into foreign industries . " There is enough machinery for manufacturing in the world . The trouble is the under-consumption of foreign goods in the far corners of the earth . What the world needs today is concerted effort for the opening up of the waste places of the earth . The undeveloped interiors of the great continents of the earth can be opened up by highways , motors and airplanes without at first expensive railroads . World production and world consumption can thereby be tremendously increased . This is my view of the future for the development of the trade of the world . " In this development Great Britain should hate leadership . She knows better than any other nation how to cleat with under-developed countries . Site is the only real colonizer in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American capital should go up behind the English pioneering , and together they should develop the waste places of the earth for mutual profit and world benefit .
