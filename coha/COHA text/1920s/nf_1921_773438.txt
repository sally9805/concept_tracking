The Bill of Rights enumerated some of the high-handed , illegal acts of the reign of James and denied such powers to future sovereigns . It also solemnly excluded Roman Catholics from the throne . The Toleration Act also was passed in 1689 . By this law dissenting Protestants ( Presbyterians , Baptists , Congregationalists , Quakers , etc. ) were granted the right of public worship , although the Episcopal Church remained , as before , the established church , supported by public taxation . The law forbidding dissenters to hold office remained in force for many years after this . But the Toleration Act was a very important step . English law thus for the first time granted the right of holding public services to more than one form of religion at the same time . The Triennial Act provided that Parliament should be elected for not more than three years . ' An American Congress or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is elected . A British Parliament , on the other hand , may be dissolved at any time , but it can not continue beyond the legal time . One of the most important laws of Parliament belonging to this period was the Act of Settlement of 1701 . By this act it was provided that in case of the death of William and of Mary 's sister Anne without heirs , the crown should go to the House of Hanover , which was descended from James I ( see note , sec. 321 ) . 348 . Final Supremacy of Parliament ? The reign of William and Mary was one of the most important in British history because it established finally the supremacy of Parliament . It also marked the beginning of Cabinet government , the Cabinet being responsible to Parliament and not to the sovereign.2 Note the steps during this reign by which Parliament became supreme : 1 .

Parliament by the Triennial Act made it impossible for a sovereign to do as Charles II had done in the case of the Cavalier Parliament , or to govern without a Parliament , as his father had done . Also , Parliament , by voting revenue bills for the expenses of the government for only one year at a time , made the king ' constantly dependent . 3 . Finally , the king 's ministers , or Cabinet , came to be responsible , not to the king , but to Parliament . This was a growth of more than a century , but it had its beginning in the reign of William and Mary . With the ministers responsible to Parliament such arbitrary government as that by Charles I and Wentworth ( sec. 332 ) became impossible . In short , Parliament , after a hundred years of struggle , became supreme in the British government , as it still remains , subject only to its master , the people . 349 ? General Progress . ?

Rise of the Absolute Monarchy . ? With the passing of Feudalism ( ch . XVIII ) most of the nations of Europe became absolute monarchies . An absolute monarchy is a government in which the monarch has complete or absolute power . He makes and enforces the laws . The people obey the laws , but have no part in making them . Under the feudal system there were thousands of petty rulers , each with his castle , his little trained army , and his domains over which he was master . Gradually , after the invention of printing and of gunpowder , the feudal estates became merged into the greater state , the kingdom ( sec. 241 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly established in France , while at the other extreme were Germany and Italy , which continued under the divided control of many petty rulers . The absolute monarchy is not at all to the taste of the American people , who enjoy self-government ; but it must be remembered that the people of that day were not ready for self-government and that the absolute monarchy was an improvement over feudalism. 351 . The Early Times of Louis XIV . ? On the death of Louis XIII in 1643 his little son , not yet five years old , inherited the French throne as Louis XIV . His reign of seventy-two years ( 1643 ? 1715 ) was the longest in European history . He came to be known as the Grand Monarch and was the typical absolute monarch of modern times . The brilliant career of the great Richelieu had just closed ( sec. 325 ) and the Thirty Years ' War was near its ending . Owing to the part Richelieu had taken in that war the Hapsburg House 403 // of Austria had been humiliated , the Bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and France had reached her pinnacle of greatness . During the childhood of the young king the government was administered by his mother , who was an Austrian princess and was known as Anne of Austria . Her chief minister was Mazarin ( ma-za-raN ' ) , who had been chosen and trained in the public service by Richelieu . In ability he could not be compared with his great master , but he was a man of inventive mind and of strong common sense . For nearly twenty years Mazarin and the queen carried on the government on the principles laid down by Richelieu . At this time the nobles , who had been subdued by Richelieu , made a final effort to regain their prestige . But in a // short civil war , called the War of the Fronde ( frond ) , they were defeated and never again did they give the monarchy serious trouble . 352 . The Brilliant Age ; Colbert . ? On the death of Mazarin in 1661 the young king assumed control of the government and even became his own prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine right " of kings . The English Parliament he pronounced an " intolerable evil . " The famous saying , " I am the State , " ascribed to Louis , sums up his ideas of government , whether he really used the expression or not . For two decades after Louis assumed the government the financial and industrial progress of the nation was remarkable ; but it was not due to the king , who was of mediocre ability ; it was due to Colbert ( kolbar ' ) , his great minister of finance . Only a few of the great things Colbert did can be mentioned here . When Colbert came into power the revenues were far less than the expenditures . The taxes were farmed out as in the case of the Roman provinces ( sec. 155 ) , and less than half the taxes paid by the people reached the public treasury . Colbert changed all this . He deprived great numbers of useless office holders of their offices ; he reduced the pensions of nobles and courtiers to half what they were before ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which they had bought ) and made them again taxpayers ; he greatly increased the revenue and turned a deficit into a surplus , while at the same time he reduced the land tax by half for the benefit of the farmers . Other great improvements were due to Colbert . He found his country in its infancy in manufacturing ; he left it one of the leaders in Europe . He fostered shipbuilding and foreign trade , built many roads , and constructed the great Languedoc ( langdok ' ) Canal to connect the Atlantic Ocean with the Mediterranean Sea . The industrial system of France to-day rests on the foundations laid by Louis XIV 's great minister , Colbert.l // Next to Colbert the greatest man of the reign was Vauban ( v6-barn ' ) , who was a military genius . He made great changes especially in the fortifying and capturing of cities . It was said that " a city besieged by Vauban was a captured city , and a city defended by him , an impregnable one . " The French army was . brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model for all the armies of Europe . 353 ? Wars of Louis XIV . ? The brilliant age closed with the death of Colbert in 1683 . Had King Louis chosen to make his life work the perfecting and continuing of the great improvements of Colbert , he might have left a great name in history . But he France and Louis XIV 407 chose to make war on his neighbors that he might win a little more territory and make a military record . The result was that during the last thirty years of his reign there was a gradual decline in industry and commerce , while the coming generations were burdened with a crushing national debt . The first of Louis 's wars was against the Spanish Netherlands ( Belgium ) on a flimsy pretext , 1667 ? 1668 ; but he was thwarted by the Dutch Netherlands ( United Netherlands or Holland ) . A fierce resentment was thus kindled in the breast of the Grand Monarch against the little republic , and he determined to crush it . The Dutch fought with great bravery . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later king of England ( secs . 345-346 ) , their captain general . The remaining thirty years of William 's life were one long struggle with Louis XIV , and it was he more than any other man who foiled the ambitions of the French monarch . When a French army besieged Amsterdam , he drove it away by cutting tile dikes and letting in the waters of the North Sea . At length William formed a great European coalition against Louis , and when he became king of England ( 1689 ) that country also was joined with the coalition . The long war that followed ( 1689-1697 ) , called the War of the Palatinate , was known in America as King William 's Var . Neither side gained much by this devastating conflict . It was the beginning of what has been called the Second Hundred Years ' War between France and England , contending for commercial world supremacy . ' 354 ? War of the Spanish Succession . ? The War of the Spanish Succession ( in America Queen Anne 's War ) , 1702 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balance of Power " in Europe.2 When the king of Spain died in 1700 and left a will bequeathing his vast possessions to a grandson of the king of France , the // other powers objected , as this would place the crowns of both France and Spain in the hands of the Bourbon dynasty . Such power in the same family would disturb the balance and become a menace to the peace of Europe . So the war began . It developed strong commanders , as the Duke of Marlborough of England and Prince Eugene of Savoy ' ; and there were a few battles of world renown , as the allied victory of Blenheim ( blen'em ) in 1704 . In the end the French prince was permitted to remain on the Spanish throne on the condition that France and Spain should remain forever separate . This yielding of the allies was due to the fact that their own candidate for the Spanish crown , the Archduke Charles of Austria , had become emperor and they were no longer desirous of making him king of Spain . But other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Utrecht ( u'trekt ) in 1713 , were of greater importance . Great Britain ( sec. 330 ) received Acadia ( Nova Scotia ) , Newfoundland , and the Hudson Bay country , from France , and Gibraltar , the mighty gateway to the Mediterranean , from Spain ; all these possessions she still holds . Austria received Naples ( all southern Italy ) , the former Spanish Netherlands , and other possessions . Holland ( the Dutch Netherlands ) after this war ceased to be a first-class power and has never since risen to that eminence . France was greatly crippled by the war and her fortunes were at the lowest ebb when , two years later ( 1715 ) , her aged monarch passed away . 355 . The Huguenots under Louis XIV . ? One of the greatest mistakes ever made by Louis XIV was his revoking of the Edict of Nantes . It will be remembered that King Henry of Navarre in the Edict of Nantes , 1598 , granted certain privileges to the Huguenots or French Protestants ( sec. 315 ) . The Iuguenots. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal , harmless people . But King Louis , in the belief that all the people should be of one faith , and misled by over-zealous advisers , revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685 and deprived his Protestant subjects of all their privileges . It was a stunning blow to the // industries of France , and France in later years paid the penalty for the blunder of her stupid king . The Huguenot ministers were ordered to leave the kingdom , and their congregations were forbidden to follow . But in spite of the king 's police system , about 250,000 of them crossed the borders and " carried to foreign lands the French arts , the secrets of French manufactures , and hatred of their king . " In the armies of England , the Netherlands , and Germany whole regiments were formed of French Protestants . Many of the Huguenots made their way to America , and among their descendants were such leading citizens of our country as Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , Peter Faneuil ( fan " l ) , and Paul Revere . 356 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered himself more completely lord of the earth , or at least of his own people , than Louis XIV . Court etiquette in France was intolerably exacting . Everything centered in the king . Great lords and nobles considered it an honor to do him any menial service . It required seven persons to help him put on his shirt when he awoke in the morning . While sitting at meals or moving about his court the king was attended with the utmost pomp by his servile courtiers . Desiring an exclusive home for royalty , near Paris but away from the turmoil of the great city and the contamination of the common herd , Louis XIV built a royal city , Versailles ( ver-sa'y ' ) , twelve miles from Paris . Here he spent a hundred million dollars of the people 's money ; hither he moved with his court , his five thousand servants , and thousands of other retainers , and here amid the splendors of Versailles the elite of France , attached to a court of " sweated hypocrisy , " lived a false , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned by the toiling masses . The royal palace built by the Grand Monarch at Versailles , containing hundreds of rooms , was the grandest ever seen in Europe . To-day it remains , with many other public buildings // and wonderful public gardens , a monument of voluptuous extravagance . It is visited every year by thousands of tourists . 357 . Culture and Progress . In spite of its blunders and its extravagance , the long reign of Louis XIV was an age of progress and was the literary age of France . Few other names in French literature can be classed with the great dramatists , Moliere ( ma-ly- r ' ) , Corneille ( kor-na'y ' ) , and Racine ( ra-sen ' ) , or with the philosophers Pascal and Descartes ( da-kart ' ) , all of whom were contemporary with Louis XIV . In many other respects France set the pace for Europe . French etiquette , dress , and fashions were imitated everywhere . It even became the fashion to use the French language in court circles and polite society throughout Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALKS Louis XIV . ? The following is from the diary of St. Simon , a member of the court of Louis XIV . " The king 's great qualities shone more brilliantly by reason of an exterior so unique and incomparable as to lend infinite distinction to his slightest actions ; the very figure of a hero , as appeared even in his most insignificant gestures and movements , without arrogance but with simple gravity ; proportions such as a sculptor would choose for a model ; a perfect countenance and the grandest air and mien ever vouchsafed to man ; all these advantages enhanced by a natural grace which enveloped all his actions with a singular charm which has never perhaps been equaled . He was as dignified and majestic in his dressing-gown as when dressed in robes of state , or on horseback at the head of his troops . . . . " Louis XIV 's vanity was without limit or restraint ; it colored everything and convinced him that no one even approached him in military talents , in plans and enterprises , in government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Versailles which disgust every foreigner ; those opera prologues that he himself tried to sing ; that flood of prose and verse in his praise for which his appetite was insatiable ; those dedications of statues copied from pagan sculpture , and the insipid and sickening compliments that were continually offered to him in person and which he swallowed with unfailing relish . Hence , his distaste for all merit , intelligence , education , and , most of all , for all independence of character and sentiment in others ; his mistakes of judgment in matters of importance ; his familiarity and favor reserved entirely for those to whom he felt himself superior in acquirements and ability ; and , above everything else , a jealousy of his own authority which determined and took precedence of every other sort of justice , reason , and consideration whatever . " Fight of the French and Spanish Ambassadors in London . ? For some centuries ' France and Spain were rival powers . Spain held the leadership during the period of Charles V and Philip IT . But from the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in power while Spain declined . Under Richelieu ( died 1642 ) France passed Spain and since then has been the superior power . In nothing did their rivalry appear more conspicuously than in the unseemly broils that took place between their respective ambassadors at foreign courts . The worst of these took place in London in 1661 , the year following the Restoration in England . The Swedish ambassador was about to arrive in London . In the procession from the wharf on the // bank of the Thames to the court , his carriage , according to custom , was to follow that of the king of England , and the carriages of the other ambassadors were to follow his in the order of their respective nations . On this occasion the French and Spanish ambassadors each determined that his carriage should follow immediately after the Swede 's , and both prepared for a contest . The king of England , knowing what was coming , forbade all Englishmen , under penalty of death , from taking part in the contest . A great crowd of people gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage , guarded by fifty men armed with swords , arrived at the place five hours before the time for the procession and thus secured the best position , but the French guards numbered more than a hundred , armed with swords and pistols . The fight , beginning on the river bank , continued into the city . Twelve men and many horses were killed and about forty men were wounded . The Spaniards , though outnumbered , won a complete victory . When Louis XIV , king of France , heard of the affair he was wroth . IIe dismissed the Spanish ambassador from Paris , recalled his own from Madrid , and declared that he would make war on Spain if precedence of France over Spain were not acknowledged in every court in Europe . After some months of diplomatic correspondence Spain yielded all that the French king demanded . For a fuller account of this remarkable episode , see Pepys 's Diary . The Man in the Iron Mask . ? One of the great mysteries of the reign of Louis XIV is seen in the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in the Bastille ( Ws-ter ) , a great fortress in Paris , in 1703 , after an imprisonment of twenty-four years . During all that time the prisoner was never permitted to talk to any one except the jailer .

It was evident that for reasons of state his identity was not to be made known . All manner of speculations were rife as to who was the Man in the Iron Mask . Some hinted that he was a twin brother of King Louis XIV , who thus sacrificed him to make his own title to the throne secure . Others thought the celebrated prisoner was a son of Oliver Cromwell , and still others with more reason that he was a state prisoner of France whose confinement , if known , would cause trouble with some ' foreign country .

CHAPTER XXIX RISE OF PRUSSIA AND RUSSIA DURING the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries nothing in the development of Europe is of greater interest and importance than the growing of Prussia and Russia into great nations . Among the builders of Prussia the names of two men stand apart from all the rest ? the Great Elector and Frederick the Great . In the building of Russia also we find two figures who rise far above all others ? Peter the Great and Catherine the Great . I. PRUSSIA 358 . Brandenburg and the Hohenzollerns . ? One of the northern German states during the Middle Ages was Brandenburg ( bran'den-boorx ) . Its ruler was called an elector because he had a vote in electing the emperors . When in 1415 the old line of electors died out , the emperor sold Brandenburg to the Count of Hohenzollern ( ho-en-tsol'ern ) , a nobleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be strong rulers . Soon after 1600 the elector of Brandenburg secured two very important additions of territory , Cleves on the river Rhine , and Prussia , later called East Prussia , which lay far to the east , on the shore of the Baltic Sea , outside the Empire and separated from Brandenburg by a part of Poland . Thus the electors of Brandenburg ruled over three widely separated districts . It was their ambition to unite them by acquiring the intervening territory . 359 ? The Great Elector ( 164o-1688 ) . ? Frederick William , known as the Great Elector , coming into his inheritance in the 415 // last period of the Thirty Years ' War , found his lands reduced to misery by the devastating armies . But he was a man of great vigor ; he soon raised an army and drove out the foreign soldiers . At the treaty of Westphalia , 1648 , he acquired important bits of territory , including a frontage for Brandenburg on the Baltic Sea . Later he secured the release of the Polish claims on East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Great Elector was a good Protestant , but , broader-minded than the French king , he welcomed Catholics into his country and made them eligible to office . And when in 1685 Louis XI V revoked the Edict of Nantes ( sec. 355 ) and thousands of Huguenots escaped from the domains of their persecuting monarch , Frederick William welcomed them to his country . In a proclamation he offered them free lands and utensils for cultivating the soil . About 20,000 French Protestants responded and settled in the Great Elector 's domains . No doubt large numbers of Germans are among the descendants of these immigrants . The Great Elector was an absolute monarch , but he believed himself the servant rather than the master of the people . He made great improvements . He built roads and dug canals and drained marshes ; he built towns and encouraged industries . He made a name for himself that commanded respect over all Europe . Oliver Cromwell , through his secretary , the poet John Milton , sent Elector Frederick William a letter of friendship and congratulation . The son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much weaker man than his father . But he is remembered for having secured the title of king in addition to the less dignified title of elector , in 1701 . Soon after this time the name Brandenburg began to fall into disuse and all the Hohenzollern possessions came to be called Prussia . 36o . Frederick the Great and his Father . ? King Frederick William ( 1713-1740 ) , the son of Frederick I and father of Frederick the Great , was a coarse , rough man , fond of hunting wild game and smoking strong tobacco . He ruled his country and // his own household with a hand of iron . He carried a cane and did not hesitate to use it on citizens or soldiers or members of his family . Sometimes on the streets of Berlin he would strike a loitering citizen and bid him go to work . He had a great fondness for the tall soldiers whom he called his " blue children . " He gathered giants from all over Europe and formed them into a bodyguard , but was careful not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William was , he had a solid basis of good sense and Christian character . He greatly cut down the royal expenses , even retaining but thirty of the thousand riding horses inherited from his father . In his instructions as to how his son should be educated we find this : " Other men are guided toward virtue and away from evil by the rewards and punishments dealt out by those who are set above them , but a prince must rely on thefear of God alone , since he is subject to no human law , punishment , or reward . Frederick II , the Great ( 174o-1786 ) , was the most famous character in the long line of Hohenzollern rulers . Like the rest of his race he was devoted to the upbuilding of Prussia , and was not scrupulous in his methods . Unlike his father , he was fond of art , literature , and music . Coming to the throne at the age of twenty-eight , he inherited a great state , a well trained FREDERICK THE GREAT // army , and a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a burning ambition , Frederick determined to add to his dominions and to make a great name for himself . One of the first things he did was to invade Silesia ( si-le ' - shi- a ) , without any declaration of war , without warning , suddenly in the winter of 1740 . Silesia was an Austrian province , jutting like a peninsula between Poland and Bohemia . Frederick 's twofold object , as he admitted , was to add that province to Prussia and to make a military name for himself . He did both . In the war with Austria he retained the disputed province and became the greatest military commander of his time . In a later war he was defeated and almost overpowered , but he did not give up . He fought on against great odds until his enemies , disagreeing among themselves , abandoned the contest and let him keep what he had seized . 361 . Frederick the Great in Peace . Frederick was more than a war leader ; he was a statesman of high rank . Prussia had already become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he increased its prestige greatly and , made it a power of the first class . He did everything to encourage the manufacture of silk and woolen products , of glass , porcelain , and paper goods , and to aid the farmers he furnished cavalry horses for plowing . Like his father and the Great Elector , he encouraged immigrants , and many thousands from other countries found a home in Prussia during the forty-six years of his reign . It is estimated that a third of the Prussian people are descendants of immigrants from other lands . Frederick the Great was a man of prodigious industry ; but there was a convivial side to his nature . With congenial companions he spent many a night at Potsdam , near Berlin , in merrymaking . At his invitation the great French wit and skeptical writer , Voltaire ( vol-tar ' ) , joined the merry throng and remained a guest of the Prussian ruler for two or three years . Now Frederick prided himself on his literary attainments , while the French poet thought he knew something of military matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about poetry Voltaire preBeginnings // ferred to show what he knew about war and statecraft , and at the same time each secretly laughed at the other 's ignorance . At length the two men quarreled ; the Frenchman shook the dust of Prussia from his feet and returned no more . It is a singular fact that Frederick , with all his love of literature , could not appreciate the German literature of his time . The leading German authors of the period were Goethe ( gu te , 1749-1832 ) , the greatest of all German writers , the Shakespeare of Germany , a few of whose early works were produced in Frederick 's reign ; Lessing ( 1729-1781 ) and Schiller ( 1759-1805 ) , dramatists of high rank ; and Kant ( 1724-1804 ) , the great philosopher who wrote that immortal work , The Critique of Pure Reason . Frederick the Great admired the French language and literature . He pronounced Shakespeare 's plays " abominable " and " fit only for the savages of Canada , " and he accused Goethe of imitating the wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reign of Peter the Great ( 1689-1725 ) . ? The land ruled by Ivan the Great ( sec. 257 ) was only the central and northern parts of what later came to be Russia . Under his successors the country was expanded ; but it had not yet reached either the Baltic Sea or the Black Sea when Peter the Great came to the throne as the tsar ( or czar ) ? the Russian word for Caesar or emperor . The early education of Peter the Great was sadly neglected . Like Charlemagne and Alfred the Great , he saw , when too late , what he had missed . When he came to the throne Russia had no outlet to the sea and the people were far behind the rest of Europe in civilization . Peter determined to give his life toward securing a seaport and to leading his people to adopt European civilization . But first he had to conquer himself , and this was not an easy task . He was a strange mixture of barbarian and civilized man . His anger was ferocious when aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own hand . At times he would spend a night with the roughest of companions . ' But Peter was a man of sincere motives and during his long reign he did much to uplift his people . He introduced European customs and aided the church ; he established an army and a navy and built schools and factories and cities . It is to Peter the Great that Russia is indebted more than to any one else in her history . 363 . Peter 's Westward Journey and his Reforms . ? In order to learn at first hand of the progressive spirit of Western Europe , Peter the Great with a small company made a tour of Holland , England , and Germany , in 1697 ? 1698 . In Holland he put on the garb of a sailor and worked for a time in the shipyards . In his tour the young tsar studied the manners and customs of the people ; he studied printing presses , flour mills , and many kinds of factories ; he even took short courses in surgery and pulling teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him to his own country . When about to continue his journey into Italy he was startled by the news that the old Russian army , known as the Streltsi ( strel'tse ) , were plotting a rebellion against his power . Hastening back to Moscow ( mos'ko ) , his capital , Peter took a fearful vengeance on the rebels . He put great numbers to death , and , as a warning to others , he stuck the heads of hundreds of the executed on the walls of the buildings in public view and left them there all winter . Within a few years Peter had utterly broken the power of the nobility by which the Streltsi had been controlled . He obtained control of the church by refusing to appoint a successor to the patriarch , who died in 1700 . Thus Peter became absolute master of Russia . In his efforts to introduce European ways Peter extended his reforms even to dress and personal appearance .

Those refusing the royal command were subjected to fines. 364 . War with Charles XII of Sweden ; St. Petersburg . ? For some time after the reign of Gustavus Adolphus ( secs . 323-324 ) , the greatest power on the Baltic Sea was Sweden . The Swedes controlled not only their own country but also Finland , Esthonia , and parts of Germany . In 1697 Charles XII , then a boy of fifteen years , ascended the Swedish throne . The neighboring nations , believing that so youthful a sovereign would not be able to defend his possessions , formed a coalition against him . But Charles proved to be a remarkable military genius . He defeated all his enemies , including Peter the Great . At Narva , in 1700 , the Russian tsar with 40,000 men was beaten by the boy king with only S000 . But Peter was not disheartened . He coolly declared , " The Swedes may beat us at first , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , at the battle of Poltava ( pol-tii'va ) , Peter won a great victory over Charles , almost annihilating his army . This victory did much toward raising Russia to the posit ion of a first-class power . Meantime Peter had laid the foundations of his new capital on the marshy shores of the Baltic Sea , at the mouth of the Ne'va River ( 1703 ) , and had called it after his own name , St. Petersburg . ' Foundations were made by driving piles into the marsh . Whole forests were consumed for this purpose and for the erecting of buildings . In this arduous toil , says a writer of the time , the lives of more than eight thousand men and as many horses were destroyed . 365 . Peter 's Influence ; Catherine the Great . ?

There were . moments of reaction during the following century , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of Peter the Great . Next to Peter the most powerful personage in the making of // modern Russia was Catherine II , the Great ( 1762-1796 ) . In spite of her serious defects of character , Catherine proved herself a ruler of great capacity . She took up the work left unfinished by Peter nearly half a century before and even surpassed him in fostering Western civilization . She greatly extended the boundaries of Russia , not only in Europe but also in Asia , and she left her country one of the great nations of the world . Peter and Catherine were of the Romanov ( ro-ma'nof ) dynasty , which ruled Russia for three hundred years , until 1917. 366 . The Partitions of Poland ( 1772 , 1793 , 1795 ) . -A map of Europe of two hundred years ago shows Poland as the greatest country in extent , except Russia ; a map of the nineteenth century shows no such country .

The adjoining nations encouraged disorder and anarchy in Poland . They had designs on the land , nothing short of di Oiling it up among themselves . Catherine II , with all her vast Russian possessions , looked with covetous greed upon Poland . Frederick the Great of Prussia also wanted a slice , for East Prussia was entirely separated from the rest of his dominions by a section of Poland .

" ? Campbell . CHAPTER XXX FRANCE AND ENGLAND IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I. COLONIAL EXPANSION 367 . Colonial Expansion . ? One of the most notable features of the eighteenth century was the expansion of England into the British Empire . Great Britain made a long step in the building of her empire at the treaty of Utrecht ( sec. 354 ) . Later in the century she was to expand in the East and in the West , notwithstanding the loss of the colonies which gained their independence as the United States . Tremendous wars accompanied the expansion movements , but between the first and second periods of expansion Great Britain enjoyed a season of peace under the guidance of one of her great statesmen , Robert Walpole . Spain also , through the discovery of the New World , had gained overseas dominions . But Great Britain and Spain were not alone in their policy of expansion . In the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries , France , the Netherlands , Portugal , Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe ? especially in Africa , Asia , and the East Indian archipelago . Europe constitutes about one fifteenth of the world 's land area , but the European states control more than half the earth 's surface . 368 . Sir Robert Walpole . ? As already noted , the English Parliament in its struggle with the Stuart kings gained control of the government , and political parties and the Cabinet came into existence ( secs . 343 , 348 ) . According to the Act of Settlement ( sec. 347 ) the head of the House of Hanover ascended the throne of Great Britain as George I , in 1714 . He was a good-natured , industrious , corpulent German gentleman who did not speak the 426 Colonial Expansion 427 English language . He soon tired of meeting with his Cabinet , whose language he did not understand , and ceased to attend . No British sovereign has since resumed the practice . The great figure in the reign of George I ( 1714 ? 1727 ) was Robert Walpole . Becoming premier ' in 1721 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not made in a heroic mold . He was sagacious and level-headed , and sincerely devoted to peace . He won his victories by clever manipulation . Walpole was in power for twenty-one years , under the first two Georges , father and son , and they were years of peace and great prosperity . It was the contentment of the people , due to Walpole , that established the Georges firmly on the throne and thwarted the Stuart " pretenders , " son and grandson of the exiled James II , in their persistent efforts to regain the lost kingdom . 369 . England Acquires India . ? The great central peninsula of southern Asia is India , or Hindustan . It is a land of teeming populations of many races and many languages . Soon after 1600 the European peoples awakened to the importance of trading with India and the many islands of the eastern seas . The East was the land of spices and ivory and grain , of rich fabrics and precious stones , including the famous diamonds of Golcon'da . Early in the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels trading in India and the East Indies . They were rivals and often enemies . After these nations had been trading and planting trading stations in the East for more than a century the rivalry for India was reduced to France and Great Britain . Each country had chartered a great trading company with almost sovereign powers , and these companies often came into conflict . ' In 1741 Dupleix ( du-pleks ' ) became the French governor in India . He was an able organizer and he conceived the plan of // establishing a great French colonial empire in India . His plan was frustrated by young Robert Clive of the British company . After some years of warfare , each side making use of many native soldiers , Dupleix was recalled to France ; and with him fell the hope of French victory . In 176 a native ruler , the nabob of Bengal ( ben-gol ' ) , took 146 British prisoners and kept them over night in a room eighteen feet square , with but two small windows . This is known as the " Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoners were dead . Clive hastened to take vengeance for the outrage . In 1757 , at the decisive battle of Plassey , he won the // whole great province of Bengal . Thus he became the founder of the British Indian Empire . A few years later France withdrew from India and left the British to expand their possessions from time to time until they controlled practically the whole land . It was a century later , however , when the British government took over the control of India from the East India Company . The people of India have enjoyed far better government under British rule than they had before , and much of the great wealth of England is due to the rich commerce with the Indian Empire . 370 . War in Europe and America . ? At the time when Clive was making his conquests in India a tremendous conflagration of war was sweeping over Europe and America . In Europe it was known as the Seven Years ' War ( 1756 ? 1763 ) and in America as the French and Indian War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side were arrayed against Great Britain and Prussia on the other . It was decided in favor of the latter through the surpassing ability of two men ? Frederick the Great of Prussia ( sec. 36o ) , and William Pitt of England , known later as the Earl of Chatham ( chat'am ) , who was put virtually at the head of the British government . Far greater than in America were the military operations in Europe , but the results in Europe were less significant than in the New World . Here , after a straggling war of some years , the decisive battle at Quebec ' , in 1759 , settled the future of North America . The vast region called Canada became and still remains a British possession . France lost practically all her possessions in America , as in India , while Great Britain took an immense stride in the extension of her empire . Some years later France took a partial revenge by aiding the thirteen British colonies in America to win their independence . This came through the American Revolution , an account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great Britain , however , was in some measure compensated for her losses in America by acquiring complete control of Australia . // II . INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS 371 . Relics of the Middle Ages . ? At the close of the Seven Years ' War there lingered many things to remind one of the Middle Ages . Feudalism and serfdom had been very greatly modified in France and- England , although in Germany , where there was no strong central government , the condition of the serf was little changed . Copernicus ( 1473 ? 1543 ) had made his marvelous discoveries concerning the solar system , and Isaac Newton ( 1642 ? 1727 ) had taught the world the law of gravity . The Renaissance had led men to read the ancient classics and to love nature ; the Reformation had brought freedom of thought unknown in the Middle Ages . Great painters and sculptors , as Michelangelo and Raphael , had reached the highest consummation of human art . But with all such signs of progress it is an astonishing fact that in the middle of the eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years . His tools and implements for tilling the ground were little better than those of ancient Egypt and Babylonia . All manufacturing was done by hand . The means of travel and transportation had scarcely improved since the time of the Caesars . A few great inventions there were , as gunpowder and printing , but general progress in the industries was yet in the future . This condition was due largely to the fact that man had not applied himself to the careful study of the natural sciences . Then came an industrial awakening quite as wonderful as the Renaissance of the 1Vlidelle Ages . More than one hundred and fifty years have passed since , and the spirit then awakened is still in the ascendancy . It has resulted in steam navigation , the telegraph , the telephone , the automobile , the airplane , and thousands of electrical and mechanical machines . Two or three inventions of the early period have given to Great Britain more wealth than her possession of Canada , Australia , and the Indian Empire . 372 . Great Inventions . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . This is merely a machine by which the forceful expansion of water into vapor , caused by heat , is made to turn wheels . The power is transmitted to all sorts of machinery for transportation and manufacturing . In a thousand ways this natural force , bridled by human genius , does the work formerly done by human muscle or by beasts of burden . The invention of the steam engine ( about 1770 ) is attributed to James Watt , a Scotch inventor . ' The spinning jenny , invented by Hargreaves about 1765 , was improved upon later by Arkwright , Crompton , and others , making a machine by which hundreds of threads are twisted at the same time . This was followed in 1785 by Cartwright 's power loom . Watt 's engine was soon applied to these machines and steam power took the place of the tedious methods of hand 43 2 The Old Regime spinning and weaving that had been in use since the dawn of history . These great inventions and many others that followed made Great Britain for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought about partly by the fast-growing commerce that followed British colonial expansion .

Jose , The Growth of the Empire , treats the subject more extensively and is an excellent work . THE FRENCH REVOLUTION CHAPTER XXXI EVE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION I. CONDITION OF FRANCE 373 . The Government . ? France was a typical absolute monarchy during the period of absolutism . The king had absorbed all power to himself . To carry out his will he had a host of agents and officials whom he appointed and dismissed at his pleasure . He had entire control of the army ; the navy ; he made war and peace ; he made the laws of the land and enforced them . Over his twenty-five million subjects the king had the power of life and death . Taxation was wholly under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . During the years immediately preceding the Revolution , the king gave away in presents millions of dollars a year . The king ruled through ministers and these through great numbers of officials . Not only the nation as a whole , but every province and commune in France was governed secretly by the king 's agents . The governor of a province was called the intendant . Often with a cruel hand he wrung taxes from the people , but they had no power to protest or even to petition their superiors . There was no freedom of speech or of the press . Woe to the author who published a book that had not passed the public censors . A newspaper was not permitted to publish a word against the government or the looting taxgatherers . Nor was there any greater freedom of conscience . The Catholic religion was supreme : Jews and Protestants were not permitted to hold services , and when they did so in secret , they were put to death or sent to the galleys if discovered . 433 43 4 The French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , in the middle of the eighteenth century , were composed of three great classes , ? the Nobility , the Clergy , and the common people , often called the Third Estate . Two of these , the nobility and the clergy , each of whom numbered about 140,000 , were known as the privileged classes . Only part of the nobility were the descendants of the feudal lords of earlier times ; the greater number had purchased their // titles or had been ennobled by the king for other reasons . Many were the privileges of the nobles . They owned one fifth of the land of France , which was exempt from taxation . From many other taxes also they were exempt , but they filled all the offices at the king 's court and they alone could hold high positions in the army . Great numbers of the nobles drew large pensions from the treasury and rendered the state no service . They were the drones of society , idle and profligate . Among their privileges was the right to collect feudal dues from the industrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursions . The Church of France owned at least one fifth of the land of the whole country , the income from which was very great , to say nothing of the tithes collected from the people . All church property and the clergy were exempt from taxation , but the clergy on occasion voted a donation to the king . There were two distinct classes of the clergy . The upper class was composed of the high dignitaries , bishops and abbots , generally chosen from the nobility , who drew large salaries and did little . They lived at Versailles as courtiers of the king , in idleness and often in vice . The other class comprised the lower clergy , the parish priests , who lived on meager salaries and worked faithfully and devotedly among the people . 375 . The Common People . The Third ' Estate included the middle and lower classes , of whom there were nearly twenty-five million . Many of the middle class , composed of merchants , manufacturers , physicians , lawyers , and men of letters , were rich and intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not eligible to hold office . It was this middle class that brought on the great Revolution . Some of them , like the nobles , by bribery or otherwise , eluded the necessity of paying taxes . The peasant class , farmers and laborers , were ground down with the burdens of taxation . Though feudalism as a form of government had almost disappeared in France , peasants were still obliged to pay feudal dues ( secs . 213-214 ) . Then there were the land tax , the church tax , the salt tax , the income tax , // and the tariff duties charged for moving goods from one province to another , up or down or across a river , or from the country to the city . More than half the peasant farmer 's earnings had to go for taxes , even four fifths of them in some parts of the country . If a man neglected to pay his tax a blue-uniformed soldier with a gun came to his home , sat by his fire , slept in his bed , and seized any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wages in addition to the tax . Many a farmer secreted a part of his meager income , and to avoid rousing the suspicion of the taxgatherer , lived in a miserable hovel and let his furniture go to rack . The nobles had great tracts of game preserves and often at harvest time troops of hunters with hounds and horses would trample over the ripening fields and destroy the crops . But the farmer had no redress . When the hares and deer destroyed ? his young orchard , or the pigeons devoured his new-sown grain , he dared not lift a hand against them lest he mar the lord 's hunting pleasure . The specter of the galleys was always before him . He had no rights ; he was a cipher iii the government , in society , in everything except the paying of taxes . To his excessive tax burdens was added another burden . Ile was obliged to work without pay on the roads or other public works from one to three days every week . Certainly France cared little for the welfare of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voltaire , the Brilliant Writer . The most conspicuous , witty , and brilliant writer in France if not in the world in the eighteenth century was Voltaire . Born in 1694 , the son of a lawyer , he developed early as a writer . But there was no freedom of the press in France , and before he was twenty-five years of age Voltaire had spent a year as a prisoner in the Bastille for having published satirical verses . Later for another offense A galley was a low , single-decked vessel . Criminals were sentenced to serve as galley oarsmen , chained to the deck . The life of a galley slave was one of extreme hardship . // he was exiled to England , where he spent three years studying the language and literature of that country . We have seen him also at the court of Frederick the Great ( sec. 361 ) . Voltaire was a historian , a poet , and a dramatist . The chief passion of his life was to fight the Catholic Church . He was not an atheist , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dogmatic teachings , and its great influence with the people , he believed to be an obstacle to progress . He was not friendly to Protestants , but there were few of them in France , and he reserved his shafts of subtle wit and satire for the Catholics . And though his books were often suppressed and he himself was harshly dealt with , his writings had a profound effect on great numbers of his countrymen . He played an important part in preparing his country for revolt . 377 . Diderot and the Encyclopedia . ? One of the great works that molded public opinion in France during the forty years just preceding the Revolution was the Encyclopedia , edited by Diderot ( ded-ro ' ) , a great scholar and philosopher . With him were associated the famous mathematician D'Alembert ( da-UN-bar ' ) , and many other scholars . The first two volumes , published in 1752 , were suppressed because some of the articles in them were too free in criticizing religion and royal authority . Diderot , like Voltaire , was sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the years following , and at length , in spite of the protests of the clergy , the government withdrew its opposition . The Encyclopedia attacked the abuses in church and state ? criminal and tax laws , the slave trade , religious intolerance , and other things . It played a large part in unsettling the public mind with reference to French institutions . 378 . Rousseau and the Social Contract . ? The Social Contract , by Rousseau ( rob-so ' ; 1712-1778 ) , is a little volume which has had more influence on human government than any other writing of modern times . Rousseau , a native of Geneva , was a man of excitable temper438 The French Revolution ament and of very irregular and questionable habits . He wrote on many subjects ? music , education , and others ? but it was his Social Contract that gave him universal fame , which is undimmed to this day . It is an essay on government , written in a most fascinating style . Its keynote is that no man has an inherent right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation is the people , and that the people who must obey the laws should make them . These principles have been adopted by nearly all nations of the earth . The Social Contract became the keynote , and its author the prophet , of the Revolution . ' III . THE BENEVOLENT DESPOTS 379 ? Frederick the Great and Catherine the Great . The great French writers noticed above made a profound impression not only in France , but in other parts of Europe , notably among the rulers of the period . These rulers remained absolute or despotic ; they made no attempt to take the people into partnership with them ; but they made a sincere effort to rule their people well and to put into practice some of the new doctrines of the French writers . They were known as the Benevolent Despots . Among these were Frederick of Prussia and Catherine of Russia , both of whom have been noticed in an earlier chapter . Frederick the Great refused to share with his people any part of his government , but he worked day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great power and devoted his life to making his people prosperous . Catherine of Russia , after gratifying her morbid desire for place and power , had left a wide margin of energy which she sincerely devoted to the welfare of her people . She was greatly interested in the French philosophers . She subscribed for the Encyclopedia and invited its editor to visit her in her palace . In order to put into practice some of the new ideas of reform she O // called a great assembly of the many races and classes of her empire to meet at Moscow . Her proposals of reform to this body were of a high order , but a war with Turkey broke up the meeting and nothing came of it . 380 . Joseph II of Austria ( 1765-1790 ) . Among the enlightened or benevolent despots of the second half of the eighteenth century the best was Joseph II of Austria . An admirer of the French philosophers , he determined to put their doctrines into practice . Joseph , the son of the great Austrian empress , Maria Theresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigious worker . Brushing aside the theory of the divine right of kings , he considered himself the servant of his people . Not only did he believe in reforms , he also set about putting them into practice . Among other reforms Joseph abolished serfdom and established religious toleration . He cut down greatly the expenses of his court ; he built colleges , hospitals , and factories . He established the freedom of the press to such a degree that his enemies could publish libels and attacks against him . There can be no doubt of Joseph 's desire to rule well . But he , like the other despots and like the French writers , had not taken into account the deeprooted habits and traditions of the people . In his belief that his reign of intelligence would be eagerly received , he put forth his best efforts . But society was not ready for such drastic changes . They awakened opposition on all sides , and his well-meant efforts produced little permanent effect . SIDE TALK Cagliostro . ? A few years before the Revolution there appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cagliostro ( kal-yos'tro ) , an assumed name . He was one of the most successful swindlers known in history and has been called the king of liars . Thomas Carlyle wrote a biography under the title , The Arch Quack . Born in Palermo , Sicily , Cagliostro became notorious in childhood for trickery , theft , and forgery , and while yet a youth was forced to flee from his native town . Then began his astonishing career of travel and deception . He went to Egypt , where , with a little knowledge of // chemistry , he made much money by pretending to change baser fabrics into silk . Returning to Europe , he married a wife who quickly fell into his ways . They traveled over Europe with a coach and four horses , visiting nearly every capital and often finding access to the highest social circles . They sold potions and charms and pretended to heal the sick and restore youth to the aged . They carried a wine of Egypt which they sold in drops to restore youth and beauty to the old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that they were past sixty , had a son in the Dutch army , and had been restored to youth by their own medicine . Their dupes numbered thousands , some of whom were among the nobility . One rich cardinal yielded himself wholly into the power of Cagliostro . But now and then their dupes , whose eyes were opened to the trickery , became troublesome ; hence , the charlatan and his wife suffered imprisonment in London , Paris , and other cities . In Paris they spent nine months in the Bastille . At length Cagliostro , having wandered to Rome , met his final downfall . The church authorities had long had their eyes upon him . He was arrested , tried , and condemned to spend the remainder of his life in prison , where he died afew years later ( 1795 ) . CHAPTER XXXII THE EARLY PERIOD OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION I. THE KING AND THE STATES ? GENERAL THE great upheaval in European society known as the French Revolution ' was at hand . The Renaissance had brought intellectual freedom ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke the political shackles , the royal tyranny of the ages , and brought the recognition of the rights of the common man . 381 . Causes of the Revolution . ? The trampling of the rights of the common people in the dust by the privileged classes , and a growing consciousness of the increasing power of the common people , especially of the middle class , were among the general causes of the outbreak . But there were more specific and immediate causes . The annual deficit in the public treasury had become alarming . Coupled with this was the exasperating fact that the frivolous privileged classes refused to curb their reckless extravagance . Thousands of idle pensioners swarmed about Paris and Versailles , drawing their regular stipends from the treasury . The support of the army cost less than the pay of the officers . Of these there were 36,000 on the payroll and only 13,000 in actual service . The American Revolution hastened the crisis in France . The French efforts to aid America greatly increased the national deficit and thus brought nearer the day of reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career of Lafayette in America , they pondered the Declaration of Independence , // and they rejoiced over the defeat of Burgoyne and the surrender of Cornwallis . All this , not merely because of their hatred of Great Britain , which had robbed them of Canada , but because of a new-born interest in liberty and democracy . An English traveler in France declared that the American Revolution had laid the foundations for a revolution in France . 382 . Louis XV ( 1715-1774 ) . ? The wars of the Grand Monarch , Louis XIV , as noted in an earlier chapter , left France in a weakened condition . On his death in 1715 his successor was but a child , his great-grandson , who ascended the throne as Louis XV . Spending his boyhood with a shameless tutor who led him into vice rather than virtue , the unhappy lad on reaching manhood was ill fitted to wear a crown and govern a nation . He spent his days in debauchery and frivolity , and the nation almost went to pieces . For having such a king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talents was unappreciated and was recalled ( sec. 369 ) ; India was given up . The valiant Montcalm ' , the noblest Frenchman of them all , was not properly supported , and Canada was lost ( sec. 370 ) . The national debt piled high while France was losing in all her wars . The thoughtless king had sense enough to foresee the corning storm . Ile expressed the hope that the machine would run itself as long as he lived , " and after us , the deluge , " he declared . 383 . Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette . ? Louis XVI , who succeeded his grandfather Louis XV in 1774 , was a man of correct habits and sound morals , but he was a weak ruler . He was not wanting in courage ; and his ultimate motive , his sincere desire to do the best in his power for his people , was beyond question . But he was utterly wanting in the power of leadership and in the ability to appreciate talent in others . He was slow of speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a decision . In person he was short , fat , dull , and unattractive . Louis had married Marie Antoinette ( ma-re ' aN-twa-net ' ) , // the beautiful sister of Joseph I I of Austria ( sec. 380 ) , and daughter of the famous Maria Theresa . The two were not well matched . Louis was too phlegmatic and plodding to be a companion to the gay and girlish princess . She sought her companionship elsewhere , often among questionable characters . The queen was no doubt virtuous , but her free and reckless manner in speech and action gave rise to many a scandal . Moreover , the French queen had the narrowest conception of human nature . She knew only the little circle in which she moved . That the common people were not utterly sordid , that they might have feelings and aspirations , was beyond the comprehension of Marie Antoinette . And when the storm broke all these things were remembered against her , ? and against her husband . 384 . Louis and Turgot . ? There was one man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turgot one of the greatest statesmen and economists of his time . He was a second Colbert ( sec. 352 ) . In 1774 , the year when Louis XVI came to the throne , he called Turgot to be his chief minister . Turgot saw whither the country was drifting , and he laid hold on the finances with the hand of a master . He reformed the methods of taxgathering , lowered the taxes of the peasants , and abolished the forced labor on the public highways . Furthermore , he determined to tax the lands of the nobles and the clergy , to cut down great numbers of shameless pensions , and to abolish useless offices . Other radical changes also this great reformer had in mind when his public career was cut short . He was hated by the nobles and even by the queen because he disturbed their pleasures . The king had not the stamina to . resist the clamor against his great minister , who was therefore dismissed after twenty months ' service . Even in that time he had left a surplus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The States-General . ? After the dismissal of Turgot the old corrupt regime was quickly reinstated . The annual 1 Later the king called Necker , a rich hanker , to manage the finances . Necker also attempted to introduce reforms , and like Turgot was forced to retire . // deficit increased alarmingly . The country 's credit fell until it was no longer possible to borrow . In despair the king called an Assembly of Notables , in 1787 , composed of the higher nobility and clergy . When the distress of the country was laid before this body , and it was proposed to tax their lands , a howl of protest and indignation arose . The notables deemed it a disgrace for them to pay taxes . The assembly adjourned and nothing was done . " The States-General " soon became the cry all over France . The States-General was a body representing all France , ? nobles , clergy , and the common people . It dated back in its origin to the Middle Ages . Its first meeting was held in 1302 . It differed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . The only function of the States-General was to advise with the king , apprise him of conditions , and aid him to carry out his purposes . For three centuries the States-General met at irregular intervals , but when France became an absolute monarchy it was no longer called together . No meeting had been called for 175 years . It was the last resort , but the country was in distress and the notables with their extensive untaxed lands had refused to come to the rescue . Could they only have foreseen what was to happen within one short year ! The king at length yielded to the universal demand . He ordered the election of delegates to the States-General. 386 . Meeting of the States-General ( May 5 , 1789 ) . ? All France was profoundly stirred by the calling of the States-General . All taxpayers , even the peasants , were permitted to take part in the elections , and they had become thoroughly interested . They were also invited to present their grievances , and the numbers presented were amazing . The pent-up bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was clearly to be seen now that the old conditions were doomed . In some parts of the kingdom the peasants were already refusing to pay their feudal dues , or they were even driving the noble hunter from their fields at the point of a gun . The // privileged classes quickly saw the handwriting on the wall . Many of them were now ready to make concessions , to pay taxes , and give up many of their special privileges . But it was too late . What a year ago would have been joyfully welcomed by the people they now brushed aside unheeded . The people had been asked to send their delegates and to present their grievances . They had done both and with eagerness they would await the outcome . Under these conditions , and in the midst of great throngs of excited people who had gathered from all over the kingdom , the 1200 elected delegates of the States-General met at the royal city of Versailles . 387 . The Oath of the Tennis Court . ? The enthusiasm of the expectant multitudes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates elected numbered about 1200 , half of whom represented the common people or Third Estate , while each of the other orders had 300 . The delegates of the privileged orders insisted that the three classes meet separately , each having a veto on the action of the other two . By this plan every measure of reform that the commons might propose could be thwarted by the upper classes . The commons would listen to no such arrangement . They determined that the three orders should meet as one body , every man having a vote . Day after day the commons sat in their hall and waited . Five weeks passed ; nothing was done . At length the Third Estate resolved itself into the National Assembly , declaring that as it represented ninety-six per cent of the nation , the other two orders might properly be ignored . This was a bold and revolutionary move . The classes were alarmed at this radical action by the masses . A day or two later the king ordered that the hall in which the commons met be closed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the doors locked and sentinels on guard . Thereupon these representatives of the people met in a near-by tennis court and there took a solemn oath that they // would never separate until they had established a constitution for Frances 388 . Victory of the Commons . ? Many deputies of the clergy joined the commons , their sympathies being with the people rather than with the privileged classes . Alarmed at the drift of things , the king called a joint session of the orders and , after making an address with a promise of reforms , commanded the three orders to disperse and meet as separate bodies . The nobles and upper clergy followed him as he withdrew , but the commons sat still . Later the king 's agent returned to remind them haughtily of the royal command . Then rose Mirabeau ( me-rabo ' ) , who was to prove himself the leading statesman of the Revolution , and in a voice of thunder said , " Go tell your master that // we are here by the will of the people and that nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was open defiance of kingly authority , ? a thing unheard of in France for centuries . By this time the city of Paris , but a few miles away , was in an uproar . The wrath of the people was rising against the king and the upper classes . The king , becoming alarmed , at last ordered the nobles and clergy to sit with the commons in joint sessions ? just what the commons had demanded from the beginning . The victory was a vital one for the people . 389 . Fall of the Bastille . ? Great was the excitement in Paris during the second week of July , 1789 . The ruffians and idlers of the great city were joined by thousands of vagabonds from all sections . The king stationed several thousand veteran soldiers near the city to overawe the National Assembly , and it was rumored that they were about to make an attack on the unarmed people . The better middle class then joined hands with the ruffians . They threw up barricades in the streets and sacked The King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The soldiers failed to appear , and the maddened ' crowd spent its fury on the Bastille . The Bastille was a great stone fort and prison in Paris . It was not a penitentiary , but a prison for state offenders , an emblem of absolute royal authority and of feudal tyranny . On this account it was hateful to lovers of liberty . The attack on the Bastille was led by a young journalist , Camille Desmoulins ( ka-mel ' da-moo-T ) who leaped upon a table in a public garden and with wild gestures shouted to the mob , " To arms , to arms ! " All night , and all the next day and night , the lawless crowd surged through the streets . Then they made their way to the Bastille , where many arms were kept . After some hours of onslaught the garrison yielded and the great prison fell into the hands of the mob . They looted it from cellar to garret . They killed its defenders and cut off the head of the commander and carried it exultantly on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the king at Versailles was awakened from sleep and told of the event . " This is riot , " he exclaimed . " No , " answered the messenger , " it is revolution . " The fall of the Bastille 1 was a great event in French history . It marked the end of feudal oppression and the dawn of liberty . To this day the French people celebrate the day of its fall , July 14 , as we celebrate the fourth of the same month as the birthday of liberty . When the news of what the mob had done in Paris reached the provinces , the people became intoxicated with their new-born freedom . In reckless fury they stormed the castles of their noble masters , and the masters fled for their lives . Many of the castles and many abbeys of the monks were burned to the ground ; others . // were ransacked from top to bottom . Whatever else the peasants did , they were sure to destroy the parchments , the feudal titles to their little farms . II . WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? A great movement will develop great characters . So it was with the French Revolution . But it happened that the great leaders were all on one side . The royal party developed no strong man . Many of the effeminate nobility fled the country . The weak and vacillating king was left to cope with forces that he could not master . He was like a feeble boatman caught in a mighty whirl of rolling waters and overwhelmed . On the other side we find some real leaders . The greatest figure of the Revolution was Count Mirabeau . Rejected by his own class as a delegate to the States-General , he was elected by the people . Tall and masterful in appearance , towering above other men , profoundly convinced of his own strength , with a shock of powdered hair that shook like a lion 's mane when he spoke before the National Assembly , he rose to every occasion with an eloquence that was overpowering . Mirabeau had led a life of dissipation and he had much prejudice to overcome . His espousal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was cautious , never radical . His vision was that of a statesman . It is possible that the Revolution might have taken a different course but for the untimely death of Mirabeau . One of the stanch leaders of the Assembly was Sieges ( sya-yes ' ) , who was elected by the commons of Paris and who became a champion of the people 's cause . Before the election of the StatesGeneral , he had published a stirring pamphlet and touched a popular chord by his triple question , " What is the Third Estate ? Everything . What has it been so far to the state ? Nothing . What does it ask to be ? Something . " Sieyes did more than any one else in framing the new constitution . Another conspicuous figure was the Marquis de Lafayette . Recently returned from America , where he had served valiantly Work of the National Assembly 451 under Washington , he was well known throughout Europe . Though a noble by birth and training , a favorite in his youth of the royal family , at heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French system of government . 391 . Renunciation of Feudal Privileges . ? The greatest day in the French Revolution was August 4 , 1 789 . On that day the nobles renounced their privileges . The session of the National Assembly continued far into the night . One after another the nobles rose and gave up the special privileges which they and their ancestors had enjoyed since far back in the Middle Ages . ' Amid great enthusiasm the Assembly then passed a decree declaring that henceforth the taxes upon all classes should be alike in accordance with their property , and that henceforth all citizens , without distinction of birth , should be eligible to any office or dignity . ' Here in a nutshell is the whole substance of the Revolution . Already the king had yielded part of the governing power to the people . The equalizing now , on this night of August 4 , of the rights of the people with the rights of their former masters , completed the work ? all done within three months of the meeting of the States-General. 392 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a work of pure destruction . The old fabric did not suit the age . It had to be torn down , and it was . Now remained the more difficult work of construction , of building a great government on a new plan . Why should it not be done without violence ? After the American Revolution the American people got together deliberately and sensibly and established a national government without bloodshed . Could the French do this ? But the French were of a different temperament , and were utterly without experience in self-government . // The work of construction was long and laborious and often bloody . The nation swayed between violent disorder and republicanism on the one hand and reestablished monarchy on the other , and eighty years passed before it settled into its present form of government , which seems to promise to endure . But with all the tossings and changes from that time until now the people of France have never lost for a day the priceless boon of equal rights which had been won in those three months ending on that memorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Versailles . ? Comparative quiet reigned for a time after the abolishing of privileges , but the restless masses of the metropolis soon again showed signs of disorder . Led by violent agitators such as Marat ( ma-ra ' ) and Desmoulins , they came to distrust the middle class as well as the nobles , and to believe themselves the only " patriots . " Moreover , the crops of the preceding summer were meager , the city was filled with idlers , and , in short , Paris was hungry . Great crowds paraded the streets crying for bread . There was still a profound respect for the king , and it was believed that if he knew of their distress he would aid them . Goaded by hunger , a great crowd of women set out for Versailles ( October 5 ) . Weary and haggard , thousands of women and a smaller number of men , including the riffraff of Paris , tramped through the mud and rain twelve miles to the royal city . Lafayette , commander of the newly organized volunteer National Guards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All night the howling , bedraggled multitude paraded the streets , of Versailles . In the early morning the mob broke into the palace and would have slain the queen but for the fact that some of her faithful guards enabled her to escape by giving their lives in her defense . Owing to the demands of the crowd and the advice of Lafayette , the king decided to remove to Paris . The royal carriage , accompanied by thousands of haggard creatures , was driven to the great city . " We have the baker , the baker 's wife and the baker 's Work of the National Assembly 453 little boy , " they cried jocularly , referring to the king and the queen and their little son . The palace of the Tuileries ( twel-re ' ) now became the royal residence . The National Assembly also was transferred to Paris . The change was most unfortunate , for the lower elements of Paris were fast becoming dominant and would soon by violent uprisings be able to overawe both king and Assembly . Mirabeau foresaw this and urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But nothing was done , and what he predicted came to pass . 394 ? Mirabeau . ? During the next year and a half the strong man in the Assembly was Mirabeau . He believed that the salvation of France lay in establishing a limited monarchy . He stood for a middle conservative course , being at once the adviser of the king and of the radicals . Both mistrusted him and his task was herculean . Mirabeau made great headway in the difficult task he had set for himself ? to strike a balance and effect a peaceful compromise between the royalist party and the wild forces of the Revolution . More and more the extremes were coming to respect his judgment . But the weight of his labors was too heavy ; he reeled under the burden . His life of dissipation had weakened his stalwart frame , and this greatest Frenchman of the time passed away on April 2 , 1791 . Noisy Paris was hushed to silence at the death of Mirabeau , and his funeral was the largest ever known in France . Mirabeau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totter and fall and its ruins would become a prey of factions ; also , that the Revolution , like Saturn , would devour its own children . ' 395 ? Clubs and Parties . ? The violence of the rabble of Paris was increased by the flood of pamphlets and newspapers published // by the leading agitators , and by debating clubs that sprang up in all quarters . Coffee houses and various other resorts became the meeting places where exciting questions of the day were vigorously discussed . Two of these clubs grew into political parties and became national in scope . The first of the radical parties was the Cordelier ' party . Led by wily agitators , it did much to keep the lower classes stirred up against the government . Another of the early parties was the Jac'obin party , so called from the building in which it was organized . This party was at first more moderate than the Cordeliers , but it grew more radical ; it organized branches in all parts of the country , and at length , as we shall see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the mother of many wild uprisings in Paris , and of the Reign of Terror . Its most conspicuous leader was Robespierre ( ro-bes-pyar ' ) . The Girondist ( ji-ron'dist ) party ( from Gironde , the province from which its leaders came ) was of later and quite different origin ; it was very important for a time as the most formidable rival of the Jacobins. 396 . The Emigration ; the Flight of the King . In the summer of 1789 , when it became clear that the masses would prevail over the classes in the great French struggle , the nobles began to leave the country in large numbers . They made their headquarters in German territory on the Rhine , and from there they stirred ? up all the trouble they could against their native land . Among the " emigrants " were the two younger brothers of the king . After the death of Mirabeau the king and queen felt more than ever that their personal safety in Paris was endangered . Day after day and night after night the lawless mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The royal family determined on secret flight . At midnight , disguised as a valet , Louis XVI with his family escaped from the city . By relays of swift horses their carriage rumbled away for many miles , almost to the border of France . But being recognized at Varennes ( va-ren ' ) , they were apprehended and brought back to Paris . I // The people feared that if the king left France he would raise armies against her in an effort to recover his lost power , and never again was he permitted to leave the city . 397 . Work of the National Assembly . ? A few weeks after the meeting of the States-General , as we have seen ( sec. 387 ) , the Third Estate resolved itself into the National Assembly and took the Oath of the Tennis Court that it would give France a constitution . Two and a half years were required to accomplish this great work . France fell almost into a state of anarchy while the Assembly slowly ground out the constitution . As this constitution was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at length . Only a few of the main features can // be mentioned . It established a constitutional or limited monarchy ; it retained the king as executive , but gave him too little power . The governing power was vested in a Legislative Assembly to be elected by men who paid taxes equaling three days ' labor . It formed a government of the middle class . The royal party was displeased because the king was made little more than a figurehead ; the lower classes were displeased because a property test excluded at least a million men from the ballot . Above all , the Catholic Church was displeased . The National Assembly seized all the church lands in France and // provided that the clergy be paid their salaries out of the public treasury . It also required that the clergy take an oath of fidelity to the new constitution . Great numbers of them could not do this conscientiously and they refused . Henceforth there was strife between the church and the forces of the Revolution . But the National Assembly did some things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries and divided France into eighty-three departments ; and it equalized taxes . ' The new constitution completed , the National Assembly dissolved , September 30 , 1791 , and was succeeded by the newlyelected Legislative Assembly . The new government began auspiciously . The absolute monarchy had been changed to a limited one . Many believed that the Revolution was over , but in reality only the first phase of it had closed . // covered that she had never purchased the necklace and that the notes he held were pure forgeries . The cardinal and his accomplice were brought to trial and both were obliged to flee from France . The scandal became the talk of the town in every village and hamlet in France , and every court of Europe . There is scarcely a doubt that Marie Antoinette was entirely innocent ; but her enemies spread the story that she had conspired to obtain the necklace in this fraudulent way and then to refuse to acknowledge her signature to the notes . A great many people believed this , and the belief no doubt had something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER XXXIII FALL OF THE MONARCHY ; FIRST FRENCH REPUBLIC I. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY , OCTOBER I , 1791 , TO SEPTEMBER 20 , 1792 398 . A New Set of Leaders . ? At a foolish moment of selfdenial the National Assembly had voted that none of its members should be eligible to the new Assembly that was to carry the constitution into effect . The 745 members of the new Legislative Assembly , therefore , were without experience , mostly young lawyers and journalists , burning with enthusiasm but ill-fitted for the great work that was before them . Almost from the beginning it was clear that this body opposed the retaining of the monarchy , even the limited monarchy that the constitution had set up . The Assembly divided into political parties , and the two most powerful , the Girondist and the Jacobin parties , both were in favor of abolishing the monarchy and setting up a republic . The revolution thus far accomplished was mild in comparison with the violent and bloody one that was to follow . As to leadership , Mirabeau was dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of harmony with the new spirit and his influence gone . The most conspicuous leaders of the second Revolution were Robespierre , Marat , and Danton ( daNtoN ' ) , all of whom were destined to meet a violent death within the coming three years . Robespierre was a " dapper little lawyer " who won great popularity and for a time was the idol of the nation . Marat had been a physician . He became a violent revolutionist , published a newspaper , and inflamed the lower classes to madness by his vicious editorials. 459 46o The French Revolution Danton , next to Mirabeau , was the greatest figure of the Revolution . Powerful , eloquent , and gifted with the qualities of leadership , Danton was a constructive statesman of high order and deserved to be called the Mirabeau of the second phase of the Revolution . 399 . War with Austria and Prussia . ? The runaway nobles along the Rhine , led by the two brothers of the king , did all in their power to engage foreign armies against France . Exasperated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Assembly declared war against that country on April 20 , 1792 . An alliance between Austria and Prussia brought the latter country into the war also . King Louis signed the declaration of war because he knew that a refusal would have brought a revolt such as had never before been known . But one can imagine how humiliating it must have been , for at this time he was secretly encouraging the Austrians to come and rescue him from the prison of his own capital . As the summer approached an Austro-Prussian army crossed the French frontier and marched toward Paris . Leading the invasion was the Duke of Brunswick , an old commander of Frederick the Great . In July the duke issued a proclamation to the people of France declaring that he came to put an end to the anarchy and to restore the king to his rightful powers , ? that he would punish with death all taken with arms in their hands , and if King Louis were injured , the city of Paris would be given over to destruction . 400 . Fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolent proclamation , the people of Paris broke into furious and uncontrollable passion . Stung to madness by their belief that the king was in league with the invading foe , the people demanded that he be dethroned . From Marseilles ( mar-salz ' ) on the Mediterranean Sea came 500 men , dragging their cannon through the July dust for hundreds of miles . They entered Paris singing a new revolutionary hymn , that most stirring of national songs , the Marseillaise ( mar-se-laz ' ) , and demanded the dethronement // of the king . On August 1o , 1792 , came the crisis , a memorable day in the French Revolution . The radicals , having seized the city government , determined to stir up an insurrection . All through the night preceding , the bells of Paris , rung by Jacobin hands , sent out their peals . From the slums and from every section of the city multitudes came , arming themselves with pikes and muskets . In the early morning the mobs gathered about the palace of the Tuileries , the dwelling place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have saved his throne and made a great name for himself that day . He had 1500 Swiss guards and many other defenders , thoroughly trained , faithful to his orders and well posted , about the palace . But Louis was utterly wanting in the powers of leadership . Having taken refuge with the Legislative Assembly in a near-by hall , he wrote an order that his defenders should not fire on the besieging crowds . It was a stupid and tragic blunder . At the first onset the Swiss drove back the insurgents with a deadly volley . The mob came again , but the Swiss had now received the order not to fire . The infuriated multitude , knowing nothing of the king 's order , struck down the noble Swiss in their tracks or hunted them to death as they were trying to escape . The Swiss were massacred almost to the last man . All day the king sat in the Assembly chamber . He heard the roar of the cannon and the shrieks of his dying guards without . He heard also the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office as king of France , and witnessed its final passage by a-unanimous vote . The mob had overawed the Assembly . The Duke of Brunswick had received his answer . 401 . Dumouriez Checks the Invasion . ? Never in history had a people risen more grandly than the French now rose to beat back the invaders of their country . At their head was the superb figure of Danton . Day and night he labored to rouse the people and equip the armies . To the Assembly he shouted with the dashing splendor of Mirabeau , " Our country is in danger , " and " to dare and dare and dare again , alone will save it . " // Dumouriez ( dii-moo-rya ' ) was the commanding general . With a badly equipped , half-trained army he marched against the invaders . The French were successful . They turned back the invaders and took several German towns on the Rhine . Later Dumouriez occupied the southern Netherlands ( now Belgium ) , then a possession of Austria . The rejoicing in France was great , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opportunity to carry the principles of the Revolution to foreign lands . 402 . The September Massacres . ? Meantime an atrocious crime had been committed in Paris . In the fear that there would be a royalist uprising in Paris after the strong men had gone to the war , great numbers of royalists and priests had been thrown into prison on suspicion . To terrify the royalist party and to secure more room in the crowded prisons the leaders of the city government of Paris , called the Commune , decided on a coldblooded massacre ( September , 1792 ) . With the merest sham of a trial , hundreds of men and women were slain by assassins at the prison doors . It is a dark page in the story of the Revolution ? the shocking tale of these September massacres . But they had the intended effect . The royalist party was completely subdued . II . THE NATIONAL CONVENTION ; THE REIGN OF TERROR 403 . Birth of the Republic and Death of the King . ? When the king was suspended in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . The Legislative Assembly thereupon provided that a new body be elected to draft a new constitution and to govern the country at the same time . This body was called the National Convention . The Convention , composed of about eight hundred men , was entirely hostile to the monarchy , and its first act was to depose the suspended king and proclaim France a republic . This first French Republic dates from September 22 , 1792 , which was reckoned as the first day of the Year One . ' // How to dispose of the king was one of the hard problems that came before the Convention . He and his family had been kept close prisoners since August lo . To retain him indefinitely in prison would not be feasible , and it might give rise to endless intrigues of his friends . To banish him from the country would be to invite such troubles as the half century of annoyances to which England had been subjected by the Stuart pretenders ( sec. 368 ) . The ardent republicans believed that Louis should be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had secretly encouraged the enemies of France to invade the country . The fallen monarch was therefore tried by the Convention on a charge of treason . He was pronounced guilty and by a small majority was condemned to death . On January 21 , 1793 , Louis was put to death by means of the guillotine ( gil'o-ten ) , a newly invented machine for cutting off heads . He died bravely . In the following October , the widowed queen , Marie Antoinette , condemned for the same offense by a Revolutionary Tribunal , days each , the remaining five days being made holidays ; they divided each month into three weeks of ten days each , every tenth day being a rest day . // mounted the scaffold and with equal fortitude suffered the fate of her husband . ' 404 . The First Coalition. ? Monarchist Europe was stirred to wrath by the beheading of Louis XVI . To punish the regicides and to prevent the further spread of republicanism , a great coalition of the European powers was formed against France . Even Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers actually contemplated the partitioning of France and dividing up large sections of it among themselves . Now again French patriotism rose to heroic heights . As vigorous and immediate action was required , a Committee of Public Safety was created by the Convention and given almost unlimited powers . Lafayette had fled to Austria , and Dumouriez , disapproving the execution of the king , had deserted to the enemy . New generals were soon found and within a few months they had under arms at least three quarters of a million men . The organizer of this force was Lazare Carnot ( la-zar ' kar-no ' ) , one of the strong men of the time . The Allies began to move upon France , but not with the expected vigor . Some of them at this moment were more interested in the second partition of Poland ( sec. 366 ) . The French armies were generally successful , and by the end of the year 1793 all danger from the First Coalition had passed . 405 . The Mountain Crushes the Girondists . ? The Convention divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had done much toward overthrowing the monarchy and setting up the republic . But the leading Girondists , though splendid orators , were too theoretical and philosophic at a moment of public danger when action was necessary . They enjoyed debate rather than action . The Mountain was a more radical and violent party , so called because its members ? mostly Jacobins ? occupied the upper // tiers of seats in the Convention hall . At first the Mountain was in a hopeless minority in the Convention . But at its back were the rabble and all the violent elements of Paris , also the Paris commune or city governing body . Why not invoke the Paris mob against their enemies ? On various occasions in the overthrow of the monarchy the mob had played a leading part . Why should it not be equally potent in overthrowing the Girondists ? So thought the Jacobins , and on this idea they acted . The mob of Paris was again stirred to fury . On June 2 , 1793 , all the fanatical elements of the great city surrounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Convention . Again the mob was successful and about thirty of the leading Girondists were placed under arrest ; many of them later were put to death . This violent method of the radicals in triumphing over the more moderate party awakened a fierce resentment in the various parts of France . In La Vendee ( la-vaN-da ' ) , Bordeaux ( bor-do ' ) , Ly'ons , and Toulon ( too-ION ' ) the people rose in revolt , but were put down with a ruthless hand . At Toulon the city was subdued by the skill of a young artillery officer , hitherto unknown , but destined to become the most conspicuous man in French history in a thousand years ? Napo'leon Bo'naparte. 406 . The Terror at its Height . ? The most revolting feature of the French Revolution was the Terror , which lasted about ten months ? from September , 1793 , to July of the next year . ' It seemed that the French nation had gone mad . The Jacobins composing the Mountain became uncontrollably and fanatically radical . No one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning point . They imagined plots against the Revolution on all sides . They passed the Law of the Suspects by which any one could be imprisoned on mere suspicion . Thus thousands of people were sent to prison for no crime , except that they were supposed to sympathize with the royalists . // When the prisons became crowded , they were emptied by the Revolutionary Tribunal , a kind of court created . to try the prisoners . But so many were the victims brought before this tribunal . that it could give them no real trial . They had no chance of self-defense . Hundreds were condemned to death by the mere reading of their names before the tribunal . In the heart of the city was the Square of the Revolution , and there stood the ghastly guillotine . To this bloody ground the hapless victims , men and women of high and low degree , were brought in crowds day after day , and in the midst of a hooting , staring crowd of idlers , their heads were rolled into the basket . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman of fine mind and of noble qualities . She was an ardent republican , but she had displeased the Jacobins and her fate was sealed . While on her way to the place of execution , she passed a statue of liberty and looking at it exclaimed , " Oh , Liberty , what crimes are committed in thy name ! " 407 . Marat and Charlotte Corday . ? One of the wildest of the fanatics was Dr. Marat , formerly a physician , now an inciter of mob violence by means of a newspaper . He seemed to prefer mob rule to law and order . Nothing was too violent for this sometime doctor , and no amount of bloodshed seemed to glut his // savage vengeance . It was chiefly due to him that the patriotic Girondists were hounded to their death . In the province of Normandy there was a beautiful and nobleminded girl named Charlotte Corday ( kor-de ' ) . Deeply grieved at the horrors of the guillotine in Paris , and believing that Marat was the soul of the Terror and the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? she would go to Paris and save her country by killing Marat . With a concealed dagger she sought and obtained entrance into his house and stabbed him to death . A few days later the girl-assassin paid the penalty of her crime at the guillotine . The death of Marat did not stop the Terror nor aid the remaining Girondists ; but if ever there was an assassin whom the world has forgiven , it was Charlotte Corday. 408 . Death of Danton . ? The two great leaders in France at this period were Danton and Robespierre . Both were sincere men , upright and intensely anxious to regenerate France and make it the model of the world . Both belonged to the party composing the Mountain , and in common they believed that the free use of the guillotine was necessary to rid the country of a class that would plot against the republic if they could . Danton was the more powerful and the more admirable of the two . As minister of justice he proved himself one of the leading statesmen in French history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He became an idol of the people , but was never popular in the Convention . On two occasions while speaking before the Convention he was unnerved by the hooting of his enemies , when Danton came to his rescue . " Go on , " rose the deep , rich voice of the orator , " Go on , Robespierre , there are many good citizens here to listen . " Soon came a change . Danton grew weary of bloodshed . Believing that the Revolution needed to be sustained no longer by the guillotine , he gave his voice for moderation . This did not please the radicals , who still thirsted for blood . Many of them were enemies of Danton and they made his change of heart // a pretext to attack him . On various flimsy charges this titanic leader who had saved France ( sec. 401 ) was arrested , was given a farcical trial and condemned to death , and with him perished the witty , brilliant Camille Desmoulins , who had also joined the moderates . 409 . Death of Robespierrre ; End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the destruction of his great friend , Danton , but he could have prevented it and did not . He approved it and aided in bringing it about . Why Robespierre took this position is scarcely known . Perhaps he was jealous of the great name Dan ton had made and wished to be rid of his only formidable rival ; perhaps Robespierre saw that the Terror would surely continue for a time and wished to be on the popular side . As Danton was passing the home of Robespierre while being carted to the guillotine , he shouted in a powerful voice , " You will soon follow us ! " Robespierre was now the leading man in France . He had sent Danton to his death and also a gang of atheists who had made a bitter fight on the Catholic churches of Paris . He led the Convention to affirm that the French people recognized a Supreme Being , in whose honor he held a solemn festival , himself acting as the high priest . Meantime the Terror went on at a more rapid pace ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1794 , numbered 1356 . Robespierre , contrary to popular belief , was not the chief instigator of this slaughter . The fact that it ceased with his death makes it difficult to undo this popular error . There is ample evidence that he wanted it to be stopped , but could not control the men who desired it to go on , and it is certain that Robespierre was survived by many men far more blood-guilty than himself . In July , 1794 , he was overwhelmed by his enemies and sent to his death . Surely the Revolution , like Saturn , was devouring its own children . The Terror ceased , not because of the fall of Robespierre , but because the public mind was revolting against it and would // tolerate it no longer . The vilest of the men who had carried it on now saw the turn of the tide and promptly cast all the odium on the head of the dead Robespierre . The nation returned to a state of sanity and order . 410 . Constitution of the Year III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of permanent value that it did was to adopt the metric system of weights and measures , which has gone into use in many parts of the world . The great work of the Convention was to frame a new constitution . This was finished in the fall of 1795 , the third year of the republic , and was called the Constitution of the Year III . By this a new government was created , known as the Directory because the executive power was placed in the hands of five Directors . Under the first constitution the Legislative Assembly or parliament consisted of one house ; under this second constitution there were two houses , the lower house being called the Council of Five Hundred and the upper one the Council of the Ancients . The terror of the guillotine having ceased , the enemies of the Convention again raised their heads . The royalists stirred up an attack on October 5 , 1795 , but it was repulsed with the slaughter of hundreds . The defense of the Convention was in the hands of young Bonaparte , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few weeks later the life of the Convention came to an end ( October 26 ) and the government of the Directory came into being . 411 . Passing of the High Tide . ? With the adjournment of the Convention in the autumn of 1795 , the high tide of the Revolution had passed . A backward glance will show much disorder and bloodshed . It will reveal to us again the bitter hatred between the masses and the classes , the murderous rising of the lawless mob , the execution of a king and queen whose personal characters deserved respect . We note also a wave of irreverent atheism sweep over the land , the destruction of old landmarks , churches and castles , and the slaying of many innocent men and women . Finally we see the leaders , in their frenzied zeal for reform , turning upon and slaying one another . // Many of the reforming zealots were men of high personal character , and though they lost their heads and ordered wholesale executions , they abhorred the practice of the Middle Ages of torturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since the meeting of the States-General , France had been regenerated through her baptism of blood . The common people had been awakened toa sense of their rights and responsibilities ; thousands of square miles of hunting lands had been changed into farms and gardens , and a universal system of education , the first ever known in France , hadbeen established . Results of the Revolution . ? Deeply as we deplore the excesses of the French Drawing of a funeral urn with the profile of Louis Revolution , the wild XVI in the base at the left , Marie Antoinette at the disorder and the Reign right , the Dauphin in the willow tree at the right margin , and his sister Madame Royale at the left of Terror , we must not of the king 's head . Made for sympathetic royalists overlook the fact that by a contemporary artist . it was the beginning of momentous changes of the most far-reaching importance . The principle of the Revolution , democracy , has spread in nearly all countries . Nothing in modern history is of more importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England had already worked out partial self-government , but on the Continent , except in the two little countries , Holland and Switzerland , the people had no rights whatever against the will of their sovereigns , not even the right to life and property .

To-day , however , through the emancipation of the masses of the people , the common man has come into his own . His government now offers him not wealth or talent or station , but opportunity , a chance to make the best of himself . This had been denied him under the old regime . Who can tell how many Newtons and Franklins and Edisons lived and died unknown during the Middle Ages , never having learned to read ? No wonder the progress was slow . The marvelous advance of the past hundred years is due largely to the fact that the masses of the people have been given a chance ? and the ball was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution may be expressed in this brief sentence , ? One man is as good as another , ? which means that all should enjoy the same rights and opportunities . CHAPTER XXXIV NAPOLEON BONAPARTE I. NAPOLEON BECOMES MASTER OF FRANCE 413 . Beginning of Napoleon 's Career . ? No one can tell what might have been the story of France in the next two decades but for the unexpected appearance of this most remarkable character in the history of modern times . Born in 1769 on the island of Corsica , of Italian descent , the second son in a family of eight children , Napoleon Bonaparte spent several years of his boyhood in military schools in France . Thrown in the classroom among nobles who twitted him for his poverty , he came to feel bitter against them and their country . As a young man he returned to his native island and planned a revolt against the government of France , to which the island belonged . But he displeased the local authorities and was banished from Corsica . Henceforth his destiny was one with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention first at Toulon and again at Paris . 414 . The Italian Campaign . ? The great career of Napoleon began when the French Directory sent him on his famous Italian campaign , one of the most brilliant of his life . It was in the spring of 1796 . Peace had been made with Prussia and Spain , but Great Britain and Austria were still at war with France . The want of a French fleet made it difficult to attack England , and it was determined to attack Austria from three sides . Two splendid armies under well-tried generals were sent to attack the north . A third and much smaller army was given to General Bonaparte to make an attack from the south by way of Italy . The two northern armies were defeated and accomplished little ; the third was brilliantly successful . 472 // Europe was astonished at the series of lightning-like strokes by which the young Corsican commander won his victories . Leaving Paris late in March , he crossed the Alps with incredible swiftness . Ile soon occupied the Po ! Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay heavy ransoms but also despoiled the churches and galleries of many fine works of art , which were sent to France . This spirit of plunder was unknown in the earlier days of the Revolution . Austria sent army after army against Napoleon during the following months , but all in turn were defeated and many thousands of prisoners were taken . By the following spring the intrepid c o m // Napoleon returning to Paris was hailed as the hero of the nation . Not in a hundred years had France held so commanding a place in Europe , and it was the brilliant young Corsican commander who had given her such eminence . Conscious of his own powers , Napoleon already had it in mind to seize the government of France , but he saw that the time was not yet ripe . 415 . The Egyptian Adventure . ? The remaining enemy of France was England . To strike this enemy on his home soil was impossible . Napoleon suggested to the Directory an expedition to Egypt , led by himself , the purpose being to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even to cut that country off from her great possessions in India . The Directory was jealous of his popularity and gladly consented to the proposal , which would take him out of the country . With an army of 40,000 men , Napoleon embarked at Toulon in May , 1798 . By a narrow margin he eluded the battle fleet of Admiral Nelson , the great English naval commander , and landed at Alexandria . A month later his fleet was destroyed by Nelson in the famous battle of the Nile . Napoleon was now completely cut off from Europe , and his expedition became useless , although he won the battle of the Pyramidsr and gained control of Egypt.2 After making a fruitless excursion into Syria , and after hearing how matters stood in France , he determined to abandon his army in Egypt and return to Paris . Again eluding Nelson , he landed on the coast of France with a few followers in October , 1799 . Wild and enthusiastic was the rejoicing of the French people at this second return of their conquering hero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian campaign was lost sight of . Few of the people knew at this moment of the deep designs of this designing man . // 416 . Napoleon Seizes the French Government . ? Napoleon understood the French people better than they understood themselves . He saw that the time had come . He knew that the Directory , composed of five men , was corrupt and inefficient , that it lacked the confidence of the people , and that the country was broken into hostile parties . He knew that the people were weary unto death of disorder and bloodshed and revolution , and he believed that they were ready to welcome a strong hand at the helm of the ship of state . Moreover , the treasury was empty ; a second great coalition of the nations against France had been formed ; and already several French armies had been defeated . Even northern Italy , which he had won so brilliantly two years before , had been lost to the republic . Weary and disgusted with all these things , the French people , though they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , ? and here he was . On the 9th of November , ' 1799 , Napoleon Bonaparte seized the government of the French nation . The Directory was quickly forced to resign , but the Council of Five Hundred resisted fiercely , until Napoleon , imitating Cromwell with the Long Parliament , took possession of their hall with a band of soldiers . The members escaped speedily through doors and windows , and the Corsican commander , at the age of thirty years , was absolute master of France . 417 . A View of the New Master . ? The transcendent genius of Napoleon Bonaparte is acknowledged by all . In personal appearance he was not striking or impressive ; he was low of stature , thin and slight of body in early manhood . Yet there was something that compelled attention in his keen searching eye , his animated gestures , his quick , irregular speech . Such was the man who was to set up and pull down empires , to make and unmake kings and kingdoms , and to make his will the law for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hardly an equal in history . Seldom are more than three other warriors ? Alexander , Hanni476 The French Revolution bal , and Caesar ? mentioned in the same class with him . The two supreme qualities necessary for a successful commander he possessed in a high degree ? first , strategic ability , the power of faultless planning of campaigns and battles ; and second , the power of electrifying an army with his own spirit . As a statesman also Napoleon ranks among the greatest in history . The one vital point to be deplored in the make-up of this wonderful man is the fact that he was not guided by any high moral principles . Right and wrong were meaningless terms to him , and there is every reason to believe that the highest motive of his life was to gratify his insatiable selfish ambition for power and glory . II . THE CONSULATE ; NAPOLEON IN PEACE 418 . The Government under Napoleon . ? The Constitution of the Year III fell to pieces with the seizure of the government by Napoleon in the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution of the Year VIII . It abolished the Directory of five men and put in its place a Consulate of three men . The " first consul " was Napoleon Bonaparte . One of the other two ( for a short time ) was Sicyes , whom we met in the early days of the Revolution ( sec. 390 ) . Sicyes had helped to overthrow the old government . He had expected to have large powers in the new ; but after the first meeting of the three consuls he said to some friends , " Gentlemen , we have a master . The republic is no more ; it died to-day . " From this time on for fourteen years the will of Napoleon dominated the country as completely as any absolute monarch ever governed a nation . The new constitution was molded by his will so as to leave all ultimate power in his hands . The other two consuls , the legislative bodies , and every official in the nation were as puppets in the hands of the young Corsican prodigy . And from the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done on the battlefield. // He soon reestablished order throughout the country ; he recalled the noble emigrants and declared them eligible to office ; he cleared the country of bandits , reopened the churches , and placed the finances on a firm basis . The departments he governed by officers called prefects and subprefects , who took the place of the intendants of the days of the kings . 419 . Second Italian Campaign ; Luneville and Amiens . ? On Christmas Day , 1799 , Napoleon offered peace to Great Britain and Austria . Both refused . Great Britain , led by William Pitt the younger , one of the greatest of British premiers , suggested that France prove her good faith by recalling the Bourbons to the throne , which made the French furious . A few months later Napoleon astonished the Austrians by swooping down from the Alps into northern Italy . His army crossed the Alps by way of the Great St. Bernard Pass , rivaling the feat of Hannibal . The cannon were dragged through the snow-covered mountains in hollowed-out trunks of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maren'go ( June 14 , 1800 ) , in which at a single stroke Napoleon won back all of northern Italy . Meantime he had sent General Moreau ( mo-ro ' ) to strike Austria on the north . In December Moreau defeated the enemy at the battle of Hohenlinden ( ho-en-linden ) ; and with these two French victories Austria was humbled and sued for peace . The treaty of Luneville ( ltl-nl - vel ' ) followed ( 1801 ) and most of the provisions of Campo Formio were repeated . The Rhine River was made the eastern boundary of France . The next year , March 25 , 1802 , Napoleon made peace with Great Britain in the treaty of Amiens ( a-myaN ' ) , and for the first time since he came into power France was at peace with all the world . 420 . Progress in Peace . ? Great in war as Napoleon was , he was almost equally great in peace . Indeed , it may be said that while his military victories left no permanent effects , much of his constructive work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate was speedily fixed and the money of the country // made stable after being for years of uncertain and varying value . A sinking fund for the paying of the public debt was established , and the Bank of France was founded . Great activity in road and bridge building and in improving the docks became the order of the day . Two of the most memorable of Napoleon 's achievements were his treaty with the Catholic Church and his new code of laws . The forces of the Revolution had persecuted the church , especially the priests who had refused to take the oath prescribed for them . Napoleon was personally devoid of religious principles , but he saw clearly that by making some concessions he could gain the support of the church . He thereupon made a treaty with the pope in 18o1 , known as the Concor'dat . ' By this arrangement the rites of the Catholic Church might be freely observed . But the church none the less remained largely under the control of the government , which was to nominate the bishops , who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by experts appointed by Napoleon . The laws had been in a chaotic condition . They were now carefully collected and published in 1804 . This collection was called the Code Napoleon . It is still in use in France and in various other countries . One of the notable incidents of this period was the sale of Louisiana to the United States . Napoleon had recently received Louisiana from Spain , but he saw that Great Britain would be able to prevent him from building up a great colony across the Atlantic , and he therefore sold it rather than run the risk of losing it in war . III . THE EMPIRE AND TnE NAPOLEONIC WARS 421 . Napoleon Becomes Emperor . ? The personal ambition of this " man of destiny " was unbounded . No monarch of the ancient Orient was fonder of homage and adulation . Since the seizure of the government in I799 he had been absolute // master in France . In 18o2 he was made first consul for life with the power to choose his own successor . But his ambition was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the power of a monarch ? The pliant Senate , heedful of its master 's wishes , therefore formally requested him to become hereditary monarch with the title of emperor . No urging was needed . On December 2 , 1804 , in the great cathedral of Notre Dame ( no-tr ' dam ' ) in Paris , General Bonaparte was crowned as Napoleon I , Emperor of the French . The occasion was one of great pomp and ceremony . The crowd was innumerable ; the musicians alone numbered five hundred . The pope had come all the way from Rome expecting to place the crown on his head , but Napoleon took it and placed it on his own head . He wished the world to know that he was not indebted to the church , but to his own genius , for his success and his lofty eminence . Napoleon as emperor preserved for France one great principle of the Revolution ? equality before the law ? but at heart he was no democrat . He created a new nobility and introduced all the pomp of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his service , he bridled and guided the left-over forces of the Revolution , and he made the church subservient to his imperial will . Liberty of the press and freedom of speech were sternly suppressed by Napoleon . He terrorized and conciliated as suited his purpose . But withal , he governed France with a master hand ; his energy was prodigious and tireless . He established the Bank of France and the Legion of Honor ; he released the imprisoned priests and put a stop to forced loans ; he constructed roads and bridges and docks . The vast majority of the people were contented with the change . 422 . Napoleon 's Ambition . ? This mighty man was at the parting of the ways . What a name he could have left to the world had he now been content to spend the remainder of his life building up France and cultivating the friendship of her neighbors ! Already his military renown filled the world ; he needed no more glory of conquest . Already his country held a 48o The French Revolution commanding position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south her boundaries had been greatly enlarged , and it was due chiefly to himself . He enjoyed the unbounded confidence of his people . Could he only settle down to a life of peace and constructive statesmanship ! But he could not . To govern a nation in the ordinary way , even to be absolute monarch of a great world power , was to live a life too tame for Napoleon 's ambitious and restless soul . A soldier he was above all things , nor was he troubled with remorse on account of wholesale shedding of human blood . Moreover , he was obsessed with the idea that Europe should be a confederated state with a single imperial head . The peace with Great Britain continued but a year , when the treaty of Amiens was set aside . England induced Russia and Austria to join her and thus the Third Coalition was formed against France . Napoleon made ready to invade the British Isles , but the frowning cannon of Nelson 's men-of-war guarding the Channel made the undertaking too perilous , and suddenly he wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trafalgar and Austerlitz . ? Austria was Napoleon 's goal , and the campaign was won in a single decisive battle ? the great battle of Aus'terlitz . Isere on Dec. 2 , 1805 , a year from the day of his coronation at Notre Dame , Napoleon crushed the combined Austrian and Russian armies . In the treaty of Pressburg which followed , Austria gave up much of her territory , including Venice , acknowledged the independence of Baden ( ba'den ) , and agreed that the rulers of Bavaria ( ba-va'ri-a ) and Wurttemberg ( vur'tem-berx ) be raised to the rank of kings . These and several other German states were then formed into the Confederation of the Rhine , with Napoleon as " Protector . " The next year , 1806 , witnessed the extinguishing of the old German Empire , or Holy Roman Empire ( secs . 209 , 248 , 249 ) , after an existence of a thousand years . Meantime one of the greatest sea fights in history had taken place . The British admiral , Nelson , on October 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar ' off the coast of Spain . " England expects every man to do his duty , " were Nelson 's memorable words as the battle opened . Like Gustavus Adolphus at Liitzen , Nelson lost his life , but his victory was complete . The supremacy of England on the sea was assured , and Napoleon 's last hope of invading the island kingdom was gone . 424 . Humiliation of Prussia ; the Peace of Tilsit . For ten years Prussia had been at peace with France . Her king had refused to join the other nations against Napoleon . But that conqueror , in his thirst for more conquest after humbling Austria and Russia at Austerlitz , moved into Prussia , goaded her into war , and inflicted a fearful defeat on her at the battle of Jena ( ya'na ) , October 14 , 18o6 , and the same month entered Berlin ' in triumph . The following June he defeated the Russians at Friedland ( fred'lant ) , and all Central Europe lay at his feet . Then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia , Alexander I , met the French emperor on a raft in the Niemen ( ne'men ) River , and here one of the great treaties of the time was arranged , ? the treaty of Tilsit , July , 1807 . The romantic young tsar was charmed by the fascinating emperor and was ready to listen to his extraordinary proposals . Napoleon spread before his eyes the division of the world into two mighty empires , with the tsar and himself their respective heads . Alexander was to expand into Asia and was to seize portions of Turkey and of Sweden , while the French Empire was to be supreme over central and western Europe . This famous treaty provided for the dismemberment of Prussia with the loss of more than half its territory . On the west was // created the kingdom of Westphalia , with Jerome Bonaparte , a brother of the French emperor , as its king ; on the east , the duchy of Warsaw , ? only a part of the old Poland , now taken from Prussia ( and later from Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ally , as its ruler . Thus the Poles , who had fought faithfully in the Napoleonic battles , were cruelly denied the greatest longing in their souls ? the restoration of their land and selfgovernment . Moreover , the treaty of Tilsit provided for the humbling of England by means of a continental blockade to be enforced jointly by the two emperors . 425 . Napoleon at the Height of his Power . ? The treaty of Tilsit marks the high tide in Napoleon 's career . Beginning life on a small , dependent island of the Mediterranean , he had risen , through his own matchless genius and energy , to a height that few men in history had ever attained . He was emperor of the French and king of Italy with absolute power ; he was ruler of Switzerland with the title of Mediator . In addition , he had surrounded the French Empire with vassal states in which he had created thrones for the various members of his family . I Hs three brothers each sat upon a throne . Louis Bonaparte was king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , and Jerome was king of Westphalia , a state created for his benefit . Napoleon 's brother-in-law , Murat ( mii-ra ' ) , followed Joseph as king of Naples . No Bourbon or Hapsburg or Hohenzollern family had ever wielded such power as this family so recently obscure and unknown . In 18io Sweden , whose king was without an heir , chose one of Napoleon 's marshals , Bernadotte ( bur-na-dot ' ) , as crown prince and heir to the throne . In his military career Napoleon had proved himself a matchless leader . Three times he had humbled the proud House of Hapsburg to the dust , and a fourth was to be added in the future . Three times he had defeated the Russian armies , and he had torn to pieces the great kingdom that the Hohenzollerns had been building for four centuries . But the highwater mark had been reached and the ebb was soon to begin . // IV . DECLINE AND FALL OF THE EMPIRE OF NAPOLEON 426 . The Continental System . ? Napoleon having made an ally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe , had remaining the one unconquered enemy , ? Great Britain . The victory of Nelson at Trafalgar made an invasion of that country impossible . Napoleon therefore as a last resort determined to starve out the island kingdom by enforcing his blockade known as the Continental System . It was the archenemy England that had stirred up the Continent against him and had furnished large sums of money to his enemies . Therefore , he ' determined to crush England at all hazards . In November , 18o6 , Napoleon issued his Berlin Decree , declaring a blockade of the British Isles , and forbidding British trade with France and other parts of the Continent . French ports were left open to neutral trade ; but in retaliation for the Berlin Decree the British ministry issued an order in Council ( November , 1807 ) forbidding any neutral vessel to trade at a French port without first paying a duty at a British port . ' This again led Napoleon , then in Italy , to issue his Milan Decree ( December , 1807 ) . By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawful prize and subject to seizure and confiscation . Thus like fighting dogs the two nations snapped and snarled at each other . In the end the Continental System greatly impaired the prestige of Napoleon in central Europe . Hitherto the masses of the people had not been greatly displeased with the invasions of Napoleon . He had destroyed the remaining vestiges of feudalism and had dethroned many of their petty tyrannical rulers . He had brought the people some of the blessings of the French Revolution . But the Continental System brought them nothing but discomfort and loss . Thousands of business men were ruined . Their ships lay rotting in the harbors . Sugar , cotton , and many // other things were unobtainable . The people rightly believed that they suffered all this merely to gratify the boundless ambition of one man . Their national spirit was awakened and soon they were ready to rise and throw off the yoke of their oppressor . But from an unexpected quarter , the kingdom of Spain , came the first serious blow to the power of the great emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effete monarchy of Spain had been subservient to Napoleon for years . With nothing to gain it had furnished men for his armies and money for his treasury ; it had sold him Louisiana for a price that was never paid ; it had declared war on Great Britain only to please him , and had sent its fleet to be destroyed at Trafalgar . After all this abject servitude the French emperor , detecting a sign of discontent in Spain , determined on one of the most highhanded political crimes in history ? nothing less than to dethrone the Spanish monarch and place his own brother on the vacant throne . The old king , Charles IV , 1 was cajoled into abdicating , and his son Ferdinand was forced to renounce his rights . Napoleon then , in the spring of 18o8 , deliberately took his brother Joseph from the throne of Naples and placed him on the throne of Spain ? all this without a word of approval ? rom the Spanish people . When Joseph entered Madrid ' in July he found the whole country seething @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Bourbon dynasty the Spaniards had two reasons for refusing longer to bow to the yoke of Napoleon . First , he had quarreled with the pope and held him a prisoner , and they were ready to avenge their spiritual father at any cost . Second , they loved their medieval government and wanted none of the progressive innovations of the French Revolution . King Joseph was forced to flee from his capital . Several French armies were captured or driven back , by half-equipped armies or guerrilla bands emerging from the mountains . Napo- Decline and Fall of the Empire of Napoleon 485 leon was enraged . In person he marched into Spain with 200,000 men and recaptured Madrid . But he could not remain , and no sooner had he gone than the Spanish rebellion was as widespread as before . Herein lay England 's opportunity to throw an army upon the Continent . Sir Arthur Wellesley ( welz'li ) , afterward the Duke of Wellington , entered Spain by way of Portugal , which was also hostile to the French . Then followed the long Peninsular War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain . This uprising of the Spaniards proved the first great step in the overthrow of Napoleon . Napoleon 's hurried departure from Spain was caused by another war brewing in Austria , and thither he marched with a large army . But in this case he found his task more difficult than he had found it at Austerlitz . In May , 1809 , Napoleon was defeated at the battle of Aspern ( as'pern ) , near Vienna , but in July he won a victory at the battle of Vagram ( va'gram ) , and Austria was again humbled to the dust . In the treaty of Vienna which followed , Austria was obliged to yield to the conqueror large sections of her territory , including four million of her inhabitants . 428 . The Disastrous Russian Campaign ( 1812 ) .  --  The records of history present no more tragic military event than Napoleon 's hapless campaign into Russia . The Continental System brought no advantage to Russia . When Alexander fully realized that its only purpose was to cripple England in order to gratify the ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement . For this and other reasons Napoleon became angered . He determined to humble the Muscovite empire , the only remaining great continental power that had not come under his control . He raised a mighty army of 500,000 men and marched into Russia , in June 1812 . He expected to take about three years to conquer the Russian Empire , after which he proposed to make a great // expedition to the Orient and strike India . But the fates had in store for him a very different outcome . The wily tsar played a skillful game . His army retreated day after day , devastating the country and luring the French farther and farther from their base of supplies . But once did the tsar offer battle , and then Napoleon won a costly victory . The invaders entered Moscow in the middle of September . Most of its 250,000 inhabitants had fled , and but a few thousand stragglers and vagabonds remained . Then the city caught fire ; how , no one knows . It may have been by the order of Alexander . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight ten miles away . Five weeks Napoleon waited , expecting the tsar to make overtures of peace . But Alexander made no move . He well knew that his great ally the Russian winter ? would soon come to his rescue . Moscow was in ashes . The surrounding country was devastated . Nothing but an early retreat could save the French army from perishing . The retreat began late in October . It proved a tragedy . The blasts of winter soon overtook the fleeing men . The Russian cavalry harassed and cut them down . Besides , they were starving , and to the thousands of unburied bodies of their comrades who had perished on the inward march , tens of thousands of the retreating army were added . Nine weeks of that dreadful march , and the famishing remnants of the once grand army , now scarcely twenty thousand , crossed the friendly boundary into the duchy of Warsaw . 429 . The War of Liberation ; the Battle of the Nations . ? Napoleon never recovered from the frightful Russian disaster . He had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost superhuman energy he raised another army . He knew that now he must fight again , not for conquest , but for his throne . In the early summer of 1813 he was in the heart of Germany with half a million men , many of them raw recruits . The magic of his name was broken by the Russian campaign . Longoppressed Central Europe was arming against him . It was a Decline and Fall of the Empire of Napoleon 487 " War of Liberation . " At first he won an empty victory or two , but the decisive battle was yet to be fought . At this critical juncture Austria might have joined Napoleon had he agreed to restore part of her stolen territory ; but this he refused to do , and she joined Russia and Prussia against him .

Then came the tremendous three days ' conflict , the battle of Leipzig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16-18 , 1813 . Napoleon fought like a wild beast at bay , but he could not win ; his enemies overpowered him , and a little later he was fleeing across the Rhine with a remnant of his broken legions . Then came the crash of a falling empire . All Germany rose against the sometime conqueror . Holland , Bavaria , Naples hastened to join his foes . King Jerome Bonaparte fled for his life from Westphalia . Wellington was pressing in across the Pyrenees on the south . And at this moment Napoleon made the greatest blunder that he ever made . He rejected ( November , 1813 ) an offer of peace , making the Rhine , the Alps , and the Pyrenees the boundaries of France . The man whose will had been law for half the world could not settle down to the peaceful government of a single nation . With scorn he rejected the proposal ; and the allied armies moved upon France .

He took leave of his generals in the Court of the Farewells , before the main entrance to the palace . The fallen emperor was banished to the island of Elba , near the western coast of Italy , and was made sovereign of the island . 430 . Return from Elba . On the downfall of Napoleon a congress of nations met at Vienna to reorganize the states of Europe . Among other things it decided to reinstate the Bourbons // on the throne of France . The next heir was a brother of Louis XVI . He had fled from France in the early days of the Revolution and had not set foot on French soil for nearly a quarter of a century . He was now a fat , gouty old gentleman , good-natured and with little ability . He entered Paris and became king under the title of Louis XVIII , ' but his reign was unpopular with many classes . In the tiny island-realm of Elba the tireless energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having heard of the dissatisfaction with the Bourbon rule in France , and of ominous dissensions in the Congress of Vienna , the emperor ( he had not been deprived of his title ) decided on the most daring adventure in all his amazing career ? a dash into France for the recovery of his throne . With 800 of his old guard , who had been his companions in exile , he landed on the southern coast of France on March I , 1815 . His irresistible personal magnetism was never more in evidence . Multitudes of people on his journey to Paris received him with tears and shouts of joy . Marshal Ney ( na ) , who had fought by his side in many a battle , but had gone over to the king , was sent to capture him . When he came in sight of his old commander , he burst into tears and clasped him in his arms . Louis XVIII fled at the approach of Napoleon .

The rulers of Europe refused to accept his professed desire for peace . They pronounced him an outlaw , and four of the great powers pledged themselves each to keep 150,000 men in the field until he should be finally overpowered . Decline and Fall of the Empire of Napoleon 489 431 . Waterloo ( June i8 , 1815 ) . ? Nothing could save the restored throne of Napoleon but war , and war only for a little time . The allied armies were gathering over Europe , and France would soon be hemmed in on every side . Early in June the emperor , having raised his last army , started out for his last battle . But it was not a large army , less than ioo , 000 men . The old-time vigor of the days of Danton , or of Austerlitz , was gone . The Duke of Wellington with a motley army of Eng- lish , Dutch , Belgians , and Germans was near Brussels , and Blucher ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join him . Napoleon determined to engage them singly and prevent their union if possible . NIh . A n Hastening to the north , he struck Blucher at Ligny ( len-ye ' ) on June i6 and drove him back with heavy ' loss . Two days later he en- L countered Wellington near , the village of Waterloo ' . MOVEMENTS LEADING TO WATERLOO There is hardly a doubt that Napoleon would have won the day had not Blucher reached the field in the afternoon . It then required nearly half the French army to fight the Prussians . This gave Wellington an immense advantage . The battle raged till nightfall . At length the French wavered and became demoralized . They turned and fled from the field in great disorder and confusion . Thus ended the military career of perhaps the ablest commander of men in the annals of history . Eloquently Victor Hugo says that Napoleon was overthrown , not on account of Blucher , but on account of God . " It was time that this vast // man should fall . His excessive weight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to civilization had it endured . " 432 . St. Helena . ? Napoleon fled to Paris from the gory field of Waterloo . Again he was forced to abdicate his throne . Hastening to the coast , a hunted fugitive , he hoped to find passage to America , but the coast was too well guarded by British vessels . He then went aboard a British warship , the Beller'ophon , and begged the right to end his days in seclusion in England . But as Napoleon had broken faith with the allies at Elba , they were unwilling to trust him again . He was banished to the rocky island of St. Hele'na , far away in the Atlantic Ocean between Brazil and the coast of Africa . Here , under heavy guard , with 1300 miles of rolling sea between him and the mainland , the mighty Corsican , who had transformed the world as no other man ever did , fretted away the rest of his life brooding over the glories of the past . ' 433 . Napoleon in History . ? The French Revolution may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first ten years were a period of destruction , of fire and violence and storm , during which the old royal structure of society was torn to pieces . The early enthusiasm then abated . The people were listless , weary of violence and bloodshed . The pendulum was swinging back . But the great work was only half done . A new edifice had to be reared . Who was there equal to the task ? Danton had been guillotined , Mirabeau was gone . There was not a great constructive statesman in France . Then came Napoleon , the man of gigantic intellect , of boundless ambition , capable of all tasks that might fall to him . He picked up the reins of government that lay limp before him . The nation was electrified with energy and vitality at his magic touch . For fifteen years following , the history of this man and the history of Europe were almost one and the same thing . // It is not easy to say what Europe might have been without Napoleon . It is true that his motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lacked the greatest thing in life ? a high-born moral principle . But he was an instrument in bringing about great benefits to civilization . He saved France from falling into confusion and he shook up Central Europe in such a way as to make it impossible for the parts ever again to be laid as they were before . Whether the career of Napoleon was a blessing or a calamity to the world must be determined by weighing the good that he wrought against the lives of the million men he sacrificed in accomplishing it . CHAPTER XXXV EUROPE AFTER THE REVOLUTION I. THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA ; CHANGES IN EUROPE 434 . Changes in Germany . ? The nation that suffered most and was benefited most by the Napoleonic wars was Germany . It is true that in Austria , then a part of Germany , the principles of the French Revolution took but little immediate hold , but in Prussia and other northern states there was a change for the better . Napoleon destroyed many petty states and reduced the number of independent governments from about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying the foundations of a united Germany . Still more important was the abolition of serfdom in most of the German states . As early as October 9 , 1807 , under the guidance of an able statesman , Baron Stein ( shtin ) , the king of Prussia decreed the end of serfdom in all his remaining dominions ; also the right of the peasant to buy land and live as free as his master had done before . By this reform great numbers of peasants were awakened to new life and quickened patriotism , as was shown in the War of Liberation a few years later ( sec. 429 ) . Petty tyranny and perverted justice held sway no longer in Prussia , although constitutional government was reserved for a later generation . 435 ? Work of the Congress of Vienna . ? No more distinguished body has met in modern times than the Congress of Vienna . ' Many of the royal rulers of Europe were present in person , others through representatives . The two most interesting non-royal figures in attendance were Prince Metternich ( met'er-nix ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented France . Metternich , as we shall notice later , was an enemy of all reform . Talleyrand , who had been faithful to Napoleon during his ascendancy , ' quickly turned to the Bourbons on his fall . It was he who suggested the return of the Bourbons and who saved France from being despoiled and disrupted by the angry allies that had suffered so many blows in the recent wars . As it was , the Congress took from France all the territory she had annexed since the beginning of the Revolution . Belgium ( the former Austrian Netherlands ) , which had been incorporated with France , was now added to Holland ; and the kingdom of the Netherlands , as the combined country was called , was put under the rule of the House of Orange , descendants of William the Silent ( sec. 319 ) . In Germany the Holy Roman Empire was not restored , but the thirty-eight German states were formed into a loose union , called the German Confederation . Prussia was given half of Saxony // ( which had been faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Rhine ( map following page 496 ) . Austria received Venice and Lombardy , while nearly all the other states of Italy were restored to their respective princes who had reigned before the wars . Sweden lost Finland to the Russian tsar , but on the other hand Norway was taken from Denmark ( sec. 256 ) and placed under the rule of the Swedish king . Bernadotte ( secs . 425 , 429 ) remained the heir to the Swedish throne , and he and his family have occupied it since 1818 . The treatment of Denmark was like that of Saxony ; both had been in league with Napoleon , and both were now punished , the one by the loss of half its territory and the other by the loss of Norway . Napoleon 's duchy of Warsaw , with reduced boundaries , was made a kingdom of Poland , with the tsar of Russia as its king . Switzerland , the favored of all the states , was left free to govern itself ; and the powers agreed not to invade it or to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most persistent of all Napoleon 's enemies . She had for years furnished the allies with money , and had incurred an immense war debt . In the final settlement at Vienna , Great Britain received Cape Colony in South Africa , Ceylon , and a few small islands . Her empire , now including Canada , India , South Africa , and Australia , was the most extensive the world had ever seen . II . THE SPIRIT OF REACTION 436 . Prince Metternich . ? The ruling spirit in the Congress of Vienna was Metternich , the great Austrian minister . IIe was of noble but not of royal blood . He was a statesman of keen and comprehensive mind , and might have made a notable name in history but for his " stand-pat " and reactionary principles . He despised liberal ideas and reforms . He believed in the divine The Spirit of Reaction 495 right of kings and hated democracy in all its forms . He was an uncompromising foe to the principles of the French Revolution . It was chiefly the influence of Metternich that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without consulting their people . Note what was done : Belgium , against the bitter protests of its people , was added to Holland ; the Poles longed for self-government , and most of them were placed under the tyranny of the tsar of Russia ; Norway , Venice , and other sections received similar treatment , against the fierce resentment of the people . ' Switzerland was the only republic left in Europe . All the peoples who had attained self-government since the opening of the Revolution , including the French themselves , were thrust back under despotic monarchs , ? and all this by the rulers without the consent of the people . It was the period of reaction . But the spirit of liberty had been awakened and was destined to prevail in the end , as we shall see in later chapters . 437 . Repression Gone Mad . ? The astute Metternich , though unable to undo all the work of the French Revolution , determined that its principles should go no further . He organized the great nations in a league to aid one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more liberal conditions . Spies and secret police were sent prowling about to ferret out any signs of conspiracy . The Prussian king had promised his people a constitution at the time of the War of Liberation in 1813 , and other rulers had made similar promises . Metternich saw to it that these promises were not kept . Still the people cherished hopes for more liberal governments . Authors , journalists , professors and students of universities , kept agitating the subject , and many of them were sent into exile for such crimes as wearing the colors that stood for liberty or singing patriotic songs . In 1817 were issued the // Carlsbad Decrees , by which liberty of speech and of the press was denied the people of the German states , students ' clubs were suppressed , and spies were sent to the universities to report the teaching of any liberal ideas by the professors . III . UPRISING IN SOUTHERN EUROPE 438 . Revolts in Spain , Naples , and Portugal . ? As Spain was the first of the nations in which the people rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the repressive policy of Metternich . In 1812 the Spaniards , having with the aid of Wellington ejected the armies of Napoleon , adopted a constitution . But soon after the exiled Bourbon king , Ferdinand VII , was restored to his father 's throne , he trampled the constitution in the dust and restored the absolute government and the Inquisition . Spain was precipitated back to the Middle Ages . The result was an insurrection covering the whole country . The tyrannical king , a coward as well as a knave , then swore to observe the constitution . The Spanish revolt soon spread to Portugal and to Naples , which was , like Spain , again under a Bourbon ruler . In both countries the people rose in rebellion against tyranny , adopted constitutions modeled on that of Spain , and forced their respective kings to accept them . Here was the opportunity for the shrewd Metternich , more a tyrant than Napoleon ever was , to put his policy of intervention to the test . 439 ? The Holy Alliance . ? The Holy Alliance was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called forth in 1815 by the sentimental tsar of Russia . It pledged the signers to govern their respective countries in accordance with the principles of the Bible , with " justice , charity , and peace . " It had little effect on European politics and would have been forgotten but for the fact that the term has been wrongly used to designate the league that was later formed for the purpose of putting down popular revolts . // Metternich , alarmed at conditions in Spain , . At this meeting , Austria , Russia , and Prussia signed a declaration pledging themselves ( 1820 ) to join their forces in crushing uprisings of the people wherever such might occur . It was not long before an Austrian army moved into Naples , where the liberals , badly organized , were soon defeated . The treacherous king , in violation of his oath , resumed his absolute government and ruthlessly punished the defeated liberals . The same year ( 1821 ) an Austrian army did a similar service in northern Italy , where the people , longing for freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall under the Metternich system of repression . Another congress of the powers was held at Vero'na in 1822 , and France was induced to join the three eastern powers . It was here decided that a French army be sent to suppress the Spanish constitution . This was done , and King Ferdinand again became an absolute monarch . 440 . The Monroe Doctrine . ? Meantime the Spanish colonies in America had been in revolt . While Napoleon was in power these colonies had enjoyed much liberty , having refused to acknowledge Joseph Bonaparte as their king . But on the return of a Bourbon ruler to the Spanish throne an effort was made to reduce them to their former condition of colonial dependence . Having tasted the sweets of liberty , they refused to give them up . They rose in revolt , one after another , from Argentina to Mexico . King Ferdinand sought to induce the powers at Verona to aid him in subduing the American colonies , and they might have done so but for two very serious obstacles ? Great Britain and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of repression . She had saved Portugal from the fate of Naples and Spain . And now when it was proposed that the powers join together to subdue Spanish America , Great Britain determined to oppose the project . // At this time the British Secretary of Foreign Affairs was George Canning , a broad and liberal-minded statesman , who proposed to James Monroe , President of the United States , that the two countries join in an alliance to protect Spanish America . ' This country preferred to act alone , and in December , 1823 , the President issued the famous Monroe Doctrine . The main feature of this " doctrine " is a declaration that no part of America must be considered as subject for future colonization by any European powers , and that any attempt to extend their systems to any portion of this hemisphere would be considered dangerous to our peace and safety and as showing an unfriendly disposition toward the United States . This attitude of Great Britain and the United States quickly put an end to all thought of aiding Spain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , the former Spanish-American colonies were left to themselves , and they have since then enjoyed complete independence . 441 . The Greek Revolution . ? The attitude of Great Britain and the United States with respect to Spanish America caused the first break in the Metternich system . The second came with the Greek revolution . For centuries the Greeks had been subject to Mohammedan Turkey . For centuries they had paid tribute and had furnished men for the Turkish armies . The Turks in turn treated the Greeks with contempt and had stolen away their fairest women . Inspired by the French Revolution and incensed that the Congress of Vienna had done nothing for them , the Greeks in 1821 rose against their oppressors . Almost at a stroke they gained possession of More'a , known in ancient history as the Peloponnesus , and of Central Greece . The Turkish sultan was enraged at their success and the next year he sent large armies into the revolted territory . The Greeks fought with fierce bravery from their mountain defiles and on the sea , where they destroyed many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contest raged with cruel ferocity : thousands of captives were massacred in cold blood by both sides . The people of Europe generally sympathized with the Greeks in their heroic struggle for liberty ; but rulers of the Metternich school saw in it another French Revolution and they would have aided the Turks if they dared . The sultan in desperation called to his aid his powerful vassal , the Pasha of Egypt , and the Greeks , after six years of a struggle as desperate as any people ever endured , were about to be overwhelmed when help came at last . In England the sympathy with the Greeks was widespread , and it was increased by Lord Byron , the most popular poet of his time . His stirring lyric beginning , touched the hearts of his countrymen . But Byron did more . He went to Greece to offer his life in the cause of liberty . Thousands of others were led to do the same . At length the British government was moved to act ; also Russia , // for the Russians hated the Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians . France then joined them , and the three nations sent a fleet to Grecian waters . In October , 1827 , the great naval battle of Navarino ( na-va-re'no ) took place , in which the allied fleet annihilated the Turkish fleet . Turkey was forced to yield and in 1829 Greece was granted independence . // 442 . Reign of Louis XVIII . ? On the final fall of Napoleon at Waterloo the fat old king , Louis XVIII ( sec. 430 ) , returned to Paris and resumed his reign . He awakened no enthusiasm . The people cared nothing for the Bourbons . Louis was a man of good common sense , and he was no tyrant . He recognized the main principles of the Revolution , equal rights before the law , liberty of the press , and religious toleration . He granted the people a constitution which provided for a legislature of two houses , one of which was elected by the people who paid a certain amount of taxes . The king was wise enough to see that it was impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if he wished to do so ; but he kept up the fiction of absolutism by insisting that the constitution was granted from the goodness of his heart and not because the people had any right to it . With the restoration of the Bourbons to the French throne the exiled nobles returned by thousands . They expected to enjoy all their old privileges and hoped to wipe out all traces of the Revolution . Their leader was the king 's younger brother , who later succeeded to the throne as Charles X. King Louis opposed their demands as best he could , but he grew feeble and scarcely able to resist them . When he died in 1824 , the reactionary party had gained almost complete control . 443 . Charles X , the Last of the Bourbon Dynasty ( 1824-183o ) . ? The last three of the famous Bourbon dynasty to wear the French crown were the three brothers , Louis XVI , guillotined in
