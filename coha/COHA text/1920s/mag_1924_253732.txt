With domestic politics quiet for the moment , the equally political conference of the Allied Premiers over the eternal question of German reparations is again to the fore . The acridly partizan politics in Paris threaten as usual to hold up agreement upon the Experts ' Plan . Yet the business community in the U. S. , although heartily weary of futile European conferences , is unusually hopeful that this time some definite basis of concerted action regarding Germany can be secured . How much actual buying in U. S. markets this would develop , is problematical . <P> The West is reviving under better grain prices and rapidly maturing crops . Money continues easy , and now the fear of higher rates because of crop financing is being allayed . But industry is very dull , although not sufficient wage-cuts or layoffs have been occasioned to injure retail merchandising . Even the stock market has acted somewhat weary and dispirited , despite strength in utility stocks and the better railroads.                  @ @ @
