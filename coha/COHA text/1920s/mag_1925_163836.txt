Production of motor cars in October established a new high monthly record at above 452,000 , and led critics to say that car makers were becoming decidedly overenthusiastic and liable to find themselves with huge unsalable inventories in 1926 . Actually , however , motor producers have been watching demand very carefully . Also , the record figure for October was largely due to the tremendous but temporary production of the new Ford model . The old Ford model was discontinued in August , while delays in producing the new model held down the Sep- tember Ford output and created a large accumulation of unfilled Ford orders . Thus , while Ford made only about 85,000 cars in September and August together , in October 204,827 Fords were turned out . This exceptional output clearly affected the figures for total national October car-production . <P> In November the Ford plants continued active on the balance of their unfilled orders , but many other concerns reduced their production schedules . When Ford has " caught up " with the orders for his new model , a considerable falling off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular seasonal feature of the business . <P> The present surplus stock of cars in the hands of dealers is estimated at 500,000 , although some students of the industry question the accuracy of this figure . The total number of motor vehicles in use in the U. S. today is more than 15,000,000.
