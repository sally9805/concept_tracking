If there is an outside chance for the Republicans to drive home the Methodist-Baptist bone-dry wedge and split off a piece or two of the Solid South , the man to swing the sledge is saturnine Campbell Bascom Slemp , President Coolidge 's onetime ( 1923-25 ) secretary , the Republican National Committeeman from Virginia . He it is who knows the ways , light and dark , of Southern Republicans . He it was who , last week , immediately after the Anti-Smith Democrats had said their say for Hoover at Asheville , N. C. ( see p. 9 ) , was appointed a " special assistant " by National Republican Chairman Dr. Work . He will have a Southern Republican Bureau . He will have money to spend .
