The War Department issued a call last week for volunteers to sail for Tientsin with the 15th U. S. Infantry . Said the call : " Applicants . . . will face the most severe enlistment requirements the Army has ever set up . . . . Ex-service men must have been discharged with excellent character to be eligible . Volunteers without prior service must be at least 25 instead of the usual 18 years and of unusually fine character and physique . " <P> Many a high-minded stalwart , feeling sure he could meet these specifications , quailed at one more requirement . To belong to the 15th U. S. Infantry , you must be able to speak at least 300 words in Chinese .
