Over a tawny glass of Spanish sherry a suave Semite faced London reporters in his flat last week . They knew that he had just made a bust of the largest British magazine enterprise of recent years , was regarded by some as a not inconsiderable ass . Twirling his glass of sherry , Gilbert ( " Swankau " ) Frankau alibied : <P> " As the founder of Britannia sip , I said what I thought , without fear or favor . Evidently I am against lots of people sip , for I believe in everything British ! That was what Britannia stood for while I held her helm . " <P> Actually the Frankau weekly Britannia stood not for but against everything British or foreign which did not come within the extreme Fascist fringe of the little Semite 's whims . He was " agin " the Government of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , " agin " the David Lloyd George Liberals , " agin " the Ramsay MacDonald Laborites , but chiefly " agin " everything remotely hailing from the U. S.-where Novelist Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from book sales and lectures about himself to U. S. women 's clubs . <P> The bust came , last week , when Britannia 's owners , the Inveresk Pulp &; Paper Co. , found that the 33 pages of advertising per issue with which the magazine was launched had shrunk to four . Tactful requests that Editor Frankau modify his Lunatic-Fascist policies caused him to apply for an injunction restraining Inveresk Ltd. from interfering with his conduct of their paper . Since the editor had a contract , the only thing to do was buy him off . He held out last week for 12,000-nearly $60,000-and finally got it . Wherefor the smug airs , the sherry . <P> The assininity which Gilbert Frankau brought to Britannia was pointed out ( TIME , November 5 ) when he made his initial statement as the founder . <P> Rumored early last week was the startling suggestion that the Earl of Birkenhead , recently resigned as Secretary of State for India , would take over the editorship of Britannia , to which he has regularly contributed . Denial of this persistent report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication of Britannia will be continued under the direction of the present editor , Crawfurd Price . " <P> If bewildered by this announcement , many a Briton could lay hands on an old copy of Britannia , and jerk it open to the index he would read : <P> Governing Director : Gilbert Frankau . <P> Editor : Crawfurd Price . <P> As a matter of fact Gilbert ( " Swankau " ) Frankau edited Britannia with the assistance of Mr. Price ; but apparently his swanky little soul rejoiced in the title of GOVERNING DIRECTOR . <P> Britannia 's new out-and-out-editor , Walter Crawfurd-Price was a famed British War-correspondent , and later Foreign Editor of the Sunday Times .
