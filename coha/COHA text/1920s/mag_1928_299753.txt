In the discomfort of last week 's heat , the report on the relation between weather and crime , made by Dr. Edwin Grant Dexter , to the National Probation Society , received national attention . Dr. Dexter analyzed the 12-year police and weather statistics of New York and Denver . His conclusions : <P> Misbehavior is less on calm days than on windy , because when weather is calm the air contains an excess of carbon dioxide , which lessens vitality . <P> Murders increase during dry and windy periods , because of the prevailing high electric potentiality of the atmosphere . <P> In summer people are outdoors , have free opportunity to quarrel ; commit acts of violence . In winter living becomes difficult ; people steal and commit other acts against property . <P> Above 85 F. people become too lethargic to quarrel . <P> Suicides are fewest in physically comfortable weather . Most happen in May . <P> An approaching storm excites some people to violence .                  @ @ @
