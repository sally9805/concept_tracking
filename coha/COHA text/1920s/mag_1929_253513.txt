Prosperous German piano tycoons once battened on the parents of flaxen-haired fruleins . Each apple-cheeked Lorelei of 1914 , required , as her minimum working equipment , a revolving stool , a well-tuned upright , and hundreds of sheets of such saccharine music as Die Unglcklichen Herzen ( The Unhappy Hearts ) . Last week a survey of the German piano business showed how strikingly frauleins and times have changed . <P> Of the 300 old established piano factories nearly all are running part time , with thousands of skilled workmen laid off or reduced to making radios . Four years ago the British Isles were buying 22,000 German pianos annually . With the enactment of the McKenna tariff that figure has fallen to a mere 1500 in 1928 . Similar tariff enactments by other countries have cut German piano exports from 76,400 in 1913 , to 30,000 in 1928 . <P> Even more disheartening is the fact that today the German piano tycoons stand clearly defeated , after a two-year battle with " sales resistance " in Germany itself . The offensive began in 1926 . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as against 60,000 in other years . The tycoons were scared . Therefore they organized an " American Campaign " of high-pressure salesmanship , something unprecedented in the Reich . Salesmen rambled through the countryside with trucks full of pianos , selling and delivering on the spot , selling on credit , shouting , pleading , browbeating . . . . <P> Presto ! High-pressure sold 60,000 pianos in 1927 . So-called " American Methods " seemed triumphantly vindicated - until they were tried out a second year . Last week 's survey showed that Germans bought only some 28,000 pianos in 1928 . <P> From Stuttgart to Munich and from Bremen to Berlin , piano salesmen are talking with unglchen herzen , about " the saturation point . "
