" With Head Erect " <P> William Z. Foster , Charles E. Ruthenberg and Robert Minor , the three chief defendants in the Michigan criminal syndicalism trials , spoke at Webster Hall , New York , before a cheering audience of 600 ardent radicals . <P> Foster received an ovation of several minutes when he stepped upon the stage . He reviewed the trial and likened himself and his colleagues to Christ , whom he called " the original Communist . " <P> " The capitalists of His day , " shouted Foster , " crucified Christ because he tried to teach the world . He ran the capitalists out of the temple and they hated him for it . To-day the capitalists do n't crucify us for preaching overthrow of their rule . They simply try to send us to jail for ten or fifteen years ! The trials at St. Joseph were unique , because we were not charged with favoring any of the doctrines opposed by the syndicalism law of Michigan . We were tried merely for being present at meetings of a party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy as the favored statesman of the capitalist classes . " Mussolini 's followers wear black shirts , " said Foster . " In America the men who favor the ideas of Mussolini wear black robes and sit on the bench as Justices of the Supreme Court ! " <P> " Twice before I was sent to prison for conducting this fight for the working classes , " said Ruthenberg in his speech . " Each time I came out I took up the task where I had left off . . . . If we lose this fight we shall go to prison with our heads erect- bleeding but not bandaged . " <P> Police reserves were unable to disperse the crowd until the Communist leaders left the hall , when they were followed for blocks by the cheering radical sympathizers . <P> *William Z. Foster was the first defendant tried . The jury disagreed and he must be tried again .
