An atmosphere tense with Anglo-U . S. suspicion and discord characterized the sessions at Geneva last week of the Naval Limitations Parley ( TIME , June 27 ) , nicknamed by the Swiss " La Conference Coolidge . " Nothing of a constructive nature was accomplished ; but the proposals put forward by the U. S. , Britain and Japan were of utmost importance ; and the verbal fireworks which followed agreeably enlivened last week the annual Geneva Flower Festival . <P> U. S. Proposal . Chief Delegate Hugh Simpson Gibson , U. S. Ambassador to Belgium , proposed : <P> 1 ) Extension of the Washington Conference 5-5-3 ratio , now limiting only capital ships , to limit also cruisers , destroyers and submarines . <P> 2 ) Application of this ratio in such a way that the combined total of cruiser plus destroyer tonnage would not exceed 550,000 for the U. S. , 550,000 for Britain and 330,000 for Japan . <P> Apart from this limitation of the total of cruisers plus destroyers , the limitations of each class to be : <P> CRUISERS <P> U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Japan 150,000 to 180,000 tons <P> DESTROYERS <P> U. S. and Britain , <P> each 200,000 to 250,000 tons <P> Japan 120,000 to 150,000 tons <P> SUBMARINES <P> U. S. and Britain , <P> each 60,000 to 90,000 tons <P> Japan 36,000 to 54,000 tons <P> 3 ) Any excess in tonnage above the combined totals to be immediately scrapped . <P> The reason for this harping upon combined totals is that the U. S. has a relatively superfluous number of destroyers , while Britain has , in U. S. eyes , a like superfluity of cruisers . By lumping the two , and by limiting combined or global tonnage the U. S. would be relieved of the necessity of building up to Britain 's cruiser strength , would save money , yet keep global parity . <P> British Proposals . Chief Delegate William Clive Bridgeman , First Lord of the British Admiralty , proposed : <P> 1 ) Not only extension of the Washington agreements from capital ships to cruisers , destroyers and submarines ; but revision of these agreements as they now stand and limit capital ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their capital ships for 26 years-instead of scrapping them at the end of 20 years and building improved ships , as at present . <P> Similar clauses to fix the " replacement age " of cruisers at 24 years , destroyers 20 years , submarines 15 years. * <P> 2 ) Further revision of the Washington agreements to fix the maximum permissible tonnage of future ships of any class at 30,000 , whereas capital ships may now be built up to 35,000 tons. + <P> Similar revision to reduce the maximum future battleship gun bore from 16 to 13.5 inches . <P> 3 ) Limitation of the individual tonnage of cruisers to 7,500 each , destroyers 1,750 to 1,400 tons each , submarines 1,600 to 600 tons each . <P> Limitation of the maximum cruiser gun bore to six inches , destroyer and submarine gun five inches . <P> Thus the concrete proposals in the British plan dealt only with limitation of the strength of individual ships , and not with limitation of the number of ships or global tonnage . Since something had to be said about this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
