There are no headstones in the Graveyard of the Sea . Somewhere along this sullen stretch off Sable Island Mrs. Frances Wilson Grayson 's airplane Dawn lies , according to belief , buried beside the wrecks of sailing ships . The Dawn might have floated for a little before sinking . Seeking a floating speck , the great dirigible Los Angeles roamed the air above this unmarked waste . <P> The Los Angeles saw no speck , wheeled for home . She lives at Lakehurst , N. J. , where she was housed after 1200 nautical miles cruising , 700 of them at sea . Newspapers detailed her movements calmly . It did not occur to many readers that December dangers which had drowned the Dawn threatened the dirigible . She was too big , too safe to shrink from weather which might kill a heavier-than-air machine . Some few were perplexed . If dirigibles are so dependable , they wondered , why all this bother about airplanes . Why not build dirigibles instead ? <P> Lieut . Commander Charles E. Rosendahl , lord of the Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that huge hangars ; great ground crews ; and extraordinarily expensive terminal equipment are requisite for dirigibles . In the U. S. there are only two hangars ; Lakehurst and Scott Field , Belleville , Ill . Dirigibles can not , like ariplanes , be landed on any flat run of ground and wheeled into a convenient shed . They must have home life . <P> There are several mooring masts in U. S. where the Los Angeles may tie up for the night . But should a high wind rise she must let go , or tear her nose off . She can , in emergencies , be brought down on large flat stretches . There must be crowds on hand to hold her . She can be temporarily " anchored " at sea by means of a huge canvas bucket dragged in the water on a 200 foot cable . On absolutely still lakes she can be angled down , to rest with her nose in the water . These are all temporary measures . Dirigibles are too expensive to be left lying around . <P> Safety . Hurricanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Commander Rosendahl , survivor the Shenandoah smash ( TIME , Sept. 14 , 1925 ) believes that the Los Angeles , once in the air , can survive far heavier storms than he permits her to rush . Perhaps , when dirigibles are enlarged , perfected , they will swim the heaviest storms that winds can blow . Helium gas , which fills the bag , will not burn , can not explode . <P> Performance . The Los Angeles came from Germany , where she was built ( Zeppelin ZR-3 ) , in 80 hours , a non-stop flight of 5,060 miles ( TIME , Oct. 20 , Oct. 27 , 1924 ) . Her top speed is 70 m. p. h . She has visited Bermuda , Porto Rico , flown many training flights at sea ; voyaged 50,370 nautical miles since her arrival in 1924 . Her usual cruising crew is about 45 . She will carry 100 passengers who can stroll her length ( 656 feet ) in " cat walks " built inside the bag .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
