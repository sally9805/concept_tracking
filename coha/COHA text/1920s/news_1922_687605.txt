txt Not a few railroads and some industrial corporations have what arc called concealed equities . A good example would be the oil lands of the Southern Pacific in the past or the coal lands of the Reading . For sufficient reasons these equities ' are not turned into cash until the time is ripe for such action . But the concealment does - not as a rule deceive the market , which reflects the supposed value of the equities in the price of the stock . The squandering politician is a great believer in concealed equities  --  latent possibilities of squeezing more out of the taxpayer . These range from crude fiat money proposal3 to taxes on capital , and are generally illusory . One of them unquestionably is a tax upon all incpmes derived from bonds which are now tax exempt . To secure such a contribution still another amendment to the Constitution is contemplated . It seems simple enough , although an elementary knowledge of the Constitution would tell the proposers of this levy that there is no such concealed equity as they suppose .

The money ' was borrowed at a lower interest rate conditional on tax exemption , or , to put it in another way , the holder of the bond paid cash for his exemption from taxes . ? It would be far better if - there were no tax-exempt bonds . But we are to remember that there is a tremendous historical argument for such exemption . It is conceded that the power to tax is the power to destroy . Exemptitm is the purchased prOtection against that destruction . In the past it tied the hands of the tyrant . Charles I borrowed the money and then taxed the principal back into his treasury . There are scores of proposals in the pigeonholes of Congress which propose to do exactly that thing . The proposers forget that without the promise of tax exemption the money could not have been borrowed at all , or only at ' prohibitive rates of interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large exemption was made .. n attractive feature of the bond when offered for subscription . Demagogues would . confiscate these privileges , Irmestly paid for in cash . Charles I was a tyrant , but there is no tyrant so stupid or so cruel as the mob . Unless this country is to have a revolution like that of Russia , some $11,000,000,000 of sstate and municipal bonds will remain tax exempt - until paid-off . Whether the states , dr-thIrtY-Six of " them ; would ** . sacrifiee " - slith method of raising money in order to fatten the federal exchequer is highly doubtful . They would be foolish to make any such surrender , but after the surrender of the police power in the case of prohibition anything seems possible . But in any case no amendment could be drawn which would do more than make state and municipal bonds subject to tax only if issued after the ratification of the amendment . So far as the coal consumer is concerned , victory for the miners might well seem preferable to a return of goy , ernment fuel administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
