In Manhattan the American Society of Mechanical Engineers met for their 46th annual conference , heard speeches , discussed propositions of a good deal more specific importance to U. S. industry than the airy theorizing , the optimistic glad-handing of the average trade- conference . They talked about oil and coal , about workers who are too dainty to get their hands soiled , about workers who are too tired to function properly . <P> The Society of Mechanical Engineers is , incidentally , one of the pies in which Secretary of Commerce Hoover has his able finger . He spoke eloquently on the subject of : <P> Pure Science . " The wealth of the country has multiplied far faster than the funds we have given for pure science , and the funds administered for it in the U. S. today are but a triviality compared with the vast resources that a single scientific discovery places in our hands . Men of science here know from their own experience how seriously scientific work has been impeded by lack of resources . . . . The Carnegie Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research activities of much . more limited but special endowments , the work of our universities , together with the work of the National Research Council and our Government agencies , have shown fine accomplishment in this field , but the whole of the income available from these sources does not exceed $10,0000,000 a year . . . . Industrial science consumes $200,000,000 annually . ... " <P> White Collars . " There are too many of them . . . too many college graduates , " said William E. Wickenden , director of the Society for Promotion of Engineering Education . " The upper rungs of the ladder are overcrowded . . . the middle positions suffer from lack of personnel . ... " <P> Oil will replace coal as a fuel , said O. P. Hood , Chief Engineer of the U. S. Bureau of Mines . <P> Tired Workers , declared Engineer R. T. Kent , are a terrible source of waste . Science should find a way to correct fatigue in mine workers , mechanics , engineers . <P> Hard Coal is so difficult to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply grist for the jokes of vaudevillians and car- toonists . Periodic suspension of anthracite mining " menaces national welfare , " said economists and engineers . Thereupon they drafted a letter to John L. Lewis , President of the United Mine Workers , and to Major W. W. Inglis , head of the operators ' committee , advising reorganization of the hard coal industry .
