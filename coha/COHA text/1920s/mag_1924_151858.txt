The following estimates of books much in the public eye were made after careful consideration of the trend of critical opinion : <P> PIERRE LOTI-NOTES OF MY YOUTH-Assembled by his son-Doubleday ( $2.00 ) . Letters and fragments from the diary of that exotic romancer who caused French eyebrows to lift as high as Oscar Wilde lifted English ones . His son seems to have done him a questionable kindness in publishing them ; they expose him somewhat ruthlessly . Among the most interesting are some letters from his sister , who understood him , saw through him and told him so . Their arrival must have caused him acute uneasiness . <P> THE MISTY VALLEY-Joanna Cannan-Doran ( $2.00 ) . Claire Wyneflete tumbles between the " clear hills of thought and the clear hills of action , " into the misty valley of romance , and the rest of the story is concerned-like Alice-with her adventures in getting out . A first novel redolent of sweet English gardens , and written in joyously casual style . <P> DOG AND DUCK-Arthur Machen-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . From his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Author Machen sends forth a book of essays written in a blend of the Dickens and the Elia manner-whimsical side-lights on varied themes . He talks about London fogs and old English simnel-cakes , he dissects April Fools ' Day , book collecting and the " merry month of May . " Carl Van Vechten has called him " the most wonderful man writing English today . " <P> GREEN SHOOTS-Paul Morand-Seltzer ( $1.75 ) . A very French account of three unusual " green shoots . " In this case they are three young women- Clarisse , Aurore , Delphine . One of the amazing things about this book is that any Frenchman can know so much about London and still remain French . <P> LOOKING AT LIFE-Floyd Dell-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . The mooncalf at it again-shambling over broken fences , galloping down blind-alleys and browsing with cheerful indiscrimination wherever a blade of grass appears . Half-thoughts and notions on Jesus , Shaw , Babbitt and many another . Forty-two chapters and no two alike , except in serious naivety and happy eagerness.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
