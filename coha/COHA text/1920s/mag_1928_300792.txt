To succeed Cosmo Gordon Lang as Archbishop of York when on Nov. 12 ( if Parliament approves ) York becomes Archbishop of Canterbury , King George V as head of the Church of England last week nominated none of the prelates whom most of his subjects expected . He preferred William Temple , 46 , Bishop of Manchester since 1921 . <P> Like the present Archbishop of York and Canterbury , Bishop Temple owes his swift rise , in part , to his intimacy with British royalty , but chiefly to his great ability as a leader of social work ( particularly labor movements ) and as a theologian . Archbishop Lang was Honorable Chaplain to Queen Victoria and close friend of the queen 's consort Albert . Archbishop Davidson was first subalmoner to queen , then her domestic chaplain , then her Clerk of the Closet , a post which he continued to hold under Edward VII . His father-in-law was the late Archbishop Tait of Canterbury , to whom he had been secretary . <P> Bishop Temple 's father was the late Frederick Temple , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple , Archbishop of York-to-be , was Archbishop Davidson 's chaplain at Canterbury in 1910.
