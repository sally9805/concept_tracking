txt In a stock market which has been marked by wide declines among a number of oil issues , shares of Standard Oil of Indiana have been holding relatively firm around 66 level . Their market usually has been around 70 , although for a short period several months ago stock got to around 74 . Indiana has always been one of the strongest units in the oil industry . Its position was probably never as strong as at present . It started 1927 with more than $66,000,000 in cash and marketable securities , the largest it ever had . This was some $19,000,000 better than end of 1925 and $52,000,000 larger than end of 1923 . Thus , in a period where widespread cutting of crude oil prices is sharply reducing oil earnings and necessitating public financing , Indiana 's management comes along with the biggest " nest egg " of cash the company ever had . There could hardly be a better time to hold such a huge amount of liquid capital and doubtless it can be ascribed to forchandedness of the management in anticipating something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 days . Indiana doubtless is doing a much larger business than a year ago . Just how profits are running is a difficult matter to estimate , as that depends on the money being realized from refined products sold and the price at which they stand in inventory account . With its usual conservatism , inventories are doubtless on the books at low prices . It is certaie. , however , that Indiana will eventually profit from present low crude oil prices . Either it will run this fresh crude , bought at low prices , and sell the products right away , or may later adopt a policy of converting some of its cash into crude oil when it thinks prices arc low enough . In any event : Indiana undoubtedly will be a buyer of crude oil some time during the present depression . Its cash position in such a situation could not be more timely for it will give it opportunity to put by a considerable amount of cheap oil against the time when markets area again righted and on a better price basis .
