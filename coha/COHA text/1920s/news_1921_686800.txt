txt AIRPLANES IN NAVAL WAR . Must Supplement , but Can not Replace , Warships . To the Editor of The New York Times : In answer to the recent article contributed by " Eyewitness " regarding the bombing tests : The comparison between mail planes and war planes operating in heavy weather is illuminating as a perfect example of a fallacious Q. E. D. Even if mail planes could from 5,000 feet drop the Daily Crier on every subseribcr doorstep regardless of the elements . it does not follow that . war planes could efficiently sink battleships . . The air people contend that fleets could be discovered and bombed while at anchor . Does this mean that they expect an enemy fleet to anchor in an American harbor thousands of miles from its base ( after defeating the United States fleet ) , or do they propose to replace the fleet in ear  --  ing the war into the enemy 's territory ? There are several military and technical restrictions related to the above questions which furnish . feed for pondering . As a starter they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best defense , " and then consider the comparative offensive abilities of fleets and air forcesThe statement that a ship fully manned and under way would sink faster from bomb wounds than would a stationary ship is surely ill-considered . Is it not generally known that several Dutch provinces were saved . from flooding by a peasant boy 's finger being placed in a hole in the ( Eke ? The public should he assured that even more modern methods are employed by the personnel on board battleships . He who knows not the efficacy of main drains , bilge pumps , bulkhead shores , W. T. doors , leak stoppers , &c.,; should listen more and prophesy less . This letter makes no attempt to discredit the airplane ; its purpose is to defend the modern battleship . The military airplane is in its restricted sphere a very formidable weapon . Just as battleships need destroyers , submarines and scouts , so also they now have need for airplanes and airplane carriers . The ultimate outcome of this question will be that airplanes must operate as an adjunct to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which also have restricted capabilities . H. N. WALLIN . Brooklyn , July 20 , 1921 . Schools in the City Campaign . To the Editor of The New York Times : In your editorial , " Platform and Candidates , " you gave the Coalition Committee and the Republican politicians sound advice . il The first requisite for a successful campaign is a candidate who stands some chance of being elected . The great mass of voters that are honestly solicitous for the welfare of the city can not be deceived by those political medicine makers , LaGuardia , Haskell and Bennett . As to home rule , we seem already to have more of it than is being properly administered . The Transit Commission seems to be funcBoning and should bo given a chanco to show what It can do . The school question should be the outstanding issue In this campaign . For years there have been complaints about overcrowded schools , but the Helan Administration 's I high pretensions and promises of school reIform have dwindled to innocuous desuetude . I The various welfare and uplift organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although many of their efforts have been misI directed  --  can for the time being engage in Ino better work than to heartily lend theit . I aid in electing men who will pledge themI selves to see justice done to both teachers Iland pupils . With a regular and proper school training j for children there will be much lees need for welfare end uplift wont among the I edulte of the future . The need of reform in school management is great and crying , and no issue can be put forward that compares . with it In importance , and yet we have the pitiful spectacle of so-called Republican leaders losing sight of this end other impon ant questions . brheging up deal issues and equabi blIng over the right of precedence .
