txt Mussolini . . was standing on the business side of his enormous desk in the magnificent room which serves as his office in the Palazzo Chigi . Leaning over and half lying on the desk he asked what I had noticed new in Italy . My reply was that it appeared that Italy was beginning to regard Fascism as a regime rather than a personal undertaking of Mussolini . The Dictator straightened . walked around the desk and ; in a sing-song and not unpleasant voice he uses at times , said : " What you say is very interesting . " Says Fascism Will Endure . Then moving closer  --  only about three inches away , and changing his tone  --  he said in a measured voice : " Fascism shall be established in Italy as a permanent institution . I do not know how long Mussolini will last , but Fascism shall last longer . Like the rest of us , I am here today and gone tomorrow : but let no one think Fascism goes with me . I will leave to Italy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution . Fascism controls Italy now and must stay in control . It has taken its place and shall keep it . The youth of Italy shall be trained so that in this country there shall be a place for each person , and each person shall be in that place . " Let no one waste his time speculating on what will become of Fascism when Mussolini is gone . " While Mussolini kindly agreed to discuss privately many issues , he refused to give more details- in his interview . He wanted to know what the United States thought of the Italian regime . The reply was that it thought much of Mussolini but less of Fascism . The Premier showed plainly he regarded that as showing that Americans did not understand Fascism . I remembered having interviewed Mussolini in Lausanne at the Turkish conference only a few short weeks after the Black Shirt march on Rome . There was then a sort of reckless aggressiveness in his manner and spirit , which now has been replaced by balanced assurance .

There can be no doubt that Mussolini believes he has found a system of government somewhere ? between absolutism and verbose parliamentarism which in its perfection would have the good points of both and dodge the faults of either . ' The ablest spirits in the country should run it for its own good . Waste in politics and waste in the country 's economy he thinks should go . In politics millions of useless words should be saved and in industry strikes and lockouts should go . If it is objected that the regime prevents free expression of opinion Mussolini would reply by asking what opinions not worth while should be expressed . In his ? National Dahlia. by which boys of $ are trained up through the Advance Guards into the Fascist Party at 18 , he imagines he has a machine that will produce men to run the party he has established as a political power . and thus to run the country on the basis of putting the State ahead of any and ail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascist program of a place . for every one , each one in that place and no noise about it , it is probable that if Mussolini is spared many more years in power his regime will show greater accommodation to current issues than in the past , when he faced a day-to-day fight to install himself in the secure position he appears to occupy today , with all political opposition crushed to earth . and even pressed into the ground . Perhaps he will make up his differences with France ; perhaps he will seek by commercial methods rather than others a foreign outlet for Italian man power and production . And perhaps one of these days the world will see a real effort by Mussolini to settle the old dispute between the Italian State and the  --  Vatican . No man who has changed his political faith as often as Mussolini would deny the possibility of evolution in the application of Fascist principles . If Mussolini really wishes the rest of the world to appreciate the growth or evolution of Fascism in Italy perhaps one good move would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples learning freely what Italy is doing .
