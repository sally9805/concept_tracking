txt Governor 's Civil Service Record . To the Editor of The New York Times : Apropos of the story in your issue of Sept. 2 giving an account of the attack alleged to have been made upon the civil service record , of Governor Smith at the annual convention of the New York State Civil Service Association . may I ask space for the statement that during his first term it was my privilege as the then President of the Municipal Civil Service Commission frequently to discuss with the Governor civil servica problems : he preached and practiced the absolutely fair and impartial administration of civil service laws and regulations , in letter as well as in spirit ; giving the public as well as the employee a square deal , without fear or favor . Nothing can better illustrate the Governor 's position on the subject than the reappointment by him , in face of bitter political opposition , of Colonel William Gorham Rice as Chairman of the State Civil Service Commission ; surely none but a true friend of the impartial application of civil service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission such an ultra orthodox champion of that law as Colonel Rice is universally known to be . Personal and official contact , therefore , enables me to say that the attack upon Governor Smith 's civil service record is as unjust as it is in bad grace . MORRIS CUKOR . Deal Beach , N. J. , Sept. 2 , 1923.
