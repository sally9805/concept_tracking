The scene is the living-room of a suite in a studio-building on the West Side , New York City . The proscenium displaces the great windows typical of these apartments ; midway up the rear wall is visible the railed landing of the stairs leading to the upper bedrooms . The large room is comfortably furnished , with a slight preponderance of the " exotic . " The walls are lined with book-shelves wherever convenient . There are books and magazines in profusion everywhere . On the right , near the fireplace , is a long , low , extremely comfortable looking armchair ; leaning against it is an ordinary drawing board . On the other side of this chair is a low table on which repose writing materials and a telephone . Not far from this armchair , also , just below the fireplace , is a small " portable " gramophone on a small stand . At the back , under the staircase landing , part of the hall is visible on the way to the entrance door . When the curtain rises , MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is a tall , handsome , beautifully dressed woman , about thirty-five . She might be described as " majestic " ; she has a fine face ; her voice is beautifully modulated and restrained even when she speaks under the stress of deep feeling . She is nervous and angry , and keeps looking at her watch . She takes up the manuscript of a story on the table , and drops it when she sees she has already read it . Finally she makes up her mind to leave ; she grasps her fur wrap , lying on a chair . At the door she stops , and returns to the telephone . Her voice is calm as she asks for the number . KENDALL at the telephone.Gramercy 4304 please  --  yes  --  may I speak to Mr. Storey please ?  --  I believe he lunched at the Club and I thought he might still be there  --  thank you so much  --  she holds the receiver to her ear , sitting on the arm of the chair  --  yes  --  about how long ago ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweeping gesture . This time she means really to go . She goes up stage and disappears in the little hallway leading to the corridor . The telephone tinkles . She runs back , quite excited , and answers the call p. 3 KENDALL at telephone.Yes . Yes , the line was busy  --  who ?  --  no , Mr. Storey is not in  --  this  --  this is a friend of his  --  is there any message ?  --  oh , Miss Grey  --  this is Mrs. Frayne  --  how do you do ?  --  yes  --  he was here but he went out  --  he 'll be back in a few minutes  --  I 'm leaving now , but I 'll leave the message for him . Not at all . Good-bye . She hangs up the receiver . She is thoroughly angry , humiliated . She writes out message , and is beginning to go when CLARK STOREY rushes in STOREY Awfully sorry . KENDALL I 'm leaving . STOREY Oh , come ! I 'm not so late . KENDALL Only an hour . STOREY The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . We got to talking  --  I told him his heroines were all neurotic and his heroes  --  KENDALL I 've got to go . She tries to STOREY Honestly , Kendall , I rushed up here as fast as I could . Had a fight with one taxi-driver and it took me hours to find another . Please do n't be angry . I 'm full of things to tell you  --  p. 4 KENDALL This always happens . STOREY Besides , I thought you 'd be quite comfortable . I left my new story for you to read . KENDALL That took exactly fifteen minutes . STOREY Only that ? Really , I must write a novel . Then I can be late with impunity . Great idea for a publisher 's blurb : " This novel is so absorbing that a jealous woman , waiting for the author to keep an appointment , forgot all about him  --  " KENDALL Really , you 've got to stop treating me like this ! STOREY I swear I only stayed on so long because I thought it would amuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying to myself : " This will amuse Kendall  --  ! " KENDALL Do n't talk like that to me . It 's all right for Monica Grey . It 's transparent to me . She just telephoned you , by the way . STOREY What did she want ? KENDALL You  --  It was humiliating . I had to say you had gone out . Of course she understood that I was waiting for you . STOREY Oh , well , everybody in town was at that luncheon . The great novelist is tall and thin and has a red beard . I suspect that if he shaved it would be discovered that he has no chin . And I was delighted to find what I already suspected from reading his novels  --  he has no sense of humour . p. 5 KENDALL Because he did n't find your flippancy amusing ? STOREY It 's as good a test as any . KENDALL He 's a genius . It shows on nearly every page of his writing . STOREY I dare say he is a genius . Sad thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Genius is a sort of fanaticism  --  The telephone rings KENDALL I 'm going . STOREY Please  --  just a minute  --  At ' phoneYou 're doing it  --  who is this ?  --  oh , hullo there , Austin  --  what about ?  --  Monica again ?  --  I thought you were all fixed  --  oh , you take her too seriously  --  I 'm busy just now  --  Mrs. Frayne  --  oh , sure  --  say twenty minutes  --  bye-bye . He hangs upAustin Lowe . Wants to weep on my shoulder . All burned up about Monica Grey . KENDALL And she 's burned up about you . STOREY Nonsense . A baby . Does n't know what she wants . KENDALL I think she does . CasuallyWhy do n't you marry her ? STOREY I have other plans . p. 6 KENDALL Meaning ? STOREY Meaning you . KENDALL Why should you want to marry me ? Outside of the fact that  --  you love comfort and I am  --  rich . STOREY Outside of the fact that I love comfort  --  and that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you enormously . You 're the most intelligent woman I know . KENDALL Not so intelligent . I discovered that  --  just  --  now  --  waiting for you . STOREY How ? KENDALL I was  --  jealous . STOREY wickedly.Of the celebrated English novelist ? You misunderstand me , Kendall . KENDALL Jealous of your selfsufficiency . Your independence of me . I saw you there talking , enjoying yourself , revelling in your own fluency . I realized perfectly well that you must have forgotten me or , if you did think of me , that you must be saying : " Oh , she 'll wait  --  " I was jealous , Storey . STOREY You too ! My last hope is gone . KENDALL You see , Storey , you are n't the least bit in love with me . STOREY I feel a much rarer , more stable emotion  --  friendliness and all sorts of affection and  --  p. 7 KENDALL I know . STOREY I was hoping we  --  you and I  --  might demonstrate the triumph of the loveless marriage . KENDALL How old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the last time you asked me ? KENDALL I believe you said twenty-eight . STOREY I lied . I 'm thirty . KENDALL I 'm thirty-five . STOREY Delightful age . KENDALL When I 'm forty-five you wo n't be any older than you are now . STOREY Wo n't I ! KENDALL Suppose you fall in love ? STOREY I 'm through with that sort of thing . KENDALL You sound so young sometimes  --  so nave . STOREY But I 've been through that sort of thing . I know . KENDALL I ca n't imagine you really in love . STOREY But I assure you , I was . It lasted two years . I suffered . I agonized . KENDALL Who was she ? p. 8 STOREY No one you know . She 's married now . Has children and a dull husband , a dull home . I see her occasionally . And I wonder at myself . Was it for her I felt that base emotion  --  jealousy ? Was it for her I used to wait in a torment of anxiety and anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimaginative , plodding creature . I see her and I wonder . KENDALL It may happen again  --  without warning . STOREY I doubt it . I 'm fed up with love . It 's a mirage , an illusion , a sort of pathology , feeds on being unsatisfied , rejected . Attain love and it vanishes  --  vanishes into the thin air or solidifies into such things as comfort and affection  --  things which you and I would have from the start , my dear . KENDALL doubtfully.All this is very pretty  --  STOREY the ' phone rings.That damn telephone  --  Taking it upYes  --  hullo , Monica  --  how are you ?  --  yes , Mrs. Frayne told me  --  I 'd just gone out to buy her a magazine with a poem of mine in it  --  oh , a trifle  --  not one of my major works  --  you 've got to see me ?  --  Austin just rang me up and told me the same thing  --  what 've you been doing to him ?  --  now do n't be a silly child  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your coming to see me  --  I sha n't coddle you  --  no , do n't come ; I sha n't be here  --  I  --  She has rung off . In disgustCrazy kid ! p. 9 KENDALL Gracious ! You are pursued by women ! STOREY Now there 's a case  --  Monica Grey ! Poor as a church mouse . Mother at her wit 's end to keep up the pretence of a conservative gentility . And here 's Austin Lowe absolutely dotty about her . A millionaire and a great man to boot  --  KENDALL gently.He is dull , Storey . STOREY Dull ! One of the most promising young chemists in America . Under thirty and he 's actually discovered something new  --  a new way of doing something or other . He 's an F.R.S. ! KENDALL Yes . And a B-O-R-E . STOREY If there 's one man on earth I envy it 's Austin Lowe . If I had his money and his brains  --  the vices I 'd encourage  --  the secrets I 'd explore  --  ! KENDALL In that case I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad you have n't his brains . STOREY Just because he 's not glib , like I am ! KENDALL He never has anything interesting to say  --  STOREY I can talk , ca n't I ? And that impresses you . But Austin 's a great man who 's made a contribution to science while I 'm an imitative poet and a second-rate short-story writer . p. 10 KENDALL You are a dear , Storey . STOREY Well , it 's true ! KENDALL I 'll make a great sacrifice : Monica can have the great man . I 'll take the second-rate short-story writer . STOREY You 'll get your preference . Austin ca n't see any one in the world but Monica . KENDALL She does n't care much for him , though . STOREY She will . I 'll let you in to a little secret  --  KENDALL Yes ? STOREY Austin and Monica are engaged . KENDALL Really ? It 's not announced , is it ? STOREY It just happened yesterday . Austin telephoned me in a perfect ecstasy . KENDALL I gather he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica 's a crazy kid . And being completely in love with her Austin 's at her mercy . KENDALL Miss Grey is rather adorable . Likes to be  --  audacious  --  does n't she ? STOREY Really an innocent . A Tennysonian ingenue with a Freudian patter . KENDALL Something appealingly wistful about her . p. 11 STOREY Actually she has all the picture-book illusions of a Saturday Evening Post heroine  --  but she 's picked up the vocabulary of the intelligentsia . Do n't let it deceive you . KENDALL Are you urging her to marry Austin ? STOREY Urge her ? My dear , I insist on it . KENDALL Why ? STOREY Why ? Because Austin 'll make an admirable husband for her . She 'll settle down and have babies and live in luxury . Her mother 'll spend her old age in comfort . And  --  so shall I ! KENDALL You 're incorrigible . STOREY I have enormous respect for money . You ca n't appreciate it . It can only be felt by those whose past was poverty-stricken and whose present  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked harder . STOREY I doubt it . I 'm too intelligent to write commercial truck and incapable of writing great stuff . It 's unfortunate . No , my dear . The only solution for me is to persuade you to marry me . KENDALL Would you want to marry me if I were poor ? STOREY That would be presumptuous . p. 12 KENDALL Presumptuous ? STOREY Only the rich should offer to marry poor girls . They are the only ones who can afford it . KENDALL You 're awfully mercenary . STOREY I 'm mature . But I am honest as well as mercenary . If you do marry me  --  I promise  --  I absolutely promise  --  not to live above your income  --  KENDALL amused.I ca n't be angry with you . STOREY Why should you be angry with me ? KENDALL Keeping me waiting an hour . STOREY At least I was n't with another woman . KENDALL I suppose that will come too . STOREY I 'll always come back to you . KENDALL You make me feel like a  --  STOREY Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never met you . STOREY You do n't mean that . Think of the nice times we 've had together . KENDALL I feel you 'll make me very unhappy . STOREY Only momentarily . And never wilfully . p. 13 KENDALL Anyway , I wish I were n't in love with you . STOREY You wo n't be  --  long . KENDALL It 's lasted now  --  three years . STOREY But most of that time your husband was alive . KENDALL after a moment.Storey  --  apart from being in love with you  --  I 'm very fond of you . I feel such fine things in you . If only you would n't waste yourself so , if only you 'd make the effort to live up to the best in you  --  STOREY Oh , now , Kendall , do n't you be fooled too . I am living up to the best in me . KENDALL But you potter so . You 're not concentrated on anything . STOREY But I 've a talent for pottering . KENDALL I feel you could do great work  --  STOREY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have certain facility for turning out pretty stuff  --  KENDALL I 'm sure you could do great things . STOREY You 're mistaken . I know my limitations . Nor have I any craving for immortality . When I 'm rich  --  when I 'm married to you  --  I probably sha n't write at all . I 'll be  --  what I 've always wanted to be  --  a prosperous dilettante. p. 14 KENDALL I never can tell when you 're joking  --  STOREY I assure you I 'm perfectly serious now . What this country needs is a dilettante class , interested in art with no desire to make money out of it . Why should n't there be an amateur class in art , as there is in sport ? KENDALL Is this a pose ? STOREY I assure you it is n't . Quite the contrary . At least you ca n't say afterwards that I married you under false pretences . I tell you now I 'm an adventurer  --  intellectually and morally  --  an arriviste with one virtue  --  honesty . KENDALL Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I 'll have to make the best of you . STOREY You 'd better  --  He rises , kisses her lightly , and folds her coat about her KENDALL turns and watches him  --  amused.I gather you 're dismissing me . STOREY Well , I have to do some work . With a gesture towards the manuscript KENDALL laughing.What ? STOREY I have n't touched that since this morning . And Austin 's coming in  --  p. 15 KENDALL And Miss Grey . STOREY You heard me tell her . I would n't be at home . KENDALL I heard her say she was coming . STOREY What can one do ? It 'll be a relief to me when these two are married off . KENDALL To me , too . STOREY Are you going out to-night ? KENDALL I do n't think so . STOREY Suppose I ring you  --  5.30ish . You might dine here . I 'll order dinner from downstairs . KENDALL All right . By the way , Storey  --  STOREY Yes ? KENDALL It 's  --  the end of the month . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . STOREY Ken , you demoralize me . KENDALL Here 's a cheque . You can pay me when your ship comes in . She gives STOREY the cheque . He puts it on the table STOREY You are a darling ! I suppose it 's dreadful to take money from a woman . But why it 's worse than taking it from a man I do n't know . Do you ? p. 16 KENDALL It all depends  --  STOREY Really , Kendall , you 've got to marry me right away  --  to save my self-respect . KENDALL What do you want your self-respect for ? STOREY I have n't the least idea  --  KENDALL slapping him.Halfwit STOREY affectionately.Darling He walks out with her , returning a moment later . Goes to telephoneRestaurant , please  --  Mr. Storey speaking  --  I want dinner for two for to-night  --  seven-thirty  --  up here . Oysters , small ones  --  clear soup  --  suprme of chicken with mushrooms  --  salad  --  yes  --  yes  --  thank you , Frederic  --  He hangs up , takes off his coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wide sleeves and brilliant sash . Then settles himself into the easy chair , puts the drawing board across its arms , making a bridge on which he puts the writing-paper , and starts to create . Inspiration is halting ; he lights a cigarette . The door-bell rings . He gets up and goes to door , admitting AUSTIN LOWE . Leaves him and comes back to his chair . AUSTIN is serious , woe-begone . STOREY 'S manner to him is extremely friendly p. 17 STOREY with a wave towards his work.I was in the middle of an immortal sentence AUSTIN I 'm sorry , old man . I had to see you . STOREY You look seedy . AUSTIN Did n't sleep a wink last night . STOREY Cocktail ? AUSTIN miserably.Nothing . STOREY Do you good . AUSTIN I could n't , really . Could n't even eat my lunch . STOREY What 's the matter ? Do n't tell me that discovery you made turned out to be old stuff . AUSTIN It 's nothing to do with that . STOREY There 's an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets it . Rushes to the Science Club or wherever scientists rush when they 've found something . When he gets there the boss tells him : " Sorry , old man , but Professor Funkenwangler got this yesterday  --  here 's his cable  --  " AUSTIN irritably.I tried to get you twenty times to-day . Last night , too . Where the devil 've you been ? p. 18 STOREY Been ? Let 's see  --  where the devil have I been ? Oh , last night I went to a party . Then on to Charmian Drew 's . Know her ? AUSTIN No . STOREY Very pretty girl . Got back at six this morning . Got up in time to go to lunch to meet Stryker Collins , the English novelist . Know his stuff ? AUSTIN No . STOREY Vastly over-ratod , if you ask me . The heroines are always throwing things at the heroes . Never saw such nasty women . AUSTIN I 'm awfully low to-day , Storey , old man . STOREY affecting surprise.Low ? Really ? You seem so gay  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica . STOREY Monica ? AUSTIN She 's thrown me over . STOREY Nonsense . AUSTIN Says she wo n't marry me . STOREY You take that child too seriously , Austin . AUSTIN But she means it this time , Storey . Told me last night . Says it 's all over . Gave me back  --  the ring . See . Here  --  Shows him the ring , with which he fumbles miserably p. 19 STOREY looking critically at the ring.I 'm glad she did . I never was crazy about that ring . Neither was Monica . I imagine . You can return it now and get her something less  --  conventional . I 'll go with you to Cartier 's . The other day I saw a stunning oblong emerald  --  AUSTIN But do n't you see ! She does n't want my ring . Any ring . She does n't want me . STOREY What 's her reason ? For suddenly  --  AUSTIN Said when she promised to marry me she yielded to outside pressure  --  STOREY Her little mother . AUSTIN Said she acted against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't love me  --  that she never could love me . What shall I do now , Storey ? STOREY Leave her alone for a week and  --  try again . AUSTIN The worst of it is  --  STOREY What ? AUSTIN She loves somebody else . STOREY She said so ? AUSTIN Yes . STOREY Who ? AUSTIN Would n't tell me. p. 20 STOREY I do n't believe it . AUSTIN Why not ? STOREY She 'd have told me . AUSTIN You think so ? STOREY Certainly . AUSTIN She would , unless  --  STOREY Unless what ? AUSTIN Unless the man she loves  --  is you . STOREY I ? You 're crazy , Austin . AUSTIN breathless.She likes you . She likes you better than me , that 's plain . It 's a wonder to me you do n't marry her . STOREY Austin , you 're losing your sense of humour . Fancy my being married to Monica ! She 'd leave me in six months . By which time I should certainly have left her . AUSTIN wanting to be contradicted.I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing . She could n't stand the poverty of my mnage and  --  neither could I. AUSTIN I ca n't understand it . You 're not in love with her ? STOREY There speaks the eternal lover . I think it strange you are in love with her . She 's pretty  --  I grant you that . But , great Heavens , man  --  so young . p. 21 AUSTIN rapt.She is young . STOREY And so full of spirits ! AUSTIN Is n't she ? STOREY Always laughing . Like the constant ringing of chimes . AUSTIN It is like chimes . STOREY You 've certainly got it badly , Austin . AUSTIN I ca n't think of anything else . It  --  it  --  obsesses me . STOREY a bit wickedly.After all , you have your science . AUSTIN You think that means anything to me now ? When I 've lost her ? I tell you I ca n't work since I 've known Monica . STOREY Your researches ? AUSTIN They 're all nothing . I ca n't do a thing . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STOREY shaking his head.What an illusion that is about the cold mastery of scientific men ! Look at you  --  helpless as a baby . AUSTIN And the worst of it is there 's nothing to do . It 's not like a problem  --  that you can work at . She just does n't love me . And that 's all there is to it . I 'm sunk . p. 22 STOREY If you want her  --  really want her  --  you can get her . AUSTIN That 's what you always say . But it 's not true . STOREY lighting a cigarette.No doubt about it . I 'm sure . AUSTIN But she told me  --  last night  --  STOREY She does n't in the least know what she wants . Wo n't till after she 's married . That 's up to you  --  AUSTIN But she 's not attracted to me . STOREY She does n't understand you . She has no appreciation of your intellectual gifts . AUSTIN sadly.That 's true . My work means nothing to her . STOREY Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how wonderful it is . Go on about the marvellous delicacy of your experiments . AUSTIN If I could only talk like you ! STOREY That 's easy . AUSTIN How ? STOREY Cultivate superficiality . AUSTIN If she only understood me  --  as you do ! p. 23 STOREY She shall be made to . AUSTIN How ? STOREY lighting another cigarette.Maternal pressure . I 'll wager you any thing a starved writer can pay that Mrs. Grey does n't know Monica 's refused you . AUSTIN What if she did ? STOREY She 'd raise hell . You see the old lady 's dreadfully afraid  --  of guess what ? AUSTIN What ? STOREY That Monica will marry me . AUSTIN There , you see . Even she 's noticed it . STOREY A good thing , too . Might be a fine thing to persuade Mrs. Grey that I want to marry Monica . She 'll never rest then until Monica 's married to you . AUSTIN What makes you think so ? STOREY Monica 's mother 's perfectly cracked about the idea of having you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminence . It 's not even your family , though of course that has something to do with it . It 's your money , my friend , your lucre , your multitudinous boodle  --  AUSTIN I can hardly believe  --  p. 24 STOREY Sorry , but that 's what it is . The Greys are mighty hard up . Monica 's been dressing shamefully of late  --  AUSTIN truculently.She looks better  --  STOREY I know . Niftier in gingham than a fine lady in velvet . AUSTIN She looks wonderful in anything . STOREY How extraordinary that a little girl like Monica can make a man like you talk like a hack writer ! AUSTIN bristling.Look here , I do n't quite like your tone about Monica ! STOREY Do n't misunderstand me . Oh , I 'm awfully fond of her . But she is a spoiled little minx , shallow as a platter . Her lack of appreciation of you proves that . AUSTIN pathetically.Well , she 's only twenty . Sometimes I think I 'm too old for her . STOREY You 're only twenty-nine . AUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so full of fun . I ca n't  --  prattle , Storey . I ca n't follow her small talk . STOREY Her talk is not small . It is infinitesimal . Your microscopic training should help you . p. 25 AUSTIN I do n't do the things she likes  --  dance , play tennis  --  you know . STOREY regarding him judicially.You 're not a jazz figure , Austin . But cou 'd better marry her anyway . If you do n't she 'll run away with a tenor or something . AUSTIN You keep telling me to marry her as if I did n't want to . Damn it , Storey , I 'd give my soul  --  STOREY I do n't think that will be necessary . But you might make some other sacrifices . AUSTIN I 'll do anything  --  STOREY Take this thing more lightly , ca n't you ? You 've fallen in love like an awkward schoolboy  --  not like a man of the world . AUSTIN But I 'm not a man of the world . STOREY Ca n't you act the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue-tied . All you can do is silently register adoration . AUSTIN I know it . I ca n't help it . When I do think of something to say it sounds so inadequate to me that I do n't say it . STOREY If you 'd only remember that everything 's on your side . You 've so much to offer . p. 26 AUSTIN I wish I thought so . STOREY If you persist , you 'll win her , as the military men say , by attrition . " Attrition " is a good word for future use . He makes a note on his MS . AUSTIN She told me not to try to see her , nor to ring her up . I tell you , Storey , I do n't know what to do with myself . STOREY shaking his head.You 're a great argument against celibacy , Austin , old boy . AUSTIN You know , Storey , I used to think  --  before I met Monica  --  that I 'd never marry a girl unless she wanted me as much as I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I want Monica . PassionatelyI 'd marry her on any terms , you understand ? It 's beyond  --  pride . You understand ? STOREY Of course I understand And I 'll do everything I can to help you , believe me . AUSTIN fervently.You 're a brick , Storey . STOREY Now , look here . I 've got to do a little work . Why do n't you go round the corner to the Chemists ' Club , look over some of those fascinating magazines full of algebraic formul , and come back here to dine ? p. 27 AUSTIN That 's awfully good of you , Storey , really . I hate to be alone . STOREY I know . AUSTIN You 're the only person I can talk to . STOREY Come back  --  say in twenty minutes . I 'll order dinner from downstairs . AUSTIN You make it so easy for your friends to impose on you , Storey . You 're swell . STOREY Do n't deceive yourself , old boy . I get a sadistic pleasure out of watching you writhe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of superiority . AUSTIN Always joking ! STOREY It 's the grim truth . AUSTIN You 're the finest  --  STOREY bustles him to doorCome now , Austin , run along . See you in twenty minutes . AUSTIN at door.Er  --  there 's something else . STOREY Yes . AUSTIN I 've been wanting to speak to you about it for some time . STOREY Well , spit it out . AUSTIN It 's about money . p. 28 STOREY My favorite subject . AUSTIN Er  --  your writing . Does it  --  I mean to say  --  does it bring you in very much ? STOREY Not what it should . I 'm caviare to the general , Austin . AUSTIN That 's what I thought . Well  --  you see  --  I mean to say  --  you see  --  well , damn it all , I 'm so rich , Storey . Wo n't you let me help you out occasionally ? STOREY Of course I will .

STOREY It 's a pleasure I sha n't deny you . So long , Austin . p. 29 AUSTIN Good-bye , old man . Awfully good of you to let me come back . STOREY Do n't mention it . AUSTIN goes out . STOREY goes to his armchair . There is a smile on his lips . After a moment of meditation he reaches for the telephoneRegent 2772  --  please  --  Mrs. Frayne  --  Mr. Storey  --  hullo , Ken  --  I 've changed my mind about dining here  --  let 's go out somewhere  --  yes , I did order it , but I 'm going to let two other people eat it  --  and  --  Kendall  --  will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind what I say  --  just ' phone me .

Good-bye , Mrs. Frayne , see you later . He hangs up receiver , puts board across the arms of his chair , as before , and begins to write . He gets up and goes to bookshelf for dictionary . Finds his word . Goes back to his board , savouring it . Writes a few lines when door-bell rings . He ignores it . It rings again , four short rings . Then , shouting.Door 's open !

STOREY same tone.Think so , do you ? He sounds suddenly weary MONICA I love it . She reads " They had been dancing and he asked her to go outside with him . They stepped out through the open French windows , crossed the lawn and walked down a narrow path between high populars . The tree-tops made hedges in the sky between which the stars grew like buttercups . " Buttercups . That 's lovely . p. 32 STOREY Go on . MONICA " It was a most curious moon , red-bronze in colour , wafer-thin , exquisitely curved , a shaving of a moon . Courtney allowed himself to speculate to the girl beside him . ' God , ' he said .

Have you  --  ? MONICA Oh , now , Storey , please do n't scold me . Not to-day . To-day I want you to be nice to me. p. 33 STOREY risingWhat 's this about you and Austin ?

She does it STOREY groaningYou 're the bane of my existence , Monica . MONICA Now , we 'll talk . STOREY Well ? MONICA Storey  --  tell the truth  --  would n't you rather have me sitting on your lap like this than Mrs. Frayne ? STOREY Do n't get fresh , Monica . Besides , the query is totally irrelevant . MONICA It is n't at all . It 's got everything to do with everything . I ca n't imagine Mrs. Frayne sitting on anybody 's lap . She 's too  --  dignified . p. 34 STOREY No one requires you to imagine that , my dear . MONICA defiantlyI do n't like Mrs. Frayne . STOREY She likes you . MONICA I do n't believe it . I 'm sure she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . She thinks you 're very pretty but adolescent . MONICA with a wicked smile I may be young , but my thoughts are mature . STOREY pretending to be shocked.Monica ! MONICA No , I do n't like Mrs. Frayne . She 's a bad influence on you . STOREY Will you please stop chattering about Kendall and tell me about you and Austin ? MONICA You hate to have me criticize her . I know it . STOREY I 'm really very busy , Monica . MONICA Busy ! Bless your heart , you never do a thing . STOREY I might if you 'd marry Austin and save me worrying about you . MONICA incredulouslyWould you really let me marry him ! p. 35 STOREY Let you ! My God ! I pray for it . MONICA You 'd go to church  --  and  --  watch it happen  --  ? STOREY Why not ? MONICA And go home and rub your palms and say " That 's that , " I suppose .

MONICA cuddling to him I will . STOREY Well ? MONICA Do n't hurry me , darling . I 'm going to stay here a long time . STOREY Unfortunately  --  MONICA putting her hand over his mouthUnfortunately , nothing . I 'm going to stay here and dine with you and then we 'll have a long talk and after that  --  we 'll take a walk  --  p. 36 STOREY And after that ? MONICA I 'll come back with you if you like . Storey , if you ruin me will you make an honest woman of me ? STOREY I wo n't marry you , Monica , no matter what you do . MONICA sighingGee , Storey , you 're hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not as indifferent to you as I pretend . MONICA Are n't you ? STOREY Of course I 'm not . MONICA Do n't you want to kiss me ?

He bores me to death . I never want to see him again . There is a pause STOREY Monica , I want to tell you something . Listen . He draws her to him againListen . I intend to be honest about Austin . You get me , do n't you ? He 's so helpless  --  that I do n't intend to take advantage of him . Besides , he 's a fine fellow . Awfully sincere . Awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him . STOREY He 's inarticulate , but he 's a fine brain . MONICA But I love you , Storey . STOREY Now do n't be a silly child . What sort of life do you suppose we should have together ? MONICA Cozy . STOREY And what 'll we live on ? MONICA I 'll work . STOREY At what ? MONICA I 'll typewrite . STOREY What ? MONICA Your stories . He makes a gesture of despairI 'll go in the movies ! I have a friend who 's a director . p. 38 STOREY Your mother would be delighted ! MONICA By the way  --  I 've told Mother . STOREY You 've told Mother what ? MONICA That I ca n't marry Austin because I 'm in love with you . STOREY You did n't  --  MONICA Mother despises you , Storey . STOREY very angryAnd you 're fool enough to tell her  --  ! MONICA misunderstandingIt does n't matter to me that she does n't like you . It just makes me love you all the more  --  STOREY That 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not all I told her . STOREY It 's quite enough  --  MONICA in one breathI told her you loved me too , and that you 'd asked me to marry you and that I 'd said yes . I intend to make quite a campaign , you see . STOREY I 've a good mind to spank you ! MONICA I thought that if I told Mother you 'd asked me that you would be  --  sort of compromised . You see , I 'm trying to get it spread around  --  that we 're engaged . He starts to speak p. 39 STOREY Now look here , Monica . She puts her hand over his mouth to stifle his protest MONICA For once do n't talk and listen to me . The fact is that I 'm doing all this for your good . STOREY Thank you ! MONICA For your good , Mr. Storey . STOREY Would you mind telling me  --  ! MONICA Of course I 'll tell you . You see I know , I 'm just certain  --  that way down deep it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Since you love me you ought to marry me . STOREY You 've been reading again . MONICA You admit that the only reason you do n't ask me is because you 're poor and you think I want all sorts of frivolous things . It 's just like you  --  you 're so splendid and always thinking of other people  --  STOREY in despairGood God ! MONICA But you misjudge me , Storey . Honestly you do . I could be awfully happy on just what you have . STOREY Perhaps . But I could n't . MONICA You ought to marry a poor girl , Storey . It would stimulate you , make you work harder . p. 40 STOREY Are you quite finished ? MONICA Not quite . I just got an idea , I think I 'll phone an announcement of our engagement to the newspapers . STOREY really frightenedYou 'll do no such thing . MONICA laughing joyouslyI 've got you , Storey  --  I 've got you at last . STOREY Come here . Now , come here . MONICA No way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STOREY Come here ! Leading her to sofaNow sit down like a lamb and concentrate on what I 'm going to tell you . MONICA demurelyAll right , teacher . STOREY How old are you , Monica ? MONICA You know perfectly well . I 'm twenty . STOREY Now listen  --  this is serious , I 'm thirty-one . MONICA Nice age for a man . STOREY Eleven years older than you . Just think when I 'm forty-one  --  that 's middle-aged , you know , Monica  --  p. 41 MONICA I 'll be thirty-one . Think how attractive I 'll be . STOREY Of course you will . And I 'll be  --  bald and wrinkled and  --  Oh , I know that 's been said before . MONICA No , you wo n't . Your hair 'll be just touched with grey . You 'll look very distinguished . STOREY I 'm too old for you , Monica . MONICA And yet you want me to marry Austin . He 's as old as the hills . STOREY He 's two years younger than I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so correct  --  like an old deacon . STOREY You talk outrageously when he 's around . MONICA I love to shock him . He 's such a Puritan ! STOREY You 've got to stop reproaching me , before him , for not having an affair with you . It gets on my nerves . MONICA I believe I shock you , too , Storey . STOREY Not in the least . But I hate to see the poor fellow suffer . MONICA Austin 's so literal . Absolutely no glimmering of humour . Oh ! This will make you laugh  --  wait till I show you ! She runs back to her bag , and dips into it p. 42 STOREY Nobody in love has a sense of humour ! MONICA holding up magazineLook what he sent me  --  STOREY taking the austerely covered pamphlet " Proceedings of the American Chemical Society  --  " MONICA With an article by Austin in it  --  look  --  here  --  STOREY reading " A new method of separating atoms and ions which are chemically similar but have different weights by diffusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tells you what to expect , does n't it ? MONICA Now whatever do you think Austin  --  ! STOREY intent on the articleThis is very touching , Monica . MONICA I know , but  --  why it 's nearly all figures  --  it would take an expert to  --  He has n't removed his eyes from the article ; she stands looking at it with him STOREY Has a brilliant climax , this thing . MONICA Climax ! Where ? STOREY There . It 's an equation  --  ca n't you see ! p. 43 MONICA Oh , Storey , come now ! I do n't believe you have the faintest idea what it 's all about . STOREY Of course I have n't . I 've had a shallow literary education . But I can see this  --  that in this chaos here in the first part of his article  --  you see  --  in this abracadabra  --  this forest of figures  --  Austin had scented , somewhere , an equation lurking . And he 's found it , damn him , dredged it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ! MONICA Oh , Storey ! STOREY I 'm perfectly serious , Monica . And I think it was very sweet of him to send you this  --  if you had any imagination you 'd see  --  it 's a tender , a beautiful gesture  --  this tapping paper  --  this is his lyric , Monica . MONICA I prefer lyrics that rhyme . STOREY An equation is a rhyme  --  a perfect rhyme , subtler and harder to find than any you 'll see in my effusions  --  Flinging the thing awayHow do you know what hope for the future is hidden in this little prose poem ? MONICA You 're so generous about others , Storey . I love you for it ! STOREY Do n't be too sure of my motive . Perhaps it 's because I want to get conveniently rid of you ! MONICA presents herself before him , shaking her head stubbornly , her hands crossed behind her back p. 44 MONICA It 's no good , Storey . You might as well give up ! STOREY Now please be serious , Monica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're lovely and his money will provide you with the exquisite background your beauty requires . And he 's good ! MONICA sitting on sofa , piteously.I just ca n't do it , Storey . Please do n't ask me to . STOREY He wo n't bother you . Spends ages in his laboratory , you know . MONICA I 'm sure he does n't sleep in the laboratory . STOREY Oh now , Monica . Really , you 're impossible . MONICA Am I so terrible , Storey ? Do n't you love me at all ? STOREY I 'm frightfully fond of you  --  crazy about you . MONICA Then why do you keep me in suspense like this ? STOREY Monica , you 're so young . I know so much more about life than you do . I know what would happen  --  I know this feeling you have for me now  --  wo n't last . MONICA But I swear  --  I 'll never love anybody else . If you do n't marry me  --  I 'll go into a convent . I swear . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 'll have me . MONICA passionatelyJust because she 's rich ! You know you would n't think of marrying her if she were n't  --  the trouble with you is  --  you 're damned selfish . STOREY Of course I am . MONICA Just admitting it does n't do any good . You like to go about and be petted by people . And your silly little comforts . You see , I know , deep down , you 're fonder of me than of any one . Just as I know that I 'm fonder of you than I ever shall be of any one  --  He makes a sudden move towards her ; is irresistibly attracted , stopsObey that impulse . STOREY It 's ridiculous . Impossible . Ridiculous . MONICA Why not ? STOREY You 're a silly child . You do n't know anything about anything . You do n't know what you want , really . MONICA Yes , I do know . STOREY disturbedI warn you Monica  --  if you keep this up I will marry you . MONICA You wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for you as much as for myself . I want to save you . p. 46 STOREY Save me ? MONICA I want you to live up to the best that 's in you . STOREY My God , Monica , I believe you have the makings of a good woman . MONICA You ought to marry me for the sake of your art . If you marry Mrs. Frayne you 'll be so comfortable you wo n't write a thing . STOREY I am thirty-one and in full possession of my senses . It would be positively immoral for me to marry you . MONICA But it would be more moral than anything else you could do to me . STOREY looking at her with perplexity . The door-bell ringsThank God ! Austin . He jumps up MONICA terrifiedAustin ! STOREY Well , I think it 's Austin . The bell rings again MONICA Do n't answer . He 'll go away . STOREY I could n't do that . MONICA Did you know he was coming ? STOREY I was n't sure . MONICA Promise you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do what I can  --  Bell ringsWhy does n't he come in ? The door 's open . He goes out . MONICA walks about petulantly . She flings a pillow violently into a corner . AUSTIN comes in , followed by STOREY MONICA Hullo , Anti Genesis . STOREY Anti what ? MONICA Do n't you know my little pet-name for Austin ? Anti Genesis . STOREY Eh ? AUSTIN Monica actually believed the world began in the Garden of Eden . MONICA slylyAustin disillusioned me about the book of Genesis . AUSTIN seriously.She 'd never heard of the Nebular Theory . STOREY Monica !  --  Oh , well , you must n't mind her , Austin . It 's the fashion nowadays to be flippant . Monica gets it from me . The difference is  --  my flippancy is a sort of defence . Monica 's is a boast . The nice thing , though , about Monica is she does n't know anything . Gives one a pleasant sense of omniscience  --  The telephone rings . STOREY answers itYes  --  oh , hullo  --  waiting for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't it ?  --  Dear me , is this Tuesday ?  --  How awfully stupid of me  --  the truth is I 've been so lost in my work  --  yes , I can make it easily by seven  --  I 'll be right over  --  Good-bye . He hangs up receiverCertainly lucky you dropped in , Austin . p. 48 MONICA sensing somethingWhat 's happened now ? STOREY The fact is , my dear , I ca n't dine with you after all . MONICA furiousOh , ca n't you ? STOREY I had no idea it was Tuesday . I thought it was Monday . MONICA Of course when one works as hard as you do one is apt to forget the day of the week ! STOREY to AUSTINI 've ordered dinner for two . Would you mind dining with Monica instead of me ? AUSTIN overjoyedRight here ? STOREY I 've ordered a delicious dinner from downstairs . AUSTIN I 'd love to . That is , if Monica  --  MONICA mechanically.Of course . STOREY I 've really got to dash . Austin , mind lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got a cent with me . AUSTIN Of course . He takes out a bill and hands it to STOREY STOREY One thing about Austin . He 's not one of those millionaires who never has any money with him . p. 49 AUSTIN Can give you more . Here 's a twenty . STOREY Well , perhaps I 'd better . Takes itSo long , children . To AUSTINYou 'll find everything ready for a cocktail in the kitchenette . MONICA Are you coming back ? STOREY Might . I 'll ' phone you . AUSTIN I 'm not very good at mixing cocktails . STOREY And you a chemist  --  ! MONICA This is a dirty trick , Storey . STOREY to AUSTIN.You 'll find a recipe in the kitchenette . AUSTIN Will I ? You 'll have to help me , Monica . He goes past STOREY into the hall MONICA white with anger.You 're dining with Mrs. Frayne . STOREY Yes . In five years you 'll thank me . In less  --  MONICA All right for you , Storey ! STOREY Good-bye , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disappearing , " So long , Austin . " MONICA moves down stage . AUSTIN reappears with a cocktail shaker p. 50 AUSTIN It does n't say how much absinthe or how much vermouth  --  MONICA says nothing . Her face is set in misery . AUSTIN comes down a little . He stands awkwardly holding the cocktail mixer by the neck . WistfullyI do n't know  --  do you put absinthe or do you put vermouth  --  She turns away impatiently@@ SCENE I.  --  The scene is the same . The time is 8.30  --  two hours after the fall of the first act curtain . When the curtain rises , AUSTIN and MONICA are discovered at the gatelegged table , finishing dinner . MONICA dallies with her dessert . AUSTIN watches her , wondering what to say . AUSTIN finally.Will you have some more coffee ? MONICA No , thanks . There is another pause AUSTIN mournfully.It 's  --  it 's jolly to be sitting here and eating like this . MONICA mechanically.Is n't it ? AUSTIN It is for me , anyway . As she says nothing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not . AUSTIN I wish I knew how to amuse you , Monica . MONICA You 're a dear , Austin . You 're far too nice for me . AUSTIN Too nice for you . p. 52 MONICA You are , really . You 're a great man . And awfully modest and nice . I 'm just a restless little nobody who does n't know what she wants . AUSTIN You 're fairly certain about what you do n't want  --  MONICA I 'm afraid I know what I want too , Austin . AUSTIN I wish I were fluent , like Storey . I wish I could talk , like Storey . MONICA What would you say ? AUSTIN I 'd tell you I love you . MONICA But you 've told me that . And I 've told you that I do n't admire your choice . AUSTIN I know . There is a pause MONICA There 's no reason why we ca n't be friends . AUSTIN That 's like telling a starving man  --  there 's no reason he ca n't look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin , you 're brilliant to-night . AUSTIN emboldened by his success.I feel that if I could find the words  --  Somewhere there must be the words that would say what I feel for you . And once you knew what I feel , I feel you would love me. p. 53 MONICA half-listening.I wonder  --  AUSTIN Yes . I feel that . What I say to you is banal , trite . I have no gift of speech . I know it . I  --  I 'm dumb . MONICA touched , patting his hand.You are a dear , Austin . I 'm very fond of you . AUSTIN Last night you said  --  you never wanted to see me again . MONICA rising , walking about the room.Last night ? I was tired , upset  --  AUSTIN You said  --  MONICA Please , Austin , do n't talk to me any more about last night . AUSTIN meekly.All right , Monica . One of those pauses.Would you  --  would you like to go to a theatre ? MONICA No . Thank you . AUSTIN Storey says Gertrude Lawrence  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the opera . My mother has a box  --  MONICA Not to-night , Austin , thanks . Storey said he 'd telephone , did n't he ? p. 54 AUSTIN Did he ? MONICA I think he did . A pause . MONICA lights a cigarette , and walks about restlessly . AUSTIN I believe Storey 's dining with Mrs. Frayne . MONICA Is he ? AUSTIN Yes . MONICA Austin ? AUSTIN Yes ? MONICA Do you like Mrs. Frayne ? AUSTIN Yes . I think she 's a lovely woman . Do n't you ? MONICA She probably was . AUSTIN I wonder  --  will Storey marry her ? MONICA I 've no idea . AUSTIN I think she 's in love with him . MONICA Why not ? AUSTIN I think it would be a good match . Do n't you ? MONICA How can I tell ? AUSTIN Storey sees her every day . MONICA Ca n't we really find any one to talk about except Storey ? AUSTIN Well , you 're so keen about him . p. 55 MONICA What makes you think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUSTIN But last night  --  MONICA Last night does n't matter . To-day does . AUSTIN very happy.Then you  --  ! MONICA I despise him . She slumps into the chair near the table where STOREY has put the cheque KENDALL has given him . AUSTIN Then perhaps  --  He moves towards her uncertainly , pauses , does not know what to say . She is lost in a dream , does not hear him.Then perhaps  --  MONICA Perhaps what ? AUSTIN If there 's no one else  --  I mean if you 're not in love with Storey  --  or any one else  --  perhaps  --  MONICA almost in tears.Please , Austin  --  be a darling and do n't  --  do n't make love to me . AUSTIN I ca n't help it . Is n't it awful ? I ca n't make love to you  --  and I do n't know what else to talk about . p. 56 MONICA Talk to me  --  talk to me about Evolution . AUSTIN But you said you preferred the Garden of Eden . MONICA To  --  primeval chaos . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of wild flowers better than a lot of  --  slime ? AUSTIN distressed.But the Bible is n't true . MONICA What of it ? Adam and Eve were such a nice couple . AUSTIN I ca n't see the use of talking about anything  --  that is n't true . MONICA with a sigh.That shuts out so many subjects . AUSTIN hesitating.Did you  --  did you get the  --  my  --  the article I sent you ? MONICA Oh , yes , thanks ! How awfully clever you are ! AUSTIN greatly flustered , blushing.Oh  --  it was just  --  that 's what I 've been working on a good deal lately  --  a new method of separating radium  --  MONICA gently.Of course I do n't pretend to have understood it  --  p. 57 AUSTIN That 's the trouble  --  unless you know the vocabulary of science it does n't mean much  --  like giving the score of a symphony to a person who ca n't read it . MONICA I know . I 'm terribly ignorant , Austin . AUSTIN You think what I do is awfully dull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes to the laboratory  --  I 'd like to show you  --  it 's really awfully interesting  --  it 's exciting . MONICA Oh , for you ! AUSTIN No , for anybody  --  Monica , I wish you 'd let me read you something  --  MONICA From your article ? AUSTIN No . From a book I 've brought you . MONICA Oh ! Thank you , Austin . What 's the book ? AUSTIN producing it. It 's by Bertrand Russell  --  MONICA a bit let down.Oh ! AUSTIN You know who he is , do n't you ? MONICA doubtfully.Well , I 've heard of him . AUSTIN Well , he 's just one of the greatest men alive , that 's all . p. 58 MONICA touched by his eagerness , pats his arm.Is he , Austin ? AUSTIN I came across this passage the other day  --  I marked it  --  I thought  --  the minute I read it  --  " I must get this for Monica ! " MONICA peering over at book . " Mysticism and Logic . " What a nice title ! Ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you ? But her thoughts wander off to STOREY AUSTIN They 're a lot of essays  --  this one 's about mathematics . Reading . " Mathematics , rightly viewed , possesses not only truth but supreme beauty  --  a beauty cold and austere , like that of sculpture , without appeal to any part of our weaker nature , without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music , yet sublimely pure , and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show . The true spirit of delight , the exaltation , the sense of being more than man , which is the touchstone of the highest excellence , is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry . " The cadence of AUSTIN 'S voice , his profound sincerity , and the beauty of the passage itself affect MONICA  --  as a bit of sad music might . She is quite rapt . But AUSTIN feels suddenly unsure.Interesting , is n't it ? p. 59 MONICA Oh , yes ! Do go on ! AUSTIN " Remote from human passions , remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gradually created an ordered cosmos , where pure thought can dwell as in its natural home , and where one , at least , of our nobler impulses can escape from the dreary exile of the actual world . " He stops a moment to look at her and finds her eyes full of tears . AUSTIN Monica ! You 're crying ! MONICA I wish I could do that ! AUSTIN What ? MONICA Escape from the dreary exile of the actual world . AUSTIN Are n't you happy , Monica ? MONICA Not very . Why do n't you marry somebody else , somebody worthy of you ? AUSTIN Whom ? MONICA That awfully clever girl . You know , that girl I met you with . You told me she was a research chemist . What 's a research chemist ? AUSTIN A person who engages in chemical research . MONICA Oh !  --  Well , why do n't you marry her , Austin ? She seemed awfully nice . p. 60 AUSTIN She is nice . MONICA And I suppose she adores you . AUSTIN Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! AUSTIN shaking his head. No . MONICA Why not ? AUSTIN For one thing  --  she knows too much for me . MONICA Ho ! Vain ! AUSTIN She wears woollen stockings . MONICA Ah , Austin , you are a funny man . Looking at him closely.I believe you 're quite serious . You 've no sense of humour , Austin . Sometimes  --  it 's delicious . AUSTIN I prefer you , Monica . MONICA For a man who lives by his brain  --  you 're awfully illogical , Austin . AUSTIN I know I am . I 've tried to reason you  --  out of my  --  consciousness . I ca n't do it . MONICA Well , I 'm as stupid as you are . Stupider . AUSTIN Why ? MONICA For  --  loving him . p. 61 AUSTIN Loving whom ? MONICA Storey . AUSTIN Storey ! MONICA Of course . Who else ? AUSTIN altogether bewildered.But  --  but you just said  --  you despised him . MONICA helplessly.Oh , Austin  --  She covers her face with her hands . AUSTIN I do n't understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try , Austin  --  She gets up , her dress brushing off some papers from the small table . AUSTIN picking up the things.How careless Storey is  --  leaving a cheque lying around like this . MONICA A cheque ? Did n't know he had a cheque . AUSTIN Five hundred dollars for a story . MONICA Five hundred ! Why , he did n't tell me . Let me see it . She takes cheque , looks at it and sees MRS . FRAYNE 'S signature . Her fingers clutch over it . Casually.How do you know he got it for a story ? p. 62 AUSTIN He told me . I asked him whether he needed money . MONICA He did , of course ! AUSTIN He said he did n't  --  because he 'd just had this cheque . MONICA bitterly , crumpling the cheque.The highest bidder ! AUSTIN alarmed.Here , what are you doing  --  ? MONICA I 'm sorry . She returns the cheque to him , he straightens it , and refolds it neatly . He ca n't help seeing the name . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He puts the cheque back . AUSTIN Well  --  why not ? MONICA I think it 's  --  beastly . AUSTIN As they 'll probably marry soon  --  I do n't see any harm in it . MONICA passionately.They she n't marry ! AUSTIN Monica  --  do you want to marry Storey yourself ? MONICA Storey 's in love with me . AUSTIN He is n't . He told me so . MONICA When ? p. 63 AUSTIN Just before you came . MONICA He lied . AUSTIN Why should he lie ? I asked him to tell me the truth . MONICA He did lie . You wait . You 'll see . AUSTIN He would n't take money from Mrs. Frayne  --  like this  --  if  --  MONICA You 're nave , Austin . AUSTIN I do n't understand . I do n't understand Storey . Why he should lie  --  MONICA She 's trying to buy him . AUSTIN a little bitterly.He seems willing to sell . MONICA He has no character . Not an ounce . No backbone  --  AUSTIN And yet  --  you want him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never met you , Monica . MONICA snatching at the cheque again.Money ! Money , Austin ! AbruptlyI 'm through with him . AUSTIN I should think you 'd have more  --  pride . p. 64 MONICA I 'm off him for life . I swear it , Austin . Try me . Test me . AUSTIN How do you mean ? MONICA Make love to me . Do something . You 'll see . AUSTIN You know , Monica , I  --  I 'm crazy about you . I do n't have to tell you  --  MONICA Propose to me . AUSTIN You know how I feel . MONICA Are your intentions honourable ? AUSTIN What do you mean ? MONICA You still want to marry me , do n't you ? AUSTIN Of course . What else ? MONICA I accept . AUSTIN Monica ! Really ? MONICA Yes . AUSTIN You 'll  --  marry me ? MONICA suddenly colourless.If you like , Austin . AUSTIN overjoyed , advancing towards her.Monica ! Can I  --  ca n't I ? MONICA drawing away.No , Austin  --  ! p. 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! Of course . Why not ? AUSTIN I 'll try to make you happy , Monica . MONICA with an impulse to cry.Thanks , Austin . The door-bell rings . AUSTIN I wonder who that is . MONICA Must be Storey . AUSTIN And Mrs. Frayne . There is a knock on the inside door . STOREY off.It 's only me . He comes in.Thought I 'd warn you . AUSTIN Hullo , Storey ! STOREY Hullo , Archimedes . Well , Miss Grey  --  MONICA turns her back on him and walks up stage.Nice dinner ? AUSTIN Fine . STOREY Kendall and I dined at the Colony . Looking from one to the other.What are you depressed about ? Eh ? AUSTIN We 're not depressed . That is  --  I 'm not . STOREY Well , you act like it . What 's the matter , Monica ? p. 66 AUSTIN as MONICA turns away.Monica 's just accepted me . STOREY Really ? No  --  really ? AUSTIN doubtfully.That 's what she said . STOREY Splendid . I congratulate you , Austin . I congratulate you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turns to kiss her . MONICA fiercely.Do n't come near me ! STOREY What 's the matter ?  --  Austin  --  AUSTIN She 's a little upset  --  who would n't be ? STOREY Well ! AUSTIN Where 's Mrs. Frayne ? STOREY Gone home to dress . Too bad Monica 's in such a singular mood . Kendall wants us to make up a party . MONICA I want to go home . Austin , take me home . STOREY Oh , come now , Monica , be a sport . Now you 're finally engaged to Austin  --  that 's all the more reason to celebrate . You both run along and dress and we 'll all meet here at eleven o'clock . Go to that new coloured cabaret in Harlem . Kendall 's sending champagne  --  p. 67 MONICA I do n't want her champagne . STOREY Because you have n't tasted it . I had some at dinner . Marvellous . MONICA I tell you I do n't want to go . STOREY Austin , exert your newfound authority . Make her behave . AUSTIN If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad way to start , Austin . If you begin by giving her her own way she 'll bully you all your life . MONICA bitterly.Yes , Austin , listen to him . Do what he tells you . The authority ! The philosopher . Knows everything . Tells everybody what to do , how to behave  --  STOREY Of course . My own behaviour is so bad I can point the path of righteousness to other people . The drunkard lecturing on temperance  --  There is a pause . AUSTIN 'S conquest has not made him happy . MONICA stands still , undecided , trembling with anger . STOREY alone remains imperturbable . He rather enjoys the situation . AUSTIN Guess we 'll go home  --  STOREY The truth is , children , I 'm a little tight . Ever get drunk , Austin ? p. 68 AUSTIN Once . Long time ago . STOREY Remember how it felt ? AUSTIN Like mal de mer . STOREY Must have been bad stuff . Wait till you taste Kendall 's champagne . It gives you ultimate sight , ultimate comprehension  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it worth it ? Wonderful illusions of grandeur  --  AUSTIN What 's the good of illusions ? STOREY Make reality bearable . MONICA suddenly. I think they make it more difficult . AUSTIN Well , Monica  --  MONICA to STOREYPay our respects to Mrs. Frayne . Tell her we 're grateful for her invitation but that we ca n't take advantage of her hospitality to-night . STOREY For pity 's sake , Monica , stop talking like an etiquette-book . AUSTIN Monica 's right . It would be better  --  STOREY Oh , come now . Have a heart , both of you . MONICA I do n't see why you want us when you have Mrs. Frayne. p. 69 STOREY Of course I want you . I feel gay to-night ! MONICA Be gay with Mrs. Frayne ! STOREY Be nice , now , Monica . I 've a peculiar feeling about to-night  --  that it 's a sort of valedictory , a sort of farewell . After to-night , things wo n't be the same , life wo n't be the same . AUSTIN gloomily.I hope not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get married and , I hope , Kendall and I. We 'll be stolid , married people . We 'll get old . We 'll change . We 'll drift apart  --  am I getting sentimental ? Well , why not ? Be nice , Monica , for once  --  MONICA defiantly.All right ! STOREY You 're a dear . AUSTIN worried.If you 're tired , Monica  --  MONICA No , I 've decided . I 'm in great spirits now , Storey . All excited . Come on , Austin . She runs out . AUSTIN shaking his head. I do n't understand her . STOREY If you did  --  you 'd disown her . Come back soon . I 'll be lonely . AUSTIN goes out . In a moment MONICA thrusts her head inside the door and speaks in a loud whisper . p. 70 MONICA I 'll be right back . STOREY Do n't you dare . She makes a face at him and disappears . After a moment he goes to window in the left wall to watch for their departure . He feels a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goes to the telephone.Regent 2772  --  please  --  yes  --  hullo  --  Mrs. Frayne please  --  Mr. Storey  --  hullo , Kendall ?  --  what 're you doing ?  --  nearly finished ?  --  I want you to come sooner , I 'm lonely  --  want to see you  --  am I ?  --  unusually what ?  --  oh , ardent  --  I do n't know  --  feel funny to-night  --  in the grip of a peculiar emotion  --  I do n't know  --  when you come I 'll describe it to you  --  by the way , Monica and Austin Lowe 're engaged  --  they 've just left  --  yes , I want consolation  --  The door-bell rings.Excuse me  --  what did you say ? The door-bell rings again.There 's someone at the door  --  I 've no idea  --  do come as soon as you can , will you , Ken ?  --  And do n't forget the champagne . ' Bye , dear . He hangs up , rushes to door , disappears , returns , preceded by MONICAWhat did you do this for ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fond of her just now . p. 71 MONICA I persuaded Austin  --  as he lives uptown and I live down  --  to let me go home alone . STOREY You 're crazy . MONICA I wanted to see you alone  --  to warn you  --  STOREY Suppose Austin saw you . MONICA It ca n't be helped . STOREY But it 's cruel . You just told him you 'd marry him . MONICA I had a moment of hating you , of utterly despising you . STOREY Go right away . I warn you . MONICA I saw that cheque . STOREY What cheque ? MONICA Mrs. Frayne 's for five hundred dollars . Is that your monthly stipend ? Or is it weekly ? STOREY Monica , go away . I ' ve got to dress . MONICA aware of her hold on him . . What 's the matter , Storey ? She stands very close to him. What 's the matter ? STOREY seizing her in his arms.Little darling He kisses her pessionately. p. 72 MONICA You do love me , do n't you , Storey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't very nice , Monica . It 's not at all nice . MONICA But , Storey , there 's no reason in the world why we should n't . We 're neither of us married or anything  --  STOREY Austin ! MONICA Oh , Austin ! STOREY Kendall . MONICA Oh , Kendall ! STOREY I feel funny about Austin . He 's so  --  helpless . He 's so  --  in love with you . MONICA What about me ? STOREY When you came in just now and told me you were engaged I felt a quick pain . MONICA delighted.Did you ? STOREY I felt suddenly as if nothing could ever make up for you to me . MONICA You did n't look it . You seemed to take it  --  quite casually . STOREY I 'm glad you came back . I want to tell you now . I do love you . MONICA Tell me . STOREY You 're rare and exquisite , precious . p. 73 MONICA You 're always laughing at me . STOREY I know . MONICA Make love to me , Storey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never out of my mind . Your gaiety , your sadness , your lovely youth . Your dear laughter  --  when you laugh it 's like the beginning of the world , before sorrow and death came  --  MONICA Darling . STOREY I am old , dearest one . MONICA Old ! You 're not . STOREY I am . There 's someone else inside me  --  a second man  --  a cynical , odious person , who keeps watching me , who keeps listening to what I say , grinning and sophisticated , horrid . He never lets me be  --  this other man . MONICA Kill him . STOREY I ca n't kill him . He 'll outlive me . MONICA nestling to him. I 'll kill him for you . STOREY You ca n't . Even now he 's looking at me . He 's mocking me . He 's saying : " You damn fool , talking nonsense to this girl  --  pretending you want her above everything . You 're making love to her because words come easily to you . But really you would n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch her because she 's young and firm and lovely . " p. 74 MONICA Do n't , Storey . STOREY " You would n't mind having her , but after that  --  " MONICA Storey , listen , darling , I know you 're fine and decent . STOREY He hears you say : " I 'm fine and decent . " And he says : " The illusion of an adolescent , of a love-struck girl . " MONICA I 'll beat him , Storey  --  I 'll beat him . STOREY I wish you could , honey . MONICA I just needed to know that you love me  --  tell me it again . Let me hear you say it again . STOREY I love you . MONICA The way you said it before . STOREY I 'm afraid I ca n't now . MONICA Storey . STOREY You see how capricious I am . MONICA But you just said it . And when you did I knew it was true . STOREY It probably was  --  then . MONICA A minute ago ! STOREY lightly.A minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference ? p. 75 MONICA But , Storey , I must believe in your love for me . I must ! STOREY Why ? MONICA Because I 've got to believe in something . And if you do n't love me  --  what is there ? STOREY My dear child . You  --  baby ! MONICA Do n't turn me down , Storey . There is a pause . STOREY considers . STOREY I want you to go away  --  and marry Austin  --  and do n't come back to see me alone again  --  ever . MONICA I wo n't . I tell you I wo n't . STOREY But do n't you understand ? I 'm crazy about you . Do you think I 'm made of wood ? MONICA Why do n't you take me , Storey ? A pause , he is nonplussed . STOREY My God , child . MONICA I 'd rather you married me , but if you do n't want to  --  well  --  STOREY Wo n't you allow me one shred of decency ? I want to be loyal to Austin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be protected . Besides , it 's all a pose . You want to marry Kendall Frayne so you can have lots of money . p. 76 STOREY What 's the use ? MONICA It 's true . You talk about decency . With that cheque lying there . You ought to be ashamed , Storey . STOREY I 'm not in the least ashamed . MONICA You 're just one of those men who go around eating fine dinners and having a good time  --  a parasite , Storey . STOREY That 's what everybody 's trying to be in one way or another . Mine 's as good as any . MONICA Instead of escaping from all this life and  --  and fighting your own battles with me by your side to help you . STOREY accompanying himself on the piano.Sounds like a popular song . Hums . " With me by your side to help you  --  " MONICA For pity 's sake , Storey , how did you get like this ? You could n't have been always like it ! STOREY Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in a garret and believe in Socialism . I used to commit realistic fiction and moonlit poetry . I dreamed  --  MONICA I want to bring back those dreams . STOREY Why ? What for ? p. 77 MONICA You must have been lovely then , Storey . STOREY Oh , I was ! Lovely ! MONICA hurt.Storey ! STOREY Lovely . I dressed badly and followed the Cults . It did n't take me long to find out how easy it is to starve on Idealism . I had facility and there was a ready market for facility . I got five thousand dollars for writing a whitewashed biography of a millionaire sweat-shop owner . That started me . I took the money and went to Italy  --  and I had a very good time . MONICA But , Storey  --  you must believe in something  --  do n't you ever regret  --  do n't you ever wish  --  ? STOREY Regret ? No . Not in the least . Why should I ? I 'd do it all over again . MONICA I can see that horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently.You amuse him . MONICA You wait ! I 'm going to beat him  --  in spite of you . STOREY swayed for a moment by the possibility.He 's got a terrific start on you , Monica . p. 78 MONICA very confident now.Trust me . Leave him to me . Whispering.We 'll be happy yet , sweetheart ! STOREY taking her in his arms.God knows I 've done my best ! Their embrace lasts several seconds . The door-bell rings . STOREY , a bit grimly.Lucky for you , young lady  --  MONICA Do n't go . STOREY Got to . Run home and dress  --  go upstairs and out through my bedroom . MONICA to stairs.All right . But I 'm not worried about Kendall now . I 'm not worried about anything  --  The door-bell rings insistently . She runs upstairs and disappears . STOREY goes out to open the door . For a moment the stage is deserted . STOREY off.Oh , from Mrs. Frayne ? Thank you ! He returns , carrying a hamper of champagne . He puts it on the table . Lifts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He takes it out of the envelope . STOREY reading . " For a good time for all . " For a moment this symbol of KENDALL 'S generosity makes him hate himself . THE CURTAIN SLOWLY FALLS p. 79 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE II .  --  The scene is the same , after a lapse of two hours . It is new eleven o'clock . When the curtain rises , MRS . FRAYNE , in evening dress , is discovered at the piano . She is playing the walts from Strauss 's " Rosenkavalier . " After a moment she stops and then plays a few bars of a popular sentimental song from music on the piano . The doorbell rings . She rises and goes to open the door.1 A splendid figure , " majestic " but graceful . She wears a black velvet evening dress cut very low ; fine arms , columnar throat , rather like Sargent 's portrait of " Madame X. " American edition . She returns in a moment , followed by AUSTIN . He is in evening dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitant . Gradually , however , she puts him at ease ; she has that sort of manner . KENDALL Storey 's dressing . I 'm the first one here . AUSTIN Monica 's not come yet ? KENDALL No . Cigarette ? AUSTIN Er  --  thanks . She lights it for him.Thanks . KENDALL You and I are the only prompt ones . AUSTIN Yes . p. 80 KENDALL Do you know what time it is ? AUSTIN looking.Ten minutes past eleven . KENDALL I was here promptly at eleven . Storey had n't even begun to dress . AUSTIN He had n't ! KENDALL I 'm awfully glad you came . I was lonesome . She smiles at him . AUSTIN I  --  I 'm glad I found you . KENDALL Why do I never see you ? AUSTIN Er  --  see me ? KENDALL Storey talks about you all the time . You 're one of the few people he respects . I always ask him to bring you to my house , but you never come . AUSTIN I 'm in the laboratory such a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come some time  --  and bring Miss Grey . She notices him staring at MONICA 'S coloured scarf which is lying across a chair . KENDALL What is it ? AUSTIN That scarf . KENDALL You know it ? p. 81 AUSTIN It 's  --  it 's Monica 's . KENDALL You dined here with her  --  did n't you ? AUSTIN Yes . I did . KENDALL Well , then  --  AUSTIN She wore it when I left with her ? KENDALL Did n't you take her home ? AUSTIN She told me to go home alone  --  to save time . KENDALL Well , she probably ran back to tell Storey something . AUSTIN bitterly.She probably did . It must have taken a long time because  --  when you came , Storey had n't even begun to dress . KENDALL after a moment.I think you can trust Storey . AUSTIN Can I ? KENDALL He told me over the phone  --  you and Miss Grey are engaged . AUSTIN There 's something funny about it . KENDALL There 's something funny about most things . AUSTIN warming to her.Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN Thank you . I wonder  --  I wonder if Storey tells me everything . I mean  --  about Monica and himself . KENDALL Perhaps he does n't know everything . AUSTIN You mean  --  perhaps he 's in love with her and does n't know it ? KENDALL Does n't know it or wo n't admit it  --  even to himself . Perhaps . There is a pause . AUSTIN abruptly.Are you going to marry Storey ? KENDALL I do n't know . AUSTIN navely.I wish you would . KENDALL It would solve your problem , would n't it ? It might complicate mine . AUSTIN I 'm not even sure it would solve mine . I wish I had n't got into this . KENDALL stops playing.It 's comforting to know that even a scientific genius is not immune . It rather justifies a weak woman  --  like me . AUSTIN It 's rotten to be like this . Wondering about everything , suspecting everybody . Why should I care if Monica came back here or not ? And yet  --  I do . p. 83 KENDALL slowiy.I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN Do you think Monica 's in love with Storey ? KENDALL You want me to tell you she is n't , do n't you ? AUSTIN Sometimes she tells me she loathes him . KENDALL That 's bad . AUSTIN Do you think so ? KENDALL Would n't it be nice if people were like molecules or electrons or whatever you work with ? It would be nice for you because you understand all about those things . AUSTIN Molecules are mysterious , but they 're more predictable than Monica . They obey some sort of law . KENDALL amused and touched by his sincerity.I think you 're charming , Austin . AUSTIN Do n't say that . I know better . KENDALL But you are ! AUSTIN I 'm dull and thick-witted and I  --  I have no words . I ca n't talk . KENDALL I think you do very well . AUSTIN emboldened.Well , that 's because it 's you . p. 84 KENDALL is still at piano She plays Tchaikowsky 's " Wer Nun die Sehnsucht Kennt " . I ? AUSTIN I find it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it 's because  --  we 're sympathetic . AUSTIN I feel I know where I am with you . With Monica I never know . KENDALL But you do n't want to be anywhere with me . With me  --  you do n't have to make an effort . That 's why you find me easy to be with . AUSTIN I  --  I 'd like you to be my friend . KENDALL Gladly . AUSTIN Wo n't you tell me  --  what to do ? KENDALL Are n't you assuming  --  I 'm wiser than I really am ? AUSTIN But you are wise . You know all about the world and  --  you know  --  you 're sophisticated . KENDALL is amused.You 've had all sorts of  --  experiences . KENDALL I 'm more experienced than you , I fancy . But no amount of experience can keep you from falling in love with the wrong man , or the wrong woman . AUSTIN I know that Storey is n't the right man for Monica . I know that he wo n't make her  --  happy . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her that himself . AUSTIN But he should convince her . What 's the good of all his talk if he ca n't convince her ? KENDALL still amused.The more he talks the less convinced she probably is . AUSTIN fingering scarf.I do n't see why she should have returned here . KENDALL shrugging her shoulders.Some trivial reason , most likely . AUSTIN She must have been here quite a time  --  if Storey was n't dressed  --  when you came . KENDALL You know Storey . Never hurries . AUSTIN It 's funny . KENDALL I 've said  --  I think you can trust Storey . AUSTIN bitterly.Can I ? KENDALL surprised at his tone.Why , Austin ! Enter STOREY , dressed . KENDALL moves to the piano . AUSTIN remains fixed , making no move towards STOREY p. 86 STOREY Awfully sorry to keep you waiting . But then , Monica is n't here yet , either . KENDALL from the piano.Two hours to dress . There 's a fop for you , Austin . She plays a sentimental song . STOREY to AUSTINFact is I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly.Did you ? STOREY A few lines . KENDALL continuing to play.You 're getting industrious , Storey . What 's the matter ? STOREY I 've decided to marry , settle down , cultivate the virtues . AUSTIN Marry ? STOREY Do n't you know I propose to Mrs. Frayne every day ? And if I 'm to support her in the style to which she 's been accustomed I 've got to work much harder . KENDALL leaving the piano.Do n't you believe him , Austin . I looked at your manuscript before Austin came and there was only one sentence added to what I read this afternoon . She goes to the table and picks up manuscript . p. 87 STOREY But that one sentence was born of a travail  --  lasting two hours . KENDALL picking up manuscript and reading . " She rose and left him " Did it take you two hours to write that ? STOREY I did brilliantly to write that in two hours . The exquisite simplicity of that sentence ! The compactness of it ! Think of the million things I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . And I picked that one . In two hours ! The tremendous  --  celerity of the choice astonishes me now I think of it . How did I do it ? KENDALL to AUSTINIs he drunk ? STOREY . No , but it 's a good idea . He pours champagne.Kendall . He hands her a glass.Austin AUSTIN No , thanks . STOREY But you 've got to . It 's to celebrate your engagement to Monica . AUSTIN I do n't feel like it . STOREY But I want us all to be gay to-night . I ca n't get comfortably drunk with a sober man in the party . KENDALL Do n't make him drink if he does n't want to , Storey . p. 88 STOREY Austin , have you ever been drunk in your life ? AUSTIN Not really drunk , no . STOREY to KENDALL.Imagine that ! KENDALL If you 're gloomy when you begin , drink only intensifies your mood . STOREY Nonsense . KENDALL Well , so I 've heard . STOREY Here , Austin . It 's glorious stuff . Drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omniscient . You 'll know more about physics than Einstein  --  the Universe 'll stretch out below you like a plaid . AUSTIN What 's the use of a sensation like that ? STOREY What 's the use of love ? AUSTIN Well , I 'll drink it anyway . They lift their glasses . KENDALL Happy days . STOREY Happy days . They drink . He quotes . " The true , the blushful Hippocrene . " KENDALL Nothing blushful about Roget 1915 . You 're colour-blind , Storey . STOREY Just an excuse to quote Keats . " With beaded bubbles winking at the brim " p. 89 AUSTIN truculently.Let 's have another ! STOREY That 's the spirit . The door-bell rings . KENDALL Miss Grey . STOREY I 'll let her in . Pour the drinks , Austin . He goes out . AUSTIN looks uncomfortable . He pours out the champagne , watching the door . KENDALL watches him . MONICA comes in . She looks charming in a simple evening frock , a picture of youthful loveliness . STOREY follows her.May I present Miss Grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe you 've met Mr. Lowe . MONICA Hullo , Austin . STOREY Austin 's on the loose tonight , Monica . Just guzzling champange . KENDALL Where would you like to go , Miss Grey ? I have n't booked anywhere . I wanted to know which dance place you preferred.MONICA , I am crazy about the music at the Trocadero . KENDALL Storey , will you telephone ? MONICA Although you ca n't dance there . It 's too crowded . p. 90 KENDALL They 're all crowded . STOREY I 've heard of a marvellous coloured place  --  MONICA Oh , where ? STOREY In the heart of Harlem . MONICA excited.Oh , let 's go ! STOREY I 'm told you have to be a good shot . KENDALL Is that the place where the man was killed ? STOREY Yes . MONICA How exciting ! STOREY Austin , you 're marrying a savage . AUSTIN Am I ? MONICA Are you jilting me , Austin ? KENDALL If we 're going anywhere  --  we 'd better start . AUSTIN a trifle desperately.One more drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever got started  --  He pours . MONICA A little one for me . STOREY This is Roget ' 15 . MONICA Is it ? Well , then , a big one . p. 91 KENDALL None for me , Storey . STOREY Oh , please  --  we 'll drink a toast . He pours for himself.To our married life ! MONICA But I have n't got one . STOREY But you will . MONICA Proposing to me , Storey ? STOREY Do n't flirt , Monica . Austin 's jealous enough already . KENDALL What a prosaic toast ! STOREY Exactly . Lifting glass.To our married life  --  may it be like the good prose of the English masters , solid , clear , sometimes hovering close to poetry  --  but in the main sensible and intelligent and  --  well-behaved . They drink . KENDALL Nice toast , Storey . MONICA I do n't think it 's nice at all . I certainly do n't want that sort of marriage . STOREY Let 's drink to your sort . MONICA I 'd like my marriage to be always like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-behaved  --  like prose . p. 92 STOREY A large order , Austin ! AUSTIN bitterly.I suppose you mean that only you could fill it . MONICA amazed.Why , Austin ! There is an embarrassed pause . KENDALL We 'd better be starting . STOREY No , wait a minute . To AUSTINAre you angry with me ? KENDALL It 's the wine AUSTIN sullenly.No , it 's not the wine . STOREY What is it then ? Come on  --  out with it . In vino veritas ! MONICA What does that mean ? STOREY It means that when you 're tight you tell your right name . MONICA Oh , that 's exciting ! Everybody tell the truth  --  the absolute truth . STOREY We 're not drunk enough for that . AUSTIN to MONICAYou might begin by telling me why you lied to me to-night . KENDALL Now , you see , Storey ! p. 93 STOREY You have had too much , Austin . AUSTIN defiant.I 'll have as much as I like . He pours himself another glassful and gulps it . He still addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back here . MONICA Yes , I did ! AUSTIN I found your scarf . STOREY pouring himself a drink.What if she did ? AUSTIN I suspected something . When she told me to go on alone  --  I came back and saw her go in . I hung around in the street  --  KENDALL Do let 's get started . STOREY drinking.Let 's talk it out . You hung around in the street . You , Austin ! AUSTIN Yes , I did . It was all I could do to keep from bursting in on you and  --  shouting . I hated you , Storey . I hate you now . STOREY Why ? AUSTIN I resent you . I resent your fluency , your gift of words , your superficial I resent you . STOREY pours.Have another . p. 94 KENDALL Please , Storey ! STOREY Why not ? All of us . It 's a rare moment . I feel we 'll talk . We 'll really talk  --  all of us . This sort of thing does n't often happen . It 'll be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and nothing but the truth  --  so help me  --  Horace ! They all stand , glass in hand . KENDALL Something tells me we 'll all be sorry for this . You , Storey , more than the rest . STOREY recklessly.I 'll risk it . Lifting his glass.To the Truth . He drinks , and AUSTIN , MONICA and KENDALL just sip their wine.Think of it  --  here is Austin Lowe  --  standing about in the street , eating his heart out , hating me . Why ? Because Monica ran upstairs to prattle some nonsense that seemed to her important . The most promising young scientist in America  --  reduced to the level of an apache . Did you hate me bitterly , Austin ? AUSTIN I wanted you to die . STOREY What did you think was happening in here ? KENDALL This is silly . STOREY to AUSTINI 'll reward your frankness . I 'll be frank too . p. 95 AUSTIN I pictured her coming in here  --  going to you  --  I pictured her looking up to you with love in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pictured  --  I wanted you to die STOREY Sex reduces everybody to a common denominator . Here 's Austin always telling me that all creation is the result of an accident . AUSTIN What 's that got to do with it ? STOREY You told me once that a slight change in the temperature a few thousand years ago would have put us all at the mercy of the ants . You 're more conscious than any of us of the insignificance of man , of the feebleness of his cry amid the vast solitudes of time and space . Your knowledge makes you one man in ten million . And yet you stand in the street looking up at that window and wanting to kill me because I 'm kissing a girl ! Savage , Austin ! AUSTIN I suppose you 're so damn civilized . STOREY I ? Not at all . When I came into this room before and you told me Monica was going to marry you I felt a pang of resentment too . MONICA delighted.It was true then ! STOREY Oh , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why does he deserve her ? I felt an impulse to take her away from you . p. 96 KENDALL This is interesting , Storey . STOREY to her.It 's not that I 'm in love with Monica . MONICA sipping her wine.Fib ! STOREY ignoring her.It 's that I resent Austin . I 'm jealous of him , I envy him his scientific eminence , I envy him his money . KENDALL You might envy his sincerity , his character . STOREY I would n't have his character for worlds . It would destroy my amusements . Interested in his own reaction.I said to myself : " Why should this mole-like creature "  --  meaning Austin  --  " possess this radiant girl ? " AUSTIN I know that 's what you think  --  I 'm a mole , a scientific mole . STOREY Did I say that ? KENDALL You 're a third-rate writer and Austin is a first-rate scientist . MONICA Storey 's not third-rate . STOREY My dear child , it 's true . Artistically I 'm third-rate . My mind is not as superficial as my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't take myself seriously  --  that 's my tragedy . MONICA Well , I do n't care what you are . I love you , Storey ! STOREY Really , Monica , you 'll embarrass me . KENDALL We must n't give Miss Grey more champagne . AUSTIN I do n't think I 'll have a very good time at this party . I 'm going home . STOREY You wo n't . I wo n't let you . AUSTIN like a child who feels he 's not wanted by anybody.I do n't see why I should stay . KENDALL Nor I. It appears we ought to leave Monica and Storey alone . STOREY That would be a calamity . KENDALL feline.For Miss Grey ? STOREY For both of us . It would tie us to each other for ever . MONICA I do n't see where the calamity comes in . STOREY You 're too young to see . You 're too much in love to see . But I see  --  for both of us . KENDALL If Austin and I had any sense we 'd leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KENDALL Why do n't I ? MONICA challenging.Why do n't you ? KENDALL slowly.Because  --  MONICA Because ? KENDALL I 'm afraid I should have a sleepless night . STOREY If I were a cad I should have an affair with Monica . But regrettably I am a Puritan . Ca n't help it . It 's in my blood . MONICA Liar ! STOREY You are right , Monica . It is not Puritanism . It 's prudence . I 'd have to marry you . That would be fatal . MONICA Why ? STOREY You would be happy for a year and unhappy the rest of your life . If you marry Austin you 'll be unhappy for a year and happy the rest of your life . KENDALL And if I marry you ? STOREY pouring champagne for her.Your life will have the excitement of a perilous risk . KENDALL But I do n't want excitement . I want  --  tranquillity , I want to be secure . p. 99 STOREY Then you should marry Austin . Matrimonially he is a giltedged bond . I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin ? AUSTIN who is befuddled now . What do I say to what ? KENDALL Shall we be sensible ? Shall we get married  --  you and I ? MONICA Say yes , Austin . AUSTIN But I 'm not in love with her . I 'm in love with you . KENDALL to STOREYI 'm out of luck , Storey . STOREY Do n't weep over him . I 'll take you on . KENDALL You 're the only resource left me . I accept you  --  not because you 're worthy  --  but because I ca n't help it . STOREY You hear , everybody  --  she accepts me . KENDALL I 'll take a  --  flutter in you . STOREY touching his glass to hers.And I 'll try not to fluctuate too much . After he drinks.Now then , Austin . Your way is clear . KENDALL And now I really think we 've talked enough nonsense . We 'd better start . p. 100 STOREY I 'm just in the mood for a good jazz band . KENDALL Who 'll carry the champagne ? STOREY Austin . AUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamper.Monica , I do n't dance . Will you teach me ? MONICA tensely.Before we go  --  there 's something I want to say . STOREY You 'll tell us in the taxi . MONICA No . Here . KENDALL Another revelation ? MONICA Yes . Her voice and manner are very strained , like one keyed up to accomplish an impossible feat . STOREY What 's the matter , Monica ? Are n't you well ? KENDALL You would start this . AUSTIN very concerned.Monica ! MONICA Since everybody 's telling the truth  --  why should n't I ? STOREY Do n't say anything you 'll be sorry for . MONICA Even if I am sorry  --  I 'm going to say it . p. 101 KENDALL I really think we ought to go out . AUSTIN The fresh air 'll do her good . MONICA I 'll say it if it  --  kills me . AUSTIN anxious.What is it , Monica ? STOREY suspicious.Watch your step , child . MONICA I think you ought to know it , Mrs. Frayne . Austin , I think you ought to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Picking up her wraps.There 's been too much confession . Let 's start . MONICA No , stop . All of you . I want you to know  --  that Storey  --  Storey is the father of my child  --  my unborn child . STOREY amazed.Monica ! MONICA There now , I 've said it . I feel better . She takes a quick gulp of champagne . KENDALL and AUSTIN stare accusingly at STOREY . They are speechless . STOREY She 's ill . She 's had too much champagne . MONICA I have n't . I 've had less than any of you . p. 102 STOREY Monica  --  you 're  --  Turning to the others.Surely , you do n't believe  --  MONICA If I had the courage to tell it . She turns away . She can not finish . The strain has really made her faint . KENDALL I did think , Storey , that you observed some code . STOREY But I tell you , the child is  --  she 's irresponsible . She 's doing this  --  AUSTIN almost screaming.You cad ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Austin , will you take me home ? STOREY She does n't know what she 's saying , I tell you . MONICA I do , too . STOREY Kendall , for pity 's sake , listen . KENDALL I never want to see you again . Are you coming , Austin ? She is at the door . AUSTIN broken.Monica , is it  --  true ? MONICA Yes , Austin . KENDALL goes out . AUSTIN True . p. 103 STOREY Austin , I swear to you it 's not true . She 's crazy . AUSTIN laughing a bit wildly.Well  --  of course . Why not ? He picks up MONICA 'S scarf lying on the chair , drops it , and goes out . Between STOREY and MONICA there is a long silence . He simply stares at her . MONICA at last.Gee , what 've I done ? STOREY still stares at her . I had no idea they 'd make such a fuss . But once I got started I could n't back out , could I ? As he does not speak.You 're angry ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . He still says nothing.Please say something , Storey . If you do n't  --  I 'll cry . STOREY You think you 're smart , do n't you ? MONICA I think I 'm brave , Storey , it 's for you I did it too . STOREY Oh , for me . MONICA  --  do n't you want me ? STOREY No . MONICA To-night  --  when I came back here  --  you made me feel you did . I was sure you did . p. 104 STOREY That will pass and what will be left ? MONICA Is n't there more to it than that , Storey . STOREY No . MONICA I wo n't let you go , Storey . I 'm going to fight for you  --  I 'm going to bring you back  --  to what you were  --  to that youth you 've let go . It 's your one chance now , Storey  --  your last desperate chance  --  do n't you see , Storey ? STOREY But I do n't watn to go back . I ca n't go back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it ? MONICA These things you 're selling yourself for  --  what good are they I Is this she includes the room in a gesture.what you really want ? I ca n't believe it . Storey , dearest , I can see such a fine way we might live . STOREY I tell you it would n't work , Monica  --  even if I did try to be what you think I could be  --  it would be no use . MONICA I ca n't think of arguments like you can  --  I ca n't put things the way you can  --  I just know that if you had any bravery  --  if you had any courage all these things you say are lies you 've made up  --  lies to justify yourself , to prop you up  --  you 're a pampered , weak thing dawdling away your life on a sofa when you might be stading up straight on your own feet . p. 105 STOREY Perhaps . Only I can see us now  --  five years from now  --  in a cheap flat  --  you looking blowsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cheap shirts and cracked shoes  --  brooding in a room over a corpse of my genius . He gets up and goes to the piano and fills the glass still standing there.You ca n't have life on your own terms , Monica . I ca n't . Nobody can.1 In the Theatre Guild Library Edition ( 1927 ) , the scene closes thus:MONICA  --  Compromise . I suppose I 'll come is that , too.STOREY  --  drinks and goes to her . What 's the use of thinking ? Let 's finish the champagne . Oh , you are lovely  --  kiss me.MONICA  --  No , Storey.STOREY  --  Now that you have lost your illusions you can begin to live . She looks at him  --  falters to the chair . A little laugh breaks from her . She sinks into the chair weeping piteously . STOREY watches her  --  he glups another drink  --  but her misery touches him . Compassionate he runs to her  --  kneels beside her , strokes her hair STOREY  --  desperate  --  to stanch her grief . Monica , darling do n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do May be with you  --  I can do it  --  dear Monica . Dear child . I 'll try . I 'll try . I 'll try . CURTAIN MONICA watching him , trembling  --  she is seeing him as if for the first time.I see I ca n't ! p. 106 STOREY I 'll marry you , Monica  --  but the joke 's on you . He sits at the piano and plays , singing rather savagely the improvised catch . " With me by your side to help you . " She fatter to the chair , weeping piteously . MONICA Storey  --  stop  --  But he plays on , cruelly , in an ecstasy of self-revealment  --  she huddled in the chair to escape the flagellation of sound , as the curtain falls. @x The scene is the same . The time : the next morning . When the curtain rises , STOREY is discovered , immured within his writing board , trying to work . He puts down a sentence , regards it , is n't pleased , gets up , lights a cigarette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his M. S. and , with an impulse of disgust , crumples it in his hand and throws it into the empty fireplace . Picks up the magazine KENDALL had been reading in the first act , looks at that , and flings the magazine , too , into the fireplace . STOREY savagely.Trash trash trash ! Catches sight of himself in the mirror above the fireplace , regards himself in itTrash ! Nevertheless he straightens his tie , and settles his dressing-gown , an instinct of foppishness not to be denied . The doorbell ringsDamn ! It rings again . ShoutingI 'm not at home He starts across the room to see who it is . AUSTIN appears in the doorway AUSTIN Hall door was open . STOREY really glad to see him.Hullo ! I say  --  you look done in . What 's the matter ? AUSTIN does , in fact , look terrible . He has evidently been walking in the rain , his evening clothes are bedraggled . He has n't slept . The champagne has made him ill all night . He is unshaved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge of being really illWhat 's the matter ? Here  --  sit down . AUSTIN shakes his head as STOREY proffers a chairYou 've been out in the rain . p. 108 AUSTIN Yes . STOREY What doing ? AUSTIN Walking . STOREY But , my dear fellow . You should n't be doing that . You 're obviously ill . AUSTIN deadly seriousThis is n't a friendly visit . STOREY No ? AUSTIN I 've come to kill you . STOREY My dear Austin . You are ill ! AUSTIN That 's why I 've come . STOREY I tell you there is n't a reason on earth why you should hate me . AUSTIN No reason ! STOREY Last night was as illusory as a nightmare . AUSTIN Do n't deny anything . It only makes you more  --  hateful . STOREY To-day Monica will probably tell you herself  --  it was a lie . AUSTIN Nothing can save you , Storey . STOREY My dear chap , let me get you a cup of tea . AUSTIN flaringDo n't you laugh at me ! He whips out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it loaded ? Am I facing death ? The situation is novel , but not as thrilling as I might have expected . Do you really mean to kill me , Austin ? AUSTIN Why do you think I bought it ? STOREY Did you buy that thing ? You need n't have . I have one upstairs . I 'd have lent it you . AUSTIN You do n't believe I 'll do it . That 's why you 're so gay . STOREY Ah , I suppose you will . I suppose  --  at the Threshold of the Great Unknown as they call it  --  I should be solemn . AUSTIN Epigrams ! STOREY Force of habit , sorry . You press that thing  --  and no more epigrams . Death is probably very commonplace . Disintegration . Resolution into original elements . Your province , Austin . AUSTIN Talker ! STOREY Ca n't help it , old dear . It will wag . AUSTIN Not a real emotion , not a real feeling  --  even in the face of death . STOREY Real emotions and real feelings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's civilization . AUSTIN The old boast ! p. 110 STOREY It 's true . You 're in the grip of a real emotion , a real feeling . What 's it doing to you ? Never mind what it wants to do to me . Listen a second . If you could empty your heart of its burden as easily as you can empty that cylinder there 'd be some sense in curving your little finger . But after I am lying there , silent for once , will you be happier ? The world will be emptier , for I shall no longer be there  --  for you to hate . AUSTIN The world will be better off without you . STOREY Please be honest . Do n't pretend this is a crusade . You want to shoot me because you think Monica 's belonged to me . You want to shoot me because you 're eaten by jealousy . You 're not doing it to raise the general level of morality . Do n't be a hypocrite , Austin . He lights a cigarette AUSTIN It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure your living . STOREY That I can understand . There is a pause . AUSTIN backs off from him as if to take better aimEr  --  have you made any plans for the future ? AUSTIN What is it to you ? STOREY shrugging his shoulders.Curious. p. 111 AUSTIN First you  --  then myself . STOREY Oh , both of us ? Teutonic efficiency . You are German , are n't you , Austin ? Lowe . Lwe . He pronounces it with the umlaut AUSTIN in a knot of angerBe quiet . STOREY It 's rather a pity . Loss to the community . You , I mean . Firstrate men are too rare to be permitted the luxury of suicide . I sha n't matter . But you . It 's a shame , really . AUSTIN Do n't worry about me . STOREY But I do . Think of it , You 've  --  let 's say thirty years left to make your discoveries in . Science is an endless chain , is n't it ? I suppose , really , there is only one science as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little trifling thing that 'll help some other fellow discover another trifling thing and that might lead to  --  well , anything , might n't it ? AUSTIN backs off a little farther . Pursuing his veinSomething perfectly tremendous  --  a cure for cancer or an escalator to Mars or anything , might n't it ? AUSTIN backs off moreAustin , do you mind not moving away from me ? I admit  --  it makes me nervous . AUSTIN Have you nothing else to say ? p. 112 STOREY Do you want a last speech ? Dear me ! I ca n't think of a thing . Is n't it funny ? Now that I 'd like to say something brilliant I ca n't . I 've often wondered how all those great men in history got off their death-bed speeches . Made ' em up in advance , I bet . AUSTIN All right then . He levels his revolver STOREY Wait ! I 've thought of something . AUSTIN Say it quick . STOREY His last words were : " Give my love to Monica . " AUSTIN wildlyDamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , the bullet going three feet over his head . AUSTIN thinks he has killed him ; he staggers , almost fainting , into a chair STOREY God ! Austin . You nearly frightened the life out of me . God ! He pours a drink of Scotch and gulps it . Pours another for AUSTINReally , Austin , you ca n't go on like this . Here . AUSTIN shakes his headDo you good . AUSTIN Let me alone . STOREY drinking it himselfI saved your life , Austin , as well as my own . I give you back to Science . If you 'd hit me they 'd have sent you to jail for life . A valuable man like you . The jury system is one of the prime stupidities of democracy , do n't you think ? AUSTIN rises to his feet . He is pitifulWhere 're you going ? p. 113 AUSTIN Home . STOREY You 're in no condition to go home . You 're ill , trembling . AUSTIN Sorry . Made a fool of myself . STOREY supporting himWhat did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? STOREY Yes . AUSTIN Went home . Ill . Not used to drinking . That champagne . STOREY Eaten anything to-day ? AUSTIN shakes his headAnd you 've been walking in all that rain ? Look here  --  you 've got to drink this . He forces some whiskey between his lips AUSTIN Guess I 'll get on . STOREY Wait till it stops raining . AUSTIN Sorry to have He sways STOREY Sha' n't let you go out in this condition . AUSTIN Feel wobbly . STOREY Tell you what  --  you go to my room and lie down . AUSTIN Too much trouble . p. 114 STOREY You 've got to . A little nap 'll make you as right as  --  unfortunate simile for a day like this . This way . He partly supports him and leads him up the stairs . The door-bell ringsMust be Kendall . Shouts through doorCome in . AUSTIN I 'll just lie down a minute . STOREY A good sleep and a hot bath . They go upstairs . KENDALL comes in . She looks around the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in a minute , Kendall . Austin His sign mystifies KENDALL , except that she gathers that AUSTIN is inside . STOREY disappears into the bedroom . KENDALL catches sight of the revolver which STOREY has picked up and put on the table . She sniffs the powder . Goes to fireplace , picks up STOREY 'S crumpled manuscript . Lets it fall again . She is full of thoughts . STOREY returns , and , after a momentHe came to kill me and remained  --  to take a nap . KENDALL Poor fellow . STOREY Poor fellow ! I like that . What about me ? KENDALL You deserve it , Storey . p. 115 STOREY What for ? KENDALL We do n't need to discuss it . STOREY You mean  --  last night . It 's too silly . Even if it were true . KENDALL Do n't deny it , Storey . Spare me that ! STOREY Even if it were true  --  about Monica and me  --  one does n't deserve death for that sort of thing . KENDALL I 'm afraid I 'm a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . STOREY I leave standards to the moralists . I do the best I can . That 's what everybody does  --  in the long run . KENDALL I did n't come here to reproach you , Storey . STOREY It 's a mess , I know . It all comes  --  from trying to be intelligent . KENDALL after a moment I came to say good-bye . STOREY Good-bye ? KENDALL I 'm going abroad . STOREY When ? KENDALL Probably on the Olympic . Sailing on the tenth . That will give me time to get my passports . p. 116 STOREY You hate me , do n't you ? KENDALL I do n't think so . I feel  --  dead about you . Just now . STOREY I tell you solemnly  --  that what Monica said last night  --  is n't true . KENDALL Do n't stoop to that , Storey . She crosses him to fireplace . There is a pause . STOREY gives it upI see you 've been throwing away your manuscripts . STOREY Yes . KENDALL A good sign . I believe you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STOREY ironicallyMonica 's idea . KENDALL She must love you very much  --  to confess before everybody  --  as she did last night . STOREY wearilyYou do n't know the half of it . KENDALL It 's Monica  --  Miss Grey  --  I came to speak to you about  --  really . STOREY Yes ? KENDALL At first I suppose it 'll be a little hard for you  --  economically . Especially if you mean to do serious work . I thought perhaps p. 117 STOREY You want to give us money  --  to start the new life on ? KENDALL I have so much  --  and I 'm alone . STOREY It 's an excellent idea . But I 'm afraid Monica  --  would n't see it . KENDALL She need n't know . STOREY ironicallyWould you have us start the new life  --  with a lie ? KENDALL Always laughing . STOREY Why not ? Life is amusing . KENDALL You ought to turn over a new leaf , really , Storey . STOREY pointing to fireplaceLook at that manuscript . KENDALL That is a good sign . STOREY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I marry I shall be regretting I tore it up . I shall be writing it again  --  from memory . I shall have to redouble my output because I shall have Monica to support and  --  you will be in Europe . In time Monica will come to see that I have n't in me the great works which she suspects are secreted in my brain like bonds in a vault . She 'll begin to despise me a little bit . And I 'll begin  --  to deceive her a litt'e bit . And there we 'll be  --  a typical married couple . p. 118 KENDALL Poor Monica ! STOREY It 's too bad for both of us , really . You and I might have lived a civilized life . You have the two great requirements for the wife of a poor but intelligent man : money and tolerance . KENDALL Unfortunately my tolerance does n't extend  --  to this . STOREY This  --  as you call it  --  is a lie . It does n't exist . KENDALL Good-bye , Storey . STOREY I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should think Monica 's  --  device  --  would be transparent to you . KENDALL Cad ! Good-bye forever . STOREY In the end everything is reduced to clich . KENDALL I never want to see you again . She sweeps to the door AUSTIN offStorey . Storey . STOREY Coming . Wait a second , will you , Kendall ? KENDALL I 'm going . The door-bell rings p. 119 STOREY on the stairsSee who that is . And do n't go . Have a heart . He disappears . KENDALL is at the door when it opens . It is MONICA MONICA Oh ! I 'm sorry . I range . KENDALL I 'm just leaving . MONICA Is Storey at home ? KENDALL uncertain how much to tell herHe 's  --  inside . MONICA I wanted to see him just for a minute . Please do n't go . KENDALL I must . I only dropped in  --  to say good-bye to Storey MONICA Good-bye ? KENDALL I 'm going abroad . I shall be gone a long time . MONICA Oh ! But you need n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call me a child . I 'm old  --  now . KENDALL All of a sudden ? MONICA Yes . KENDALL What 's  --  aged you ? MONICA Never mind . But I tell you  --  sincerely  --  you need n't go  --  on my account . p. 120 KENDALL What inspires this mood  --  of renunciation ? MONICA It 's not renunciation . It 's indifference . KENDALL I 'm afraid  --  you 're deceiving yourself . MONICA I 'm not . Honestly . You 'll see . I came  --  to tell that  --  to Storey . KENDALL I came once  --  to tell him that . I stayed , though . MONICA This is different . KENDALL Oh , you 're angry with him . That will pass . MONICA But I 'm not angry with him . This is something else I tell you  --  something else altogether . KENDALL I think you 'll be as happy as most people . Good luck . She reaches out her hand to MONICA MONICA taking it . You 're very much in love with him , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only uncomfortable  --  when I see him . But I 'm going away now . I enjoy travelling and altogether I have a pretty good time . MONICA But I tell you if it 's on account of me  --  you need n't go . p. 121 KENDALL You 're worse off than I am , really . You 're in love with a man who does n't exist . I 'm in love with one who does . That 's why this sort of thing is less of a shock . If it ever happens to you . MONICA Mrs. Frayne , I must tell you  --  what I said last night  --  was n't true . KENDALL Thanks . But one does n't invent that sort of lie . MONICA But I swear to you I  --  STOREY descends STOREY Hullo , Monica . MONICA Hullo , Storey . KENDALL Good-bye . STOREY Oh , do n't go . KENDALL I really must . To MONICAGood luck . She grips her hand , smiles at her and goes MONICA She 's  --  awfully nice . STOREY Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONICA It has n't done her much good , has it ? STOREY How do you mean ? MONICA She 's not very happy . p. 122 STOREY When it comes to that  --  who is ? MONICA You manage to have a pleasant time . STOREY I manage to behave as if I were having a pleasant time . One owes that to one 's friends , I believe  --  just as one owes it them to be decently shaved and to wear clean linen . MONICA That 's bunk . You have a good time because you 're built that way . You 're too selfish to worry about anything . STOREY I 've reformed . I 'm a better man , now , Monica . MONICA Are you ? STOREY Yes . MONICA How can you tell ? STOREY Well , for one thing , I 've thrown away the story I was working on . It 's in the grate . MONICA What made you do that ? STOREY Last night after you left I had several hours of heroic introspection . Henceforth I shall devote myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing . MONICA I wonder . STOREY The trouble is the masses bore me , democracy bores me . I 'd like to be Henry James and live with you in England on a private income . p. 123 MONICA Poor Storey ! I 've robbed you of your subsidy . STOREY What do you mean ? MONICA Mrs. Frayne . I just told her the truth about  --  last night . STOREY Did you ? MONICA She said : " One does n't invent that sort of lie . " STOREY Well , it does n't matter . MONICA sarcastic. , How generous you are ! STOREY I dare say it 'll be the finest possible thing for me to buckle down to hard work . I 'll do hackwork to make a living and the rest of the time  --  MONICA The rest of the time ? STOREY The rest of the time I 'll write sombre masterpieces , blood and tears  --  I 'll anatomize suffering . MONICA But , Storey , you do n't know anything about suffering . STOREY Most suffering is bunk , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their limitations . MONICA stamping her footHow can you be so complacent ? STOREY You 're a victim of the popular prejudice in favour of agony . Why is a book about unhappy , dirty people better than one about gay and comfortable ones ? p. 124 MONICA But life is n't gay  --  or comfortable . STOREY seriouslyDear darling , life is sad . I know it 's sad . But I think it 's gallant  --  to pretend that it is n't . MONICA Poor Austin . STOREY What makes you think of him ? MONICA I 've been thinking a lot of him  --  since last night . I 'll never forget his face  --  the way he looked . And you think life is gay  --  and comfortable ! There is a pause STOREY sincerelyMonica . MONICA out of a brown studyYes . STOREY If you take me one  --  I 'll do my best . She stares at him with curiosity , fixedly MONICA Will you ? STOREY I 'll try to be  --  what you think me . MONICA Thank you , Storey . STOREY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 STOREY Do n't you believe me ? That I 'll try . What 's the matter ? Why are you staring at me ? MONICA I 'm trying to discover what it is . STOREY What what is ? Why is everyone so cryptic to-day ? MONICA I 'm trying to discover what it is  --  that 's changed everything . You look the same as you did yesterday . STOREY The same face . MONICA But I ca n't remember the time when I loved you . Is it only yesterday  --  that I loved you ? STOREY This morning  --  one A.M. MONICA Ca n't recall what it was like . STOREY What 's this ? Do n't tell me you 're fickle , too . MONICA It 's not  --  fickle . It 's that  --  you seem to be another person . Your voice is different . STOREY Slight cold . MONICA The things you say  --  sound hollow to me . I do n't love you to-day , Storey . STOREY One ca n't have everything . MONICA I 'll never be in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over . It 's dead . p. 126 STOREY How do you know ? Tell me . I 'm interested . MONICA I just  --  know it . STOREY The things I said to you last night ? MONICA I suppose so . I feel  --  old now , Storey . I see myself  --  all this time I 've loved you  --  like a person looking from outside , a very old person . I see a little girl , a rather stupid little girl , reading a fairy-tale and believing it true  --  long after the other children knew it to be a lie . STOREY I always told you your idea of me was an idealization . MONICA But I never believed it  --  till last night . Last night I saw you as you really are  --  mercenary and unadventurous and  --  practical . I saw your soul . STOREY Must we drag the soul into it ? MONICA I saw it  --  a rather fat thing lying in an armchair  --  with a brain ticking , inside , like a clock . STOREY But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't and your brain is n't , but your soul is , Storey . You know it is . STOREY Why will women talk about the soul ? p. 127 MONICA All night I saw you like that . I said to myself : " When you see him when he stands in front of you  --  you 'll forget all that , you 'll feel as you did before . " But I do see you . You do stand in front of me . And it does n't matter . STOREY Do n't talk like that . I 'll fall in love with you . MONICA You 're too clever for me , Storey . Your emotions are too complicated . STOREY I wish I were like Austin . His emotions are as simple as those  --  MONICA tenderlyAs simple as those of a child . STOREY rather bitterlyNo second man peering over his shoulder . MONICA He 's a darling . STOREY abruptlyThe darling almost shot me this morning . MONICA Shot you ! STOREY points to the revolver lying on the table . She looks at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomplicated mood . He 's a rotten shot . MONICA Where 'd he go ? STOREY He 's upstairs , taking a nap . p. 128 MONICA How is he ? STOREY Feverish . He 'd been up all night , walking in the rain . MONICA We ought to have a doctor . STOREY I do n't think so . Champagne and jealousy . MONICA What did he say ? STOREY He was incoherent . Had an idea he ought to avenge your honour , I suppose . Acted like a moving picture hero and talked like a suburban father . Really , he was ridiculous . MONICA Did n't you tell him  --  that what I said last night  --  ? STOREY Of course I told him . But he would n't believe me . Nobody 'll ever believe the truth now . Really , Monica . MONICA thinking only of AUSTIN.Think what he must have gone through  --  to want to do that . STOREY Can you imagine the trial if he 'd succeeded ! Tracing imaginary headline " Scientist Kills Writer Over Woman . Following an all-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The note of licentiousness  --  and you in the witness- box  --  the story of your confession  --  everybody 'd say I got my deserts and Austin would come out a vindicated Saint George . p. 129 MONICA Do n't , Storey . STOREY But it 's so pretty , Monica . It 's almost a shame he did n't hit me . Ca n't you see the humour of it , the lovely irony of it ? What would you say in the witness-box ? Would you tell them the truth ? That I never ruined you at all , that you lied , to save me from myself , as you call it , to prevent me from making a mercenary marriage . But if you did that you 'd deprive the defence of a case . You 'd send Austin to the chair . MONICA You 're dreadful , Storey . STOREY And even if you said it was true  --  there must be difficulties . The prosecution would try to undermine you . They 'd want proof beyond your statement . I believe you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd want the child . Monica , you 'd have to produce the child . MONICA snatches up her wrap to go . She is outraged by his facetiousness . AUSTIN appears on the landing AUSTIN a bit wildlyMonica ! He comes downstairs STOREY I thought you were asleep . MONICA He is ill ! AUSTIN I 'm going now . MONICA Why , he 's trembling , feverish . p. 130 STOREY Wait . I 'll get him something hot to drink . He goes out AUSTIN Did Storey tell you why I  --  what I  --  MONICA Yes . He told me . AUSTIN Think if I had killed him !  --  the man you love  --  I 'll never forgive myself , Monica . MONICA Whatever has happened is my fault . AUSTIN I 've found out things about myself  --  what I really am . Look what I tried to do . MONICA Do n't blame yourself . I ca n't bear it . It 's I. AUSTIN No . You must know everything . I must tell you everything . You 've got to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do you know why ? It was n't alone because I hated him  --  but because I wanted to hurt you . I hated you , Monica . MONICA I know . AUSTIN But all the time  --  it 's hard for me to explain it  --  I loved you . You were inside of me . I was desperate  --  to tear you out . I see now I ca n't do it . I 'll never do it . I have no existence apart from you . MONICA Wait  --  Austin  --  listen to me . You 're trying to explain yourself to me . You need n't . I understand you . I understand you very well . You are clear to me . My trouble is  --  how will I make myself clear to you ? How can I make you understand what happened last night ? How I could have said what I did ? Because it is n't true , Austin . p. 131 AUSTIN repeating mechanicallyIs n't true . MONICA It seemed to me  --  I thought  --  that by saying it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a second . It was so childish . I thought AUSTIN You need n't tell me , Monica . MONICA How can I make you understand  --  that all that 's over now  --  that last night  --  yesterday  --  I loved Storey ? That to-day I do n't ? AUSTIN simplyYou do n't owe me  --  explanations , Monica . MONICA No , but I must . I want you to know everything that 's in my thoughts . I must n't hold anything back from you . I feel pain still about Storey , even now . But it is n't for him , do you understand , Austin ? It is n't for losing him ! It 's for the feeling I had for him  --  that it should have been wasted  --  that feeling that will never come again  --  that ca n't come again . AUSTIN Mine  --  remains . There is a pause MONICA Are you sorry ? AUSTIN No. p. 132 MONICA Austin  --  if you want me  --  I 'll love , honour and obey you . And I 'll try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've given you . AUSTIN You 're here . You 're close to me . It 's like being alive  --  for the first time . STOREY comes back ; he carries a glass of punch STOREY I had this ready five minutes ago . I drank it and made another . Here , Austin . AUSTIN No thank you , Storey . MONICA We 're just leaving . STOREY Oh ! A pauseBless you , my children ! AUSTIN embarrassedEr  --  thanks . Coming , Monica ? MONICA Yes . Good-bye , Storey . AUSTIN goes out STOREY I 'm awfully glad , Monica . It 's what I always told you to do , is n't it ? She says nothing . They look at each other . She is affected and he is , too . To break the moment he reverts to flippancyLife does occasionally imitate fiction . A happy ending , eh , Monica ? MONICA I think so , Storey . Goodbye . She goes out p. 133 STOREY after a momentThat 's that . He ponders ; he is serious . He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entrenches himself behind the drawing board , is about to write , looks towards the fireplace , goes to it , picks up the torn script and looks at it ruefullyDamn fool ! Goes back , begins writing , ca n't concentrate , gets up again , gives it up , and goes to the telephoneRegent 2772 please  --  is Mrs. Frayne there  --  hullo  --  Kendall ?  --  Storey  --  I 'm frightfully low , Kendall  --  you 've got to come and cheer me up  --  oh , now , are you going to drop me too ?  --  she 's gone  --  certainly , with Austin  --  we 'll dance at their wedding , Kendall  --  what about dinner ?  --  you 're busy  --  what ?  --  oh , packing  --  oh , do n't go abroad  --  if you do let 's go together  --  that is an idea  --  but why ?  --  now please be reasonable  --  do n't tell me you still believe that silly story of Monica 's  --  God , Ken , I 've never known you so stubborn  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probation until Austin and Monica  --  that 's the very least you can do  --  and , Kendall , I promise you  --  I absolutely promise you  --  that if their baby  --  if their baby bears the slightest resemblance to me  --  thank God , Kendall , you 're laughing  --  what ?  --  no , why should you ?  --  keep your passport and I 'll get another  --  of course  --  I can write as well in Europe as I can here  --  even better  --  no , I 've got a better idea  --  you cancel your passage and we 'll go the Southern route  --  oh yes , lovely this time of the year  --  land at Naples and motor to Nice  --  certainly  --  along the Riviera  --  beautiful trip .
