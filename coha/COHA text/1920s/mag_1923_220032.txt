The Friends of Music are interesting people . Their program consists of those many fine out-of-the-way compositions that rarely or never get performed anywhere else . Last Sunday afternoon they presented Schubert 's Mass in E Flat , the most charming of ecclesiastical music , an excellent example of old Schubert 's ingratiating sweetness . Which recalls that a good deal of the world 's very loveliest composition is to be found in that superb art form , the Mass.
