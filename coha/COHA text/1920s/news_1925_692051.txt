txt Secretary Mellon , who is to be the first witness before the Ways and Means Committee of the House tomorrow and discuss tax reduction problems , made public tonight a letter to Senator Edge of New Jersey in which he took a stand against proposals to exempt all net incomes up to $5,000 in the next revenue law . This is the first formal statement made by Mr. Mellon concerning his views , although there have been numerous unofficial reports about what he believes should be done in regard to limiting exemptions , abolishing the inheritance taxes and the publicity features of the laws and reducing surtax rates . Secretary Mellon made the point in his letter that if incomes of $5,000 or less were to be eympted it would be necessary in fairness to the taxpayers to exempt from taxation the first $5,000 of all incomes large and small . If this were done , he wrote , it would mean a loss of *167,000,000 annually to the Government instead ? of $85,000,000 , which had been estimated as the loss if the exemption was extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now costs the Government altruist as much to collect the taxes on incomes of $5,000 and under as was obtained in taxes from these incomes were declared by Mr. Mellon to be mistaken . Reports covering most of these smaller incomes , he wrote , were audited in the district offices at a total expense to the Government of only about $14,000,000 , the heavier expense being due to the work involved in the auditing of the complicated reports covering tile incomes . Secretary Mellon contended that the taxes now levied on incomes of $5,000 and less were " insignificant sums " to the taxpayer , although they meant much to the Government in the aggregate . He pictured the receipts obtained by the 5 and 10 cent stores as presenting a simile and gave as a further reason for continuing to tax small incomes the fact that payments , however small , kept the taxpayer awake to the desirability of governmental economy . Would Limit Cut to $260,000,000 . There has been no other official statement as yet concerning the suggestions which Secretary Mellon will make to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will advise against too deep a cut and recommend that the revenues be decreased by not more than $250,000,000 , as opposed to recommendations for cuts of from $400 , - 000,000 to $600,000,000 made in some other quarters . Mr. Mellon , it has been understood , will advise that the maximum surtax rate be reduced to not more than 20 per cent . and that the maximum normal tax be put at 5 per cent . It has been stated that he will favor abolition of the publicity sections of the Revenue law , and will oppose the proposition ' put forward by Representative Garner , that the cancellation of the public debt be spread over sixty-two years instead of twenty-five years , in order that taxes may be reduced by $500,000,000 or more in the next law . Immediate elimination of the Federal inheritance tax also will be favored by Secretary Mellon , although it is doubtful if the Treasury Department hopes to obtain such far-reaching action at this time , and the outlook now appears to be for a reduction in the present rates , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made plain at the Treasury Department that there will be no fixed Program put forward , unless such a request is made by the Ways and Means Committee . An outstanding feature of the tax situation is that even before the meetings of the committee have opened Representative Garner , the ranking Democrat on the committee , and other Congressional leaders who have been classed as high surtax men are on record as ready to accept a reduction of the maximum surtax rate from 40 per cent . to 25 per cent . This apparently eliminates all danger of a serious fight to keep the surtax rate above the 25 per cent . level , and gives some hope for the acceptance of 20 per cent . as the maximum . Leaders of a leas conservative turn of mind than Secretary Mellon are seeking to increase the exemption on the smaller incomes and a decrease in the normal rates . It appears quite probable that a compromise will be reached on some of these points , such as a. reduction of thenormal rate on incomes Of $5,000 or less to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as at present . The odds nov7 seem to favor the Treasury Department . however , , in its fight to . prevent the adoption of a policy which would extend , the cancellation of the public debt over ' sixty-two years . The Treasury Department called at . tention to the fact that Senator Edge had not recommended ; exern.ption , of M. comes of $5,000 " a less hut merely:A/ad forwarded- , to xr ; .. xenon -a suggestion= , Which had been made to him in order obtain the Treasury 's viewpoint . ? Secretary Mellon 's Letter . Secretary Mellon 's letter to Mr. Edge Ka* as follows : MY dear Senator : -I have been so busy with the various foreign debt negotiations that I have delayed answering your letter of the 24th until today . You suggest that it might be advisable in amending the income tax law to " exempt all net incomes of $5,000 or less . Your reason for this suggestion is your information ' that it probe131y costs the Government more to collect the tax on net incomes up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . therefore . it would be in the interest of economy from the Government 's standpoint to exempt net incomes of $5.000 or less . Your estimate of the loss of revenue of $83,000.000 by the adoption of such a suggestion is apparently based on the elimination of the tax on net incomes of $5 000 and under without extending a like exemption to taxpayers with higher incomes . It would hardly seem equitable to raise the exemption on taxpayers having incomes of $5,000 and less and not permit similar exemption to taxpayers having incomes in excess of $5,000 . Fortexample , it is not fair to levy no tax on a man with a net income of $4,900 and to tax a man with an income of $5,100 on all incomes in excess of $1,000 . If the principle of a straight $5,000 exemption on all taxpayers were applied . it Is estimated that the loss of revenue , based on 1920 returns , instead of $83 , - 000.000 would be $167,000,000 . If now we compare this prospective loss of revenue with the expense of collection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net revenue to the Government . The total expenditures of the internal revenue bureau for the year 1924 were some $42.000,000 . From this $8,000,000 should be deducted for expenditures directly made for the enforcement of the prohibition and narcotic laws , leaving some $34.000.000 to represent the expense of collecting the personal income taxes , both large and small , the corporate income taxes and all the miscellaneous taxes . Puts Cost at $5,000,000 . As a matter of fact , ' he small returns are audited in the field in the various Collectors ' offices , and , except ha unusual cases , do not come into Washington at all . This audit is part of the regular work in the collectors ' offices , and the total expense of all collectors ' offices is only about $14,000,000 a year . In other words , at an expense of $14,2-000,000 a year these small returns are audited . and the collectors do all the other work required of them . It seems to me if we had a complete cost system there would be allocated to the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than $5,000,000 . Compare this expense with a revenue of $107,000,000 . There is another point to be considered . It would not be practicable , even if the exemption were raised , to eliminate the making of returns by those having a certain gross income , though their net income is below the exemption . At present all having a gross income of $2,000 a year must make returns . Were this not required , many taxable incomes would evade payment of tax . So , if the exemption ' were raised . almost ' as many returns ' would have to be audited . You can readily understand this since , as cite law now stands , less than 50 per cent . of those who make returns and whose returns are audited pay any tax at all . Coming now to the ' question of delay and congestion in the bureau , it has been our experience that returns of small net incomes are very quickly audited and that the returns of large Incomes are the principal cause of delay and require the great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred small returns a day , whereas It may take him three or four months to handle one large return Add to this the fact that these returns are audited in the field , and you can easily see that their elimination would in no wise relieve the Bureau of internal Revenue from its present congested condition nor permit a lowering of the period of the statute of limitations . If you will examine the forms used for returns of less than $5,000 and for those in excess of $5,000 , copies of which I enclose , you will note the simplicity of the former and the complicated character of the latter . These forms have been the result of practical experience and give a clear indication of the difference in time required for audit . It is true that under the present law a married man with an income of $3,00a pays but $7.50 tax , or a quarter of 1 per cent . of his income ; onewith $4,000 pays $22.50 tax , or one-half of 1 per cent. , and one with $5,000 pays $27.50 tax , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are to the taxpayer , but not to the Government . It must be remembered that great businesses have been built up on small returns and large volume . The most conspicuous example which comes to my mind is the 5 and 10 cent store . We ignore experience if we say that these small taxes from net incomes of $5,000 or less are not worth collecting . Wants Every Citizen Interested . Income tax first touches the citizen of this country at a much higher point of income than in any other country with which I am familiar . In other countries the tax is on a broad base . With us this base has already been very much narrowed . To narrow it further would make the whole tax structure unstable and its continued usefulness as a source of revenue uncertain . As a matter of policy , it is advisable to have every citizen with a stake in his country . Nothing brings home to a man the feeling that he personally has an interest in seeing that Government revenues are not squandered , but intelligently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct tax , no matter how small , to his Government . I feel , therefore , that the adoption of your suggestion would be wrong in policy and ineffective in decreasing the cost of collection or in eliminating delay and congestion . The tax on the incomes to be affected is already so small as to be no burden to the taxpayer . The sole result of such a change would be an enormous loss of revenue to the Government , without a single compensating advantage . Very truly yours , A. W. MELLON . Secretary of the Treasury . Bon . Walter E. Edge . United States Senate , Washington , D. C. The hearings before the Ways and Means Committee will continue ten days , and at their conclusion the committee will get to work on a bill which will be submitted soon after Congress assembles in December . Predictions have been made that final action will be obtained early nest year , in time to have the new rates applicable whern ' the first tax payments are due , on March 15 .
