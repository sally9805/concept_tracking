In Chicago , celebrating the 25th anniversary of the day when it was founded by Booker T. Washington , the National Negro Business League convened . Dr. Robert R. Moton , President of Tuskegee University , presided . In his opening speech he referred to the National Negro Finance Corporation , recently organized as a financial backer for Negro enterprises : " For 16 years the founder of this organization , Booker T. Washington , sought with tact and courage to overcome what seemed almost an obsession with our people- business fear and timidity . In large measure as individuals , and even more so in groups , we have overcome this timidity . The need for the present , therefore , is to stress the need for honest , capable , expert management as a basis for credit . <P> " This need is being met by the National Negro Finance Corporation , chartered for $1,000,000 . I hope by the first of January we can begin business operations . <P> " Its purpose is to supply credit which will not only mean greater prosperity for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ... <P> " Let us see what the possibilities are . It is conservatively estimated there are $20,000,000 of Negro money hidden under mattresses , behind brick walls , buried in earthen jars or otherwise concealed around the home . It is also estimated that Negroes have in banks , not owned nor operated by persons of their race , from $70,000,000 to $100,000,000 . <P> " Suppose half this money were deposited in Negro institutions ? What a difference it would make in furnishing employment to Negro boys and girls ! This would mean no loss to white institutions , because most of our banks carry large accounts in white banks . . . . <P> " There is another thing this League should do in the future and in larger measure than we have in the past - emphasize the importance of thrift to our people , young and old . The Negro race constitutes one-tenth of the population of the United States . In 1921 , Negroes spent for luxuries alone these sums : For cigars , cigarettes and tobacco , $22,000,000 ; perfumery and cosmetics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum , $3,500,000 ; pianos , organs , phonographs and other musical instruments , $46,000,000 ; sporting goods , cameras , firearms , electric fans , photographs and pictures , at least $35,000,000 . . . . " <P> President Coolidge wrote to Dr Moton on this occasion : " Just as emancipation from slavery was granted by the immortal Lincoln , so is economic emancipation being splendidly wrought out by the colored people themselves .
