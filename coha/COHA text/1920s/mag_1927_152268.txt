Not since the Civil War had U. S. cavalry engaged in maneuvers on the scale of those conducted last week on 120 square miles of terrain in and about Marfa , Tex . Some 280 officers , 4,000 men , 3,200 horses and 1,500 mules were deployed over gulches , hillocks and sagebrush plains-the Second Cavalry Brigade ( Fort Bliss ) playing " Brown " army to the " White " army of the First Cavalry Brigade ( Fort Clark ) and First Cavalry Regiment ( Marfa , Tex . ) . Tanks , cannon , airplanes , Red Cross ambulances and every appurtenance of real war , right down to hot weather , secrecy and red tape , accompanied the show . <P> Following the maneuvers , horses , mules and men assembled in Marfa for athletics , a review and a horse show . Troopers were paid off and sent back to their stations while officers continued to argue about which " army " had " won . " Among other stratagems weighed for merit was that of dyeing white horses brown to camouflage them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountings on harness ; dun netting to dull the flash of shiny saddle seats . <P> With airplanes , tanks , armored cars and motor cycles competing , the cavalry , once the most spectacular service of national defense , is so little heard of that few citizens know who is U. S. cavalry chief . Major General Herbert B. Crosby is his name . A 56-year-old Kansan , he served in Cuba , the west , the Philippines and , as a Colonel of Infantry , in France . He mounted the highest of U. S. horses in 1926.
