The U.S. customs and Prohibition laws are probably the ones most commonly broken by the general run of U.S. citizens . . . . Is a private citizen corrupt , who , by bribery or otherwise , tries to make or save money by breaking or evading the law ? <P> Down a Manhattan pier to meet the Aquitania as she docked last week , moved a ponderous prodigy of a man . Customs inspectors looked his way and touched their caps from a distance . There could be no mistaking who it was-William Hanford ( " Big Bill " ) Edwards , the 300-Ib. onetime Princeton footballer who , under President Wilson , used to be Manhattan 's collector of internal revenue . Obviously , Mr. Edwards had come down to meet friends and , by adumbration of his old authority , facilitate their passage through the customs shed . <P> The friends , a smart-looking Mr. &; Mrs. Clarence S. Herter of Manhattan , debarked with six trunks and seven pieces of hand luggage and the courtesy of the Port . Mr. Edwards took them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided " the party to the section lettered " H. " A cheery conversation began as the trunks were unlocked and an inspectorial eye ran over the-Herters ' joint declaration . <P> The inspectorial eye twinkled almost as brightly as the diamond clasp on Mrs. Herter 's triple strand of pearls . The declaration showed that the Herters had prudently limited their foreign purchases to exactly the amount-$200 worth-which they could bring in free . The inspectors smiled , perhaps to congratulate onetime Collector Edwards upon having such modest , honest friends , and began looking into Herter trunks in a way that promised to be pleasantly perfunctory . <P> The Herter-Edwards conversation was interrupted by an ominous silence and then a silken rustling between the customs men . They were pulling out of one Herter trunk an astonishing quantity of flowered cerise silk , lined with baby blue . The material eventually resolved itself into a gentleman 's dressing gown of prodigious proportions , a dressing gown from Paris to fit only such a monster figure as that of William Hanford ( " Big Bill " ) Edwards . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nowhere mentioned in the Herter 's declaration . <P> Everyone looked amazed , then embarrassed , then annoyed , each in his own way . The inspectors began searching in earnest . The Herters had been abroad for six months , but not even the old plea , " I 've worn that , it 's almost worn out , ' ' could keep the inspectors ' list of their attempted smugglings from including woolen coats and suits worth $700 abroad ; silk pajamas , negligees , lingerie worth $1,300 ; bed linen , mezzotints , and a triple string of Tecla pearls with a diamond clasp . <P> Mrs. Herter regained her smile . Mr. Herter was not so cheerful , especially when the inspectors crashed his four bottles of choice liquor and told him that he would have to pay a big bill-$12 , - 919.25 in duties &; fines-to recover all his property . William Hanford ( " Big Bill " ) Edwards , onetime Collector of the Internal revenue , left the pier in a thoughtful mood , perhaps reflecting that other friends of his returning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and eloquent presence to meet them on the dock .
