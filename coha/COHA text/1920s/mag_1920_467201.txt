WE have boasted , and with good reason , that the United States is the Land of Opportunity . We may well be proud of it . But , having accomplished something worth while in building a nation , it will be the height of folly if we it twirling our thumbs in the belief that things will take care of themselves . They will not ; and yet we have shown a disposition to think that they will . In providing that every one shall have a chance we have been wasteful of opportunities ; we have exalted the incompetent and starved the competent . It has been as though we owned a menagerie , and in feeding the animals were to declare that elephants are entitled to just as much meat as lions , whether they eat it or not , and that every lion should receive as much hay as an elephant . We should thus give the animals equal sustenance without regard to their internal structures . So the elephants would waste meat while lions wasted bay , and the animals might go hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of intelligence tests was employed whereby men were graded according to mentality : mark A indicating a very active , competent , and able mind ; B , a mind of high order ; C+ , better than average ; C , average ; C ? , below average ; D , dull ; D ? , undeveloped , and E representing a mental age of seven to ten years . Subsequent indexing showed no commissioned or non-commissioned officers worthy of mention in the dull and undeveloped classes , but a vast number of illiterate recruits . Literate recruits showed a maximum number of the average , or C type , and about the same proportion from and including C ? dem as from and including B up . That literate recruits showed a synametril average ; corporals were better th average , sergeants better than corpora and among commissioned officers tyi A and B predominated , Now education will do a good deal : us , but it will not make good and relial leaders of persons having dull or um veloped minds . These are with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha to be carried along . We can not mr them wise by denying them liquor tobacco , or by sending them to hif school or college . Granted a state o municipality , or indeed any organizat ruled by D and E men , and it is cert to end in disorder . They can not co pute consequences . They are child : without guidance . They can not and take affairs and carry them throw They can work by the day , and the r jority of them are to be found in ranks of labor . Those with rich corn ) tions are provided for , but these comparatively few in number , in same measure that rich persons are paratively few in number . A consic able body ranging from D ? to is cared for by the state . There are plenty of men of types B , and C in the ranks of labor , and i no reflection upon labor that it has ca for the incompetents and carried th along . Organized labor as establishes America would have a better stand without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defectives brands group with the stigma of mental inf ority . Without them organized la would have more sense -- and it know . There would be fewer reckless strike each of contract , among other things ; , d that somewhat indefinite ideal called rmocracy in Industry might become are concrete and attainable . In what follows we shall propose the plication of such tests ? assuming em to be improved and elaborated ? us all , and in so doing we shall conler two related phases of effectmely , upon industry , and upon the dy politic . We can not get away from idea of democracy in industry , beIse the subject is in the air , and nearly persons are discussing it ; and as for - noeraey in government , it needs no ; ument to confirm the fact that a good rt of the world has run amuck over it . We propose the subject rather for cussion than for immediate action , , unlike some of our grave Senators in ngress , we are neither under obligan to oppose measures of welfare be-Lae these did not originate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making proposal , do we feel obliged to sup- ? t it should sound criticism prove it oe unavailable . . et us suppose that we , meaning the der , the writer , and all the friends and ociates of both , were on one side of a at , high iron fence , and that on the er side were people very like us , and some cases related to us by ties of od , if not of affection or even of uainlance . Suppose we were poor , had to work all the time , and that children also had to work , and that ietimes we had to go hungry . And pose those on the other side were t , and dressed elaborately ; that their nen dolled themselves up and scorned snubbed us , and that their men paid attention to us whatever . Suppose ry now and then some of our bright ng people should manage to get over fence , being more agile and spry than rest of us , or by having induced rich t or women to send for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tld have no more to do with us . We ht not behave well at all . We might iibiy feel resentful . We might even go so far as to refuse to be content " in that state of life unto which it shall please God to call us . " We on our side of the fence would not recognize any fundamental differences between our organisms and those of the rich . Our human wants are the same as theirs , and , even as they , some of us have esthetic tastes that would fain be gratified . We would state , also , that we hare the burden of the fools to carry because we are charitable ; that we have fed them and cared for them while the rich repudiated them . True , those on the other side of the fence have moments of generosity in which they give us things that they think we ought to want . But even their generosity does not take the sting from our grievance ? the grievance that only as a gift can we obtain the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times are upon us , and that we suffer want , actual want . We are hungry , but those other folks go right on in their affluence and luxury . They may make some negligible economies ; they may cut down superfluous expenses ; they may discharge a few extra servants ( who would thus be thrown over to our side ) ? but they do not feel the real pinch of poverty as we do ; they never rise from the table unsatisfied , face the cold with insufficient clothing , stifle from the heat , or are unable to send for medical attendance when ill . And when , being mortal , after all , any of them succumbs , the survivors do not have to deny themselves in order to bury their dead befittingly . As we dwell on these things our anger grows , and , anger being very contagious , our minds become alike , so that all unconsciously the intelligence of the group ascending from C suffers itself to be dominated by the unreasoning fury of those on the lower level who are ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sloughed off . D ? is in the ascendant , and before we realize it we become a roaring crowd of Bolsheviki . A gentleman of great wealth said during a period of hard times : " We have closed down the works in which I am interested , and I hear that there is trouble among the hands . They hate me like poison , and it will be as much as my life is worth to show myself there . But I 'm going . I intend to give up my golf and go out to the works to see if there is n't some way in which we can run , at least on part time , to keep them . at work . " Suppose we were the gang , living with our families in an out-of-the-way place , and that the works in question which constituted our only source of income were to be shut down on short notice . We should be in sore straits , and we should doubtless blame the old man who had ordered the shut-down . We should hold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used every effort at the outset to prevent the catastrophe . We should reason that we had gone there and settled down with our households because he wanted us ? because he had invited us , in fact , and that now it was his business to look after us ; to see to it that as part of his organization we should not suffer . He will use every precaution that his machinery shall not deteriorate during the period of idleness , and he owes it to us to take equal pains that we shall not starve . That is the situation to-day in those phases of industry which we regard as unregenerate ; this division into two groups , the owners and administrators on the one hand , and the workers on the other . It is also the situation among a very considerable number of our voters . The sense of separation is keener on the part of the laborers , because they have fewer possessions , fewer distractions , than the rich , and because into many groups of laboring-men has crept the philosophy of Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor are normally in a state of opposition . It presents democracy among workers as arrayed in hostility arainst employers who therefore must riand without the democratic pale . It prQoses that one class shall fight the other and conquer it . And there , in practise , stops . Now democracy in practice is not perfect thing , and it has failed me often than it has succeeded . As a m chine it does not work of itself . It dra along on the edge of collapse , even such municipalities as New York ai Philadelphia . The votes of the ignora and the angry kill progress . " A pleb cite autocracy , " said Bismarck , " is t worst kind of autocracy , " and Bismar was a shrewd observer , even though would have failed to qualify as a teact of moral philosophy before a conscif tions board of examiners . " The test democracy , " said a man who gig thought to such matters , " is the abili to choose good leaders and to ke them . " We frequently see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are brought about by n jorities consisting of D or D ? mir that are unable to see farther than 1 next payday in advance , and ant minds that have ceased to think at : If such men were to control indust then industry would perish , because the long run it requires intelligence well as integrity to administer affaOn the other hand , were labor freed fr. its handicap of inferior mentalities fr . D ? down , it could participate with ea tal in far greater measure than it n does ; indeed , in course of time it wo : join in the control of capital , just bankers now join in it . It is the d : of its stupid members and of those n have permitted their minds to beco numb and useless with anger that present renders negotiations with org : ized labor so of ten futile or unsatisfacto Grown men and women with the mind . children are seldom honest . They h the mathematical vision to reckon eon consequences . They do not know enough vote with discrimination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep ti promises . Stupidity will kill any orgy zation , whether a hod-carriers ' union a trust company . Itis the one dose fr to democracy . Granted intelligence , . f democracy is likely to worry through , one way or another , but where stupidity predominates the prospect is hopeless . That is the point Karl Marx missed in his philosophy . At the same time labor , under its present inadequate organization , can destroy capital , and credit , and civilization . That is the hazard to-day . That is what is happening in Russia , and that is what is threatening in Germany . In fact , the dark menace hangs over France and England and us . To destroy is far easier than to build up . Children are by nature destructive . So are men and women with undeveloped minds . They can do constructive work , but only under direction ; they lack the endurance , the vision , and the powers of co-ordination needed to plan constructive work and bring it unaided to a finish . Democracy fails when it lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public was ever wise enough to manage its own affairs in detail . The great defect of many men gifted with the : acuity of directing affairs is that they mnnot direct others to do work for them ; they must do everything themselves , Ind thus they limit their own capacity . ks citizens , we cease to function as inteligent voters as soon as the ticket be ! omes too long and bears too many mines , because the long ticket requires hat we function as voters in ignorance . ntelligenee among voters is necessary n order to look ahead , to judge men , and o compute consequences . It can not be xpected , for instance , of the voters of a age city that they be able to determine ' hich man has the best capacity and professional training to serve as engineer f public works , or as health officer . uch selection , we have already learned , 2quires special information which is not eld in common by all voters , no matter ow intelligent they may be . The snb.ance of democracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present situation in puba affairs and in industry ? We have the mservatives who are sometimes called actionaries , and these have the meritof wanting to conserve the wealth of humanity . Usually they strive to avoid the waste of wealth that has already been saved , Their fault is a lack of active sympathy . Their " hearts bleed " for the sufferings of the poor , but they do not do much constructive thinking or acting to remedy the trouble . This is by no means true of all , but it is true of a number large enough Lo work a great deal of damage . On the other hand , we have the radicals who see the defects in the social order and ? here again we speak of a large number rather than of all ? they encourage anger and resentment that tend to pull down the prevailing order ; but they are very defective in their designs for building up . Also , there are many unprincipled radicals ambitious to lead , but who lack the minds to do so in order . They see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus hope to find profit in anarchy . The merit of honest radicals is their perception of defects , and their fault lies in their methods of correction . They do not seek really competent men to direct affairs . Many hold to the theory that " the right man will appear , " that one who can be depended on to guide the ship of state into the gentle waters of peace will come forth when a condition of strain arises ; but there never was a greater delusion . Was Robespierre the right man ? Is Lenin ? Or Trotzky ? Was Andrew Johnson ? Does the tragic history of the world show that the right man always comes Lo the front ? We must have a curious notion of rightness to believe in such a delusion , Sometimes it does happen that the right man appears , but it is rank blasphemy to hold that " in God 's own time " he inevitably will do so . It is right to hope for him and to work for him , but it requires our best efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose we are taking for granted that it would be possible to make and record for public inspection a mental test of every citizen that would be more definite and a better gage of his or her capacity than the army tests we have mentioned . We must imagine that such tests could be made , and that they would be construed and recorded both honestly and effectively . Suppose every one were compelled either to submit to them or else to receive a rating too low to carry with it the privileges of citizenship . Then we could not cover our defects . Birth , family , education , would be powerless to save us . Of course we should need a common-school education ? we need it now ? but there would he nothing to hinder the man who never had got beyond the grammarschool from ranking as A , while the Bachelor of Arts might easily rate as C or even as D. This would be true democracy , for our souls would stand naked before the tests . If we were all recorded in this manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go about , with a D mind and a fat pocketbook , committing economic excesses ? Who would admire ? Imagine an overdressed D woman trying to impress with the aid of a bejeweled lorgnette a group of A and B men and women with the duty and propriety of recognizing her superiority and of " knowing their places . " What a world of new comedy would arise from the efforts of the unworthy to establish their worth by the arts of posing ! And nobody under D would be allowed to vote . In a democracy it is our minds that are needed rather than our faces . We have publicity as to faces ; why not establish publicity as to our minds ? It would be a grand leveler . Suppose it were possible to determine the A and B men who have at once good character and the ability and experience to lead . They probably would constitute less than 10 per cent . of the population ; and yet , if they were all killed off at once , before the rising generation matures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live by the grace and invention of Tess than one-tenth of our number ! In the course of time , if these were suddenly killed or taken from us , some kind of order would be evolved , but the chances are that it would Lake the form of a dictatorship . To maintain order by a dictatorship is far more simple than by the complex processes of democracy . Leadership is a rare gift with which but few of us arc endowed . Many of the best leaders undertake their responsibilities with fear and trembling because they are alive to their obliga ? tions and realize the cost of error . Mosi feeble-minded persons think they car lead and " would like to try . " There is a delicate problem involve ( in these intelligence tests . If we were b pass with an A , or even with a B rating we should be proud of it but were w classed as C ? or D we might not wan it known at first . This would be a mis take , and in time we should overcorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The purpose of the te. , is to keep us from doing damage ; to sal ; us from assuming obligations we al unable to fulfil . There is every reason why those of low rating may attain gre beauty of life , and there is nothing t prevent them from enjoying themseiv ( to their fill . Their chances of happine : would be far better were they secure from one of the most poignant tragedil of life ? that of a task beyond one capacity to fulfil , with the eonsequei misery this entails on others . Persoi of inadequate mentality are capable doing certain kinds of routine work , ar this should be open to them . And for tl very reason that they would be restrict ( in their opportunities for advaneemer public sentiment would see to it th they were happily conditioned in tin employment and in no wise abused I those supervising them . Indeed such classifications might w ' make for greater social content no k than for better social order . We like regard ourselves as individuals , wi qualities peculiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If fail to achieve distinction we prefer attribute the fact to circumstanc rather than to our own shortcoming But to the situation created by the establishment of tests we could soon adjust ourselves . Many persons have endowments of a high order coupled with 3thers little more than rudimentary , and nearly every one of us is feeble-minded n one respect or another . To realize inch shortcomings is a great advantage . Chat is a feature of intelligence . But isually we guess wrong , for we are , most of us , but poor diagnosticians of our own wits . An eminent authority tells us hat most great poets have been good aen of business . With many artists of he first rank this holds true also . Of ourse great poets du not always make coney and good painters , for instance , re not necessarily clever salesmen of heir own wares . The fact is the best rinds in poetry and art are usually too evoted to production of work of a high rder to consider immediate returns or i follow the markets . Pot-boilers are isiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make pot-boilers . On the ler hand , it is the claim of many men ad women who devote themselves to t in various forms that they almost ) proach imbecility in matters of busi ! ss . Often they are right , except that le claim is too narrow . Again , with all respect to our friends ho address themselves to the study of : neties and heredity , no one knows a ter than they that types of mind are it always transmitted in direct descent ; at Mendel 's law applies to a multitude characteristics ; that Darby and Joan , th classified as A , may have a son or lighter who combines the eyes of Irby with the hair of Joan , and yet in natal equipment may take after a Dmt-uncle who was hanged for murder . to progeny of the great are of len little , d vice versa . Organized tests would he ; evere blow to false family pride , and conceivable public measure would do ore to overthrow the pretensions of an aristocracy of wealth than this very ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry were organized on such tests and the men duly graded as they were employed , the low types might for a while bunt for berths for which they were unfitted , but soon they would be forced to settle down to the only kind of work open to them , and probably , once placed , the bread-winning exigencies of their existence would prevent them from paying attention to the orators of anarchy . And the orators of anarchy would have the intelligent body of the public ranged against them . The A 's and B 's would get their rightful opportunities , and soon would be earning their deserts . Thus would class distinction be overcome . Competent men are always in demand , and with the assurance that promotion lay ahead , the higher type would fit themselves for better things in store , knowing that their own fortunes were literally in their own hands to make or mar . Meanwhile the D and E types would he eared for by industry instead of by labor . Occupation suited to their limited capacities under special guidance would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves and from the liability to injure others , and they would no longer he the drag that holds back their superiors and delays industrial progress as it does now . We should never forget that the D and E men and women are our brothers and sisters and , even as we , entitled to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , but none the less we should take every precaution to prevent them from playing with machinery ? above all with the machinery of administration ! Let us imagine an industrial establishment in which fifteen hundred men are employed . The record cards of the various employees would be examined . There are , let us say , eight or ten young fellows with type A minds among them . The employer would soon give them their opportunity to work their way ahead and become parts of the organization , because they are always greatly needed . They , for their part , would take their chances and contribute that quality of invention that leads to success , in which they would share . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would consist. , of the skilled workmen , and would understand enough of the economics of the situation to know bow unprofitable strikes are . They would not have to strike . Publicity . of accounts would take care of that . As things are , there 's no use in offering figures to a moron . He thinks he can understand them , but he ca n't . People who can understand get along much better than those who can not understand . The incompetents would be segregated , and would work to better effect if looked after than as now when their chief contribution is confusion . And any competent child which the incompetents might produce would have his chance . Nobody would be ruled out . With this proposed grouping of talents , capital and labor could work together harmoniously , because defective foremen and superintendents , and also officers of corporations , all of whom would have to undergo tasts , would also be eliminated from posts of authority . Men of high rating but low moral standards who might seek to corrupt their weaker brethren would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render their efforts not only unprofitable , but distinctly dangerous to themselves . But to put incompetent men into office and then to tell them to go ahead and do their best is no less than a form of sabotage . By the signal addition to the councils of industry which skilled labor would contribute , if relieved of its burden of the unfit. , an important provision would be made against the useless expense caused by idleness and unemployment from which workers now suffer . And in place of the unsealable fence between the rich and the poor there would be avenues of intercommunication uniting the two groups , to the benefit of both . There are many difficulties , naturally , in the way of this test-rating , as there are in every forward step . But if the loss of the 10 per cent . of men of ability and character who are endowed with ti capacity for leadership would break u the country ? and it is our firm con vi , tion that it would so do ? we may eve now he nearer the urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who lack foresight ar vision . Within the realm of scientific resean there are two general methods of pr cedure . One is to test everything in sigi and available until a solution of tl problem is reached or abandoned . is the slow and expensive method of td and error . We use it . with men in indr try , and the consequent wastes al losses are immense . The incompete man that it puts into the wrong pla causes disorder and misunderstandin and anger and suffering . The more e lightened method is to study the pi losophy of a problem from the star point of mathematics and natural scier until , as very often happens , both n terial and methods are indicated . T1 is the modus operandi we should empl in industry when dealing with the hum element involved . It would avoid wa : of men and waste of the possibilities happiness . In government it would eliminate t incompetent voters , and the demagogy would be the only one to suffer . The competent would he better off becai they would live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vicious if realized would not be p posed as a lure for votes .

Australian bushman in intelligen could no more corrupt parties and tate elections . A great change mid come over public opinion and pul thought . We might seek the to rather than seek what can be " i over . "
