Lie Upon Lie <P> Sirs : <P> ... In your issue of Sept. 17 you again pile lie upon lie ! You report that when Field Marshal von Mackensen visited the Kaiser at Doom , the latter asked about his prospects for restoration , and that Mackensen replied : " There is not the slightest evidence that the people desire your Majesty 's return . " <P> Wilhelm II , according to your story , blushed furiously and left the room , only to return later and assail Mackensen for the latter 's failure to appear in uniform . Thereupon the Field Marshal is alleged to have repeated his former statement in effect . <P> I am authorized by Field Marshal von Mackensen to make the following direct statement from him : <P> " The article of the magazine TIME is a complete fabrication . You are authorized to describe it as a swindle . His Majesty has never put to me such a question as that set forth in the article ; never has a conversation with him even touched on that theme . The article lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The TIME article further asserted that Zoubkov , who married the Kaiser 's sister , sent a copy of his memoirs to Doom , inscribed : " To Wilhelm , the Genius of Our Family . From Alex , Your Affectionate Brother-in-Law . " <P> I am authorized to say that no copy of this book was ever received at Doom . <P> I wonder whether you are not mistaken in assuming , as you plainly do , that the bulk of your readers are tormented , like yourselves , by an acute feeling of inferiority which makes them rejoice when the mighty are brought low . I am pretty sure you are mistaken . <P> <P> S. MILES BOUTON <P> Special Correspondent : The Baltimore Sun The Brooklyn Daily Eagle Berlin , Germany <P> TIME notes ( with thanks to Baltimore Sun 's Bouton ) Field Marshal von Mackensen 's denial of incidents originally reported in German newspapers . Difficult it is , however , to believe that Monarchist von Mackensen never talked monarchy with his onetime Monarch. - ED . <P> <P> Numbering Presidents <P> Sirs : <P> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been President of the United States . They number 29 . I have counted them carefully . Yet on at least five occasions since election TIME has gravely and informatively told its readers that Herbert Hoover will be the 31st President . I add his portrait to the row-it only makes 30 . Kindly explain . <P> <P> C. W. HALL <P> Akron , Ohio <P> TIME follows the almanackers ' custom . in numbering the Presidents as they have come . Thus , though George Washington had two terms he is numbered only once . <P> But Cleveland , between whose two terms came Benjamin Harrison 's , was both the 22nd and 24th President . Should Calvin Coolidge be reelected in 1932 he would be President Number 32 as well as Number 30. - ED . <P> <P> Lajpat Rai Bayonetted <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME 'S issue of Nov. 26 under the heading of Milestones an item stated that Lala Lajpat Rai , of India , died of heart disease . <P> It is a well-established fact that Rai died from the effects of bayonet wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the day Sir John Simon visited Lahore . Rai at this time had been leading a peaceable demonstration against the reception of Simon . . . .
