Sun-shot Florida is no place for a man with work to do . Impatient with its seductions , Herbert Hoover last week boarded his train at Miami , sped back to Washington against the advice of several good friends . Inauguration was still a fortnight off . All precedent opposed such an early return . But Mr. Hoover had lots to do , many people to see . Besides , his home is in Washington . <P> The sunset of an old administration is generally a strange , distorted hour . Shadows are longest then and the last red glimmer of official prestige is at its richest . Would the President-Elect eclipse the outgoing President ? Probably not , for Mr. Hoover is ever cautious . He will sequester himself in his S street home , strive to cast no shadows at all . Mr. Hoover and his party skipped all over southern Florida last week . Bad weather drove him back from his west coast tarpon fishing . He inspected the Okeechobee flood area , saw tent colonies , praised sugar cane and truck growing in low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish for federal aid . At Palm Beach he was feted at the Bath and Tennis Club . At Fort Lauderdale , 3,000 excited children mobbed him , swept him two blocks from his car . At Brighton , Fla. , Mr. Hoover lunched with Glenn H. Curtiss , aviation pioneer . He remarked to his host that Col. Lindbergh should fly no more , lest he be killed by the law of aviation averages . The Pan-American Airways , Inc. , Mr. Hoover suggested , should give him a good safe ground job . Mr. Curtiss , a-twinkle , replied that the situation would probably be met , in view of press reports that Mr. Hoover was going to appoint Col. Lindbergh to his sub-cabinet in charge of civil aeronautics . Mr. Hoover promptly changed the subject of conversation .
