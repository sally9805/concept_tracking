THE force that drives Mr. Shaw 's prefaces is , after all , not that of reason or philosophy , but intuition and emotion . His great gift is that of the artist who must record his sense that what he thinks and feels must . be true and that other people must be driven to a like per ? suasion . There are those who might fear that such an observation would offend Mr. Shaw . But I think he knows it already , and that , anyhow , he will net mind very much so long as you call the gift great . Stirred by this impulse toward carrying his point , for that is what it amounts to , Mr. Shaw will sacrifice reason , if necessary , fair play and art itself . He will exaggerate , contradict himself , cheat a little for his game , distort a scene , prolong a play beyond its inherent and plausible length , anything to win . On the surface , he is often mentally dishonest ; he runs in specious joints , specious argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning . But underneath he is honest and sincere ; he feels what lie feels , his conviction is genuine and propulsive ; and for it he is quite as willing to cheat himself as to cheat the argument . But where the artist in general will use sensuous appeal , poetic images , engaging tone and color , Mr. Shaw uses dialectic . He is a debater . The strength and weakness of his method are those of the debate method . His excitement is that of temperament and cre ? ative egotism . And so it may be said that Mr. Shaw 's writings have changed the permanent beliefs of very few people , and that he has contributed little to the store of ideas . But that he has done much to agitate ideas is another matter . In all his debates on every subject , marriage , sex , war , vivisection , society and the rest , his one continuous im ? pulse and lasting conviction is the necessity for keeping all social and intellectual standards and forms in the bal ance ; for testing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and value for each one of us . To this agitation he has brought all the powers and ' delights of his mind , his observation , wit and lively theatrical sense . These Shaw prefaces we no longer read for their ideas or contentions ; nor can they be said to have taken a very strong place in our opinions . In fact , we are not apt to read theth any more at all . But if we do pick them up and dip into them , we find ourselves still carried along by their directness in style , their agility , their fervor and acrobatics , their organization and brilliant contagion . We read them for the personality behind them and for the art . The controversy around medical doctrine and practice , inoculation and so on , that " The Doctor 's Dilemma " is arranged to exhibit , has , therefore , not much influence over us , though . may rouse simple souls to review their ideas about doctors and human frailty . But it is still alive with thc Shavian powers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dramatist , however ,
