txt " I 'd like to stay in this afternoon with you , mother , and you and I can have a cozy little time together , " said a small daughter one day not long ago , just as she left for school In the morning . The visiung friend registered disapproval , and when the child was gone she burst out : " Mary . that child is getting a mother complex . You should be very , very careful . " And a solemn look accompanied the words . " O , nonsense , Jane , " laughed her hostess . " She 's a naturally companionable child and we 're very congenial , and that 's all there is to it , " Sensible woman . But we 're not all as clear headed as that . Some of us are more easily confused in our think-. tag . A littleyknowledge is a dangerous thing in almost any field  --  medicine , phychology , the sciences . In fact , the more subtle and profound the subject , the more dangerous a mere smattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terminology , and some people are apt to feel that they have a working knowledge upon which they can base all sorts of con- ! elusions , to a misleading and often dangerous finish . This is especially true in applying some of the new philosophies , the new psychologies , to r children . Take , for instance , the use of psychoilanalysis in interpreting our children 's actions . It is , as its name implies , the analyzing of the psyche or soul  --  a profound , a difficult , a supremely delicate task . Because of certain aspects of the science It has caught the public eye and to a certain extent been popularized . People read a supperilcial article or two , let it color their understanding of their children , and go ' around feeling that some psycho-analytic goblin will get them If they do n't watch out . Unless you are seriouslyil thoughtfully studious about these subjects , it is safer for you to simply use your own common sense and your own first hand knowledge of human nature to solve the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
