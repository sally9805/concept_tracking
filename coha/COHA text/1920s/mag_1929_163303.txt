Mustafa Kemal Pasha , President of Turkey , the Ghazi , the Victorious One , retired last week to his model farm at Tchankaya near Angora for his annual vacation . Active , he was soon in the fields , mingling with the workmen , superintending the harvest , himself driving a snorting , clanking mechanical reaper . Only the Ghazi 's large panama hat showed the neighbors which were the laborers , which the Victorious One . <P> Later in the week Mustafa Kemal was awakened from a sound sleep by excited shouts , the clang of alarms . <P> " Hurry , Master ! " cried a secretary . " The Fish Bazaar is on fire ! " <P> Rushing in his car toward Angora the Ghazi saw that it was true . Jutting high above a dusty plain is the ruined citadel of Angora .

Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackling flames , lighting up the plain . For hours the Ghazi worked shoulder to shoulder with firemen , policemen , soldiers . The acrid smoke of burning buildings mingled with the smell of burning fish . By morning it was seen that fire had gutted 500 houses , one hotel , three khans ( caravansaries ) and a mosque . Since meat , vegetables , almost all food is sold in the " Fish Bazaar , " Angora suffered a serious food shortage until the strenuous Ghazi rushed supplies up from Constantinople . <P> Just prior to embarking on his strenuous vacation , President Kemal had put finishing touches to the new Turkish tariff . Last week U. S. Commercial Attache Julian E. Gillespie cabled details vital to U. S. exporters : <P> 1 ) High protective duties tending to the virtual exclusion of luxuries : perfumes , jewelry , silks , high-grade woolens , haberdashery , high-priced automobiles . <P> 2 ) All articles not specifically mentioned in the tariff to be subject to a 40% ad valorem duty , instead of the present 20% . <P> 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coffee , tea , spice , candles , soap and sacks , to be abolished , the amount being included in the tariff instead . <P> 4 ) Agricultural implements , and other " commodities used in developing Turkish industry and agriculture " to be duty free .
