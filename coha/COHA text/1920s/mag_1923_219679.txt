It was announced by Chairman Albert D. Lasker of the Shipping Board that the Leviathan ( formerly Vaterland ) will leave New York for Southampton and Cherbourg on July 4 . Not only will she make her first trip since receiving the $10,000,000 alterations which have equipped her for passenger service ; she will go forth now as the largest vessel ever afloat . Hitherto the Majestic , a British ship ( formerly the Bismarck ) was the largest vessel , with a registered tonnage of 56,551 and a length of 915.5 feet . The Shipping Board announces , however , that on account of alterations on the Leviathan-chiefly because of changing her from a coal burner to an oil burner-her tonnage is now 59,956 , an increase of 5,674 tons over her previous rating . The Shipping Board also adds that the Leviathan is 950.7 feet long-which would mean that somehow she had grown 43 feet longer than her former length of 907.6 feet . The Leviathan will soon leave Newport News , where she is being reconditioned and go to Boston for dry-docking and taking aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , etc . There will follow in June a trial trip to Guantanamo to test her new oil engines and train her personnel of 1,500 men .
