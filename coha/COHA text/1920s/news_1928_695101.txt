txt " Although a stern chase is always a long one , 1 do not see any reason why our gross for the full year should not be about even with that for last year . which was a good , normal year . " said W. B. Storey , president of the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Railway system . " Even if we do n't quite catch up . we will not starve . Our passenger business is still declining , and for the first four months of 192S was about 32,000,000 behind 1927 ; but I think we ought to recover later on the decrease in freight business thus far . The wheat crop in our territory will be as good as last year . and may be better . The probabilities arc it will be better . The crop last year was not short as compared with normal years . but was short as compared with the year before . Kansas may go to 140.000,000 bushels . In Atchison territory the crop outlook is generally good . although in the southwest cornrr of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy . Off our ti es there are parts of the state where the situation is not so good . There will be a normal crop In Oklahoma Texas is not a big wheat state . Cotton ' Possibilities Normal " As far as we can see now , the cotton possibilities in Texas are normal . Texas had a good yield last year and got good prices because of shortages elsewhere . The cattle situation is good , and apparently will be good for some time . Pastures are in good shatIe ; rains have been plentiful ; prices seem to be pretty fair . I do not see enough improvement in the oil situation to amount to anything . " There has been a lack of rain in southern California this year and for that matter all over the state , but it is not serious enough to affect the crops . It may have an effect on ground water . Southern California relies on irrigation and will be able to make its crops all right . Some fruit crops , such as cherries , plums and certain others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citrus movement this year was not as great as a year ago , being 3,000 or 4,000 cars behind , but the crop nevertheless was good , prices were good . and every one seems happy . Next year 's citrus crop can not yet be estimated ? as it is all in bloom now . " Lumber movement is not up to a year ago , but that industry is still not so badly off . " As a consequence of these withdrawals and some increase in the reserve requirements of member banks , there was a large increase in member bank borrowing at the Reserve banks , and the volume of discounts in May was larger than at any other time in the past four years . Heavy indebtedness of member banks at the Reserve banks was accompanied by a rise in open-market rates , and particularly in the rate on call money . Discount rates at the New York , Philadelphia , Cleveland , Atlanta and Dallas Reserve banks were raised in May from 4 , k to 41. i. % , and this rate is now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demands for Discounts " The relatively large contraction in member bank credit necessary to bring about any considerable decline in the demand for Reserve bank credit has an important bearing on credit policy . During recent months increasing pressure on member banks through gold exports , security sales by member bank credit . The policy of the Reserve banks , however , has resulted in greatly increasing the indebtedness of member banks to the Reserve banks . In the middle of May discounts by the Reserve banks for member banks amounted to $800,000,000 , the largest amount in more than four years , and in addition the Reserve banks held $350,000,000 in acceptances purchased from the member banks and from dealers . This growth in member bank indebtedness has been widespread , ailecting member banks , not only in New York City and in other leading cities , but also in smaller communities . Advances in rediscount rates and in buying rates on bills , furthermore , have increased considerably the cost of member banks of their indebtedness to the Reserve banks . This higher cost of Reserve bank credit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously in debt at the Reserve banks exert a continuous pressure on the member banks . That these banks , in turn . pass the pressure on the borrowing public is evidenced by the rise in open-market money rates and the closer scrutiny to which many loans are subjected . Unless a chance occurs in the direction of gold movements , or in the open-market policy of the Federal Reserve System , the only means by which the member banks will be able to reduce their debt at the Reserve banks is a sale of investments or a gradual contraction of their loan account .
