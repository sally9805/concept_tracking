Georges Carpentier was once a great boxer . Slender and genteel , he lambasted British plug-uglies in Paris sporting clubs ; and proved that although he wore an orchid in the evenings and received perfumed notes in the mornings he could hit hard and dodge adroitly . Last week for nine seconds Carpentier lay on his face in a ring in Philadelphia . At ten he got up . With his eyes glazed , his ears ringing , a cut in his cheek , and his nose oozing like a broken bottle he summoned the wraith of his courage and flailed , thumped , jabbed , socked , lashed at one Thomas Loughran , mick . Loughran won the decision . But the Philadelphia clients who saw the Frenchman helped to his corner glanced at each other in solemn agreement on an important fact : Carpentier is still a game boxer .
