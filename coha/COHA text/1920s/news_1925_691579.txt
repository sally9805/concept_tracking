txt Governor Smith summoned today the Legislature to meet in extraordinary session Monday evening , June 22 , to consider exclusively the $6,000,000 appropriation bill to further the State Park program . which was lost when the Governor vetoed the Thayer bill seen after the Legislature adjourned . At the same time the Governor announced plans for putting the whole project before the people of the State when at 10 o'clock , Daylight Saving Time , tomorrow night , he will have a half hour in front of a microphone connected with the WGY broadcasting station and tell his side of the park situation . The call for the extra session had been expected for some time by those close to the Governor . Ever since the Republican leaders who conferred with him recently refused to accept his program it had been talked about the Capitol that Mr , Smith had not abandoned a plan for a special session . His recent illness postponed the matter for a time . but he announced the definite call today after a long conference with Robert Moses , President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Conservation Commission . George IC , Morris , ** State Chairman , who was in Albany when the call was issued , wired the information to Senator Wadsworth at Washington . and conferred with Senator John Knight , leader - , of the Republican majority in the Upper house . Says Bill W111 Be Repassed . ? Mr. Morris said this afternoon that the Legislature probably would repast ' the Thayer bill which the Governor Vetoed . " We welcome a special session , " he said , " as much as , and perhaps more than , those who called it . We are just as anxious that the people have parks . but what we are chiefly concerned with is that control of park land purchase be vested in the State Land Board . " ' After his conference this morning with Mr. Moses the Governor said : " I have decided to call the Legislature in extraordinary session Monday night , June 22 , at 8 o'clock , at which session I will deal exclusively by message with the subject of State parks . " Mr. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be mounted on his desk tomorrow night he will lay before the people of the State the whole State errks subject . Trouble Began Last Session . The park controversy arose during the last days of the 1925 session of the Legislature , when the Republican leaders refused ' flatly to pass a bill giving the State Council of Parks complete jurisdiction over the acquisition of land for park purposes . Instead , the Legislature sent to the Governor the Thayer bill . appropriating $6.000,000 and vesting this authority in the State Land Board . ' Republican leaders say they can see no reason at this time that would cause the majority to change their views on the subject . Governor Smith declined tonight to discuss the matter . Senator Knight , in a statement regarding the special session , said tonight : " We regret the mistake of the Governor in vetoing the Park bill has forced him to call an extra session of the Legislature . " The bill as passed provided for the approval of park land purchases by the Land Board . The position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruaintaintid . We have never opposed the park program as authorized by the vote of the people . We strongly favor it . The bill as passed appropriated every dollar asked by the commission for park purposes . " City . Bepablicane still oppose Smith . Of . the two Republican Senators and nine Republican Assemblymen representing districts in this city , the probability is that a majority , 11 not all , will stand with the Republican organization leaders in opposition to Governor Smith 's demand for elimination of the Land Board as controlling factor in the purchase of land for park purposes , at the extraordinary session of the Legislature . According to Samuel S. Koenig , Chairman of the New York County Republican Committee , Republican lawmakers representing districts in Manhattan will be found lined up against Governor Smith 's proposal . One of the two Republican Assemblymen from Brooklyn ? Robert C. Shepherd of the Fifth Dis- , trict  --  said he voted against the Governor 's plan at the regular session , but was willing to " listen to reason " if any good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board out in the park land purchase plan . L'elwarcl B. Fay of the Seventeenth District in Kings said he would stand pat on his vote , at the regular session cast against the Governor . In Queens , the only ? thee ? borough which has Republican representation in the Legislature . the two Republican Assemblymen representing the Fourth and Sixth District , it was stated- last night . would - stand ? wail-the -ouga3iiilt1011.in their votes at the special session . The lone Republican Senator from Queens , John L. : Carle , could not be reached last night He voted for the organization bill at the regular session . So far it is not apparent that Governor Smith has succeeded in actually winning . over any Republican support , with the exception of the two Senators and five Assemblymen from Westchester. which county would come in for a large slice of the $6,000,000 which would become available if the Governor and the Legislature could get together on the proposed park legislation . Friends of Governor Smith are " hopeful " of getting some votes from Nassau County and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be reasonably assured of the support of the Republican Assemblyman from Cattaraugus County . In order to prevail the Governor will be required to win over for Ms proposal four Republican Senators and twenty-two Republican Assemblymen . While there has been some talk of supPort by the seven Republican Assemblymen and two of the three Republican Senators from Erie , recent reports indicate that the Erie delegation will stand with the party organization against the Governor . Republican leaders here are looking forward with tense curiosity and some apprehension to the Governor 's radio appeal this evening . They admit that , as was the case when the $300,000.000 bond issue for the elimination of grade crossings was before the Legislature , a forceful presentation by the Governor of his side might result in irresistible presewe being brought to bear on Republican lawmakers by constituent in localities which would be benefited by enactment of the legislation the Governor has demanded . SAYS PUBLIC MUST HAVE SHORE PARKS Long Island Commission Sees Isolation of Great Estates Less and Less Possible . The Long Island State Park Commission made public its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and ? discussing the ' rights of the recreation-seekint public and the owners of private estates . The commission said : " From Cape May to Florida the coast is of such a nature as to be undesirable for recreational development except at some isolated point here and there . What is happening to the Florida coast is a matter of common knowledge because of the almost unbelievable rise in the price of land which has taken place in the last decade . The remarkable thing about Florida is not so much that this development has taken place , but that it has not taken place before , when the enormous population of the country east of the Mississippi is considered in relation to the small area of desirable waterfront coast land far enough south to afford Winter recreation . " All of which means that the shore front of Long Island , happily temperate in climate , will at no distant time be a priceless asset to the State of New York . As the population grows , as the ratio of urban over rural dwellers becomes steadily greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , public sentiment rightly becomes more insistent not only upon resisting encroachment by private interests upon public land , but upon the establishment of more recreational breathing spaces . The shore front of Long Island is of enormous potential future value to the State of New York , because with the exception of a few miles of littoral in Westchester County and the harbor of New York City the State 's only shores upon salt water are to be found on Long Island . " Much Land Pre-empted . After describing the waterfront park Possibilities of Long Island in greater detail , the report continues : " Earlier appreciation by private Interests of the desirability and value of accessible shore land in Nassau County within commuting distance from the city has resulted in the pre-emption of the ocean front on the south and for considerable stretches on Long Beach , Fire Island and beyond , and on the South Shore far into Suffolk County . This shore land is so closely held by private estates , dubs , suburban developments and institutions that there are no shorefront parks worthy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water upon public roads has been denied to the public by proprietary interests . This has resulted in a situation fast becoming intolerable , especially on Saturdays , Sundays and holidays . " Urban and inland suburban dwellers in ever-increasing numbers swarm over the narrow and congested roads and lines , trespass upon private property , sometimes leaving litter and depredation in their wake in their zeal for ' a day in the country . ' Protests by the land owners are as unavailing as they arc increasing . Closing old reads and rights of way to the shore by establishing new village governments or by other devices and the employment of re ivate watchmen do not cure the trouble , bat often foster greater irritation . The town and village parks , pitiUly few and small , are wholly inadediate even for local residents . and efforts to discriminate against non-residents are not successful . Semi-public beaches are also crowded arid unsatisfactory . All this refers Primarily to excursionists and motorists . The presaure for camping space is now also beginning to be felt . ' Here is hut one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Public parks of decent size with ready access to them roust be provided . Sees Isolation Diminish . " It is not the purpose of this report to criticize those who in recent years Past built homes or estates upon the shores of Nassau County , seeking at one and the same time the advantages of the country within close proximity to the city . We merely wish to point out that the means so far adopted by them to secure isolation from their city and suburban neighbors have been anything but effective and will be even less so in the future , as pressure to get to the shore increases and as available shorefront diminishes . " Steps taker . to acquire Deer Range Park were described by the commission in a discussion of the controversy which has raged on that subject . This was as follows : " The commission , after surveying the property , found it admirably adapted for the purposes public park , field headquarters and permanent game sanctuary . In the Autumn of 1924 the commission , after long negotiations . bad reached an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title to take an option to purchase it for the sum of aaa0.000 . The understanding thus reached , however . was never carried out , because tire stockholders of the corporation . repudiating the agreement reached by its officers with the . State , voted instead to sell it to a group of private interests who opposed a public park in this location and proposed to put the property into real ? estate development . As this sale was being carried into effect the commission , after a hearing before the Governor , took steps to acquire the property by entry and appropriation in order that It might he aecured by the State before the plan fc develop it as a real estate Proposition was effectuated . The commission 's act was resisted by the purchasers in the courts by litigation which is pending at the present tittle . " . The commission listed the following factors which should govern the seleciton of park sites on Long Island : Availability , accessibility , location with reference to other parks , conservation and game preservation and cost .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
