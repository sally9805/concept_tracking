EVERY now and then , a man ? or , , more often , a woman ? seems to 4 sum up and , as it were , crystallize a period in so salient and challenging a way that one can , for the first time , recognize its general nature and significance . That , anyhow , was my impression when , this winter , I met Hester Johnson again in New York . I had not seen Hester for fifteen years , and at first I did not recognize her . In her abbreviated and attenuated skirts , with a shingled head of glossy and perfectly waved fairness , she was exactly like hundreds of other modern young females , and , like them , a being whose age could not be guessed . Women seem , in shearing their hair and uncovering their legs , to have discovered a passport to universal youth . Perhaps that is why the older generation objects and emits vague mutterings about men looking at pink stockings . Certainly the space between knee and ankle bears little or no trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy the most skilful expert to guess the age of the limbs presented to his observation everywhere . Hester showed a great deal of stocking ; she looked younger than I had remembered her ; she looked , above all , just like everyone else . Certain tricks of speech and manner that belonged to the old Hester only made more striking the change that had passed over her in the years , and assimilated her completely to the 1927 type . I met her at a dinner party , a company of both sexes and various ages , though it would not have been easy to assign the right decade to any of the women . Twoof the men were not so young . Conversation was free , lively , and intimate . " I heard a story the other day that amused me , " said Hester . She glanced at the older of the two men as she spoke smilingly . " Yes ? " he said , observing her eye . " What is it ? You 're not afraid I might be shocked ? " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he continued . " My wife and daughters have cured me of that . " Hester , thus encouraged , proceeded with a narrative whose central incident was of what used to be called a very French type : it culminated in an expletive once confined to the stables . Everyone laughed . " Oh , that 's nothing , " said another woman . She proceeded to broaden the treatment . Hester capped her conte drOlatique with another , and the conversation moved , easily and freely , along what used to be called smoking-room lines . Needless to particularize the incidents or name the familiar key words that give to such conversation its characteristimIly modern note . There is a museum in Berlin which always comes in for mention . Everyone knows these conversations . In this milieu Hester Johnson was evidently entirely at home . I looked at her and marveled at the achievement of the whirligig of time . When I knew her formerly she was , as she is now , exceedingly pretty . She has lost none of her fair-haired bloom : retains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a trick of drooping them so that her long lashes make a fringe on her cheek , and then lifting them suddenly with an effect of innocent startling unconscious blueness that is even more surprisingly effective now than it was then . Fifteen years ago it was really innocent and unconscious , that upward glance of Hester 's . She was the shyest , most reticent , most completely inhibited young thing . Daughter of a Lutheran pastor somewhere in Wisconsin , she had the air of one just interrupted in reading her prayer book who finds the world presented to her both troubling and strange . She knew little or nothing . She was afraid of nearly everything . Her speech was a constant avoidance of words that might not be mentioned : her actions were conditioned by countless things that might not be done . One picked one 's expressions in talking to her and one 's friends in introducing them to her , for fear that she might be shocked . She was easily shocked . I took her to concerts , since nearly every play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , some incident that would not do . Concerts seemed safe : she knew little of music . Hester had a story . It was , in fact , that story which had caused her dreamy ingenn of a father to rouse himself to bring her to Europe , in order that she might forget it . Of course she said she never would forget . At the time she believed that , fully . It was a simple enough story . A few weeks before the date fixed for her wedding , her fianc ? had come to her and told her that he had received a call , couched in piteous language , to the deathbed of " another woman . " Hester 's delicacy would not allow her any more precision of description than that . " Of course I told him he must go . " I looked at her as she said this and recognized the self-sacrificial Puritan conscience , sure that what is disagreeable must be right . " Yes ? " I said feebly . She looked at me as though surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the end of it ? for me . " After a few minutes I plucked up enough courage to ask her whether she thought he cared for the " other woman . " " Oh , no ! It was not that kind of thing . " It was evidently the kind of thing to which no nice girl could refer ; and no nice young man either . Hester could not look at it : it turned her to stone . Her emotion was precisely that given by the dictionary as descriptive of shock ? recoil as with painful astonishment . She recoiled . She hid her eyes . She suffered ? as perhaps no girl of her age can suffer to-day . How long this suffering lasted I do not know . Certainly it was round her like a veil all the time she was in London ; and something in its obstinate intensity , its impenetrable texture made the girl interesting . She was still enfolded in it , dignified by it , when her father , deciding that Europe could do nothing for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that I do not know . There arc no marks of it on the unlined , unshadowed face Hester shows to-day . She has to-day a hard bright finish that seems more than skin deep . But who can penetrate behind the modern complexion , from which every trace of emotional ravage is smoothed by skilled fingers in a weekly " facial " ? Before the evening was over she came across to speak to me . She " joined on , " as they say , at once . " I am so glad to see you again , " she said . " Amusing how one always is . . . . I 've often wanted to see you and tell you I realize now what a darn fool I was about Richard . We 're great pals now and have had many a good laugh over my prudishness . . . . Oh , no , I did n't marry him . My first husband was a soldier ; Frank is in Wall Street . He suits me much better as a husband than Richard ever would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyhow . . . Do you know , I was shocked , at the time : really shocked . 1 ca n't understand it now . Nothing shocks me now . I almost wish it could . " She sighed , then smiled . " It would be a new sensation ? and they are so hard to get . " II Hester 's progress from being shocked by everything to being shocked by nothing is the typical progress of the modern maid or man . Immunity to the sensation of " recoil with painful astonishment " is the mark of our civilization , the sign of what we call our freedom . The criterion of an " advanced " community , as of an " advanced " individual , is its degree of incapacity for shock . Hester is a New Yorker . She might just as well be a citizen of Chicago , Berlin , Paris , London , or Vienna . A sort of value is given to her freedom and her advancement by her knowledge that regions exist across whose rudimentary and unema , neipated consciousnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful astonishment ; where people shudder with a delighted sense of daring when they see or read stories of " what goes on " in capital cities . There is a gap between the center and what in England and France are called " the provinces " ? a word for which American States-sensitiveness allows no precise analogue . But that gap is continually contracting . The papers and , above all , the magazines that enjoy a " nationwide " circulation , which are read on the Pacific Coast and in the West and South as well as in the East , imply shockability on every page . But their preoccupation with implying it , like their constant titillation of their public 's nerves , is more suggestive than their modesty or reticence . And when one passes from the fiction which describes what is supposed to be , to the news columns which record what is , one sees how thin is the veil . Facts are the same , at center and circumference . If Judge Ben Lindsey is to be believed , the young people of Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no oneimagines that Denver is peculiar . The only real difference between center and provinces is in freedom of reference to what goes on . It is an important difference . Talk is the key to life . The Revolution we now see going on in " unchanging " China has been preceded by a more fundamental revolution by which the speech of the people has conquered its literature . The use of the vernacular in printed books is the big transforming event there . The same thing has already happened with us . Modern speech has conquered modern literature . " Let me make a nation 's songs , " said a sage , " and I care not who makes its laws . " Our songs come from the revue and the music-hall , and they give us our dialect . That dialect , in its turn , is the most expressive index of our minds . Listen with a detached ear to a modern conversation , and you will be struck , first by the restriction of its vocabulary , and second , by the high proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the older jargon , " no lady could use . " Its staples are nouns and adjectives that in the days when Hester Johnson received her " shock " were considered unmentionable in polite society ; that were discreetly skipped when they occurred in the classics , and , in the " best " editions , were bowdlerized out of Shakespeare and the Bible . Most of these words belong to a common family : they are words describing the physical facts of life and , above all , the physical facts of the relations of the sexes . A better instance of the completely conversational modern novel than Ernest Hemingway 's successful The Sun Also Rises need not be asked for ; it is the perfect transcription . In it the word " bitch " ? for example ? occurs with wearisome iteration ; acts , indeed , as a sort of refrain There are other words in it of the same type ; and here , as elsewhere , the words used foretell and correctly previsage the action . Another instance of the same tendency may be cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet . " The passages which he put back for that version are , almost invariably , the passages that used to be cut out on grounds of " modesty . " " Hamlet " has to be cut for tolerable modern performance , to allow us time to eat our dinners ; but Barrymore chose his cuts on a perfectly modern principle . All the " broad " dialogue came back , and all the franker passages in Hamlet 's account to his mother of the precise nature of her relations with her husband . Anyone who looks up these passages will see what are the words I mean ; anyone who listens to a " modern " conversation will hear them all , ad nauseam , and hear them on the lips of ladies no less freely and frequently than on those of gentlemen . The same is true of another group of words that does excessively heavy duty to-day ? the more or less unmeaning expletives and " swear words " that have no real significance in this unbelieving age . They are all over the place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . In this so-called emancipation of speech women have been the pioneers . Among the trammels they have cast aside are those which belonged to the silence and reticence of their servitude , and to the ignorance which was its badge . Now , the wheel has come full circle . Once the measure of refinement , of cultivation , of belonging to the right set , socially and intellectually , was the possession of a delicacy that registered the largest variety and greatest number of shocks . The perfect lady was shocked by nearly every fact of life . Hardly any of them might be mentioned in her presence . A vocabulary wholly different from that prevalent among males had to be employed in her company ; even among males the upward movement in the social scale was marked by the elimination of direct phraseology and the pruning of expletives from speech , which proliferated in elegant circumlocutions , innuendoes , and veiled allusions . Death was described as " passing , " birth as an " interesting condition , " andso on . Talk became an ingenious game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the array of barbed-wire entanglements , bushes , and floral screens with which the scene was provided . The trail of this tradition still lies over public speech , leading articles , and provincial conversation . Emancipation , beginning as a refusal to admit that there are any words that may not be mentioned , has landed us , at present , in a curious imprisonment . The one-time unmentionables have become the staple of conversation . They are never off duty . Listen to any genuinely up-to-date group and you will hear the nouns and the expletives of the farmyard , the ring , the stable , and the trenches , almost to the exclusion of all others . Fifteen or so years ago Bernard Shaw was at great pains to unearth an authentic unmentionable . In his " Pygmalion " the utterance of the expletive " bloody " ? an adjective which , in London , punctuates the talk of the hundred-per-cent proletarian ? was intended to be the high note ; was designed to administer to the audience a genuine electric shock . Even at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect was only partial , and this although the word has the high merit of performing no function whatsoever and , therefore , of being charged with the highest associative and taboo potency . To-day , of course , the effect is lost . Eliza 's natural talk is nearer to the contemporary model than that which Professor Higgins endeavors to teach her , and the results on what was once the big scene are disastrous . There is no shock to he got out of the word . Yet it and others like it linger on as symbols of freedom long after they have ceased really to be anything but badges of a new servitude , a new restriction . We are so busy not being shocked that we do not see the fetters which our preoccupation imposes . The zest for the utterance of the onetime forbidden word , and its employment as a sign to one 's self and others that one is immune to the sensation of shock , has actually produced a sort of rigor mortis which is visibly affecting our language . Its growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment of words to meaning , is being arrested . The vocabulary actually employed by up-to-date persons is extraordinarily limited , and the limitation , as is natural , works back from words to ideas . The physical facts that used to be forbidden now dominate the scene , and the vocabulary refers almost exclusively to them . The medium of conversation being thus contracted , its subject contracts likewise . Words of precision , whether nouns or adjectives , are pale in comparison with the highly colored phraseology of open reference . Yet color , as every artist knows , is a matter not only of intensity but of value and relation . To use nothing but scarlet is not the means to a brilliant effect any more than is the employment of heavily leaded type all over a newspaper page . The effort to make everything salient defeats itself . So the over-emphasized high note of modern language ends in monotony ; the swear word or the stable word bores us . Yet we can not get back to greater range and freedom of language because the words that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . To admit any such scale is to admit the possibility of being shocked . That can not be allowed . To be shocked is out-of-date . To confess a capacity for it is to confess to provincialism . So , if a modern happens on a word that produces in him any faint reflection of that sense he immediately utters it , in as loud a tone as possible , by way of exorcism . Conversation consequently resounds with these words , and for all its blaring noise grows lifeless and dull : has no more music in it than the jazz band it resembles . If we have found the courage to admit that modern conversation , either actual or as reported in the novel , is dull , monotonous , and , in effect , colorless , we may carry that discovery over and apply it as at least a partial answer to the question , " What is wrong with the Stage ? " The question , to be sure , is dreadfully jejune ; there is a modicum of correction to be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone , " is not as good as it used to be . " " No " - so runs the reply ? " it never was . " So , no doubt , it is with our theater . The stage of the past looks to us more brilliant than it was ; the stage of to-day , poorer than it is . But its dullness today is of a special kind ; it is dull just in proportion as it struggles to be " lively . " The Censor is perturbed because it attempts , incessantly , to shock its audiences ; what he might more reasonably be troubled about is the fact that it can not possibly do so , for that is the root of the matter . The trouble is not that playwrights , producers , and managers are out for " dirt , " but that they are out to shock audiences who , as a matter of fact , are immune to the kind of shock they seek to give them . They can not be made to recoil with painful astonishment from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these are tried . You can see them in a dozen theaters in any metropolis to-day ? and see the audience utterly unmoved . Dramatists thoroughly involved in the effort to do " strong " things get " stronger " and " stronger " ; their audience 's reaction gets weaker and weaker . Shock of some sort or another is the dramatic weapon par excellence . What situation that can be put before an audience to-day will give it a shock , cause it to sit up and ask itself " Can this be ? " The method of " revelation " has been explored and exhausted . The dramatist , like the reformer , finds his armory bare or stocked with blunted weapons . It seems impossible to-day to rouse people by showing them what exists . They know . So in the theater one finds the plays of even such a master as Ibsen less moving , less effective than they used to be betruth expressed to me the other day in a remark by a young creature who said , almost plaintively , You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' business than I thought . " There is , if we think in terms of modern shock treatment . But it has escaped the notice , apparently , of our playwrights and novelists , who are , of course , of the same psychological make-up and have the same psychological background as their audience , that there is another kind of shock available to the artist ? the aesthetic . You can not show the up-to-date denizen of our exposed world a fact he does not know , least of all a physical fact ; but you might reveal to him a feeling . In order to do this , however , our writers and showmen must release themselves from physical preoccupations and transcend their belief that reality , being exclusively sensual , can be expressed in terms limited to the one-time unmentionables The desire to shock is its own enemy . IV Descriptive realism is to-day the formula of the stage and of the novel . They strive to represent the life of the time , and do so with a success of which their close resemblance to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked by what is . That never was useful reaction . It has become an obviously futile one . Not so long ago , one used to hear people saying , " Nothing shocks me " with a sort of timid bravado . It was , and they knew it , not quite true . They hoped that saying it would make it true . Their hope has worked . It has worked mainly because of the powerful assistance it has received from experience . The theater and the novel show us facts . Facts have overwhelmed us . Our standards , our theories , above all , our values have sunk and broken under their weight . This sense of overwhelming fact is at the root of modern " license " andwhat is more significant ? of the ennui which is its doom . Facts have , literally , proved too much for us . This has not happened in a minute . The old policy of averting the eye and withdrawing the skirt had begun to break down a generation ago . Hester Johnson , little as she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by negatives . For the old regime no one need feel any regret . Its false confusion between " decency " and concealment has much to answer for in constructive indecency . Young men and women brought up under its shadow found every natural impulse in themselves mysteriously tainted and suspect ; they had , or so it seemed to thousands of them , to choose between stultification and rebellion . The motions of breaking out of a strait-jacket inevitably lack elegance ; prisoners are not apt to put a. high value on discipline ; forbidden fruit nearly always looks nicer than it tastes . The stupidity of the old prohibition system brought its doom upon it . The young Scot whose faith collapsed after his first visit to the theater was typical ; he lost his belief in Heaven and Hell because he had been taught that the pit was the entrance to the latter , and smelled no brimstone when he entered it . So , in countless instances , the rigid unimaginativeness of the old morality , and its arid remoteness from natural impulse and blank conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with reality . Before , everything was wrong . After , nothing was . Hence , the progress of the refusal to be shocked has been rapid . Indeed , beginning as a refusal , it has become an incapacity . The field is now swept bare . The grandchildren of the generation that was shocked by everything are shocked by nothing . The " individual case " has destroyed the codes . " Divorce is wrong , " said the moralists . That view collapsed as soon as a concrete instance challenged it . Unknown divorcees ? yes , terrible people ; one 's friend ? oh , no . The trumpet brokedown the ramparts , and the army swarmed in . Then came the War . After that awful onset of fact there was nothing left . Certainly nothing to shock us . How could there be ? We " supped full with horrors " ? gloated over , even glorified them . For four years all the resources of publicity were turned on the revelation of the things in ourselves and in our lives that , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , the imperfectly repressed and barely controlled instincts of the primitive beast within the civilized man were called forth , commended , even worshipped ; a new philosophy arose to assure us that those instincts alone were " real , " and a new psychology came to its support with the suggestion that any attempt to control them was dangerous to mental balance . The physical swept the rational completely off the board . Today " direness , familiar to our slaughterous thoughts , can not once start us . " How could it ? The War is , so we say , over . Yet its consequences are in our blood . Cruelty and instability have become part of the air we breathe . The statistics which show one divorce in every eight marriages range themselves with other statistics to form a colorless presentment of facts we all know by contact . Who now , after a brief absence , rings up a household with any confidence that no permutations or re-combinations have taken place , in the interval , among its inmates ? Who feels any security in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ? The things that used to be the incredible substance of drama , that happened to other people but did not happen to us , now happen to all of us . Hester Johnson is typical , although the outline of her story has an unusual simplicity . Once she was shocked , nay stunned , by the discovery that her Richard was " like other young men . " Now she would deride the assumption that any young man existed who was not . Moreover , she claims and exercises the right to behave in the same way herself . Why not ? V The answer to that question is not easy , nor is it to be found along the line of any attempt to recapture the sensation of being shocked that we have lost . Rather must we look for it in the results of immunity to shock ? above all in the one universal result . That is boredom . Tedium is the surprising achievement of our freedom , our knowledge , our advance . It broods over our stage , over our fiction , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as a personal right to touch , taste , and handle everything ? that , to-day , is the banner under which the army of the unsatisfied march to defeat . In its name they Maim the right to do everything , say everything , know everything . It is the will-o ' - the-wisp which carries them on , over swamp and quagmire , through wreckage and disillusionment , perpetually seeking ? something which they do not find . They do not find it partly because they are in too much of a hurry to determine what it is that they are hurrying after ; partly because they have , in advance , cast aside any and every principle of selection . Any experiment is in their view an experience . They think of it as of something external ; they imagine that life is made up of experiences and , hastening from one to the next , with little or no sense of differentiation , deny to any the possibility of teaching them what they say that they want to know . For experience is intensive , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the circumstances that surround it , is a function of the experiencer rather than of the thing experienced . It is a flavor which gluttony misses as surely as does undiscriminating hunger . Abstinence rather than eating creates appetite ? in spite of the proverb . Our reaction to the old morality has , really , been far too simple . Like children , we have assumed that nothing is worth eating but the forbidden fruit ; and we eat it , till we are sick of it , and talk about it , as if the world contained nothing else . We have , if we are to be honest about it , merely exchanged one convention for another . Our grandparents could not mention the " facts of life . " We can mention nothing else . Our expression is their repression , stood upon its head , that is all . Sex is not the only fact in life , although it was the one that they decided to say nothing about . Nor is sex limited to its physical expressions , although those were the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more in the spirit of man , than " facts " can cover or express . If we are to escape from boredom , we must retrieve some power of resistance to facts , some recognition of forces within ourselves , must recover , in a word , the capacity to select and to choose . We have submitted , helplessly , to things , have denied the existence of mind and its power over matter . Things now stifle us . We gape at them , and can not so much as organize them in a series . Any and every system of values has been abandoned , because a particular one seemed to play us false . Because we lack the energy to say that anything is wrong , we can not achieve the vision of anything that is right . Our color spectrum has been shortened , and by ourselves . We have stared at red till blue , green , violet , orange , yellow , elude us . We need to rub our eyes and look again .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
