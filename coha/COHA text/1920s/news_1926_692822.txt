txt William Richardson , army deserter and self-styled bad man , returned last night to Fort Monmouth , formerly Camp Vail , to pay off old scores . He hailed a taxicab in Newark and told John Cogan , the driver , to take him to Oceanport , near here , but Cogan did not know where that was , and said he would have to consult his boss . The night before the deserter had driven to Fort Monmouth from Jersey City in a cab belonging to the Tube Taxi Company , and when Frank Miller , the driver , tried to collect his fare he found himself looking into the barrel of a regulation army automatic . That . Miller was informed , was how Richardson was in the habit of paying his debts . Richardson then forced ' the taxi driver to disrobe. took his clothes , money and jewelry , and after beating him on the head with the butt of the pistol , left him . Several hours later Miller found his way into camp and reported the occurrence . The military authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially as Millet said that the robber " stuttered awful ' Cogan 's boss . Joseph Maass of 431 Main Street , Newark , however , knew nothing of Miller 's experience . The job looked all right and he accepted . and besides , some friends of his were fishing from the Long Branch pier . Mazza had wanted to go along , but had missed them . He told Richardson that if he did n't mind he would accompany him . Richardson was willing and Mazza climbed into the cab . Suspicious of His Fare . The drive to Long Branch was a long one because they got lost once , and it was almost daybreak when they arrived . They drove to the camp at Richardson 's request , but then he decided he would go home . He directed Cogan to a house OD the outskirts of Long Branch . where he said he lived . Mazza , however , became suspicious . and insisted on accompanying Richardson to the house . Mazza knocked at the - boor . A sleepy farmer , with a pistol in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson did not live there and ordered them to leave his property . Mazza grew angry . He accused Richardson of trying to beat his fare . But the latter assured him that it was a mistake and that he would take them to his home . He ordered Cogan to drive to another house , but there the same scene was enacted . Then Mazza threatened Richardson with arrest , whereupon the deserter backed through a hedge and started running up the road . Cogan and Mazza followed in the cab and as they drew abreast of Richardson , Mazza dropped from the running board of the taxi . Cogan saw Richardson draw a pistol and fire , and Mazza dropped with a bullet through his stomach . Lifting him into the cab , Cogan took Mazza to the Long Branch Hospital , where his condition was said to be critical . Meanwhile First Lieutenant Joseph Parrot , the camp provost officer , was in his room . He had just returned from a party at the home of some friends and had been unable to sleep . Hearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned as if a shoulder bad been pushed heavily against it . " Who 's there ? " Parrott demanded . He heard some one run stealthily down the corridor outside , and he went back to bed believing it to be a prank of some fellow officers . Bloodhounds on Trail . As soon as Mazza reached the hospital officials there telephoned County Detective Ameriga Sacco . Only the morning before Sacco and State Trooper John Diver had been discussing the Miller case , and the similarity in the ishooting of Mazza and the Miller asI sault caused Sacco to communicate with Diver at once . The trooper advised Sacco that Sergeant Tighe would come with him and that they would bring bloodhounds . It was Eiger daylight when they I reached the hospital . The bloodhounds were taken to the scene of the shooting and given the scent from a newspaper which Richardson had carried . They started at once for Fort Monmouth . Sergeant Tighe went on ahead to the fort . While this was going on , First Lieutenant Oliver Francis of the Marine Corps , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking his daily cross-country run . Near a clump of woods a few hundred yards west of the fort he met a man wearing a straw hat who inquired the time . It was Richardson . As Francis reached for his watch the man thrust an automatic at him and said with a sneer : " So you 're , Parrot ? Well , I 've been looking for you , and I 'm going to bump you off . " Francis replied that he was not Lieutenant Parrot , whereupon the man said , " Well . anyway . I need some money . How much cash have you got ? And let 's have your watch and ring . " At the point of his pistol the deserter forced Lieutenant Francis into the woods and made him take off all his clothes . Then he compelled the Lieutenant to jump into an abandoned well fifteen feet deep , and as he piled fragments of fallen trees and debric over the opening , Richardson said : Threatens Him With Death . " I 'm going to taunt for Parrot now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay where you are until I get bark I wo n't hurt you , but if you try to get away I 'll kill you , too . " About fifteen minutes later Lieutenant Parrot was on his way to mess . The rear door of the officers ' quarters looks down a road leading from the fort to the main highway between Eatontown and Long Branch , and gritting the road from the fort is a ravine . The Lieutenant 's attention was was drawn to a man wearing a straw hat who wa smelting his way carefully along the ravine toward the camp . As the man drew near Lieutenant Parrot recognized him as Richardson . He knew Richardson well . Before the latter deserted two months ago , Lieutenant Parrot had been compelled on one or two occasions to put him in solitary confinement . As the man with the straw hat drew nearer , Lieutenant Parrot saw clearly that he was Richardson . Not daring to trust him out of sight , the officer called to Corporal Pickles of the guard and ordered him to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , Lieutenant Parrot began trailing his man . Richardson headed toward the Central Railroad of New Jersey tracks , evidently bent upon getting a train . Starts to Run Away . A crane was working at the railroad drawbridge over Oceanport Creek , and all trams were being stopped there . Apparently Richardson was cognizant of the fact 4 .. r.d planned to board a train . but as he started along the tracks he looked back and saw Lieutenant Parrot . The deserter started to run and the Lieutenant called to John L. Bottles , a trainman , who was approaching , to stop Richardson , but as oBtties blocked his path Richardson whipped out his pistol and yelling " Get out of my way , damn you , ' waved the weapon at him . Bottles closed in and grasped Richardson'a arm just as Lieutenant Parrot came up behind and grabbed the deserter . Richardson dropped his pistol and faced about . " Hell , " he observed , " it 's you , is it ? I was looking for you . That 's why I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I guess you 're too late , Richardson , " the Lieutenant replied . " It seems I 've got you . " Richardson was taken to the hospital wii-ere both Mazza and Cogan identified him . Then , since Government prisoners can not be turned over to the civil authorities without special permission from Wasnington , Richardson was taken back to the fort . In the guardhouse he began to exhibit signs of insanity . He battered his head against the wall . Seizing a drinking glass , he crashed it on the floor , picked up a fragment and tried to cut his throat . Six sentries were called to quiet him . Fearing that he might attempt to hang himself , the authorities ordered him strippea of all but his underclothing . Five minutes later a sentry , peering through the door of the guardhouse , found Richardson hanging from the rafters by his undershirt . They cut him down , took away the remainder of his clothing and left him naked , with hands manacled behind his back . Lieutenant Francis was missed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he came walking into camp an hour later . Then he told of his meeting with Richardson . After Richardson left the Lieutenant climbed the fifteen feet to the top of the well by bracing himself with his feet against the sides , but he found the weight of the debris Richardson had heaped at the top of the opening too great for him to remove . So he began scooping away dirt from the sides with his fingers . He finally made an aperture large enough , to crawl through . Boasts of Murders . While his money and jewelry were recovered . the old uniform which Lieutenant Francis wore when he was accosted by Richardson has not been found , even though a large searching party spent the remainder of the day in the woods hunting for it . The police are convinced that Richardson has a cache somewhere in the woods , and that if is found quantities of jewelry stolen from homes in the vicinity may be recovered . They also plan to drain the well tomorrow to ascertain whether his boasts of murder are correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Monmouth last January . From the first he had been unpopular with the men . He posed as a bad man and was the camp bully . No one was sorry when three months later a communication was received from Washington saying that Richardson had deserted a few years previously from Fort Bragg . Thg deserter was immediately transferred to the guard house , but even there , despite his past , he was unpopular . He had been in the guard house about two months when he was sent one day to the Post Hospital to be treated for a splinter in the foot . With Richardson went Private Hilbert W. Olmstead . Neither returned to the fort that night . Their disappearance was cause for much speculation . Richardson had often boasted that he would not hesitate to " knock off " sentry if it meant a chance of getting away Olmstead explained that Richardson had wrested his pistol from him and had forced him to accompany him " over the hill "  --  the army term for desertion . Since then , Olmstead said in the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been gone for more than the allotted thirty days Olmstead also is being sought as a-deserter.
