txt I thought you might like to know how I was getting along rattling around in Uncle Dick 's shoes , so before I open the composite mail I 'll drop you a few Ines . There is more work ? all right , but one does : et a day off , while of course I work seven days . week for you even if you do say that every day is day off the way I work for you , Which of course snit very nice for you to say , but I know you do n't ' calls , menu IL 2 have n't had- very many squawks yet- from Jncle Dick 's readers , but I suppose they will come , mcause as you know I 'm not much on the highmow thing and I am sport-minded , so they 're geting their fill of sporting topics . Still , It may be mod for them , on our theory that if a person is n't nterested in some branch of ; port there 's somehing wrong with them . Well , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which you were in'Red but could n't go because you had to work . rhat 's where B. H. L. 's day off came in handy for no and I had several unique experiences . You me , we played in foursomes , and in our foursome were Ben Marshall , Bill Dewey , and a member of um editorial staff who never likes his name mentoned , either becatfse of modesty or the size of his score  --  I never was sure which . For this event they auctioned off the foursomes and ours happened to come first . None of us bid , secause we know how much we were worth . The first kid was " Thirty cents , " which was about sight , but because we were first and they wanted lo get the pool started bidding was lively , and finally we were sold to Charlie Crane for 8200 . I suppose Charlie thought some one else would bid again , but they did n't , and he was stuck . But that 's not the worst of it . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , have to work overtime nights to build , a couple extra elevators or something to get even , so we took ' half of It off his hands . Now , I received your note that Mr. Derringer of the auditing de . partrnent says R. H. L. had no expense account , so how can I charge that 25 smackers to " good will , " and if It was n't good will , what was ft ? Ben Marshall is an architect and a good golfer ordinarily , but he was an excavator that day , and Bill Dewey 's putts were contrary , and the editorial staff chap was off his game , and I had 108 , and they asked me not to tell their scores , but 1 was n't high man , so we had a fine chance . for the ; 3,300 pool . There were lots of fellows there you know . Fred Sterling Was one , and of course every one called him " Governor , " because Gov . Emmerson could n't come . Well , Fred introduced me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how much salary he got and ho told me , and I said it was n't enough , and he asked how much salary you paid me , and I told him , and he said it was n't enough . So we had a nice time together . Of course , I 'm not telling you this as a hint to you and " Gov . " Sterling , because you know I 'm satisfied , but I Just thought you ought to know about it Well , for dinner we went down the path from Sheldon 's house to Emil Wetten 's barbecue kitchen , and John , Stevenson and TIM Groner ; recited and sang , and there wan lots of entertainmet , Charlie Glore was there , too , but he dld't play golf , because he has quit golf for polo , because he says the polo ball is larger and easier to hit , but it his polo Ponies do n't run faster than the horses I bet on at Lincoln Fields I do n't sea how he ever get 's . up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie told me of a stock which still is going up 100 points , but for the life of me I ca n't remember the name . If I could we 'd each buy 5 shares and have 8500 when you go on your vacation to Florida in February and I have my expected nervous prostration at the same time . Maybe I can remember the name of the stock later . I suppose you read the prize list . Well ; funny thing , Phil Roamer and Charlie Eddy , . who won prizes , were in my foursome last year , so next year I suppose Ben Marshall and . =ill Dewey will win prizes . Evan Evans was there , tee , Don , and he still re . members that day at Arlington when you and I gave him Blanc Seing and it : - Won at 15 to 1 , and he thinks we 're smart follows , which Is worth remembering , as he 's the only chap I know who thinks I 'm a smart fellow around a race track . Well , I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny little " cubes which looked rather difficult . Anyway , 1 was n't nearly as tired as last year , when 1 took a nap in the locker room to get rested for the long drive home . Sheldon said to tell you he 'd expect you next year . Well , Don , that 's how I spent my week end , and now to work for another week . Regards . LziARVErT T. ' Woos:mum P. S. : By the way , do I get any world series tickets ? Ralph Bond phoned and said that at Sheldon 's party I promised to get him two , but I 'm sure ho must be mistaken  --  because it was n't that kind of a party  --  you know what I mean ,
