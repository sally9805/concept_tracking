AUTHOR 'S NOTE " Pearl of Dawn " was written to provide a pictorial one-act play , neither tragic nor highfalutin , which might afford opportunity for rapid movement and adventure in a small compass of time and space . I have therefore placed the story in a period and a country about which the rising generation knows comparatively little , and have deliberately shifted the action constantly from street to shop or palace and back again . Scenically , the street is a painted front curtain , and the shop a cyclorama drape . The palace scene is simply the shop , with different light , and its properties changed . SCENE ONE : A Street in Bagdad . Night . HAZAN ( comes down the street , making his way with difficulty , swaying with weakness . His clothes are shredded to ribbons . He has bandaged himself , here and there , with fragments of his garments ) Allah , be merciful ! Let me die ! Let me die ! Allah  --  ( He falls unconscious . ) ALI ( runs out , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to rouse him . ) HAZAN ( sprawls on his face , and his back , upon which no clothing remains , is revealed striped with marks of a whip. ) p. 3 ALI Ah , poor man ! Poor man ! HAZAN ( recovering consciousness , rolls over on his side , looks up ) Ali ! ALI What , you know me ? Who are you ? HAZAN You do not recognize me ? I am Hazan . ( He faints again . ) ALI Hazan , good brother ; wake again . It is I , Ali , Ali . I do n't remember which wife it is whose brother you are , but I know you . Come , wake up , dear brother , you are much too heavy for me to carry . ( Nevertheless , he manages to pick up Hazan and stagger out with him , leaving his lantern behind . ) HAROUN AL RASCHID ( enters from the opposite direction , with his Vizier , who carries a lantern ) You say the man who carried him into that shop is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people call him . As he is a merchant  --  you may believe it if you like . HAROUN AL RASCHID Stop salaaming . I wish to remain incognito . So that is the man to whom they give my title ? Not Haroun al Raschid the Good , but Ali the good ! A merchant of women 's wear for a rival ! THE VIZIER The moon does not rival the sun , but reflects it . p. 4 HAROUN AL RASCHID But if he is called " the good , " why does he now give aid and comfort to a wretch who has been publicly whipped for violating his neighbor 's harem ? THE VIZIER Perhaps Ali 's own harem is a little too much for him . HAROUN AL RASCHID That is the most cynical thing you have said this evening . I shall have to present you with a brace of wives . THE VIZIER That is the most cynical threat you have made today . To keep you from remembering it , let me tell you that the man who was whipped is Ali 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was whipped for . His wives keep all the scandal to themselves . HAROUN AL RASCHID I should like to see this merchant sell his wares and yet earn his title of " the good . " THE VIZIER You should have that opportunity soon . The guardian of your harem asked me where your favorite might buy some silks this evening at a reasonable price and I told him of Ali 's shop . They may be there now . HAROUN AL RASCHID And be defiled by the presence of Hazan the unclean ! Let us go there quickly . ( They hurry off , Haroun taking Ali 's lantern . ) A patrol passes . The lights fade out . The scene changes. @x SCENE TWO : The Shop of Ali Through the open doorway at the back one sees the sky of early night . In the foreground a curtained divan is lighted by a small lamp concealed in the canopy . The center of the shop is lighted by a brass hanging lamp . Under it Ali 's wives are displaying silks to a veiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gigantic Nubian with a naked sword across one arm . THE ELDEST WIFE Lady , the silk is worth fifty pieces of silver , and it is yours for thirty . THE FAVORITE It does not interest me . THE YOUNGEST WIFE Lady , we could not cheat you . You are in the shop of Ali the good . THE ELDEST WIFE We are commanded to cheat no one and to speak to our customers no untrue word . THE YOUNGEST WIFE These are the commands of Ali the good . THE FAVORITE Is the merchant really so good ? THE ELDEST WIFE I , the eldest wife , acknowledge it . THE FAVORITE Then he must be good , indeed . Are you sure this silk is of the best quality ? THE YOUNGEST WIFE Lady , it is the jewel of China , whence it came . p. 6 ALI ( appears in the doorway carrying the unconscious Hazan ) One of you , a cup of water , quickly ! THE ELDEST WIFE But see , a customer , a great lady ! ALI But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a brother of one of you . Make haste ! ( He brings Hazan down to the curtained divan . ) THE YOUNGEST WIFE ( brings a cup of water . ) THE ELDEST WIFE ( attends to her customer , sereening her from seeing more of the intruder . ) THE FAVORITE Is that the merchant , Ali ? THE ELDEST WIFE Ali the good , lady . You must forgive him. He is so tenderhearted that he forgets all business to help any creature in distress . THE FAVORITE What a wonderful husband he must be ! THE ELDEST WIFE He is wonderful . Only sometimes we wish his heart would harden a little to the distress of others that he might take more thought for his own affairs . ALI ( taking the cup from the Youngest Wife ) Oh , he 's your brother ? p. 7 THE YOUNGEST WIFE Dear husband , do not call him my brother again.Let him tell you for what he was beaten . ( She rejoins the Eldest Wife . ) ALI ( lifts Hazan and gives him a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if you like . It is the will of Allah . ALI Why should I kill you , brother ? HAZAN Ah , it is you , Ali . Where have you brought me ? ALI To my house . HAZAN No , no ! You must not . ( Attempting to rise . ) My own sister , your youngest wife , would have me driven out . ALI What have you done , brother ? HAZAN I was found  --  in the harem of my neighbor . ALI With his  --  wives ? HAZAN His favorite . ALI Alas , brother , why did you do this ? HAZAN Ali , you are too good ; you do not know sin . ALI Do I not ? Have I not eyes , brother ? p. 8 HAZAN I do not know , myself , why I sinned . ALI That is sin , indeed . HAZAN Yes , I have sinned and I have been caught , wounded with swords and beaten with whips . Then , when the breath came back into my body they stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head before me so that I was blinded with her blood . Oh Allah ! Allah ! ( He weeps . ) ALI Shall I not arm you against them that did this ? HAZAN ( regaining some of his self-control ) No , dear brother ; it was done by decree of the Caliph , Haroun al Raschid the Good . ALI Alas , then your case is hopeless . HAZAN ( struggling up on one elbow , his eyes bright with fever ) No , it is not . ALI Indeed , I can see no hope for you . HAZAN Allah is merciful . I have learned it here in your shop . That is why he would not answer my prayers for death . That is why I shall leave your house at once with my wounds healed . ( He struggles to his feet . ) ALI A miracle ? p. 9 HAZAN The miraculous mercy of Allah ! Listen , brother  --  neither the sharp edges of the swords nor the blows of whips have robbed me of my golden hour . You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have been but a minute . It is written in the book of man 's life that such things shall not last long ; we should then lose our interest in heaven . And look  --  ALI Where , brother ? HAZAN Just before me . ALI I see nothing . HAZAN Ah , you can not see her , but I do , and I shall never lose sight of her image while I live . I shall go to the desert , where my disgrace will not be known , and her ghost will lead the way and comfort me . Allah is merciful ! ALI No ! Do not go ! THE YOUNGEST WIFE ( has come down to them with a bag and a large cloak ) Dear husband , I bring a cloak and food for this unfortunate man . You , dear husband , are Ali the merchant , and have a duty to your customers . Let the unfortunate man , who was my brother before his sin , go his way lest your customers think evil of Ali the good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , O Ali the good ! Let me go my way in peace . ( He puts on the cloak , takes the bag and starts for the door. ) p. 10 HAROUN AND HIS VIZIER ( enter the shop , coming down toward Ali . ) HAZAN ( turning in the doorway ) The blessings of Allah on this household ! ( Then to the moonlight outside . ) Lead on ! ( He leaves the shop . ) HAROUN AL RASCHID To whom did he speak the last words ? ALI To a ghost . The unfortunate man has sinned and suffered . HAROUN AL RASCHID Too bad , too bad ! ALI Is n't it , now ? HAROUN AL RASCHID Do n't you think the Caliph was too cruel ? ALI Yes , of course . He has to be . People expect it of a man in his position. I suppose that , personally , he is as merciful a man as any of us . THE VIZIER I am sure the Caliph would like to hear himself so well commended . HAROUN AL RASCHID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( simply ) I am the merchant , Ali . THE FAVORITE I have been shopping in the bazaar all afternoon , and I am very tired . I must rest . p. 11 ALI Conduct the lady to a place of rest . THE ELDEST WIFE ( leads the Favorite to the curtained divan . ) ALI ( to the Youngest Wife ) Show her silks . Do not lose the sale . Is coffee ready ? THE YOUNGEST WIFE All ready to be poured . That Egyptian fabric  --  I can not find it . THE ELDEST WIFE ( joins her in the search ) ALI ( handing a cup of coffee to Haroun ) May I offer you gentlemen a cup of coffee , since the Caliph has outlawed more stimulating hospitality ? THE VIZIER Do you mean to tell us that you have nothing in your cellar ? ALI ( giving him coffee ) I am unfortunate . My house was built without a cellar . THE VIZIER Then you are , perforce , Ali the good . ALI ( absently filling a third cup ) So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cloak and veil ) Do I smell coffee ? THE WIVES ( busy with their search , do not hear her. ) p. 12 ALI ( comes down to her with the third cup . ) THE FAVORITE ( snatches up her veil with a little start , then , lowering it with a smile , takes the coffee , which she sips ) How nice of you ! ALI ( devouring her with his eyes ) I am richly rewarded . O , how unfortunate are the blind ! HAROUN AL RASCHID ( signals to the Chief Eunuch , who tiptoes stealthily toward Ali . ) THE FAVORITE Tell me more . ALI Pearl of Dawn ! THE FAVORITE But this is evening . ALI A night of miracles ! Oh , that I  --  THE FAVORITE Be careful . We are watched . ( She raises her veil circumspectly . ) Has your shop ever been robbed ? ) ALI No , lady . My besetting vice is covetousness.I wish for what is my neighbor 's . I dream of a jewel in a prince 's turban . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways . THE WIVES ( come down with a piece of white silk. ) p. 13 THE FAVORITE No , I want color . Show me all you have . ( She goes up with them to the other side of the shop . ) THE NUBIAN ( stands regarding Ali , darkly . ) ALI ( gazes , rapt , at the cushions where the Favorite rested . He becomes conscious of the Nubian , turns and smiles at him ) Your master 's lady is safe within my shop , good swordsman . ( He rejoins the Caliph and the Vizier ) HAROUN AL RASCHID ( picking up the goods originally offered to the Favorite ) This piece of silk . Is it good ? ALI Gentlemen , no . That silk is of domestic make . THE ELDEST WIFE ( signals frantically to Ali . ) ALI ( disregarding her ) It will turn yellow in a short time and the fabric will split . THE VIZIER Why , then , is it for sale in the shop of Ali the good ? ALI Because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want silks for your turbans , buy this . If you do not find it good you may have , for the asking , another fabric or your money again . p. 14 THE FAVORITE I will buy some new veils . And , mind you , do not try to cheat me again . This is the shop of Ali the good . THE WIVES ( all talking at once ) We would not think of cheating you.Our husband knows the stock.We made a mistake.It takes an expert to tell the goods apart . ( Grouped about the Favorite , they remove her outer cloak . One holds a mirror for her , the other a box of veils , which she tries on , frequently allowing her face to be seen by Ali . ) HAROUN AL RASCHID Ali , you are a righteous man . Yet I have seen that you have compassion for the sinner . Can you not tell us why one man is righteous and another wicked ? ALI ( attempting to give his attention to the question , but letting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin for the same reason . Some sin because they are stupid , which is a sin of itself . Others sin because they live many years behind , or ahead , of the age in which they are born . Still others sin because all their lives they have cherished a dream , perhaps not a good dream , but the dream of their lives . When the chance comes for the dream to come true they do not stop to consider the consequences to the others , nor even to themselves . Sin has intrigued the philosophers of every age and nation . As for myself , I know that I might sin , and in this wise . Suppose two robbers met upon the street in Bagdad  --  ( As he talks the lights fade out. ) p. 15 The scene changes. @x SCENE THREE : A Street . A Robber Captain and his Lieutenant ( enter from opposite directions  --  both carry lanterns . ) THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Well , how many purses ? LIEUTENANT None , yet , but I have news . Haroun al Raschid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also called " the good . " THE ROBBER CAPTAIN " The good "  --  to be cursed with a title like that ! Was the Caliph spending freely there ? LIEUTENANT He will , no fear . Ali is a shrewd merchant . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN The more he spends , the more for us to take.But he does n't spend fast enough . I wish I had force enough to swoop down on his treasury . LIEUTENANT It is well guarded . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Well guarded  --  yes , so is he . And well he need be , for banishing wine from Bagdad . My throat 's dusty as a carpet in the bazaar . Who are these ? LIEUTENANT The Caliph , his Vizier , and his Favorite . Hide quickly , the patrol will follow them . ( They hide at the end of the street . ) THE NUBIAN ( enters and passes along the street , followed by the Favorite , carried in a tiny palanquin , with a lantern in its canopy. ) p. 17 THE CALIPH AND HIS VIZIER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) THE VIZIER You paid him too much for the silk . HAROUN AL RASCHID I paid , not for the silk , but for the man . Such honesty is priceless . Had I more of it in Bagdad , I might dispense with guards and patrols . THE VIZIER Until you get it , though  --  ah , here they come . THE PATROL ( enters , standing , ready to follow the Caliph . ) HAROUN AL RASCHID Do you think he knew me for the Caliph ? THE VIZIER Of course he did . I have told you a thousand times that your incognito deceives no one but yourself . ( They disappear , followed by the patrol . ) THE ROBBER CAPTAIN ( comes out , with his Lieutenant , from their hiding-place ) There goes the robber of wine. Our way is clear . Call the men . We 'll fall upon the Ali the moment his harem is alseep  --  be careful not to wake the women  --  they 're worse than any dog  --  a bone will not silence them . The lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The lights are dim . Ali ( is discovered , standing beside the curtained divan , lost in thought , alone . ) THE WIVES ( from another room ) Good-night , good-night ! ALI Good-night ! ( He draws the curtain across the doorway to the street and comes down to the spot where the Favorite tried on the veils . He finds on the floor the veil which she wore , which he takes to the chest in the center of the room , upon which he sits with the veil at his lips , and is presently lost in dreams . ) ( A naked arm appears at the curtain to the street and pulls it aside a little . ) THE ROBBER CAPTAIN AND THE LIEUTENANT ( steal into the room . They have left their cloaks outside and their knives gleam wickedly in the dim light . They waken Ali , presenting their knives to his ribs to prevent outcry . ) ALI Mercy ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Tell us where your treasure is hid and no harm shall come to you . ALI In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him unceremoniously off the chest and open it. ) p. 19 THE ROBBER CAPTAIN ( lifting a bottle ) By the beard of the Prophet , wine ! ALI Even so . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Sly dog ! Ali the good ! Why , he has twenty varieties of bottled drunkenness ! LIEUTENANT But how if it be poisoned ? THE ROBBER CAPTAIN In these days of forbidden wine , make the giver drink with you . Come , merchant . ( He fills a cup . ) ALI As I put by the wine , myself  --  may we all live to be extremely wicked ! ( He drinks . ) LIEUTENANT The man is moonstruck ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN ( chuckling ) Ali the good , extremely wicked ? ( He drinks  --  wine dribbles down his chin . ) ALI ( mopping it up with a napkin from the chest ) Do n't waste it , good Captain . There is n't much left . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Enough for the evening , good merchant . ( Pours himself another drink . ) ALI And after that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( He drinks . ) ALI Could I but catch that thought ! ( He drops the Favorite 's veil . ) LIEUTENANT ( snatches it up with a ribald exclamation . ) ALI Give it me ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN I told you he was a sly dog ! Ali the good , a harem robber , a beauty snatcher ! Ah , old fox ! LIEUTENANT Let it be , merchant , or I 'll give you the knife instead . ( He thrusts at Ali . ) ALI ( with a wrestler 's trick , throws him on the floor . He retrieves the veil as the man sprawls . ) THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Serves you right . Should n't interfere with another man 's souvenirs . What 's she like , merchant ? ALI She is the Pearl of Dawn ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Marvelously accurate description ! Identify her immediately . Where 's she live ? ALI That is my secret . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Must find this out . ( He places the point of his knife between Ali 's ribs. ) p. 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ALI It is the will of Allah . I will tell All my life I have been seeking for naughtiness . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Ali the good ! ( He laughs boisterously . ) ALI That name was not of my own seeking . I own the largest library of forbidden books in Bagdad . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Some day when I am sober  --  ALI If you are ever sober you may look at them . I assure you they have been a great disappointment . None of them really come up to their reputations . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN But the censors  --  ALI The censors would n't know real naughtiness if they met it . And I have wasted my substance to see all the dancers and nautch girls of Turkey and Egypt . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN ( rubbing his hands ) Ah , an epicure ! ALI Very , very stupid and not at all naughty . Disappointments , every one . So I have thought a great deal about naughtiness , and Allah has given me the key to the riddle . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven.It lies within you . I have tended the naughtiness in my heart like a poppy garden until today  --  THE ROBBER CAPTAIN To-day you 're a bolder fellow than I am , you were going to say . LIEUTENANT Captain , he 's tricked you . He 's led you away from the secret . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN ( his knife at Ali 's ribs ) Quickly  --  where does she live ? ALI It is the will of Allah . She lives in the palace of the Caliph . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Ah , the sly dog ! No wonder he is vain ! ALI The Pearl of Dawn ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN ( after emptying his cup ) What would you give to hold the Pearl of Dawn  --  to have her , perhaps . ALI Anything ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Now , perhaps , it might be managed if you  --  No , no ; it wo n't do . ( He finishes another cup . ) ALI Try me . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN You are determined ? Listen , then . About the Caliph 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a neighboring roof . Once inside , the harem is but one door away . The treasury  --  but that is my affair . You have the courage to climb that wall upon the shoulders of my men and let a rope down after you ? p. 23 ALI Command me ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Come , then ! ALI A moment only . A letter for my wives , lest they grieve too loudly for my absence . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN ( looking over Ali 's shoulder as he writes ) " Am held captive by robbers . Give no alarm , but send two thousand sequins at once to the old gate of the city . " Ah , sly dog ! Lead on , O Prince of Evil ! ( The three men go out into the street after putting out the light . ) WOMEN 'S VOICES ( rise in the next room from a murmur to an argument . ) THE YOUNGEST WIFE ( coming from behind the curtains in her nightdress , with a lantern ) But I 'm sure I heard voices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it empty , begins to search the room . ) Husband is not here ! The chest is open ! A letter ! ( She reads it and screams . ) THE OTHER WIVES ( run in ; they all talk at once ) Let me see it ! How can I when you  --  But I do n't understand . It ca n't be true . But think  --  robbers in here and gone without noise . I knew there was something wrong . You told me to be quiet . What shall we do ? Ali says to give no alarm . But they may murder him . Two thousand sequins ! Let 's call the patrol ! Allah be merciful ! Help ! Robbers ! Thieves ! ( Their chatter rises to a shriek , and the Youngest Wife goes tearing out into the street , followed by the others , all screaming. ) p. 24 The lights fade out . The scene changes@@ SCENE FIVE : A Street . A patrol passes . The Captain , Ali , the Lieutenant , and sundry robbers enter warily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peevish , alcoholic reaction ) I do n't like it . Something will go wrong , I know . Bagdad is alive with patrols . Tomorrow night  --  ALI ( with bravado  --  also slightly alcoholic ) Tomorrow  --  why , tomorrow I may be Myself with ten thousand yesterdays . THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Stop quoting that damned Persian ! His verses are full of wine , and they make me thirsty . ( Struck by a happier thought . ) Let 's go back and have another drink ! ALI ( not budging , but pointing ahead ) Have you forgotten the Caliph 's treasury ? Haroun al Raschid may feel generous in the morning and give half of it away to somebody . Think of taking , in one night , all the gold your men could carry ! THE ROBBER CAPTAIN Being wicked in large doses , are n't you ? ALI I have been good for a long , long time . LIEUTENANT ( starting sharply ) What 's that  --  p. 26 ALI ( laughing ) Your shadow on the wall . What a bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Coward ! Learn courage from this brave merchant , Ali the good ! Let all brave men follow me . ( He struts off . ) ALI I follow ( The party goes out  --  A patrol passes . From one side comes a murmur which swells in volume to the shrieks of Ali 's wives , who now appear in their night robes . ) THE WIVES ( all at once ) Help , help , help ! Thieves , thieves , Watch ho ! Watch ho ! Thieves ! Thieves ! Watch ho ! Watch ho ! Help ! Help ! Watch ho ! Watch ho ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Thieves !

Do n't you understand that robbers have entered our house and stolen and taken away our husband ? If we do not pay the ransom they will kill him ; and we ca n't pay it because all our money is stolen , etc.I shall die if you do n't save him . Scour the streets ! Go at once ! Spread the alarm ! He is our husband . If he dies our hearts perish also ! Draw your swords ! Read the letter ! Save him from the robbers ! p. 27 THE PATROL ( puts its hands to its ears . ) The lights fade out . The gabble subsides to a murmur , but does not stop , swelling again as the lights come up on the next scene. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , a draped bed . Cushions at intervals on the floor . Several colored lamps hang from the ceiling . As the lights come up the noise turns out to be the chatter of three houri seated in the center of the room . THREE HOURI ( all three at once ) First : I do n't see why on earth she paid fifty sequins for that veil . I would n't trade at that shop anyway . They 're cheats . She does n't use any judgment at all in her shopping . That 's why her clothes never look like anything.Second : Did you smell the perfumery she bought ? When the Caliph smells it , someone else will be the favorite until his nose gets well . I do n't know how she gets away with it  --  a person with no more taste than that . Some women have all the luck.Third : Then the Persian said to me , " Why are you content to be a maid for the Favorite ? You should be favorite yourself . Run away with me and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

THE VIZIER Shall I have a hundred of them beheaded . HAROUN AL RASCHID No , the executioner already complains of overwork . THE VIZIER I might give them away to the Bashaw . HAROUN AL RASCHID No .
