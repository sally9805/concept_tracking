Last week died tall , drawling Federal District Judge Henry De Lamar Clayton , 72 , for 17 years a Representative from Alabama . His name , like Sherman 's , Volstead 's and Mann 's , will be remembered when its bearer is forgotten . During his four year chairmanship of the important House Judiciary Committee he wrote the famed Clayton Act , climax of U. S. anti-trust legislation .
