PERSONALLY I have always thought , that although he left off in the middle of a sentence , Plato said all that he had to say about Atlantis : " The divine portion in the Atlanteans began to fade away . It became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture ; human nature got the upper hand . Then they , being unable to bear their great fortune , became insolent and adopted unseemly ways ; to him who had eyes to see they began to appear bare , as having lost their fairest and most precious gifts . To themselves they still appeared glorious and blessed , and that at the very time they were filled with unrighteous power . " Of course we should like to have been told how the judgement of the gods was fulfilled , and the ways by which Atlantis came to be overwhelmed . But what has a philosophic historian to do with all that ' ? The cycle of Atlantean civilization was complete ; it had grown as Spengler tells us all civilizations grow , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had faded . Perhaps no one will ever tell us more than Plato has told us about the decay of a civilization . " The divine portion began to fade away . It became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture . " And perhaps , philosophically speaking , that is as much as there is to be said about the Atlanteans , as it is as much as there is to be said about the Babylonians , the Egyptians , the Greeks , and the Romans . But where did Plato get the piece of history on which he philosophized ' ? Or was it a piece of history ' ? Did he invent Atlantis and its civilization , or did he make use of a tradition that was current in Egypt or in some other land ? And if he did , how had that tradition grown up ? Was it a reminiscence of Minoan Crete with its material civilization and its maritime power ' ? Or had  | it grown up out of that feeling of catastrophe that comes over us all as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The kernel of Mr Spence 's argument is that Plato 's account of Atlantis is the working-up of an old and authentic tradition , just as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's tale of Arthur , or Homer 's account of Troy , is the working up of an old and authentic tradition . Arthur existed , Troy existed , in spite of the fact that a great deal that is mythical comes into Geoffrey of Monmouth 's account and Homer 's account of the scene and the people . " Broadly speaking , " he writes , " it is now generally accepted by critics of insight ? the others do not matter much ? that when a large body of myth crystallizes round one central figure , race , or locality , it is almost certain to enshrine a certain proportion of historical truth capable of extraction from the mass of fabulous material which surrounds it , and when so refined , is worthy of acceptance by the most meticulous of historical purists . " But in making this argument and illustrating it by Homer and Geoffrey of Monmouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of account something that is very impotrant . That something is the time-element . Only a few centuries separated the period of Troy from the period of Homer , the period of Arthur from the period of Geoffrey of Monmouth . But between the time of the overwhelming of Atlantis and Plato 's time there was a period vast enough to baffle all historical record , all historical memory . Atlantis was founded B. C. 7000 , says Mr Spence . Let us say that it endured loon years , and was overwhelmed with the islands of which it was the capital B. C. 6000 . From that time until Plato 's time there was a period as long as from the First Egyptian Dynasty until today . Can we believe that the Atlantean tradition could have persisted through such a vast period of time ? It might persist as a story of general disaster , likely enough , but it could not persist as a record holding the actual physical features of the lost land . Mr Spence would reply that the tradition embodying the physical features of the Atlantean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was written down , and Plato 's account was drawn from documentary evidence . His whole mass of speculation then really rests upon this hypothetical evidence . And it seems to me that not only the author of The Problem of Atlantis but all those who make claim for the authenticity of the tradition that Plato has embodied will have to discover  | and bring into the light that very evidence . Where are the documents from which Plato drew his account ? They were Egyptian , and apparently it was next to impossible to destroy Egyptian documents . And how is it that we have never heard about them except through Plato ? There must have been a great deal of interest taken in the account they embodied in the Greece of Plato 's time and in the Roman world afterwards . The Egyptian priests would surely find it profitable to gratify the curiosity of people interested , even if they were only interested in finding out how Plato 's story ended . And yet Plato 's is the only account of Atlantis that we have . Herodotus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has nothing to say about it . The evidence that would have been salient is not in the possession of the writer of The Problem of Atlantis , but a great deal of secondary evidence is brought into court . Mr Spence is an authority on the mythology and archaeology of South and Central America , and he is able to show us correspondences between the civilization noted in Plato 's account and the Maya , Mexican , and Peruvian civilizations . It is part of his theory that Atlantis , the eastern end of a broken-up continent , and Antilia , the western end , were joined by an insular chain , and that civilizations went from Atlantis , not only into Europe and Africa , but into America as well . Peru , too , according to Mr Spence , had an Atlantean civilization which was taken over by the people who had the Incas for their leaders . And he brings a great deal of testimony to show that the earliest peoples in Europe who were capable of creating a civilization ? the Cro-Magnon men , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances in Biscay and the Pyrenees : " Why , it may well be asked , should all these races appear suddenly in the same area ? " The answer that he makes is that they were all colonists from a disintegrating Atlantis , bringing with them the Atlantean culture in its various stages . That answer may be the right one . But there may be another answer . In to-day 's newspaper I read about discoveries in the Sahara that indicate that the part of Africa near the Pyrenees was the scene of human activities in incredibly remote times . " The hatchet , which both Professor Reygasse and Dr Pound identified as the second oldest of the period of the Old Stone Age , is estimated to have existed one hundred and fifty thousand years ago , antedating from five hundred to one thousand centuries the work of  | the Cro-Magnons in Southern France . " This would seem to dispose of the evidence that is based on the early civilizations in the Pyrenean area . But doubtless Mr Spence would maintain that the men of the Sahara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an Atlantis in the Atlantic there was also a lost land in the Pacific ? Hawaiki . However , those who wish to establish the existence of Hawaiki do not have to go into such deep waters as the spokesmen for Atlantis have to go into . There is a clear tradition about Hawaiki . Not only have the Polynesians named many of the islands they came to after the land that they speak of as their fatherland , but , apart altogether from this particular tradition , it is evident that their uniform culture , their language , their racial type , were built up in some land in which the ancestors of the New Zealanders , the Hawaiians , the Samoans , the Tahitians , the Marquesans all lived together , having there the food plants and the few animals that they brought with them through the islands of what they have named as the Great Engulfing Ocean . Hawaiki , that common fatherland , is now at the bottom of the sea : Professor Macmillan Brown so declared in his essay on The Languages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . Easter Island is at once the riddle and the key to the riddle of the Pacific . Part of the riddle of Easter Island is known even to those who take little interest in the wider problem of Polynesia . On the Island , ringing it around , are great statues ; they have been overthrown since the European discovery of the Island , and they are now prone on the ground . It is true that these statues were made out of material that is easily worked ; it did not require many workers nor a great deal of time to cut out in a crater-workshop even one of the statues that weighed thirty tons . But it did require a great many workers to transport the statues from the extinct volcano where they had been cut out , and to set up the platforms of cut stone that are associated with the statues . And it is impossible to think of Easter Island as ever producing food enough to suffice for a population adequate to the work of moving the statues . Moreover , the beams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been obtained on the Island ?  | there are no forests and there never were any forests there . And the present population of Easter Island gives no evidence that they ever possessed enough directive ability to carry out such a work as the cutting-out , the transporting , and the setting-up of these great images . Who put up the statues and why were they put up ? What ' relation have they , Polynesian as they are in the type they represent , to the present Polynesian population of Easter Island ? And what bearing have the statues on the problems connected with Polynesian culture and the Polynesian dispersal through the islands of the Pacific ? To the east of Easter Island , Professor Macmillan Brown declares , there was an archipelago known in Easter Island tradition as Motu Matiro Hiva ; to the west there were islands known as Marae Renga and Marae Toiho . The archipelago and the two islands have gone down . Perhaps only those who have read The Languages of the Pacific will be puzzled by this subsidence . They will ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession of sinking fatherlands ? Hawaiki and Motu Matiro Hiva ? or if we are to take it that the archipelago and the islands to the east and west of Easter Island were the surviving fragments of the home land ? of Hawaiki . If these were the fragments of Hawaiki , that would leave the Polynesian home land in a southern temperate zone , and I think Professor Macmillan Brown on page 194 of The Riddle of the Pacific makes a very good case for their having had a home land in the temperate zone ? the adventurous , the Viking strain in the Polynesians certainly suggests a temperate and not a tropical origin . In The Riddle of the Pacific he puts forward the lost Motu Matiro Hiva as the seat of a Polynesian Empire . The archipelago had wealth , organization , a subject population ; its rulers resolved to make the barren place that we now know as Easter Island the mausoleum for their conspicuous dead . They landed a slavepopulation on the place , and they kept them in subjection by controlling the food-supplies which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire-makers with their control of slavelabour had the statues cut out and put up ; they were , according to Professor Macmillan Brown , arranging great avenues of statues and raising great platforms when the catastrophe came upon their  | own land . It went down in the ocean . On Easter Island the population promptly downed tools , and since that time they have never achieved any discipline or any real social order . His great contribution to the elucidation of the riddle presented by Easter Island lies in his analysis of the social order ? or lack of social order ? there , and its departures in culture from the Polynesian norm . He makes a case for his picturesque theory of a Polynesian Empire in the southern temperate zone . He spoils it from time to time by pressing too hard upon scraps of evidence . For instance , Easter Islanders call their little speck of land Te Pito to Henua which means the navel of the world . That seems testimony to the theory that it had an archipelago and islands around it . But then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same name ? Ka Piko ke Henua . As there were no lands surrounding the Hawaiian group , the title can not imply there what Professor Macmillan Brown thinks it implies for Easter Island ? a centre of lands . And in order to make it credible that great labours should go to the making of the island into a mausoleum , he has to declare that the men of Motu Matiro Hiva were an ancestor-worshipping people . There is no warrant in Polynesian tradition for saying this . The Polynesian stories , the Polynesian customs , the Polynesian myths do not give the impression that the Pacific Islanders were ancestor-worshippers . We know that their great reverence was not for ancestors , but for the Ariki , the Alii , the " Divine Ones , " " The Heaven Born , " the living chiefs and kings who had the power of tapu . In Hawaii the bones of the great kings , instead of being marked , were carefully hidden away . The secret of where the great Kamehameha is laid is still carefully preserved . But these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are writing about . What Mr Spence has said about The Problem of Atlantis applies also to The Riddle of the Pacific : " The purpose of the book is not so much to demonstrate the former existence of an Atlantean continent as to place the study of the whole problem on a more accurate basis than has yet been attempted in recent times . . . . If errors and false hypotheses are encountered therein , I must plead that these are due to a spirit of experiment and archeological enterprise . " It is in this spirit that we should read both books .  |
