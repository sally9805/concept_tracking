Rubbers are not romantic . Neither are auto tires , nursing nipples , hot water bags or rubber boots . But last week rubber-romance kindled in the quiet , Gothic depths of the House of Commons . There Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin pronounced a few matter-of-fact words which altered the destiny of Britain 's wide-flung rubber plantations in Malaya . Straits Settlements and Ceylon . To U. S. motorists the pronouncement meant that raw rubber suitable for tire-making will probably be stabilized in price at a figure less than half of what was paid last year . <P> Briefly , the Prime Minister announced that on Nov. 1 , 1928 , the Empire will abandon its six-year-old program of attempting to force up the world price of rubber by curtailing the supply . This program , the so-called Stevenson Plan , went into effect in 1922 , when crude rubber stood at 17 a pound , and bounced the price up within three years to $1.21 . That meant bonanza profits for British plantations . Why then is the Stevenson Plan about to be scrapped ? <P> Rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not until they had done some furious trading . As the Baldwin announcement flashed over the cables to Manhattan , bedlam broke loose in the red-brick building which houses the New York Rubber Exchange . At the close of a day of pandemoniac selling all records for volume of turnover had been shattered by transactions totaling 8,985 long tons and exceeding $5,000,000 in value . The average price , chalked up again and again with fractional variations by perspiring board boys , was 21 per pound . <P> At the London Rubber Exchange in Mincing Lane ( near the Tower of London ) trading was quiet among disgruntled British rubber men . They established a price which hung close to 10 pence per pound , virtually the equivalent of the U. S. average price of 21 cents ( since one pence equals two cents ) . Londoners , therefore , had ample time to ponder and explain why the Stevenson Plan will be scrapped on Nov. 1 , 1928 . <P> The plain fact is that the plan has progressively failed of its purpose . True it sent rubber up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price had declined to 41 . Why ? <P> To understand , one must examine the original assumption on which the Plan was based in 1922 , namely that , since Britain then produced five-sevenths of the World 's rubber , she might , by curtailing her own production , create a scarcity of rubber such that the price would rise . In the year 1925 , as has been said , this assumption was temporarily justified . So high a price , however , encouraged rival Dutch producers to extend their plantations . Moreover U. S. rubber manufacturers , urged by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover , proceeded to circumvent partially the artificially high price of new rubber by turning to the use of reclaimed rubber and other substitutes . As a result the scarcity artificially created by Great Britain has progressively ceased to exist and the price of rubber has accordingly and progressively fallen .
