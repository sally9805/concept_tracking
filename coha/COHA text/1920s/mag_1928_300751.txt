" I can understand . . . that the Governor Alfred E. Smith in casting those votes against those reform bills touching gambling and the facilities for prostitution might honestly have felt that the bills were unconstitutional or were not enforceable or infringed on personal liberty or encouraged police blackmail . . . . <P> " I have never consciously questioned any man 's motives and so ... I desire to withdraw the charges formally , in so far as they affect his votes on gambling and prostitution , but not his position as to the saloon . . . . <P> " Organized , protected prostitution is quickly passing out of American life and that issue is not vital . But vital or not , I could not in good conscience press this issue , realizing that Governor Smith , whom I greatly admire for his many high qualities , feels that my charges question the purity of his motives . . . . <P> " I never mean to hit below the belt , but I felt that roll-call on prostitution was a bit below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew . ... " <P> And so ended the attack of the country editor ( Emporia , Kan. ) upon the city-bred Nominee . Judges on both sides of the party line awarded the decision to the Nominee , who made no retort to Editor White 's exhumation and exegesis of the 1904-1915 record of Smith votes in the New York Assembly ( TIME , Aug. 6 ) . <P> Boarding the S. S. De Grasse , Editor White said : " That 's the longest gangplank in the world. * Three seconds after I cross it I 'll be 3,000 miles away from the whole mess . " Editor White was bound for Paris , with Mrs. White and a " chunk of money . " He was going also to Bayreuth , Germany , to " take a big Wagnerian souse in Parsifal to purge myself of all my sins . . . moral and political . " <P> The agent of Editor White 's retraction had been Editorial-Writer Walter Lippmann of the Wet-Democratic New York World , to which and to whom Nominee Smith pays close attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican National Committee went a telegram from Representative William Walton Griest , aged " dean " of Pennsylvania Congressmen : " If possible bottle up tight William Allen White and all other hot air artists that may be hovering around national headquarters . Please try your utmost . They are a distinct liability . " <P> The New York Sun ( Republican ) contrasted the grudging White retraction with the forthright retraction of another Kansas-bred journalist , Editor Gene A. Howe of the Amarillo , Tex. , Globe-News , who last week said that he had erred in attributing a " swelled head " to Charles Augustus Lindbergh ( see p. 27 ) . <P> Editor White once called his stout political friend , Nominee Curtis , a " nit wit . " Asked , last week , if he was still of that opinion , Editor White said : " I am . Go ahead . They 'll probably prove that I beat my wife .
