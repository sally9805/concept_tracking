ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN-Edgar Selwyn has written a comedy of mannerly intoxication . Anything might happen , but what actually does is rather amusing than important . Two of Manhattan 's most impeccable recently-jilted ( Roland Young and Leslie Howard ) become inextricably involved with each other 's fiancees until the last act , when an extensive readjustment takes place . <P> Most of the hilarity centers about a quart bottle of champagne , on which one of the young blades ( Mr. Young and one of the ex-fiances ( Estelle Winwood ) get unwarrantably but agreeably mellow . Other indignities offered the recent amendment are highballs in the first act , cocktails before the champagne , and a pitcher of some obscure intoxicant in a restaurant scene . <P> One of the notable features of the play is Leslie Howard 's anglicised delivery of American colloquialism . Another is a polite flirtation in a taxicab , to the accompaniment of a clicking meter . The weather is unpleasant in the first act , but the rain is not nearly as wet as that in the play named after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . inconsequential plan . " <P> Alexander Woollcott : " . . . intricate and intermittently amusing farce . " <P> John Corbin : " ... a phantasmagoria of off-again-on-again nightmare . " <P> MISTER MALATESTA-If everything happened to the audience that Mr. Ricciardi ( author and principal actor ) intended should happen , there would be a sustained sound of laughter bubbling up through tears . It is another Abie 's Irish Rose , with one of the nationalities somewhat altered . The Abie in this case is an Italian immigrant who has acquired wealth and a resolute Hibernian spouse . The attendant complications need scarcely be enumerated . They include the intrusion on the wife 's well-ordered domain of organ-grinders and spaghetti-jugglers from Mr. Malatesta 's laborious past . They further include a titled wooer for the daughter of the family and all manner of familiar domestic difficulties . The formula has been working well for a good many years now . It may well work again . <P> THE STRANGE CASE OF DR . JEKYLL AND MR . HYDE-John E. Kellerd is appearing in special matinees of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emphasis is placed less on the romantic phase of the situation and more on the mental struggle of Dr. Jekyll than in the former dramatization . It is maintained that Stevenson 's chief object was to emphasize the moral effect of the habit of evil on a character normally good . <P> THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOF and THE LADY FROM THE PROVINCES- Russian holds no further terrors . But the astonishing histrionic agility of the Muscovites does . It is in a sense a relief to feel that they have no further versatilities with which to confound one . <P> Their last bill is ideally constituted to illustrate the virtuosity to which a great repertory theatre alone can attain .
