FIRST , let me say that our English cousins would not understand this title . ' Game ' to them means something quite different from what it does to us ? to them it suggests something tricky . A London policeman , seeing two or three rather disreputable-looking characters acting suspiciously on a street corner , will approach them with ' What 's your little game ? ' He may say ' gaime ' ; in any event , he will tell them to ' move Won ' or ' be h'off . ' We , on the other hand , say that a man on leaving college is going into the electrical game , meaning thereby that he has adopted the electrical business as his profession , and that he intends to play it with what skill he has . I have been playing this book-collecting game for forty , years ; it is , indeed , the only game I thoroughly enjoy . I remember perfectly how it happened that I began to play it . For a boy , I was a sturdy reader : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back ? I read Napoleon , having , as a small boy , consumed the ' Rollo ' books , The Swiss Family Robinson , Sandford and Merton , Robinson Crusoe , and Great Expectations . But Napoleon as portrayed by Abbott enthralled me , and finally I came to have some twenty or thirty volumes about him ? quite a lot for a lad . Then one day I awoke from my trance and saw Napoleon ? as I still believe Into to be ? a monster in human form ; whereupon I trudged off to Leary 's , that famous secondhand 742 bookshop in Philadelphia , and sold the lot , and was ready to begin what I was pleased to think was my intellectual life over again . Then , just at the proper moment , fell tinder the sway of a man old enough to be my father , who , without consciously intending to do so , undertook to direct my reading and suggested that I form a library . ' It will be a great delight to you when you are older , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but where shall I begin ? ' At the beginning , ' he said . With Homer , Pope 's translation : the Iliad ; afterward read the Odyssey , which you 'll like better . ' I bought the books and have them still : two volumes , Bohn 's edition , in faded green cloth ; they are the corner stones of my library . Subsequently , at my mentor 's suggestion , I read The Cloister and the Hearth and The Autobiography of Benvenuto Ccllini . These led me to Motley and Prescott ; by that time I was twenty , and had read Boswell 's Johnson , had been in London , and my education ? such as it was ? was complete . Certainly this education might have been better , but then it might have been worse . In between what I may have thought was my ' heavy reading , ' I read Dickens , Thackeray , Scott , and Charles Reade . Then the problems of life began to press rather firmly upon my shoulders , but I managed to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when I bought // a book always to get , if possible , a first edition . And when I inquired why , I was told that if I ever wanted to sell my books I might get my money back if I had first editions ; whereas , if I had not , I should be pretty sure not to . Years passed : I bought what books I could ; finally got married , bought a home , had children , and came to feel the need of some sort of place in the country for the summer months . It seemed , at the moment , more important to have a place in the country than to have a few hundred first editions , and as it was perfectly clear to me that I could not have both , I decided to part with some of my books . After some discussion and correspondence , carried on through a third party , I decided to sell at auction in New York , and ? to save money ? to make and print the catalogue myself . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were bound up my hopes and fears . There were in all two hundred and forty-six items . I had made my notes as interesting as I could , and on the afternoon of Monday , May 18 , 1836 , with my catalogue in my pocket and my heart in my mouth , I climbed up the shabby stairs that led to Bangs and Company 's in lower Fifth Avenue , where the sale was to take place . One or t WO people nodded to me as I enemd the room , but no one knew that the books were mine . On the other hand , I knew to a penny what each item cost , and to keep up appearances I bought one or two books that were going f.tr less than they were worth ; but I had to be careful , for the sale must net me twenty-five hundred dollars . And it did . As I remember , I ultimately got a check for something like twenty-seven hundred dollars ; with which amount I built the cottage in the country in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been able to make as I got a lead on the sheriff . It was several years before my affairs permitted me to think seriously of again collecting hooks ; meantime 1 had the mistakes to make that a city man always makes when finally , for good and all , Ile transfers himself to the country . How we raised every animal that could be raised ? in adversity ? and grew everything that refused to grow , until with increase of fortune we discovered that only the very rich could afford to milk their own cow and grow their own vegetables ? of what interest is this to any man ? Books are my theme . A permanent bent had been given to my life and interests by my first visit to London . Its individuality was greater forty years ago than to-day : something ? maybe it is democracy ? is tending to make most of us colorless and uninteresting . In an effort to recreate myself in a less commonplace world , I became a reader of biography . Of soldiers and soldiering I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sordid games , I had ? and still have ? a feeling of abhorrence . The lives of actors and net resses always premise to he interesting but seldom are . My great regret is that , as a young man , I was never led to read Shakespeare . almost to the exclusion of everything else . But he once seemed too remote for me ; and this feeling led me to neglect the seventeenth century ; in the eighteenth I found the leisure which was lacking in my own . I became , ex officio , a member of the Johnson circle . I exchanged ? happy exchange ? my perplexities for those of Oliver Goldsmith : what shall be the name of the new play ? ? which was to deal a body blow to the artificial deleted material // exhausted , I should turn my attention to some other author of equal distinction of the same period : in the case we are imagining , it would be Thomas Hardy . Why , do you say ? For this reason . Let us suppose an auction sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be disposed of . Kipling does not lit into everyone 's collection ; not everyone ? not even the booksellers , who are certain to be present ? knows as much about the subject as a man who has for years specialized upon it , and it may happen that a unique item which may have cost you a lot of money will be knocked down for a song . Another reason : there is such a thing as ' sales fatigue . ' It is difficult for the auctioneer to keep his customers ' interest from flagging at a long sale in which there is no variety : variety is the spice of life , and nowhere is it more necessary than in the auction room . It will be seen that I am at the moment writing from the point of view of the seller ; from the buyer 's point of view , these long and wearisome sales afford excellent opportunities for strengthening one 's collection . And here let it be said that if the average man seeks to make a representative collection of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several years : occasionally it will occupy a lifetime . I have in mind the collection of The Dance of Death , the most remarkable of its kind ever formed , which was assembled by Miss Susan Minns of Boston . It was sold several years ago by the American Art Association in New York , and in the introduction to the excellent sales catalogue Miss Minns tells how she put the collection together , piece by piece , over many years . In dispersing it she sportily said : ' I have had the pleasure of collecting : let others have the same . ' I applaud the sentiment , but the collection should have been kept together as a monument to the lady 's unrivaled knowledge and industry . A bore once asked Oliver Herford what he would like most to see ; after a pause he replied : I should like to see you throw a raw egg into an electric fan . ' Now , were the question put to me . I should say I should like to see the ordinarily well-informed man , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about The Dance of Death . III To return to Thomas Hardy . His first book was Desperate Remedies , published anonymously , by Tinsley Brothers , in three volumes : in those days all novels were published in three volumes , and it was usual for the circulating libraries to buy a certain number of every novel when it came out , few people caring to venture thirty shillings ? the established price ? upon a work of fiction , especially if the author were unknown . Hence it is that almost all copies of an author 's first book ( I am speaking of novels ) are known as ex-library ' copies , meaning that a library label has been pasted upon the binding , leaving a stain if removed , and accounting for other damage . From this it will be seen how difficult it is to come across a fine copy in cloth . Bound copies make , of course , a fine appearance on one 's shelves , but fastidious collectors have declared for original cloth , or boards with the paper labels , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fancy to a pretty steep figure . Even as I write there comes to my table a catalogue from Walter M. Hill of Chicago , whose catalogues , by the way , always deserve careful reading . Note how lovingly he describes this item : ? 746 THIS BOOK-COLLECTING GAME AUSTEN ( line ) . Sense and Sensibility ; a novel . In three volumes . By a Lady . London . Printed for the author and published by T. Egerton , 1811 . First Edition . $900.00 In the original blue boards and with the paper labels , and in perfect state . No foreign element has entered into the physical condition of the copy . A most unusual book in the most desirable and rare state of perfection . I need it to complete my set . The temptation to buy it is almost irresistible , but one ca n't have everything . Of Jane Austen , Mr. R. W. Chapman , the Secretary of the Oxford University Press , one night , not long ago , told me an interesting story . A friend of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord what was the second-best novel in the language . ' We are agreed , I take it , that Tom Jones stands first . ' We are , ' replied the guest , land I should say that the second-best was Emma . ' You are right , ' said Lord Rosebery . The noble lord spoke positively ; I am not quite so sure myself , but then I am not a noble lord . We were speaking of the difficulty of getting first editions in their original cloth or boards . The moment a book is rebound it must be viewed with suspicion . Half titles are frequently lacking , or , if present , may have been taken from second or later editions . Or it may be that some ignorant bookseller has taken upon himself to add a half ' title to a book which in its first state had none . Too much is quite as bad as too little : anything more or less than the book in the condition its author gave it to the world is not now favorably regarded . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what an expert binder can do to a book would make your eyes pop out of your head . A title-page , or any other page , can be reproduced so that even experts have been deceived . And it has always been so . A century ago , in London , a man named Harris supplied complicated title-pages with such skill as resulted in their being shown , for years , as original in the British Museum before detection . The ' recasing ' of books , which sometimes extends to ' renewing , ' the use of new end papers , and such sophistications , are pitfalls which should be avoided ; I infinitely prefer to have the leaves of a book not overclean rat her than ' washed , ' because the process or washing involves the use of chemicals , some of which may remain in the paper , ultimately making it brittle . And , obviously , rebinding a book , unless it is done carefully , usually means the reduction of margins ? and size is a matter of the utmost consideration in buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hung by the feet until they are dead for the offenses their ancestors in the trade have committed . Tho nonchalance with which a binder put a book under a lusife and removed a substantial fraction of its margins is now recognized as a crime . Every important library contains numbers of rare volumes which , had they been allowed to remain in their original condition , tied up with a bit of string if the leaves were loose , would to-day be priceless ; as it is , they may indeed be so , but how much more valuable would they be had they not been subjected to the process of cropping ! Blessings upon the head of Daniel Charles Solander , a botanist of distinction , who after extensive travels became a ' Keeper ' in the British Museum . He invented the leather case which bears his name . It is a box in the exact shape of a book , in which some precious volume may be kept , and which , when placed upon one 's shelves , has the appearance of a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering asbestos boards , which render them practically fireproof . I almost never have a book bound : the moment one does so , some question arises which could perhaps have been settled if the book had not been tampered with . Many collectors , in binding their books or in having slip cases made for them , ? a slip case being a simpler form of case , ? have their novels bound in one color , their poetry in another , and so on . This adds variety and beauty to one 's books and makes it easier to recognize some particular volume when sought . After Solander 's death in 1782 , it was sought to honor him in some way , and a small island somewhere in the Pacific was named after him ; but a Solander case ' is more frequently referred to than the island , I am quite certain of it . I have not animadverted upon the collection of books in sets . Let me explain what I mean . Certain sets one must have ; no gentleman 's library is complete without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parlcman , or Motley , and hundreds of others . These are backbone books ? one must have them ; but their possession confers upon their owner no more distinction than a pair of pants . There are , however , other books which give perpetual delight ; these vary with the wealth and learning of the collector . In my own case a fine copy of Benjamin Franklin 's Cato Major in original binding , the first classic translated and published in America ( in Philadelphia in 1744 ) , would do it ; whereas Mr. Henry E. Huntington would have to produce the original manuscript of Franklin 's Autobiography ? and he could do it , too . IV The only set ' of first editions I ever bought , complete , in binding , is my set of Trollope . I bought it years ago before the renaissance of this great Victorian had set in . I am glad to have it , ? many of the books are practically unobtainable in their original condition , ? but it gives me no feeling of pride . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trollopean , wrote to ask me a question as to the original binding of one of Trollope 's early hooks , I was obliged to confess that as my set was in binding I could not answer his question . I like to think that I am responsible in some measure for Trollope 's present vogue , both with readers and with collectors . I have always delighted in him because of his humor , and his marvelous pictures of nineteenth-century English life . After his death a quietus was put to his fame by the publication of his Autobiography . In it he described the perfunctory way in which he wrote his novels , and , his own generation of readers dying with him , the next would have nothing to do with him . ' How can novels so produced be anything but stupid ? ' it was said . Years ago I wrote a small paper on the genius of Trollope , being led to do so by the appearance of a silly article in an English magazine to the effect that Trollope was as dead as Caesar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in his book on the English novel that ' no one would dare call Trollope a genius ' ; whereupon 1 rose and said , ' I do . ' To-day Trollopeans are everywhere , even in England . He has more first-rate novels to his credit than any other writer . A complete set of his writings runs to sixty-eight titles , one hundred and thirty-four volumes ! Anyone who wishes to spend a delightful evening or two with this novelist will read his Autobiography . And would you read an excellent novel ? Try The Eustace Diamonds . 748 THIS BOOK ? COLLECTING GAME I sometimes think that the greatest joy that comes from playing this hook-collecting game is the delightful acquaintances one makes ? tastes in common soon flower into friendships . Through my interest in William Blake I came to meet and know intimately Graham Robertson ? an English authority and collector of that fascinating man . It happened in this way : I was in the British Museum one day , talking to Laurence I3inyon . He asked me if I knew Robertson , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I think I can arrange it , ' said Ilinyon ; and a few clays later I received a letter saying that Mr. Robertson was out of town , but if I would call at a certain house in Knightsbridge his housekeeper would show me his collection of paintings . I did so , and saw some wonderful paintings , ? they are now in the Tate Gallery , ? and when subsequently I wrote Mr. Robertson thanking him for his courtesy I remarked that we had other tastes in common ; and I mentioned Gilbert and Sullivan and Irving and Terry . Whereupon I received another letter from Robertson , saying that if I , in addition to being a Blake collector , was a Gilbert and Sullivan and an Irving and Terry enthusiast , he wished I would come down into the country and spend a day with him ; that all his best Makes were in the country , and that he himself had not been in his London house for several years . He said that he would meet me at the railway station ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plain-looking old man , but that he would be accompanied by the finest sheep clog in England . I went , met Mr. Robertson without . difficulty , spent a happy clay with a most delightful gentleman ; and I have never since gone to England without spending a day in his company , and his letters to me are a joy . And , of course , I know well Geoffrey Keynes , the splendid young surgeon of Barts. , ' whose bibliographical studies of Blake would seem to be the last word on the subject ? at least the Grolier Club thought so when it brought out its splendid volume . Let me mention another man , John Burns , England 's one-time Labor leader , and one of the most brilliant men I ever met . His acquaintance I made in Sawyer 's bookshop . The Honorable John is self-educated , but what an education ! He has half a dozen degrees from as many universities . What are his interests ? Well , in addition to statistics on every conceivable subject , I should say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planning , and Sir Thomas More , of whom he has the finest collection in the world . He is a seasoned book-hunter , has a wonderful library , and a memory which is bewildering to a man who , like myself . was born with a complete forgettery in place of that useful organ . He does not . believe in war , gave up office and five thousand pounds a year for conscience ' sake ; but , England once in , lie did what . he could himself , saw his son and only child go , ? never to come back , ? and now , with his very charming wife , he lives in semiretirement , with his books . Through book-collecting I came to meet and know that rare personality . Amy Lowell , and , through her , Professor Palmer of Harvard . The meeting with him came about in this way . I had been spending some weeks visiting friends ' down east , ' and when I got to Boston one hot August clay I said to myself , ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over now : all my friends will be out of town . Ellery Sedgwick I know is away , and Amy Lowell will be rusticating somewhere . Nevertheless , I 'll go through the motions of calling them up . ' I was right as to Sedgwick , THIS BOOK ? COLLECTING GAME ' 749 but wrong as to Miss Lowell . After the usual delays came the rich , well-rounded voice over the telephone ( the voice I shall , alas ! never hear again ) : ' What brings you to these parts ? Certainly you may come to dinner . send the motor for you . You 'll find a dear old gentleman in it : Professor Palmer . He 's dining with me ; he 's a honk-collector too . ' Why , he 's the ery man I came to Boston to see , ' I replied . ' You did ! ' cried Miss Lowell . ' I supposed you had come to see me ! However , come to dinner and I 'll show Professor Palmer to you . ' Now Professor Palmer not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to distinction , however , is his knowledge of Greek . He has translated Homer 's Odyssey into a ' best seller . ' ' When ' Omer smote ' is blooming lyre , ' as hipling says , I wonder what he would have thought had he been told that some three thousand years later , in a world to him unknown , and in a manner to him unsuspected , a fellow by the name of Palmer would sing his songs , in a barbarous tongue , to an audience of over a quarter of a million people . That evening when Miss Lowell 's motor called for us we found Professor Palmer ensconced therein , and I soon discovered that a fine bibliographical evening was in contemplation ; for the dear old man had with him a green baize bag , such as Philadelphia lawyers used to carry , full of rare books to show to Miss Lowell , in exchange for which she was to show him her wonderful Keats collection , which is now one of the treasures of Harvard . There is a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself that there would probably be some exhibition riding of hobbyhorses , and I had a feeling of satisfaction in the belief that , although my nag might stumble once or twice , it would not get altogether out of hand . That evening was one to be remembered . Miss Lowell was in fine form : she radiated hospitality as she welcomed us at the door of her stately mansion in its park of green velvet , studded with fine old trees ? which I should describe as elms but for a story I once heard . A little girl was visiting at an English country house situated in a park famous for its fine old trees . As she strolled around with her host after dinner , knowing that she was expected to remark upon their beauty , she exclaimed , ' How beautiful those old elms are ! If they could speak . what . would they say ? ' To which her host replied quietly , ' They would say , I think , " We are oaks . " ' Anxious to avoid the chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with describing her trees as stately , and let them go at that . I soon discovered that poetry was to be the subject of the evening . Out of Mr. Palmer 's green bag came one rare volume after another : Herrick , and Herbert , and Blake , and Milton ; giants , housed in tiny volumes , one after another , all to be matched by Miss Lowell . And as I was not called upon to prove possession , it was easy enough for me to say , ' I have that , too . ' Finally I said to Mr. Palmer , ' Let us see your Lovelace Lucasta ; mine is in old sheep . ' Out of the bag it came , but , unluckily , in a modern binding . ' I have you both there , ' said Miss Lowell , displaying , with glee , her copy of the rare little volume ; ' look at the title-page . ' We looked , and found thereon the inscription , ' Ex Bono authoris . ' It was as pretty a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sport continued till after midnight , at which time it was agreed that I should witness a game of what might be called ' solitaire ' as played by Mr. Palmer in his library next morning . 750 THIS BOOK ? COLLECTING GAME My visit to Professor Palmer will ever be remembered : he is a past master in the art of book-collecting , and has since my first visit to him given his fine collection of first editions of English poetry to Wellesley College in memory of his wife , the late Alice Freeman Palmer . He accompanied his gift with an excellent catalogue , ? a. large volume , well printed , and substantially bound , ? and he has also printed a slender little volume , Notes on a Collection of English Poetry , of which he had thirty copies struck off at the Riverside Press at Cambridge , one of which is before me . Immediately following the title-page is a quotation from the famous translation of The Ship of Foolcs , reading , ? and more to the same effect . Then follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formed , the considered judgment of so fine a scholar and so eminent a collector that I can not do better than to quote it : ' It is easy to overestimate the value of old books . .. their shape is often unhandy , their type and paper poor ; they usually abound in typographical errors , and they are not supplied with such notes and introductions as enable a reader to stand where the printer stood .. . . But they have a sentimental value as having been used by contemporaries of the author , perhaps by the author himself . . . In my feeling , the presence of the poet is there , as it can not be in later issues . ' He then goes on to say , ' The cost of such books is very great and it constantly and rapidly rises . A narrowing supply makes this inevitable . Every time such books are sold a good proportion of them go into some public library , from which they never emerge . Each year , therefore , diminishes the number open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of wealth and refinement . A few rich men have doubled their permanent price in a single year . ' It would not be easy to better this explanation . And I am entirely in accord with Professor Palmer 's ideas as to the best . arrangement of books in their places on the shelves . He says , ' Ease of access is the first end of classification , ' but he prefers , as I do , the chronological rather than the alphabetical arrangement . It offends him to see Crashaw follow Crabbe , or Burns follow Browning : ' When I go to a shelf I wish to find there the men who worked together , to see the little imitators gathered about their master mind . We view our poets , then , as living social beings each among his fellows . This is the instinctive order , setting forth relationships even to the casual eye . ' As I walked away through Harvard Yard after my delightful visit , my thoughts were of the not very Reverend Laurence Sterne who invented the hobbyhorse : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for it . Somewhere in Tristram Shandy are lines to this effect : ' Have not the wisest men of all ages had their hobbyhorses , their running horses , their cockleshells , their drums , their trumpets , their fiddles , their books , or their butterflies , and as long as a man rides his hobbyhorse peacefully and quietly along the King 's highway and compels neither you nor me to get up behind him , why should we complain ? ' Why indeed ! But that when one sees a fellow creature toiling along life 's highway , going in our direction , should we not give him a lift ? Especially if the horse we are riding will safely carry two ; and it may happen , when ' your brother man ' or ' gentler sister woman ' gets up beside you , that you discover one having like tastes with yourself : if so , I say , the journey 's as good as over . A man without a hobby is to be pitied and avoided : if he is not exactly looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet it halfway ; he gets no joy out of life and he has little sympathy for those who do . I do n't much care what a man 's hobby is : he is a better fellow for having one . The name of Barry Worcester Smith occurs to me ; he is a hobby-rider if I know one ( he took his hunting stable and a pack of hounds to Ireland and gave good sport ) . Ask him to put a sentiment in his delightful Sporting Tour , in two fine volumes , in which his experiences in the old country are narrated , and he will write : ' A sporting life is sometimes checkered but never dull . ' His presence in your house at breakfast is as exhilarating as champagne at midnight . He never stops to inquire whither you are going and whether you expect to be happy when you get there : he is content to take a chance and join you ; for him the destination is not so important as the sense of progress . Sometimes , when people see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monotony of life , I am asked : ' What hobby shall I ride ? What shall I collect ? ' But to answer this question I have to know what you have in mind when you say ' collecting ' : whether it be merely for the sake of killing time ? of all things in the world the most valuable ? or whether , perchance , some one thing , some man or woman , or period in history , or thing accomplished by the sons of Adam , interests you enormously : in that case , that is it . There are rules for collectors , of course , but the exceptions are numerous and brilliant . We are told , for instance , that collectors should begin young , and some , no doubt , do . About a year ago I received a note , written from New York , reading thus : ' I have read your books and have enjoyed them very much , hence I do not hesitate to ask you for your autograph . I am now eleven years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a library like J. P. Morgan . ' I shrieked for joy , to find , at last , a person not afraid to give Mr. Morgan a run for his money ; and in my enthusiasm , after I had answered the letter , I sent it over to Miss Belle cla Costa Greene , the librarian of the Morgan Library , saying that after she had worked herself out of a job there was another awaiting her ? and such jobs do not grow on trees . In due course I heard the sequel : how Miss Greene had written my young friend a note telling him that if he seriously intended to form a library like Mr. Morgan 's it was high time he got started , and asking him to call on a particular clay and hour . The day and hour came , and the lad ; Miss Greene was waiting . The boy was not overcome , as I was when first I entered that noble and beautiful building , filled with some of the greatest bibliographical treasures in the world ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in answer to her question , explained that at present his means would not permit of his buying any books , but that he was making a collection of catalogues of Mitchell Kennerley 's Anderson Galleries , and the American Art Association , and that he had priced copies of the more important sales of the past year . Miss Greene does not often meet her match , but she . did then , and when , to hide her confusion , she asked him if lie wanted to see any particular book , he replied , Yes , I should like to see the first book printed , the Gutenberg Bible . ' It was brought him , whereupon he at once began to count the lines to discover whether the first pages were of the forty or the forty-two line issue . And 752 THIS BOOK ? COLLECTING GAME this at the age of eleven ! On the other hand , Mr. Huntington , who has formed the most important library of modern times , did not begin until he was a man of middle age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a speed of twenty-five miles : this is nothing to the speed that Mr. Huntington has developed . V After a man has rowed his way across a river , it is hardy worth while for him to regret that he has not crossed by the bridge ; ho has arrived , that is the important thing . But I can not free my mind from the belief that if I had my life to live over again I should take on ' Americana . ' There is no element of ' fad ' about it , as there may be about Conrad or Stevenson , for instance . It has come to stay , but it is now too late for mo to get up any interest in a badly printed tract describing what is now Virginia , or to go into an ecstasy at the sight of a map , which at a glance one can tell is a , gigantic error , simply because I am told it is the first map of what is now North America . But other men , wiser than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours a year ago in the William L.

Visit Ann Arbor and see the simple but beautiful temple which contains the books which were , a short time since , the hobby of a busy man of affairs . Read Mr. Clements 's modest but scholarly essay in which he says : ' All collections must have their beginnings , and in 1903 the foundation of this one was made by the purchase .. . of a library of about a thousand volumes . ' I would not say that his account of the growth of his collection is as fascinating as a romance , but anyone who cares to read about books relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nothing to that great nation that we call the United States ? the greatest romance in the world ? will find that a new planet has swum into his ken .

And when I read the excellent reviews that Adams 's History of the Foreign .

Ask the college professors who are working in the subject , or Lathrop Harper of New York , a most // reliable guide ; ask Dr. ilosenbach , Ito only a few clays ago exchanged a monarch 's ransom for a small specimen : ask my friend J.

The growth of Chicago is the measure by which we should judge the interest in Americana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players are joining in the gnaw ; we amateurs are playing it against professionals , and sometimes it costs us money , but not so much as one might suppose . To play against Hosenbach is like trying to break the kink at . Monte Carlo ; yet even he has sold me items which he would now take off my hands at three or four times what I paid for them . A rare book should , and usually does , advance in value , but it is a good deal more fun to anticipate the rise than to buy it at a high price after it has risen . There are thousands of excellent books by important authors which will never he ' collected , ' for the reason that the first edition was so large . The books to collect are those the success of which was at one time problematical , or those which the subsequent work of an author has made important : these constantly rise in value . Of books of yesterday : de la Mare 's Sungs ( g ' Childhood , Masefield 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaye-Smith 's Tramping ilethorlist , Morley 's Parnassus on ll'heels , keep on advancing in price , to the bewilderment of their authors . How long they will hold their present value , or whether they will go taill higher , nobody knows ; but it would seem sari ? to say that an author 's first book . if his subsequent COL. /. ; 8 ? No. work survives the critics , could be bought with impunity . Collectors of modern books now have excellent bibliographies to guide them : these were entirely lacking when 1 first began to play the game . Some of these are monuments of bibliographical exactness , others are of errors all compact ; but , good or had , as Dr. Johnson says of dictionaries , the worst is better than none . VI In the hook market I have seen many changes : no longer is London , or indeed England . the only market in which to buy books . For almost a century we have been drawing on that great reservoir , and the level of the supply is permanently lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are good hooks . There is a glamour , a romance , about prowling around in the bookshops of the old country , but I lie best picking is now to he had at home , especially in New fork City . The book-collector , early in the game , w ill do well to attract the attention of some good bookseller . This is easy : half a dozen purchases and as many intelligent questions will do it . But he should also study the catalogues , which , once his name gets on the booksellers ' lists , will come to him by every mail , and the auction sales should always he kept in mind . It is great fun goit , to hook auctions , and the auctioneers ' catalogues tire mines of information . In the auction room in New fork a great hook Will always bring what it is worth , and frequently more . Not long ago a ropy of AI Won 's ( ' emus brought enty-one thousand , five hundred dollars . Now I do n't mean to say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find another : And if and when you do , it will bring more . But less famous books , equally scarce , frequently bring less limn they are worth . The fact is ,  - -  and I state it reluctantly , ? we collectors do not know our literature as well as we should ; we concentrate our attention too much on star items . This makes the market ' spotty , ' as the stockbrokers say . These are facts to be reckoned with , and one must remember that scarcity alone will not make a book sell at a high price ; or , to state the matter another way , it is always unwise to wrench a book out of its natural habitat . A book much sought in Paris , sold at auction in New York , may bring little or nothing . Let us not neglect the wood for the trees . What a glorious thing is English literature ! The man who elects to study it in first editions is riding a noble hobby . Consider its venerable age , its unbroken continuity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drama , and fiction in the world ; in essays we yield the palm only to Montaigne , and we have the only biography worth speaking of . What a variety ! We book-collectors each of us can ride an animal differing , in some respect , from every other animal ; but we are alike in this : that as we put it through its paces and explain its good points to our auditor ? when we can find one ? we are enjoying life to a degree that a man without a hobby knows nothing of . The exercise keeps the breath of life in us long after we have outlived our usefulness . Whether this be a good thing or not , let our heirs , executors , administrators , and assigns say . I once knew a Philadelphian , Ferdinand J. Dreer , who retired from business before he was forty to prepare himself for death , which he thought imminent . To occupy his mind he began to collect autographs , and lived to the age of eighty , forming one of the finest collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bequeathed his priceless collection to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania , and his name will ever be remembered . May it not be said of the accomplished hobby-rider , as Johnson said of Shakespeare , that panting Time toils after him in vain ?
