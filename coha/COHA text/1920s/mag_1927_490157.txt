ADDERS of insult to injury are the department stores which pick out zero days for displaying one-piece bathing suits in windows . We rather suspect connivance with Florida chambers of commerce , ever alert to proselytize in the frigid northlands . If you happen to take your winter straight , it is no fun to skid , half dead with cold , around an icy Fifth Avenue corner , only to have a papier-machr diving girl thrown up in your chapped face . EVIDENCE that ththy.country is in its usual state of normalcy arc the reports that Mr. Chaplin 's films are being barred here and there . This is usual . Our quick guess is that the emotions of the persons instituting the censorship are as follows : 30 per cent for putting Mr. Chaplin off the screen as a possible menace , 70 per cent for putting themselves , in print , plain On the Side of Right . TWO EVIDENCES that the Tunnev influence is striking at the vitals of national ignorance have turned up within the week . One was the chauffeur of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mercury . Drawn thus suddenly from the green paths of erudition , his interest in us as a possible fare was only so-so . The second evidence was reported by a publisher , who said a policeman in full uniform paid a visit to the publishing house to ask for a copy of rules governing auction bridge . WE CONTINUE to hear that Mr. William Randolph Hearst appears determined to embellish California with an ancient Cistercian cloister at the expense of Segovia , Spain , and the Segovian natives appear to he howling at Mr. Hearst , declaring that he has no right to take their cloister even though he has paid for it . The poor Segovians are wasting their breath . At the risk of being funny , we wish to point out that large fractions of the people of America have been howling at Mr. Hearst for more than a generation without influencing him perceptibly . UNFORTUNATELY , on nice bright days pessimism sometimes loses much of its appeal , and one is assailed by pleasant thoughts in spite of oneself . We could not avoid regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof-tops lower than our own . Everybody ( unless he he very rich ) has enjoyed the pleasure of going out into the woods in the morning and seeing in the snow the tracks of the invisible wild things that have gamboled there . So with the roof-tops . No one ever sees anybody on roofs in winter , yet the snow is inevitably marked with tracks a day or so after it has fallen . The conclusion , we suppose , is that we 're all animals anyway . ROADWAY has its moments of glamorous beauty when it shines forth , an amazing spectacle of foolish bright existence , but For every one of OISE ? " these moments there are long dull hours of the day and night when it is as tawdry as Coney at its worst . The latest side-show is the Lucky Strike exhibit at Forty-fifth Street , where cigarettes are manufactured ( step up , folks ) under the horny gaze of a multitude who seem to have come straight from the boardwalk at Atlantic City . Shops along the highway are unnecessarily garish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faces , so it seems , are unnecessarily vulgar . And if ever , in a mighty mood , you should want to look on man 's work and despair , stroll down Broadway about three in the morning when the lights are gone and the dreary street sprawls slant-wise across the town in all the ugly meanness of disuse . Rosa Lewis IT SEEMS that Mrs. Rosa Lewis , 1- known somewhat sweepingly as the Queen of Cooks , has met many sad-faced old preterists who have been gathering each day at her suite in the Ritz to recall the menus of her great dinners served in the day when Victoria 's naughty son was her most lavish patron . Mrs. Lewis divides her time between such reminiscences , it is said , and a frantic search of the telephone book for the numbers of those persons who might be able to purchase the $3,000,000 tapestries she has brought , and when she failed to find Otto Kahn , Marcus Loew or the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in the alphabetical lists she burst into the vehemence of billingsgate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rerengaria ; and , finding no cabs at the dock , is said to have hailed a passing limousine with three young men inside , requesting that she be a-lowed to sit on a lap as far as the Ritz . She got the lap , largely because one of the young bloods recognized her as the proprietor of the Hotel Cavendish in London , out of which he had been thrown no less than four times . MRS . LEWIS began her career , it seems , as a maid for Lady Randolph Churchill at the age of twelve . When King Edward , then the Prince of Wales , tasted her truffles she was made . During his reign she was the favorite of nobility . Retained for a dinner , she would arrive in the morning with twelve assistants and a pupil or two , whom she permitted to watch her for half-a-guinea a day . By evening the servants would be in a panic , the butler 's vocabulary considerably enlarged and a marvelous dinner served . If the affair were stag , custom decreed that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best couturieres for the sake of advertisement , would slip into a place at the table and enchant the company with stories that might not have amused Queen Victoria . She called King Edward and Lord Ribblesdale , among others , by their first names , and served dinners for the Kaiser , Kitchener , the Comte de Paris and Stuyvesant Fish . When the home of Louis Philippe was put up for sale years ago , Mrs. Lewis bought it and opened therein the Hotel Cavendish . Into her stay here she has crowded many things . She has learned Southern recipes from a negro cook , and the secret of graceful old age from Chauncey Depew ; she has acquired an unbelievable appetite for clams , and has reviewed the West Point cadets . But apparently she has one or two things still to learn . The other day , for instance , she held up a bottle of gin which had been presented to her , with the remark : " Oh , this must be good  --  it has a Gordon label . " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule that all student nurses shall be in the hospital by midnight and that when one of the young women of the institution , out for the evening recently , saw by the clock in Columbus Circle that it was a quarter to twelve , she stopped a cab and said excitedly , " Drive fast  --  I have to he in the maternity hospital in fifteen minutes . " " I 'm sorry , lady , " said the driver , " but not in this cab , " and he drove on . Annual WITH " A Pageant of Old New " Orleans " safely launched , Messrs . Howard Greenley , Kenneth Murchison and their architectural comrades will soon get a few days ' rest  --  and then undoubtedly begin thinking up an idea for next year 's pageant . For the annual Beaux Arts Ball is their fling and for months they have been hurrying from luncheon conferences in the Coffee House to the building in Forty-first Street , where the settings were assembled and tinkered , on to the Astor and even , occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , is the one who always writes the scenarios , arranges the color schemes and directs the ballet and the lighting . He is an enthusiastic little man , gray , with waxed moustaches , and the look of a French marquis . He lives in East Fifty-fourth Street and designs houses for famous people , his latest being that of Joseph Duveen at 15 East Ninety-first Street , a house whose Georgian charms and full-length Gainsboroughs have been the talk of all who have visited it since its opening earlier this winter . Mr. Greenley decorates the insides as well as the outsides of the mansions he builds . His also was the Widener Galleries near Philadelphia . Boasting two $500,000 tapestries , the decoration of one small room of this cost over a million dollars . Mr. Greenley once built a theatre in Orange , managed it , wrote plays and produced them there . But apparently such interests do n't hold him as does the Beaux Arts Ball . MR . MURCHISON is as versatile as Mr. Greenley and is perhaps better known  --  partly because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrates on terminals instead of private houses . He had a hand in the Baltimore Union Station , the Munson Line Building and the Gotham Bank Building . He looks like a business man and we have heard it said that he can fit more rooms into a given space than almost anybody else . His versatility is evidenced in the fact that he plays seven musical instruments , belongs to a musicians ' union , and it will be his fun at the Beaux Arts Ball to conduct Markel 's orchestra . He has written the music for the pageant . Historically , the Beaux Arts Ball is a youthful tradition . Only since 1924 has it been annual . The same group , Murchison and Greenley with Whitney Warren , Arthur Ware and a few others , have guided it . The touch that sounds most interesting in this year 's fete is the absinthe bar , a replica of the original of the Rue Royale in New Orleans . So great is the committee 's ambition for authenticity that they have sprayed the walls with paregoric to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a I speakeasy , where two guests were matching for their drinks . The waiter , nervously : " Do n't gamble here , please , gentlemen . The place is full of detectives . " Duty MONG the more exclusive or- ganizations of the city which do n't appear in the club directories is the Sheriff 's Jury , a quasi-mysterious body which is composed of equal parts of gentlemen of wealth and darlings of St. Tammany . It is because terse and totally inadequate announcements of its annual dinners already are appearing in the newspapers that we speak of it at this time . Your sheriff of New York County , in case you have not traced the badge , is Charles Culkin . He has offices in the Hall of Records , from which he dispatches deputies to serve papers of various sorts . The cases he tries are largely those of incompetency and damage assessment in which the defendant does not appear . He listened patiently to the alienation charges against Corliss Palmer , for example . His jury consists of four hundred and fifty men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its obligations , financial and otherwise . They are divided into three panels , each of which serves one month in every three , and meets , during this period of eruption , three times a week . The gatherings take place in the sheriff 's office  --  more or less luxurious ? in the late afternoon . Nominally twelve jurors sit at a time , but six will constitute a quorum . They dispose of official business in comfortable chairs around a large table and then exchange stories before going home . In the old clays cocktails were served . Each member pays an initiation fee of $50 , and until recently there was a fine of $3 for each absence . A new ruling , however , calls for a payment of $50 if a member fails to put in an appearance at least once a month . For a persistent absentee this would bring the total annual cost to around $250 , a sum considered extremely reasonable when it is remembered that the position grants immunity from other jury service . The annual dinners are elaborate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Biltmore , usually with prominent judicial figures as guests , and are provided for out of the initiation fee , fine money and a charge of $25 a plate . Correction THE inaccuracies of the press are always annoying , but there seems to have been a reasonable excuse for the statement in some of the papers that a Boy Scout had been in the human chain which pulled the champion , Mr. Tunney , out of the northern lake into which he dropped a week or so ago when the ice broke . Mr. William B. Powell , who , with two guides , did the rescuing , is only five-feet-two , and as he was in outing costume , the error was , more or less , a natural one . It may be noted , even belatedly , that when the true facts became known Mr. Powell received a telegram reading , " A chain is only as strong as its weakest link , " and that to this he replied , " Better a weak link than a missing one . " Fresh Glorification T T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziegfeld Theatre , which opens next week , at just the right moment the other day , so we can put an end to the terrible rumors which have latch been going about that Mr. Ziegfeld meant to devote this new playhouse to a novel and , for him , untried form of entertainment . With our own eyes we saw disproof ; for as we stumbled backstage we saw the entire hoisting apparatus being installed . The Follies girls , no matter what they are to be called on Sixth Avenue , will keep up the good old tradition of being propelled upward and up on a mounting stage , and if we have any luck , iwe shall all see a little girl in hoopskirts fifty feet long at the opening performance . The plungers or screws , or whatever they are called , which work this mechanism are about twenty feet long and six inches thick , with an enormous threading , and fit into iron tubes resting on solid concrete . They work with a slow dignity which is impressive . Stepping over planks and debris of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will control all the stage lighting  --  the baby spot from the balcony being eliminated by some clever contrivance . We made a hasty count of the various lever- , none of which we understood  --  and figured that if a man could manipulate one with each finger of both hands , the electrical department would not need more than fifty men back stage . We were assured , however , that there is a a master switch which will economize on labor . We had intended to see the mural , designed , like the theatre , by Joseph Urban , and  --  it covers the ceiling  --  called the largest in the world , but we could see only a lot of scaffolding . WHAT WHAT THOUGHTS on art we might have had were dissipated by the discovery of an obscure fact . Across the bulge which represents exteriorly the curve of the stage , are the words , " Ziegfeld Theatre , " and the fifteen letters are not precisely hewn into the stone . No , no . They are , brutally , removable letters . Desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as the theatre belongs to Mr. William Randolph Hearst there seemed to be no compulsion to make permanent the current name . This reminds us of two similar enterprises . One , literally true , concerns Earl Carroll , who , in the dim days when he opened his theatre , carefully worked the initials E. C. into the mosaic , the parquetry , and , in fact , into everything permanent in the building . " No one can get it away from me now , " said Mr. Carroll , the day before it opened , " unless the Engineers ' Club takes it over . " The other report is slightly apocryphal . It concerns Ralph Adams Cram , the most famous of our ecclesiastical architects . Mr. Cram 's lack of sympathy with Protestantism of any sort is well known , and he frequently builds a church with decided ritualistic overtones for a Protestant community . On one such occasion he used , as decorative material for two bronze doors , two groups of heads . On one side  --  it was a Unitarian church according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other notables of the dissenting creed ; on the other were the strict Fathers of the Church . The second group were cast with the door ; the first  --  in Mr. Cram 's anticipation of the building reverting to the true faith  --  were separately cast and so screwed into place that half an hour would easily remove them . News Item THE NEW tango , which is apparently threatening the Black Bottom vogue , is still obviously of the Spanish type , but is less extreme , more dignified and , what with strict instructions to dance apart , more proper generally . The revival has already given birth to an organization , the New Tango Club , which meets , of all places , in a room in the Anderson Galleries every Tuesday night for two hours of serious dancing . In its membership are such as Mrs. Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte , Mrs. Frederick Longfellow and Mrs. Frank Adair ; it leans towards exclusiveness and an older crowd . Among its male members are bankers and brokers and of course a Russian prince or two . Reconstruction CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrator of that notable book of the war , " Fix ? Bayonets , " is , we learn , among the Marines that have landed in Nicaragua ; and we gather from the press that he has the situation well in hand . Put Captain Thomason was not the only Marine painter , not the only leatherneck who walked through the flame of Belleau Wood and came out with some pictures burnt into his memory . Shortly after it was all over , Claggett Wilson , sometime lieutenant of Marines attached to Brigade Headquarters , stopped whatever he was doing and furiously painted eighteen war pictures , modernistic , fascinating , faintly monstrous . Then , with that off his mind , he went mooning off to Spain to paint Basque fishermen bronzed under a lazy sun , and he has more recently been at large in Turkey . But what of the war pictures ? What of that one which reveled in the death of a fat , dissipated Boche bayoneted asprawl in a dainty boudoir ? Or that one of the wounded German sniper hanging grotesquely in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " like a big crippled whippoorwill ? What of them ? Well , it seems they are to be published as a book . Even now the plates are being made in  --  and that is really the point of the story  --  in Germany . 4:1 THE THEATRE GUILD 'S most recent success has to do with a young lady of seventeen , studying in its ? THE NEW YORKER 13 ? dramatic school . Having insufficient funds to pay her way to her home in the South , she bought a half-fare ticket ( for children not over eleven ) . Wearing her hair down her back , shorter skirts than usual , and clutching a copy of St. Nicholas , she boarded a train . Her " uncle , " an older student , personally placed her in the custody of the conductor who agreed to be good to the " little niece , " and the railroad company never once suspected the truth . Porter THE BLACKEST Red Cap at the Grand Central is our authority for the statement that an average day of ? luggage-carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightened up , of course , around Christmas and the high peak of eight dollars was occasionally reached . As the railroad pays the Red Caps absolutely nothing , our black friend pointed out that portering is not a profitable profession for a young man to choose , especially since the boys have to buy their own winter and summer uniforms , at a cost of thirty-four dollars each . Every morning before going on duty for his ten-hour day , the Red Cap must report to one of seven bosses who inspect his manicure and general appearance and who our informant says  --  draw down the lordly salary of twenty dollars a month . The commonor taxi variety of Red Cap gets free passes as far as 125th Street , and at the end of a year of service the New York Central offers him a free trip to Buffalo or Boston , as he may elect . Seniority counts for a lot , and the men who have been there the longest are given the Vanderbilt Avenue taxi entrance . The Forty-second Street side is next in the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that promotion has more glory than cash attached to it , for there is little variation in the tips , wherever one is . The boys meet the trains according to a rotating schedule , so that all may be fair , and are assigned to special positions along the track . Day-coaches can be just as profitable as the Twentieth Century Limited , and the surprising news is advanced that women are more generous than men . A great many of the Red Caps eventually graduate into Pullman porters , and it is from this class that the liberal professions draw their recruits . More than half of the negro lawyers and doctors of today are former Pullman porters . ? COMES WORD FROM THE land of make-believe that a successful fictionist , upon writing a caption which included a reference to the painter Rubens , was told that it would n't do because the public would n't know who Rubens was . An argument ensued , at the end of which a messenger was dispatched through the studio to make a practical test upon the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fictionist was wrong , that of twenty-odd persons to whom he had put the question only one was able to identify Rubens . This man , it appeared , knew him personally ; he kept a delicatessen store in Madison Avenue , New York . ? THE BOOTLEGGERS who have been impersonating baggage-men and stewards of ocean liners with varying degrees of success have now gone further in their chicanery . They obtain passenger-lists of incoming ships , visit returning travelers the day after their arrival , pose as stewards , and offer , fraudulently , of course , " whatever wine you found to your hiking on the voyage . "
