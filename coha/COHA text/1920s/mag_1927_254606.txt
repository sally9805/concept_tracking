Seven weeks ago , Secretary of State Kellogg was pleased to hear that Senor Adolfo Diaz had been elected President of Nicaragua by that republic 's congress in joint session . With startling speed he sent U. S. recognition to President Diaz , a Conservative , an oldtime friend of the U. S. Department of State , who was recently employed by a U. S. mining company for a few dollars per week . Headline readers in the U. S. said : " Is n't it nice that those Nicaraguans are fixed up at last ? " But shrewder observers in Washington and all of Central America knew that President Diaz 's soup was not without sediment . The chief trouble was and still is that Nicaragua has another " legal " President-Dr . Juan Sacasa , Liberal , the Vice President who came into power when President Solorzano resigned a year ago . <P> It was inevitable that these two " legal " Presidents and their backers should do battle . Nicaraguan squabbles are no great cataclysms , since the peacetime strength of their army is 2,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacasa 's Liberals , who were doing well in a military way until Rear Admiral Julian L. Latimer landed U. S. Marines from his flagship , the U. S. S. Rochester , on the Mosquito ( eastern ) Coast of Nicaragua a fortnight ago . Acting on instructions from the Department of State , Rear Admiral Latimer set about to maintain the Bluefields neutral zone , ordered armed forces of both factions not to enter therein , reported that he had the situation well in hand . Presumably , he was on the Mosquito Coast to protect the lives and properties of U. S. citizens. * <P> A more pertinent reason for Rear Admiral Latimer 's presence was the fact that President Diaz 's forces had been defeated by the Liberals . After all , if the U. S. is going to have a protg in Nicaragua , it might as well protect him by armed intervention . <P> Such reasoning caused a flare of protest in Mexico , in South America , in Europe . Last week alarm was sounded in Washington . President Coolidge 's Official Spokesman said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wilbur ; they conferred for two hours . Nothing was announced . Rear Admiral Latimer remained on duty in Nicaragua . Senators and outsiders kept the question heated . <P> Senator Borah , of Idaho , Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , likes to be a severe critic as well as a maker of U. S. foreign policy . On most afternoons at 3 p.m. , he holds an informal chat with the gentlemen of the press . Interjecting a little profanity and rustling the disordered documents on his desk , he discusses anything from murder trials to Nicaragua . Fortnight ago , he was vituperative concerning U. S. intervention in Nicaragua . Early last week , he was secretively dramatic , said : " I think it is well recognized that the Nicaraguan revolution is being instigated by certain persons in Washington who are not Nicaraguans , and this is for business and other reasons . It is well known that there are eight or ten men in Washington who make a living off of these rows in Latin-American countries and put out a lot of propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
