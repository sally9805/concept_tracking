Heavy fighting in Morocco was last week reported by the French in the Jehad ( holy war ) declared by Abdel-el-Krim , " Sultan " of the Riffians ( TIME , May 11 , 18 ) . <P> The Riffians had advanced along a hundred mile front to the River Vergha on the east . Concentrations at either end , which apparently were preparing for a converging offensive with Fez as their objective , were detected . <P> This evidently decided General Comte de Chambrum to send General Colombat forward to storm the heights of Bibane , midway along the front . The attack was launched with a suddenness that surprised the Riffians ; and , in a magnificent action supported by the troops of Colonel Freydenberg , the heights were captured ! For the time being , this strategy destroyed the enemy plans for flank offensives and the Riffians began to concentrate in the centre for a counter offensive . <P> The fighting is complicated ( from the French point of view ) by two factors . In the first place , the country is mountainous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the French have had much experience of this type of warfare the advantage is with the Riffian who are natural mountain fighters . <P> More serious is the problem raised by the Spanish protectorate over a strip of northern Morocco . According to the Treaty of Madrid ( 1912 ; France recognized the right of Spain to administer a zone 200 mi. long and about 60 deep , running from the sea nearby to the Algerian border . In the present war , therefore , the French can not advance , and airplanes must not fly over the Spanish zone . This , in turn , has meant that Abd-el-Krim 's troops could attack at will , but , inside their own territory , could not be attacked . Naturally , such a situation placed the French at a great disadvantage . <P> To Madrid , however , Premier Paul Painleve sent Deputy Louis Malvy , onetime Minister of the Interior , banished from France for a species of malfeasance labeled as gross negligence in the performance of his official duties . While in exile , M. Malvy lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus thought the most suitable person to undertake a mission to General Primo Rivera , head of the Spanish Military Directory , for the purpose of obtaining Spanish consent for , or cooperation in , a French advance into the Riff country with the object of subduing their mutual enemy , Abd-el-Krim.
