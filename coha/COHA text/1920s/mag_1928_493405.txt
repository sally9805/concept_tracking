R EPORTS from Washington indicate that Presi ? dent Coolidge intends to make another effort to get the United States into the World Court , before his term of office expires on the fourth of next March . Inspired , no doubt , by the fact that Mr. Hughes is now a judge of that court , and by the obvious neces ? sity , if the Kellogg Pact should he ratified , of hav- ing some sort of international tribunal to which the United States can submit the disputes about which it has agreed not to go to war , he proposes to take up with the foreign powers the question of a pos ? sible compromise which will break the present dead ? lock . It will be remembered that the Senate , when it voted for adherence to the World Court , at ? tached five reservations . Four of these were com ? paratively unimportant , but the fifth said that the court must not , without our consent , " entertain any request for an advisory opinion touching any dis ? pute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . " To this phraseology there was such grave objection by the other powers that the whole question of American adherence has beendropped . There is no reason to believe that these powers have since changed their minds ; and it is also extremely unlikely that the Senate could be induced at the coming short session to modify or withdraw its reservation . WHILE the New Republic would like to see the United States enter the World Court , it believes that it would be a mistake for President Coolidge to seek to crowd the matter through at the coming short session . The necessary negotiations with the foreign powers will be both difficult and lengthy , and it is unlikely that they could be brought any ? where near a conclusion before Congress adjourns on March 4 . Even if this were possible , with the Boulder Dam bill , the appropriation measures , the Kellogg Treaty , farm relief and the cruiser bill on its hands , Congress has all and more than it can accomplish in ninety days . While our absence from the court is regrettable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to our seven years of abstention , rather than to risk imperilling the enterprise still more gravely , by an attempt to obtain hasty action . Mr. Coolidge 's desire to go out in a blaze of glory is natural and commendable ; but in this case it would be wiser to let Mr. Hoover see what he can do with the new Congress , over which he will exercise a much increased degree of control . IT CAN NOT be too strongly emphasized that the naval disagreement between the United States and Great Britain is not a quarrel over cruisers but over the freedom of the seas . The British Admiralty contemplates future conflicts in which England will be a participant , and will wish to control neutral shipping as she did in the Great War ? in order to starve out the enemy . The American Government expects to be a neutral , and wants the right to ship non-contraband cargoes when and where we please . It is clear that there can be no effective limitation of naval armament until this impasse is surmounted . A concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves consideration . It is put forward by Mr. Charles P. Howland in his book , " Survey of American Foreign Relations , 1928 , " ( The Yale University Press ) . Mr. Howland , a distinguished American attorney and a leading spirit in the For sign Policy Association and the Council on Foreign Relations , suggests a compromise which would mean some sacrifice by both sides . He distinguishes between " private wars , " of the old familiar variety , and " public wars , " undertaken through the League , the Locarno treaties or some similar agency . In the case of a private war , he suggests that the pow ? ers agree not to interfere with non-contraband neutral commerce . In case of a public war , they should agree temporarily to surrender " the tradi ? tional rights of neutral trade . " The first proposal would mean a sacrifice by Great Britain , and the second , one by the United States , but Mr. How ? land believes that both are within the scope of political possibility . IF WE look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in advance of a war , . as to conduct during a war , has very much force . We learned ten years ago that any nation will break its most solemn pledges if that is neces ? sary to win . The advantage of such an agreement as Mr. Howland proposes would result , not from its application in war time , but in its effect upon naval competition in times of peace . It would make it far more difficult for the big-navy advocates to demand building in pursuit of a highly hypothetical ideal of " parity " ; it would deflate the notions , on both sides of the Atlantic , as to the size of the fleet which is " necessary . " It offers a line of approach to this most difficult problem which certainly ought not to be passed by without the fullest exploration . THE organization of a protective tariff league by certain unions which believe their members are affected by foreign competition is an interesting development in the tendency of labor to accept un ? critically the ideas passed on to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate gains without re ? gard to broad labor policy . We have little doubt that employment in some industries suffers from increasing sales of foreign goods in this country . But the figures presented by this labor league scarcely furnish convincing proof that too low a tariff is at fault , or that they would benefit from higher duties . Is there a difference in price between the American product and the foreign , or is the foreign purchased because of its quality and appeal ? if there is a difference in price , is it due to differ ? ences in production cost ? If so , could production cost here be reduced by more efficient methods ? Or is the high cost of the American product attribu ? table , perhaps , not so much to American wages as to the high cost of the material , which in turn arises from too high a tariff ? If the price of the domestic article should be raised by protection , would the public buy as much of it ? Assuming that all these questions were answered in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular workmen would really be advanced by higher duties , what about the interests of the workmen employed in in ? dustries that can not be protected , like railroads , building and coal , or in industries whose expansion depends on their ability to sell cheaply abroad , and hence are more harmed than helped by the protec ? tive system ? We can imagine nothing better cal ? culated to split the labor movement than a division of unions on the basis of real understanding of their immediate interests in low or high duties . TARIFF truths have a habit of being obscured if ( we look at them solely from one side of a national boundary . It was pointed out during the campaign that the increase in the wheat tariff had reduced the import of Canadian wheat , and the inference was drawn that our farmers had benefitted . But the Manitoba Free Press points out that the Canadian wheat denied entry to the United States must go elsewhere for a market . It goes , of course , mainly to Europe , where it helps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend . It is also true that the Canadian agricultural regions form one of the best markets for industrial pro ? ducers in the United States , whose employees , in turn , buy farm products grown in this country as well as elsewhere . What is to be gained by im ? peding this triangular exchange ? If it is wise for the United States to bar out Canadian farm products , it would have been equally wise for the Eastern Seaboard States in this country years ago to bar out competition from the agricultural production of the new West , thus protecting the farmers of the East . Indeed , this logic leads us to the absurd conclusion that the United States would be more prosperous today if it were not the United States , but an array of thirty or forty little countries , each surrounded by its big tariff wall . BOSTON continues to run true to form . It has just refused to permit the production of " Gods of the Lightning , " the striking play by Maxwell Ander ? son and Harold Hickerson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer , not wishing to risk running foul of the law after he had spent time and money in moving the play from New York to Boston , submitted the manuscript in advance to the city officials . Under ' date of November 19 , Frank S. Deland , Corpora ? tion Counsel , wrote a letter to John M. Casey , Chief of the City Licensing Division , which the latter transmitted to Mr. MacFadden as the official verdict of the city government on the play . It said : Unless changeS are made in the various passages of the manuscript wherein the name of the Lord is used in such a manner as to be obnoxious to any one , whether he be believer or otherwise , and which in many instances borders on the blasphemous , you would in duty be bound to recommend to the statutory board or officials who pass upon the suspension of theater licenses that the license of any theater which allows this performance to be shown in this city be revoked if such passages were allowed to remain after a first ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this manuscript that are so condemnatory of our government , its form , its practices and its officials , both national and state , that it would require but a little stretch of the imag ? ination to term them anarchistic and treasonable . The whole play , it seems to me , is an attempt , while de ? picting the recent trial of Sacco and Vanzetti in Massachusetts , to bring into disrepute our judicial system and our judicial officers , especially those officials who participated in the Sacco-Vanzetti trial . It is unfair to them and only tends to hold them up to ridicule and to unfairness . It is in reality a dishonest attack upon our courts and our judicial system . I do not believe it is worthy of a place on any Amer ? ican stage , more especially a Boston stage . In my opinion the producers should be notified that their play does not meet with your favor and probably will not meet with the favor of the statutory board on licenses in this city . WE SHALL not pretend a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the main it is just what was to be expected from a Boston official , and we are aware of no evidence that the attitude it expresses is not satisfactory to a majority of the citizens of that community , however violently it may distress a minority . This letter raises , how ? ever , one interesting point . The " anarchistic and treasonable " passages to which the Corporation Counsel refers are uttered by characters in the play ; these characters are extreme radicals in whose mouths such statements are as natural as they are necessary to the working out of the story . Mr. Deland 's ruling means that any author who expects his work to be put before the Boston public must either leave radical thinkers out of his cast of char ? acters , or must prettify their speech out of all recog ? nition . These alternatives may be hard on art ; but what is art between Bostonians ? More fundamental is the question whether the Massachusetts idea of good government has sunk so low that an attack upon our courts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censors . Or are we to rely upon the judgment of the official to discrimi ? nate between " honest " and , therefore , allowable attacks , and " dishonest " ones ? THE MOST interesting news to come from Japan in many a day is that the government of that coun ? try is now seriously considering the relation of birth control to population growth and food supply . There is an official Commission on Population and Food , which met not long ago at the official resi ? dence of the Premier and considered what ought to be the official attitude of the government toward birth control and eugenics . As sometimes happens with committees in the occidental world , this one was unable to come to any agreement and referred the problem to a subcommittee which was instructed to make a careful study and report its findings . Among the subjects with which this subcommittee is now wrestling are these : I. Should birth control be advocated as a solution to the nations population problem ? 2 . Is it advisable to limit by legal procedure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 3 . Is it not advisable to exercise police supervision over the present so-called information offices on birth control , and over the chemicals and instruments sold by various drug stores and other places for contra ? ception , apart from the question as to whether or not birth control is advisable from the national standpoint ? OVERPOPULATION is a more serious menace to Japan just now than to any other country in the world . Her 60,000,000 inhabitants are crowded into a country not much larger than Montana , five-sixths of which consists of non-arable soil . Modern science has reduced her death-rate while her birth-rate still continues very large , the result being an annual in ? crement of nearly a million , at the highest rate per 1,000 of population found in any civilized country . The greater part of her people live under condi ? tions of utter poverty , and the outlook seems to be that these will grow . Emigration is no answer ; contrary to the opinion of Californians , the Japa ? nese dislike to emigrate and will only do so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in climate and general conditions , rather closely re ? sembles Japan . There are no such countries which will permit immigration in sufficient numbers to have any effect on the situation at home ; as soon as the Japanese arrivals become sufficiently numer ? ous to offer serious competition with the natives , the bars are sure to go up . Under these circum ? stances , the only possible solution is voluntary re ? striction of population growth through birth con ? trol . But to this there have in the past been three strong obstacles : religious opposition , the Japanese tradition in favor of large families , and the hostility of the government which , like Germany in the days of the Kaiser , has wanted plenty of strong sons for soldiers . It will take many years , no doubt , to overcome the first two of these factors , but there is no alternative . Withdrawal of the government 's opposition is a necessary first step , and therefore the fact that an official commission is now seriously studying the subject is a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ONE of the bills before the next Congress which is likely to attract the most attention from labor and liberals is the Shipstead-La Guardia anti-injunction measure , probably much modified in committee to meet the views of legal authorities . The cam ? paign has shed little light on this issue . The Re ? publican platform declared in general terms that the abuse of the injunction demanded consideration . The Democratic platform , in slightly less general terms , promised to remedy the abuse . Mr. Hoover did not mention the subject ; Mr. Smith did so , but did not specify what sort of remedy he favored . We doubt if Mr. Hoover is much interested in the matter ; Mr. Smith 's failure to specify was probably due to the fact that many labor leaders demand legislation completely forbidding the use of the in ? junction in labor disputes , while legal authorities point out that such a law would certainly be upset by the courts . The Socialist candidate apparently took the extreme position in the matter , knowing that by no chance would he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting labor 's views , would go the way of the injunction provisions-of the Clayton Act ? that is , repeal by judicial in ? terpretation . T HE inaction of the past administration in economic projects affecting the welfare of the people has seldom been better revealed than by the extensive publicity and comment given to Mr. Hoover 's intention , announced to the annual meet ? ing of governors through Governor Brewster of Maine , to promote industrial stability and relieve unemployment crises by accumulating a reserve of funds for public construction . The news stories , and most of the comment , read as if this were a brand-new idea sprung full-armored from the engineering brain . Yet there was not an iota of genuine news interest in the idea itself . It had been proposed years ago by economists ; it was one of the recommendations of the President 's Conference on Unemployment in 1922 ; it had been embodied in a bill introduced into Congress session after session , without result , by Senator Jones ; Senator Wagner of New York argued for it last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; organiza ? tions like the American Association for Labor Legislation and even the American Federation of Labor have steadfastly attempted , without success , to arouse public and official interest in it . The news value of the incident was clearly not attribut ? able to any novelty in the idea , it arose merely from the fact that at last a President actually seemed about to commit himself to a measure of economic amelioration . This is , indeed , an occasion for rejoicing , but be ? fore the joy becomes exuberant it may be well to wait for the concrete embodiment of the idea . It will require carefully drafted legislation , and really expert administration , before it can be effective . The executive can not , within his own authority , do much either to retard or to hurry construction pro ? jects . If the proposal is merely to wait until de ? pression and unemployment are visible , and then to call for increased appropriations from Congress , the depression may well be over before Congress meets , the appropriation bills are passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the work is actually started . It would be necessary to secure from Congress advance appropriations for much more construction work than is immediately neces ? sary . The authority to spend the money madeavailable by these appropriations would have to extend over several years , instead of merely for one , as is now customary . The projects authorized in advance , while not of the sort needed at once , ought to be useful ; they ought to add to the real wealth of the country rather than being mere de ? vices to get rid of public funds . This implies a far-seeing construction program . Such a program can not well be an accident , a resultant of miscellaneous demands from the vari ? ous departments and bureaus , or from the con ? stituencies of the several Congressmen and Senators . In order to formulate it , there ought to be a Board of National Development ? a body of engineers and economists who could lay out for years ahead a tentative program of useful public works , embrac ? ing in its range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , power projects , re ? clamation developments , forest and park enlarge ? ments , and all the other capital expenditures of government . When such a program of expendi ? tures is found advisable for a city , the use of public funds can not be considered alone . The probable and the advisable future growth of the city are - considered ; its industries , its housing , its means of transportation , its terminals , its recreation facilities and all the other components of its common life are studied in order to draw up a city plan which may gradually be worked out with a view to the needs of the future . Is it too much to hope that the legislation for a national construction reserve will carry with it an agency to develop a nation plan ? Once the plan is worked out , and the money appropriated in advance , the task is only begun . Then comes the duty of deciding which project to take up next , when to hasten expenditures and when to retard them . Even a man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely except on the basis of accurate , prompt and detailed statistical information concerning economic conditions . Such information is already available concerning certain aspects of business , but it is notoriously lacking concerning others , and in no field is it more scanty than in regard to the volume , nature and localities of unemployment . Experts are agreed that the only sure way to obtain good figures on unemployment is through the establish ? ment , under Federal coordination , of a nation-wide system of free , public employment exchanges , at which those looking for jobs would register . This must be an integral part of any comprehensive plan to relieve the jobless . It is ironical that the Ameri ? can Engineering Council the other day approved the construction reserve idea , but rejected this , as well as other plans , for obtaining current information . We shall wait with interest to see whether this sort of inanity characterizes the thinking of the engineer ? ing profession as a whole , and of Mr. Hoover , on the subject . So far , we have assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work would
