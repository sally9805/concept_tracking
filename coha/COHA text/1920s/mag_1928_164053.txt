When John William Davis , technical present-day head of the Democratic Party by virtue of his 1924 nomination , was a smiling cherub in a baby-basket at Clarksburg , West Va. , another young male of that village was already romping lustily in the pantalettes of the period and beginning to play " soldiers . " It was just after the Civil War , a martial moment . Young Guy Despard Goff , six years John Davis 's senior , was sent to Kenyon Military Academy , up at Gambier , Ohio . Later he went to Harvard and became a lawyer , practicing in Boston first , then Milwaukee . Perhaps he wished , as the years went by , that circumstances had permitted him to remain in Clarksburg , the way John William Davis did . <P> After practicing law locally with West Virginia coal men for his clients , John William Davis became internationally famed . He went to Congress for four years , then was U. S. Solicitor General , then went to the Court of St. James 's as U. S. Ambassador ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rise beyond a district attorney 's office until the Harding regime , when he became Harry Micajah Daugherty 's Assistant Attorney General . He only reached the U. S. Senate in 1925 . By that time John William Davis , his younger fellow-townsman , was foremost Democrat in the land . Guy Despard Goff , as it happens , is a Republican , so no real rivalry exists . But if Guy Despard Goff had stayed in Clarksburg , he too might have been a Democrat , perhaps head Democrat . <P> There is , however , a law of compensation . Last week Guy Despard Goff reached out for the honor , almost as high as any John William Davis ever had , of standing forth as West Virginia 's candidate for the G. O. P. candidacy . He entered his name for the West Virginia presidential primary at the end of May . The likelihood of his accomplishing anything at Kansas City in June was about as remote as Mr. Davis 's chance of winning the 1924 election now by a recount . Nevertheless , Guy Despard Goff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Senator Watson is Indiana 's and Senator Curtis is Kansas ' and the late Senator Willis was Ohio 's . <P> West Virginia 's votes for Goff will be a tribute to a well-disciplined Old Guardsman . They will remove the last trace of the disrepute which Guardsman Goff suffered from his connection with the Alien Property scandals under Attorney General Daugherty . Other reasons for the gesture will be to head off Hooverism in West Virginia and to carry on a State tradition . West Virginia Republicans almost always have a Favorite Son . In 1920 it was Howard Sutherland , the coal man from Elkins who sat in the Senate from 1917 to 1923 and is now U. S. Alien Property Custodian . <P> Said Candidate Goff : " I am not and have never been a stalking horse . "
