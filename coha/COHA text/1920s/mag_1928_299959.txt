It was what is called an uneventful trip . The ship ( long , tall , narrow , beautiful Ile de France ) lurched . There were no accidents ( except for 200 chairs and 12 people which toppled upon each other at a cinema ) , no thefts , no speed records . <P> There were no more than a normal number of celebrities . One of them met , shook hands with 22 Smith College girls . He and his wife inspected the ship . He liked the Punch and Judy shows ; she , the kitchen . Stewards , officers knew who they were . Many passengers did not . They were Mr. and Mrs. Frank Billings Kellogg , en route to Paris . <P> Before they reached Paris , the ship paused , lights twinkling , at Plymouth , England . Plymouthites boarded , cheered Mr. Kellogg , cheered Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , also a passenger . <P> Then spoke Secretary of State Kellogg : " I believe it is a great step forward in civilization-a great moral step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a document known as The Multilateral Treaty to Renounce War as an Instrument of National Policy-Author : Mr. Kellogg . The ship then moved on . <P> Before he could reach Paris , Mr. Kellogg had to go to Havre . He stood on the deck , last week , as the ship slipped into the narrow harbor . From where he stood , he could see , at the right , the houses of Havre which seem flat like the backdrop of a theatre . He could also see , to the East , the sun . He could not see an object upon which the sun 's rays were playing . <P> But later he was presented with that very object by M. Lon Meyer , Mayor of Havre . It was a gold pen , nearly a foot long , a half inch in diameter , surmounted by a turquoise , and made by famed Jeweler Andr Falize of Paris . Visitor Kellogg accepted it graciously , found it heavy , noticed his initials engraved upon it , and read the inscription on its green leather case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Peace , prepare for Peace ) . <P> Again spoke the U. S. Secretary of State , making a reference to French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand , granting him inspirational credit in the authorship of the treaty . Twenty-five minutes later Mr. Kellogg was in a train which rattled into the Gare St.-Lazare , Paris , 45 minutes ahead of schedule , to the discomfiture of newsmen , of whom only one , forlorn , was present . U. S. Ambassador Myron Timothy Herrick , prominent welcomer , arrived at the station late . <P> Paris made a brave show of tricolor and stars and stripes , and Montmartre , glad of an excuse , opened earlier , closed later . <P> But Mr. Kellogg chose to go to the American hospital at Neuilly , near Paris , there to call on U. S. Chief of the Division of Western European Affairs James Theodore Marriner of Visitor Kellogg 's own Department of State , paver of the Kellogg way into Paris , and shortly after seriously ill . <P> Thereafter Mr. Kellogg lunched with Ambassador Herrick , spoke with M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again dined at the Herrick table , and so to bed . <P> Pleased was France the next day when Mr. Kellogg knelt unostentatiously at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier , under the Arc de Triomphe.
