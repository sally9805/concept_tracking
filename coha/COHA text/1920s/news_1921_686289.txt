txt Thotigh the World War is practically ? over , in spite of our failure to conclude peace with Germany , the overwhelming disorder , moral , economical and financial , produced by it not only is not healed yet , but it will remain in this deplorable state at least lei ' half a century to come unless some . great countries realize that other sacrifices than blood are yet Imperative . Is it not a strange thing that men appear to be easier to be moved and more ready to sacrifice their lives for some great cause than their gold ? And . yet such is the case . It was an eternal glory of our country to step boldly into the great European struggle and to help twenty-odd nations to subdue the mad Huns , and thus to save liberty and civilization . But that is not enough . Europe is yet bleeding , and the danger of its collapse is not yet deTinitely avci ted . This time it is not our blood that is needed ; no , it is our gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic ' France , which suffered most and did most to save the world , will never be fully repaid or her losses made good , even if Germany repents and does her utmost to repair the evil done by her , for the harm done to France by Germany surpasses infinitely all German means . Therefore we must step in to help yet bleeding France . Then Belgium fully deserves and also needs our assistance . Then Italy 's case must be favorably considered . Then Serbia , depopulated and ruined for no cause of hers , is entitled to our help . Then Poland , though resuscitated , is yet far from being secure in it free existence . All these count end our help , ottr gold largely accun ted while they were lighting our battle . Thus cancellation of our credits to our Allies is a moral duty . Are we equal to that moral call on us ? Time is over for heroic deeds . Now it Is a time for an unprecedented charity .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
