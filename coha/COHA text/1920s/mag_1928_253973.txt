Governor William H. Adams of Colorado and Oliver Henry Shoup , who was Governor before him ( 1919-23 ) , swung sledges last week to drive a spike into a railroad tie under the Continental Divide west of Denver . The spike was a golden one and the two laborers made speeches . Mayor John F. Bowman of Salt Lake City made a speech , representing Governor George H. Dern of Utah . Then 2,500 people , on four special trains , rode forth and back through the six-mile Moffat tunnel thus formally opened . The tunnel connects Denver and the " near West " with the vast , enormously rich western part of Colorado , southern Wyoming , eastern Utah .
