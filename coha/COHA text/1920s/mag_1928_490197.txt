CRAZED by the immediate success of Meridian 1212 , the Telephone Company is dumbly wondering why it never thought of an idea like that before . To the company it seems a little miraculous that people are willing to pay five cents to find out what time it is . In our opinion the phone folks are silly to stop where they do ; time is not the only thing citizens wonder about . Why not a phone exchange to answer questions concerning when she entered Kingston harbor . That was done , and the peace emissary , clutching the original text of the treaty , stepped ashore through the bristling gray cannon . Meanwhile , further steps toward world peace were being taken by Germany , a successful test having been made of an automatic radio battleship which sails to battle in lonely and premeditated hate , and destroys at a distance . " The act , " wrote President Doumergue to President Coolidge , " responds to the innermost longings of all mankind .

His three operas that made last year such a lively age to he living and playing the harmonica in , did not make money . " Iolanthe " did , but it had to pay the debts of the other two . The financial unsuccess of the Ames revivals is , we fear , an acid test for these hoary pieces . If Mr. Ames ca n't do it , who can ? Probably nobody can except in a modest way and at decent intervals . Maybe one mistake ( if you call last year a mistake ) was to put on three operas instead of just one . Revivals , like paste , should be spread thinly to be most effective . If Mr. Ames will please produce " Princess Ida " this year , we personally will buy the entire costume for one soldier , engage two seats on the aisle for alternate Tuesdays , and request the United States Government to fly the Los Angeles over the city every night with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sum-VV mon , we await the next report of the Budget Bureau telling us that there is a federal deficit for the fiscal year 1928-29 . Tears welled up in our eyes as we read the bureau 's current report and saw how everybody was pinching and squeezing to make ends meet . Clerks are using lead pencils until the stems arc so short they cramp the Fingers ; paper drinking cups have gone by the board and old-fashioned cups are hack ; infantry leggings , instead of being thrown away when worn out , are patched with leather and given to cavalry troops , regardless of embarrassment to the horses ; instead of buying mops for public buildings , the government makes mops itself ( presumably out of the remains of old employees ) ; and , most pathetic of all , the government has taken to regilding the buttons on army uniforms . Through these hard times , the spirit shown has been wonderful .

New Engines for Old NHarmon you can see romantic yesterday meeting matter-of-fact today . Harmon is where steam locomotives and electric locomotives change places . We saw a steam engine standing on a siding beside an electric engine . The two engineers were leaning from their respective cabs . The steam engineer 's face was streaked with coal grime , his hands were dirty ; he wore overalls , and they were dirty too . The other was as natty a fellow as you would see in an afternoon in town . To begin with , he was much younger , and he wore a dark pin-stripe suit , a starched and spotless collar , and a straw hat with a red and blue band . There was no conversation between the two . Invaders T T turns out that only one of the I- members of the Argentine polo team , Manuel Andrada , is an Argentine of the usual Latin ancestry . The others , oddly , are all of British background . Andrada is the hardest of the players to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he prefers the play- ? ing field and the pony stables to getting about with people at Rumson and Westbury . Like all but one of the better known Argentine players , he is a wealthy rancher ( Lewis Lacey is the exception ; he conducts a sporting-goods business in Buenos Aires ) . Andrada makes a more impressive appearance on the field than most players . He weighs more than two hundred pounds , has a great shock of wiry black hair , and has sometimes been mistaken for the burly Argentine prize fighter , Luis Firpo . Incidentally , we arc told that Andrada is a greater hero to South American sports followers than Firpo was . He has supplied the most picturesque touch of the invasion , too . He has presided over an informal barbecue or two , roasting whole lambs over a fire , slicing off the meat with a great bowie knife . Indoor parties bore him .

He owns several estancias in various provinces of the Argentine , the largest comprising forty thousand acres . His father was a restless Irishman who went to the At --  gentine on a hunting trip and de-cided to stay . He became one of the wealthiest ranchers in the country . Jack was born there . His interests keep him busy , for in addition to caring for his several hundred blooded polo ponies , he must ride out to survey fifteen thousand cattle , most of them pedigreed stock , and five thousand pigs of distinguished lineage . At one of his ranches , Estancia San Marcos in Chacabuco , he maintains a private polo field , tennis courts , and a swim-ming pool , A few years ago he enter-tained the Prince of Wales there . In appearance he is of slight build and talks in a high-pitched voice . He is one of the hardest and most daring of players .

Kenny has the unique distinction of wearing neat nose-glasses when he plays . He has never broken them , and says they bother him only when they cloud up-during the stress of a game . A ranch-man of means , he has played polo for many years and was on the Argentine Olympic team which defeated Tommy Hitchcock 's Americans at Paris in 1924 . His string of ponies is one of the finest , being ninety per cent thoroughbred . Mr. Lacey is of course the best known of the men as a player . He is one of the four ten-goal men in the world . His playing in recent years has been attended by a train of misfortunes , including two serious falls and two attacks of illness .

This particular officer has a dark , attractive beard , very interesting to stroke , it would seem . The cop trrinned . " Go on , both of ye , " he said , and people who had been watching the scene from a bus relaxed . Locking the Gates THE Times Square subway station may seem as free of access as Central Park , yet it can he shut down , almost hermetically sealed , in twenty-two seconds . NVe have this direct from the fellow who can do it , Mr. Richard Schaake , whose title is Station Master . Observant persons may have seen Mr. Schaake at his post . Ordinarily he is stationed beside a telephone and a row of push-buttons mounted on the wall at the mouth of the long passageway leading into the heart of the station from the Forty-first Street entrance . The wreck a week or so ago near Mr. Schaake 's post of duty was one of the crises in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as quickly as he could and close all the many entrances to the station . That was unprecedented , but in the course of a year , there are many minor emergencies . This is what happens when one arises : Mr. Schaake gets word over his phone from trained observers stationed on the various platforms that something has gone wrong and that the crowds are coming in faster than they are being carried out . He at once manipulates his push-buttons . Each of these communicates with an agent stationed at one of the entrances . These agents in their turn press buttons and throw switches , the machinery of the turnstiles locks , and change-men come out of their booths and drop hoods over the nickel-slots . No one can enter . After enough trains have arrived and departed to carry away the " danger load , " the gates are unlocked . Suen exigencies can be caused by a thunder storm at a rush hour , and by the breaking up of parades and such . Trick MR . MOSES DY KAAR7 the sculptor who came here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen and others , has written up his recollections of some of the more remarkable sittings . To Mr. Coolidge , who sat for him off and on for two months , he has given considerable space , but we happen to know that he omitted one interesting occurrence . Toward the end of the sittings it seems that the President became quite genial and exchanged jokes with the sculptor . We have this from a friend of Mr. Dykaar . One day , after a few mild pleasantries had passed back and forth , Mr. Coolidge said , " Now we will have some real fun . " At this the sculptor looked up , and was surprised to see the President making strange grimaces and getting a little purple in the face . He was wiggling- his ears . Tap Dancer TT has not been unusual for persons too fidgety to sit through a whole show on a hot night to drop into the negro show at the Liberty Theatre at about twenty minutes past ten to see the tap dancing of Hill Robinson . Most of Robinson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has been appearing professionally since 1886 . He has been mostly in vaudeville , and it was here that he perfected his notable dance up and down a flight of steps . Incidentally , he taught Fred Stone how to do this , or a new variation of it , and Stone was to have done it this season . Robinson has been worried lately about people stealing his stuff . Not long ago he inserted a full-page adver14 SEVTEMDER 8 , 19 28 tisement in a theatrical piper warning other dancers to " keep off his routine , " and he recently had his stair dance recorded in a movietnne with the idea of registering it at the Patent Office . He gets a degree of protection , however , in the fact that few of his Contempt ) ra ries will attempt his more intricate stunts . The secret of his art , he thinks , is that he dances " close to the ground , " lifting-the soles of his shoes only very slightly from the floor . One night Robinson was heckled at a most difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted at him from the audience , " Huw about Al Smith ? , " a query which the disturber repeated a number of times . Bill smilingly silenced his heckler by working a chant of the words " Al Smith " into tic rhythm of his dance . Robinson 's friends say he could have been a great sprinter . Unofficially , he has ran the hundred-yard dash in ten and one-fifth seconds . He also claims , presumably for what it is worth , the world 's record for running the seventy-five-yard dash backwards . His special hobby seems to he the purchase of fine gems for his wife , whom he married about seven years ago . His latest gift to her was a diamond necklace bought in Paris . Mrs. Whiskey IT is a pleasure to note that the speakeasy proprietor , like the legendary bartender , has a broad streak of sentiment and tenderness . In the West Forties , we are told , lives a speakeasy cat with a fine brood of five speakeasy kittens . The entire family , the younger generation now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an otherwise empty Canada Dry case in back of the bar . While the regular customers partake of doubtful beer and unpedigreed liquors , the guileless kittens dine al fresco in the mariner of kittens for probably a good many years antedating speakeasies . At such times the owner of the place brooks no interference with their meals , although between times the customers are permitted to lift them gently to the bar and play with them . Their nomenclature is also interesting . The dusky mother of the brood ( four out of five of her offspring are tiger-striped ) is an old resident and has lonig horn the name Pew of Whiskey . Quite appropriately her children have been given derivative names  --  Sling , Soar , Punch , Tenor , and And Soda . Mess T negro cook on the sixty-foot boat of a New York man is noted wit only for his cooking but also for his respectful servility . One of a party of eighteen gentlemen who dined aboard the boat off New London last Saturday pushed hack his chair and complimented his host on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was not a dinner , you poor landlubber , " corrected the host , " that was a mess , was n't it , Sam ? " " Yessah , " said Sam , " Ah 'll try to do hettah nex ' time . " Spirited matches are frequently played on the hoard at the Brooklyn Tennis Club by such men as Tilden , Vincent Richards , and the Kinseys . They stand a yard or two from the back edge of the table and use full-arm drives and full-volley shots  --  that is , hitting the ball before it bounces , a practice which would have moved a host of the nineties to call the police . One of the best known " courts " in the city is at 250 West Fifty-fourth Street , in the atelier of the Art Guild , the organization which decorates the Hippodrome lobby and other theatre lobbies when it is n't playing ping pang .

SOMetilneS One 's Lonely As he sat on a bench along the Mall , feasting his eyes on the statuary , a woman with a parrot perched on her finger passed one of our confidential agents . The latter got up and followed , scenting a story . He heard her making cooing observations to the par-rot and calling it by name  --  Ambrose Bierce was the name . Well , the trail led to the zoo in the park , and to the bird house , and to one corner of the bird house , where gather in noisy and brilliant meeting the cockatoos and the macaws .

With some of them he had become quite good friends , although he differed from them , our agent concluded from the shouting , in politics . There Were Giants NOW and then the superintendent of workmen at the Polo Grounds grunts a small " humpf " when some young pitcher weakens , and sometimes the night watchman grins a funny grin at the picture in the sports pages of some great batsman who has made two home runs in one game . These two attendants at the Giants ' baseball field are old hall players themselves . The superintendent of workmen is Amos Rusie , and quite a few followers of baseball know who he was . In the nineties he was one of the greatest pitchers in the world . No pitcher since then has struck out as many hatters as Rusie did in his time . Probably none15 of them expects to . Some experts say he pitched a baseball faster than anyone who ever lived . The night watchman smiles about making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself belongs to the little group of men who made three in one game . He remembers the day ; it will be forty-two years ago come September 10 . This old player 's name is Dennis L. Brouthers . He belonged to that famous team , the Baltimore Orioles , which certain testy old gentlemen contend was the only important baseball team there ever has been in the United States . Forty-six years ago Mr. Brouthers became the leading batsman in the National League . He held this distinction off and on for ten or fifteen years . Mr. John McGraw , the manager of the Giants , gave Rusie his present job because Rusie helped make the Giants a famous team . ( Some oldsters wo n't let you use any other Giant pitcher 's name in the same breath with Rusie , except perhaps Christy Mathewson . ) When Mr. Brouthers was first baseman on the Orioles , Mr. McGraw was on third base , the late Hughie Jennings played shortstop , and Willard Robinson , Brooklyn manager now , was catcher . There are other stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McGraw  --  Hans Lobert , once a third baseman for the Giants , Larry Doyle , elected the most valuable player in the league sixteen years ago ( he helps at the gates now ) , and Roger Bresnahan , who can tell stories of other famous Giants , long since dead or lost sight of  --  Mathewson and Dan McGann , the great Joe 11,1cGinnity , called " Iron Man , " and Mifflin and Devlin and Dahlen . Issues OUR interest in the coining election is chiefly concerned , we are sorry to say , with little things . Thus we left off reading Mr. Butler 's letter to the Times , but spent quite a while talking with a man who is connected with a firm which manufactures a popular campaign knickknack .
