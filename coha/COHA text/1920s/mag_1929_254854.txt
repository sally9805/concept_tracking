One of the treasures which can not be bought is the fatherly New York Times . Last week it increased its capitalization to $26,000,000 from $16,000,000 . The new figure hardly reflects its earning capacity , which is probably from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 per year . But the U. S. Government collects income tax on no such earnings , for the unpurchasable Times is not operated as a dividend milk cow . The formula of its success , the secret of its prestige , is its policy of accepting only the best , and paying for it . <P> The TIMES ' new capital increase took the form of a $5,000,000 dividend of Times Preferred ( 8% ) to holders of the fabulous common , of which there are only 10,000 shares . Five more millions of the preferred were authorized , for future disposition . The dividend declared was the fourth of its kind , the three prior ones having totaled $15,000,000 . <P> The Times was started in 1851 by two young men who were excited by the report that Horace Greeley had made his New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond and George Jones , both Tribune men , the one editorial and the other business-set the Times going with 100 shares of common stock , each of which they dared to believe might , sometime , be worth $1,000 . <P> For two decades the Times was known as Raymond 's paper . He died in 1869 and Mr. Jones carried it on to greater wealth and prestige . Dying in 1891 , he left a splendid property to his children , with an injunction that they never sell out . Within a year they were preparing to sell . The editors , fearing the paper would fall into unworthy hands , rushed about and got a company organized which bought the property for $950,000 . Then came the panic of 1893 . The Times barely escaped consolidation and , in 1896 , welcomed the help of Adolph Simon Ochs of Chattanooga . Tenn . For $75,000 and his services he got , within four years , half of its stock , which was now increased to 10,000 shares . <P> Adolph Simon Ochs was a teacher 's son who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil . Working on through nearly every standard newspaper job , he had bought the Chattanooga Times when he was 20 , paying for it $250 ( borrowed ) and assuming its debts of $1,500 . <P> The present-day New York Times is his creation . People mocked his motto , " All the news that 's fit to print . " They scoffed at his plan to cover fully phases of the news that had never been so covered before , such as Wall Street , real estate , books , routine governmental matters of the city , state and nation . At his refusal to accept the trend toward sensationalism , muckraking , funnies and " yellow " headlines , his contemporaries and competitors snorted . <P> He printed about 20,000 copies of his first issue . Half of them came back unsold . The Sunday circulation of the Times last week was 752,689 . It is unquestionably the greatest U. S. newspaper , with special emphasis on the " news . " Perhaps it is the world 's greatest . <P> In the first 25 years of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 90 millions of which he poured back into the property for expansion and improvement . Last year it printed more than 30,000,000 lines of advertising , for which the public paid from 55 to $10.00 per line .
