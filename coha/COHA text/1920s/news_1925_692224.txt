txt It was natural that pro-Court Senators should heckle Mr. PEPPER when he plumped for " the plan recom " mended to the Senate by the Presi " dent " ? even charges him with inconsistency , recalling how different was the Pepper plan of eighteen months ago . Broad smiles illumined countenances that had too long been sober under oratorical pettifogging ; ripples of laughter sped over the vast surface of unlimited debate . A plain tale would have put them down : then as now Mr. PEPPER was for coming into the Court by what seemed to him the nearest way , But why a plain tale in the Senate when there is an opening for merriment ? Conditions have changed rather than the Senator from Pennsylvania . Eighteen months ago Mr. 40DGE had a plan of which it was said , with some reason , that it was intended not to prepare our way into the Court but to block it . And President COOLIDGE had received from Congress many heartrending rebuffs Like " Sentimental Tommy , " Senator PEPPER " found the wy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Assembly and the Council of the League , but were to be elected by the same gentlemen in the same way  --  each acting , however , under separate credentials from his Government . Upon our joining , the British Colonies and Dominions were to vamoose , and the constitution of the Court was to be so modified that the League could no longer call for advisory opinions . By such means Senator LODGE and his Battalion of Death were to be persuaded not to thwart the President further . Of course . Mr. COOLIDGE would be obliged to conduct delicate negotiations with the Governments of fifty-odd nations  --  to say nothing of ' that matter of separating the British lion from his whelps . But in every famous victory for 11. epublican harmony such things must be . Or so it seemed . Today the consecrated Battalion has dwindling ranks ; today Senators are in ' a mood to obey the Presidential voice even though , as Mr. PEPPER assures us , no command has'been uttered . The resolution of eighteen months ago , it now appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of con " siderable magnitude . " Under the booming of a sentence so orotund , it is not possible to conceive that words have ever been swallowed . True , Senator PEPPER has still " points " to make . His hair-splitting would be described as that of a Philadelphia lawyer even if he were not one . But they are of minor import . " If individuals propose specific reservations , " he sapiently observes , " they expose themselves as targets to attack . " Times have changed , in fact , even more than the Senator seems aware . The advisory opinions which are his chief remaining difficulty have proved of a practical value that the most sagacious of their American opponents did not foresee ; and whatever danger lay in them has been wisely forestalled by the Court itself . The Harding-Hughes plan , " recommended to the Senate by the President , " affords every needful safeguard against " entanglement " with the League . More than that , it opens the way for us to profit by an institution the achievements of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual enthronement of international law and justice .
