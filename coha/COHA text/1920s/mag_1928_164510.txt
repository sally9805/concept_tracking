Man is jealous of the birds , though he has already learned to fly many times faster . Determined to learn their secret , Leonard W. Bonney , wealthy pioneer of the air , grown middle-aged since his first flight with Orville Wright in 1910 , caught two seagulls in a steel trap padded with cloth at Mastic , L. I. For three years he studied them , scrutinizing every feather on their bodies . <P> Finally , he designed a plane . Inspired by the gull , it looked like the gull . It was named Bonney 's Gull . It was fat in body with graceful curving wings . Bonney followed the bird principle , abandoned the aileron , or balancing contrivance which airplane designers have always considered an essential feature of stability in the air . His plane had new features : an expanding and contracting tail , like a blackbird 's , for varying loads ; variable camber in the wings , so that they could flatten out like a gull 's when flying level ; a varying angle of incidence to its wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on landing , and let him drop onto a landing field " no bigger than a handkerchief . " <P> Last week , at Curtiss Field , Long Island , Bonney tested his finally completed Gull . It flew . For half a mile it traveled in a burst of speed . Bonney waved his arm in triumph . And then the Gull nosed down to earth and dived straight into the ground , a mass of wreckage . Bonney landed on his head 20 feet away , with only moments left to live .
