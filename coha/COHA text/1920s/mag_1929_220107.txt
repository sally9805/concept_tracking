Persons whose ears are attuned to advertising events last week heard a shrill , tinkling sound as a large advertising glass house was struck by a swiftly moving missile . The glass house was the elaborate structure of testimonial advertising currently so conspicuous . The missile was an attack on testimonial advertising launched by Frederick C. Kendall , editor of Advertising &; Selling , fortnightly trade-paper . The damage , considerable , was difficult to estimate . <P> Three-fold was Editor Kendall s attack on testimonials . First he got an article from Earnest Elmo Calkins , famed literary critic and exponent of advertising. * Under the title : " Lucky Strikes Save Florida 's Crew , " Mr. Calkins deplored the fact that Hero George Fried had hardly docked before he was endorsing Lucky Strikes via radio and newspapers . It is Mr. Calkins ' agency that has created the famed Fire Demon in the Hartford Fire Insurance advertisements ; to the testimonial demon Mr. Calkins is equally antagonistic . <P> Next came an article by Paul M. Hollister , a vice president at Batten , Barton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . What , said he , would happen if publishers , who have already freed their pages from patent medicine advertising , should now refuse to accept any testimonial advertisement that was not certified as unpaid for and voluntary ? Mr. Hollister predicted that such a procedure would cause anguish among many agency men charged with formulating campaign ideas , would also grieve Park Avenue females who would be deprived of " their most profitable racket . " <P> Finally , Editor Kendall put Advertising &; Selling back of the anti-testimonial movement with an editorial cheering for the Hollister suggestion that high grade publishers should ban the bought testimonial . <P> The testimonial dates back to advertising 's patent medicine era . Familiar in the old days was the tale in which an ailing person , having " taken two bottles of your marvelous remedy , " was quickly restored to blooming health . Later , as the conscience of advertisers and the standards of publishers improved , testimonials declined . It was probably the much discussed Pond 's Cream series , featuring endorsements from Marie of Rumania and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advertising 's most polished circles . Outstanding current examples of testimonial campaigns are the advertising of Pond 's Cream , Simmons ' Beds , Lux Soap , Fleischmann 's Yeast and Herbert Tareyton , Old Gold and Lucky Strike cigarets.
