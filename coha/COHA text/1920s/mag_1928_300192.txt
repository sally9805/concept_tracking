For the first time last week a U. S. opera was presented in a German theatre . The theatre was the Dresden Staatsoper where Fritz Busch is conductor ; the opera : Snowbird by Composer Theodore Stearns . <P> In Philadelphia last week Conductor Leopold Anton Stanislaw Stokowski continued to discipline his audience ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) . At an afternoon concert he gave stragglers just one minute , 58 seconds to find their seats , then had the doors closed . Hereafter Philadelphia Orchestra concerts will begin promptly and nothing will interrupt . <P> In Paris the new Orchestre Symphonique gave Arthur Honegger 's Rugby a successful premire . In the U. S. , Composer Honegger is famed for his Pacific 231 through which he sniffs and snorts to resemble a giant locomotive . His Rugby , long heralded , is a sound picture of a football match in which smart , broken rhythms tell the struggle of the players , the excitement of the crowd . <P> Washington last week took sentimental delight in a concert by the musical Homers . Mother-Contralto Louise Dilworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a homely picture standing together singing the songs of Father-Composer Sidney Homer to the filial accompaniments of Younger Daughter Katharine Homer . <P> In Chicago a pleasant Aida made her debut at Civic Opera , She was Soprano Hilda Burke , 24 , of Baltimore , who had wanted to be a trained nurse but succumbed to parental objection , concentrated on singing as a substitute . <P> <P> * Wife of Clergyman Ernest Van Rensselaer Stires and daughter-in-law of the Episcopal Bishop of Long Island .
