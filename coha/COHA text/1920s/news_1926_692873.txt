The explosion shattered the tracks over Which the -- locomotivaTan and biaated a hole adz feet deep and tea feet wide into the roadbed . Into this hole were driven great pieces of the engine 's understructure , while the boiler was lifted from the trucks and hurled into the swamp . More than half of the sixty freight cars were demolished . Cars spilled cargoes of oil , cloth and flags over the roadbed for a mile . Some of the cars were piled three deep in the water of the swamp on both sides of the track . Four cars of the flyer were derailed , the first , a sleeper , overturned , and dived toward the swamp .

It lies half buried in the water of the swamp , pointing in the opposite direction from that in which the train was traveling at the time of the crash . The tender , attached to the first car , lies upside down in the swamp . Those aboard the Cape Codder who wished to continue their journey were put aboard a special for the Cape .

The trains crashed , and the next thing he knew . be said , he was hurled into the air and into the swamp . He spent the next few minutes assisting his fireman from the Water , where he also had been thrown .. Mrs Mulvaney , the nineteen-year-old bride of the substitute fireman who was killed , said her husband saluted her in what proved to be a tragic farewell as the train passed through this city shortly before midnight . They were - married only , three months - ago . It had become a custom for him to whistle as his engine reached the point nearest their new home .               @ @ @ @ @ @
