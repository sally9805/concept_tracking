WELCOME HOME-Alice Duer Miller-Dodd Mead ( $2 ) . To compete with the fictional vogue for neuroses , stream-of-thought , documentary realism , Alice Duer Miller has done two novelettes , each with an actual plot : introduction , climax , denouement , elements as gratifying as they are oldfashioned . <P> One midnight , Bentham returns , not very " Welcome Home " from six years of South America , lets himself into his boyhood brownstone house , where not even the Irish caretaker is stirring . Memories of his late irascible father haunt him as he climbs to his old room which is filled with prep-school photos and trophies and the heavy perfume of flowers . In the sudden electricity , the most beautiful girl he ever saw sits bolt upright in the middle of his old bed , and orders him out of the house . He returns next day to find her vanished . But Author Miller can be relied upon to make out of her not the psychic fantasy of Bentham 's weary mind , but the heroine of an excellent movie scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewels " of the same volume .
