Down from the snowy Andes to Buenos Aires rumbled a five-car train full of fully-armed Argentine soldiers . Behind , in a longer train , came the President-Elect of the U.S. If he gave thought to the soldiers ahead or to the " radical " bomb-plotters who had necessitated their presence , he did not show it . He gazed with placid satisfaction out of his car window at the Argentine 's horizon-filling wheat ranches and pampas , at her myriad herds of kine and mutton . <P> President Hipolito Irigoyen of Argentine , a taciturn Socialist who makes no unnecessary public gestures , made a point of meeting the Hoovers at the terminal , thus sharing any danger the visitors might be in , thus trying to efface the national embarrassment felt by Argentina over the plan of some of her naughty children had had to blow Goodwill to smithereens . <P> In a house in a Buenos Aires side-street , two young men and two young women had been found with seven bombs , many firearms and a map of the railway by which the Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Police collared them and kept watch on all other known radicals in the city . Hundreds of guards were deployed throughout the station . Hundreds more policed 100,000 of the populace , massed in the station plaza . <P> After suitable greetings , President Irigoyen returned to the Red House ( Argentina 's White House ) . The Hoovers dined with U. S. Ambassador Robert Woods Bliss at his embassy . <P> As soon as the newspapers came out , the populace learned that Mr. Hoover had called their country " the world 's bread basket . " The phrase sounded new and original in Buenos Aires and it " took " tremendously . There were headlines about it , as well as about the various newborn babies who were to be christened " Herbert " or " Hoover , " and leading editorials complaining politely about the exclusive U.S. tariff . <P> The day after his arrival Mr. Hoover saw the sights and spent several hours at the Red House in private conversation , said to have been frank and intimate , with President Irigoyen . <P> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silences have really been even more impressive than Calvin Coolidge 's , surprised everyone by standing up and making a speech . Mr. Hoover had prepared a speech and given it to Ambassador Fletcher to read for him . When President Irigoyen sat down , President-Elect Hoover returned the compliment by recovering his own manuscript and reading it himself . An interpreter was necessary to render from English to Spanish . Mrs. Hoover speaks Spanish with moderate fluency but Mr. Hoover has never progressed beyond the meal-ordering stage .
