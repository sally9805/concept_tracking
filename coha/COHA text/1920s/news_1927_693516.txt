txt The most striking thing about the new State Cabinet is its freedom from politics . It Is not merely that six of Governor Snrria 's fourteen counselors are Republicans . That is purely fortuitous . It would be almost as pertinent to list the number of golf players in the lot . Most of them simply do n't function as politicians at all . That is in marked contrast to the Federal Cabinet . Its members usually have a strong political background , and some of them , like the Postmaster General and occasionally the Attorney General , frankly serve ' as political advisers . But what part will partisan politics play in the Cabinet services of such officials as SULLIVAN SoNss , State Architect ; FRANK P. GRAVES , Commissioner of Education , or Mrs. C. B. SMITH , head of the State Civil Service Commission ? Almost equally striking is the p.eponderance of persons representing the broad social functions of State government . Six out of the fourteen fall in that category . At first blush this might seem to reflect merely Governor 's SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a glance at the list will show how broadly they enter into the very structure of our State . Education , health , mental hygiene , charities , correction and industrial relations  --  all these are everyday vital functions of modern State government . Here again is a notable contrast with the Federal Cabinet . President FIARDING tried to get a Department of Education and Public Welfare established at Washington , but his idea did not commend itself to Congress . Isolated Federal agencies like the Children 's Bureau in the Department of Labor have been steadily under attack . Ind-istrial relations have a place in both Federal and State Cabinets , however . So has agriculture . The head of the Department of Taxation and Finance may be said to correspond roughly to the Secretary of the Treasury . Conservation , shared by Interior and Agriculture in the Federal scheme , has under the State Government a department of its own . One State official is conspicuous by his absence from the Cabinet circle , and that is the Attorney General . The Governor explains that , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set apart . But that is only half the story . Mr. OTTINGER happens to be a Republican . As the only survivor of the recent flood he naturally ' holds a rather high place in his party 's councils . He is completely at odds with the Governor on the water-power issue . . " No powers of the Governor are of avail , " say the schoolmasters , " when " he seeks legal advice from an " Independently elected Attorney Gen " eral who may hope to further his " own political ambitions by the " opinions he presents upon questions " of public interest . " Nevertheless , an Attorney General has an important place in Cabinet deliberations , and Mr. OTTINGER will b3 missed . Perhaps the Governor will call on his own legal adviser to sit in at the council table . His Cabinet may be an extra-legal body , but he is likely to find it a bit too extra-legal without some accredited counsel .                    @
