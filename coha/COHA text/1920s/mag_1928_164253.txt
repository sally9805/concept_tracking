Mr. Lowden . While Hooverites counted their chickens and hoped they would hatch ( see " The Beaver-Man " ) , Lowdenites did likewise . They counted up as high as 200 delegates , " sure " on the first ballot . Candidate Lowden 's prospects were brighter for carrying his home <P> State , Illinois , where the " Coolidge-anyway " movement of Governor Small and Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill " ) Thompson grew daily in transparency and disrepute . <P> Mr. Coolidge . A report from Washington that President Coolidge had decided to run again , sent the New York stock market zooming aloft . Polite amazement was professed at the White House , but no statement came forth , con or pro . Observers judged that amazement of another sort was felt privately at the White House when Mayor Thompson 's " Coolidge-anyway " movement in Chicago came out last week with a platform which included the plank : " Repeal the Volstead Act . " <P> Mr. Watson . In Indiana , Candidate Watson &; friends found a kettle as black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , Will H. Hays &; friends behind the Hoover candidacy there . No denial coming direct from Candidate Hoover , the Watson-Hoover battle in Indiana temporarily assumed the aspect of local gang war . <P> Mr. Smith . Up to the end of last week , 74 delegates had been chosen for the Democratic convention , including Idaho 's eight , Louisiana 's 20 , Minnesota 's 24 , New Hampshire 's eight , Alaska 's six , six from the Philippines , two from the Virgin Islands . Each and everyone was to vote for Candidate Smith . In Manhattan it became known that Candidate Smith would formalize his candidacy the week following Easter . Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City is the Smith campaign manager . He will run for Congress , hoping to be White House spokesman in the House of Representatives . <P> Mr. Meredith . Edwin Thomas Meredith of Iowa , who was President Wilson 's Secretary of Agriculture ( 1920-21 ) , refused months ago to let his name be used as a foil . But someone-perhaps William Gibbs McAdoo-has been talking to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do ... covet the confidence and goodwill of my fellow citizens here in Iowa . " He allowed his name to be entered locally as a " Stop Smith " candidate . <P> G. O. P. Funds . Treasurer William V. Hodges of the Republican National Committee denied a report that he would retire as a result of the Oil Scandal inquiry ( see p. 12 ) . He stated that G. 0 . P. funds in 1928 would be plentiful for " a proper campaign " ; that the 90,000 contributors of 1924 would this year be swelled to 150,000.
