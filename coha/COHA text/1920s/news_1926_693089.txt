txt Notwithstanding all the efforts- of the large staff of Dow , Jones &; Co. - to keep Wall Street posted right up to the minute , there is somewhere , in the back of Wall Street 's brain , a big " forgettery . " Perhaps Wall Street has no time to remember or carry in its brain the record from year to dear or from- month to month , and sometimes it forgets overnight . Recently Dow , Jones . &; Co. published a very valuable and careful statement concernin ; the Steel situation . n denial , of the reports of reorganization by issuing bonds for preferred stock . It was also noted ' that stock distribution would not lee considered in the immediate future or even at the January meeting . The stock dropped ten points . 31 , - . George F. Baker , when departing for Europe and when recently returning from Europe , also noted in the Dow-Jones steamship interviews that he did not lock for an immediate distribution in the way of a stock dividend to U. S. Steel common stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such discussions , is that it never has been contemplated to mike it Steel distribution this year . It was in the original plans when , at the annual meeting of the Steel Corporation , Judge Gary intimated that a distribution to represent the accumulated surplus would be carefully considered , that action might be taken in the spring of 1 ; 1.27 . It may be useful at the present time recall exactly what Judge Gary said : " We would not voluntarily or unnecessarily hurt the feelings of any stockholder of the corporation , nor would we say anything against declaring and distributing additional dividends . if and when the same could properly be done . Neither would we hold out any promises for the future without the most careful study and consideration . " However , I may say the time may come when it would be legal , just and proper toward all interests , and safe to the cash requirements of the Steel Corporation , to issue additional common stock as a stock dividend to the common shareholders against a part of the new improvements heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this were done it would add to the amount of cash dividends on common stock if and when declared . and might possibly in times of depression interrupt their continuity . It should not be done without painstaking and conscientious consideration . It can not be done with safety at the present time . Our need for large liquid assets is - great . We must be prepared for emergencies . Business fluctuates .. Selling prices are uncertain . Competition and fairness to customers require the best and latest improvements in facilities and methods . Machinery wears out rapidly ; and new and better designs compel replacements and substitutions . Our corporation must be and remain in the front ranks of progressive and prosperous manufacturers . We believe thoroughly in strictest economy but not false economy . " Personally I would like to see larger dividends , if practicable and proper , but what have personal or individual interests to do with our subject unless the whole body of stockholders is at the same time pro-tected ? " STOCKHOLDERS ARE PROTESTING As bearing upon this situation a private letter from Pittsburgh may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official of one of the companies which went to make up the U. S. Steel Corporation when it was organized in 1901 . It reads : " We all told our friends and relatives , that if they went along in this company and either took stock for their holdings , or bought it on the market the charter read , that after a full year 's dividend on the preferred and proper and right depreciation and new construction had been made , the balance of the earnings would go to the common stockholders . " Now , the common stockholder in the U. S. Steel Company has been most patient . He has seen vast sums of money taken from the earnings and put into the surplus and new construction . A great many feel that if the Steel Corporation had not " cracked ahead " so fast other companies would not have expanded , and thus there would not have been the severe competition which we have and there would have been far better returns to the stockholders . That is what some of us Pittsburghers feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all the above charges mentioned and dividends on the stock are taken out , they pass $12,448,300 to surplus . Under their charter I claim this belongs to the stockholders , as the surplus is large enough . " There is something in what our Pittsburgh friend The Steel Corporation has driven matters very It has kept down steel prices while raising wages from an average of about 8700 per man to about $2,100 per man . It has not considered the losses in onq year in fixing prices and profits for the next year , so that the net result has been a poor return upon the investment FOR WIIOM IS THE STEEL Co . WORKING ! The Steel Corporation has been altruistic to every interest except its common stockholder . The time is now approaching when the Steel Corporation must begin to lose its shareholders or give them something to represent a part of the stockholders ' earnings which have been invested in the plant . If the decision of the directors is to be against a stock distribution after a quarter of a century of operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the p-shlIc market at *35 to $5:a is now proved worthless , or the shareholders ' surplus has been unprofitably invested  --  or to be perhaps somewhat of both . Is the Steel Corporation to be a failure so far as the common stockholders are concerned ? Has the steel business necessarily been unprofitable to invested capital , or has it been made so , and is it to be hereafter unprofitable ? THE KEI " TO STEEL . It should be understood in all discussions of the steel situation that steel people figure that it takes two years to turn capital in the manufacture of steel , and that a 25 ' , 1 . profit is not a manufacturing 155 per annum profit . This is the real key to the steel situation . Mr. Morgan declared when he organized the great Stecl Corporation that it would be a conservator of national resources , take the fever of price fluctuations and " prince and pauper " out of the steel business and have a steadying influence upon prices and general business . Is the Steel Corporation to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shareholders ? When the Steel Corporation started , it paid 45 , upon its common stock and for many years 5% , or about 0 ' upon the fair average market value . There was then , as now , $500,000,000 of Steel common and , if we remember rightly , Charles M. Schwab testified to a value of *150 per share for Steel common at a fair valuation for its ote reserves . The Steel Corporation has since enormously increased its ore reserves and made such a reconstruction of its plants and has so added to its surplus and reserves of all kinds that it is a fair declaration that if Steel common was worth $50 a share twenty-five years ago , or $150 per share on a fair capitalization of values , both above and underground , it is today worth at least $201 more per share , unless it shall be proven that the steel business is and . : . , to be relatively unprofitable in this country and that capital : nvested in the steel business can not make a fair manufacturing return . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual meeting next spring . But if the stock market speaks truly , it bespeaks , and also demands , a recognition , before the end of anotner twelvemonth. of stockholders ' rights in the accumulated surplus .
