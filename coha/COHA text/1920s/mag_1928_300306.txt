No ordinary murderer but the ferocious , scowling Alcibiade Bebe , who last year assassinated a brother-in-law of smart little King Ahmed Zogu of Albania , finally came to trial last week , in Prague , Czechoslovakia , where his crime was committed . <P> Sensation seeking Czechs and Slovaks jammed the courtroom , thrilled by scars and scowls peculiar to the malignant face of Prisoner Bebe . <P> Even the Czechoslovak judge seemed uneasy in the presence of a prisoner who looked as if he might spring at any convenient throat . When cross examination began all eyes were fixed upon Bebe , ears strove to catch the answers which he made in thick , ungracious tones interspersed with grunts . It was all so primitive , so fascinating , that no one noticed another Albanian , one Ziga Vuciterna , who arose pantherlike among the spectators , stealthily drew two revolvers , advanced upon Prisoner Bebe with a wild and sudden yell , and opened a murderous double fire of dum-dum bullets . <P> Eight ghastly dum-dum wounds sufficed to kill ferocious Alcibiade Bebe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbitlike dive of the judge under his bench . Jurymen fled so precipitously that one slipped and broke an arm . A stray dum-dum bullet wounded , probably fatally , the distinguished correspondent of the great Italian daily Gionale d ' Italia , Signor Adriano Del Vecchio . <P> When Two-Gun-Man Ziga Vuciterna looked up from his work there was no other living soul to be seen in court . Wild-eyed but no longer violent the Dum-Dum Murderer reversed both his pistols in his hands , turning them upon himself , and stood in this peculiar attitude until bailiffs plucked up courage to come in and arrest him and the judge crawled out from under his bench . <P> To utterly shocked and totally unsympathetic Czechoslovaks , DumDum mer Vuciterna growled an explanation : " I shot him because of a blood feud . We have many in Albania . I did only what any Albanian would . Our code of honor demands a life for a life . " <P> Despatches from the Albanian capital of Tirana , last week , extravagantly rumored that over 300 minor and major blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was also rumored that the Sovereign had broken off the engagement which has bound him since childhood to wed Lela , luscious 23-year-old daughter of the great Albanian tribal chieftain Shevket Bey Verlatzi . Such a jilt , if actually perpetrated , can scarcely fail to engender another deadly blood feud . <P> Reputedly the engagement was broken because His Majesty , a puppet of Signor Benito Mussolini , now aspires to wed a Royal princess . If his fanatical Moslem subjects permit him to turn Roman Catholic he may espouse Princess Giovanna of Italy . If that much mooted match proves infeasible , the Moslem King might conceivably marry one of the Moslem daughters of His Majesty Fuad I of Egypt . Unquestionably any princess who marries King Ahmed Zogu takes her life in her hands and risks the imminent possibility that her husband may turn corpse .
