Sweeping in a Manhattan post office , last week , a negro employe stepped on a parcel and was startled to hear it go siss , and emit wisps of smoke . He gave it a " kick , let out a yell . The package stopped smoking , and nothing happened . <P> Addressed to Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt of New York , the package was diagnosed as a bomb . Only oldtime bomb-touchers were allowed to handle it . On his way to Albany , Gov . Roosevelt remarked : " That 's the first I 've heard about bombs since I left the Navy Department . " <P> Made of a tin box , an iron pipe , a pinch of gun powder , a box of matches , sandpaper and some wax , the " bomb " turned out to be a " practical joke . "
