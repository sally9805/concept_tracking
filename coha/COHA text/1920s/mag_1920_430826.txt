WAR , that blasted away the foundations of political and economic Europe , has done something more . Its backfires are now scorching various royal marriages . From Germany comes the news of assorted princely and ducal beings , among them the ex-Kaisers sons , contemplating the divorce courts . From the Balkans drift stories of marital discontent and of the desire to put asunder . Switzerland , ever a place of gossip , is now a whispering gallery of the domestic troubles of many nobility which fled there when the debacle came . All this is not a reflection of marital unrest on the continent . It is not one of those situations wherein all.the people of a land go off at some tangent , yet only the sensationalized names of their great ones spring into print . No ; royalty is divorcing royalty or ignoring , royalty and going tripping off with barmaids , generally consorting with those who are called of low birth ? or perhaps amorously entangling itself with other royalty , impossible in the days when love was not the reason for marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air today hold a significance of the new times which everyone , except a few poor misguided wretches , believe to be at hand . They connote that land is being divorced from land ; that whole groups of people are being divorced from other and foreign peoples . For it was land , population , wealth , which was the moving force that , most of the time , contracted the marriages of continental royalty . And now that the map of Europe has been redrawn , transformed into a sort of crazy-quilt of various little " democratic " states , there is  | no need for holding them together in the bonds of matrimony . For example , of what avail is it today for the ex-Royal Highness Prince Oscar of Prussia to remain married to Ina Levetzow , daughter of the Minister of State of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin ? It was a Hohenzollern policy , you know , to knit together the states of the German Empire by bringing about marriages between the offspring of their petty ruling houses and Hohenzollerns . And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marriage web over all Europe . Is it any wonder , then , today that young people who were forced into these state marriages are now doing their best to break them and , after the nightmare of war , are trying to find some happiness in true love ? A POLICY OF LOVELESS MARRIAGES THAT was no new thing , marrying lands and peoples . It began centuries ago . Like many other loveless things , it was " made in Germany . " In the sixteenth century there were seven brothers of Osnabruck , possessing among other citadels the city of Luneburg . They it was who laid the foundation for the policy of loveless marriages , of marrying people and lands , that reached its climax after centuries of mating cousins with cousins , with the matrimonial web of the Kaiser . These seven brothers who five centuries ago dwelt on the edge of the Black Forest , felt that they were not safe . They needed more land , for more land meant more power . Their seven puny dukedoms were ofno consequence , scattered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they agreed among themselves that six of them should retire in favor of one , to be the only representative of the family . The chosen brother was Ernst Augustus , bishop of Osnabruck . He looked about him and saw the lands of Sophie of Palatine . And so he and Sophie were married . Their son in due time succeeded , and added more land that had come into the line through his mother and her relations . Ii had been agreed among this son and his brothers that only one of them was to be the family head , just as his father and his  | uncles had agreed . So came into being the family that bred George I of England and the kings of Prussia . For it was through a daughter of this family , Sophie Charlotte , that the Osnabruck land-marriers were able to combine with the Zollern family , that took on the prefix " Hohen " in later years . These loveless marriages were desired for two reasons : to secure land , which meant power , and to breed a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of certain distinct types , special kinds of plants and animals can be developed . It was heeded that , given time , a certain number of generations , attributes appearing first as sporadic became fixed and permanent characteristics so long as the strain is kept pure . Look at the thousandyear-old backgrounds of the Romanoffs , the Hohenzollerns , and the Guelphs , and you will see that it is impossible to separate them from each other . Nor can they be separated from most of the dynasties in Europe . Consider that the King of England is the Kaiser 's cousin ; that Wilhelm has seen the British throne occupied successively by his grandmother , his uncle and his cousin ; that the late Czarina is also the Kaiser 's cousin ; that Maud , Queen of Norway , is the King of England 's sister , hence , also a cousin of the Kaiser ; that Sophie , the late Queen of Greece , is the Kaiser 's sister ; that the late Czar of Russia is his second cousin ; that the Prince of Cumberland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British King 's and a grandson of the King of Denmark ; that the Princess of Saxe-Meiningen , Schaumburg-Lippe , and Hesse are all brothers-in-law of the Kaiser ; that the Crown Princess of Sweden is related to him through her mother , a Prussian princess ; that Manuel , ex-King of Portugal , married a Hohenzollern and that the Queen of Holland not only married a German prince but that there have been five marriages between her house and the Hohenzollerns . Not forgetting that the Kaiser succeeded in marrying off a German princess to the heir to the Montenegrin throne .  | RESULT OF ROYAL INBREEDING NOW all this is very complicated and very tangled , but it lends itself to interesting speculation . It shows that for centuries European royalty has been going through a process of inbreeding , marrying cousin to cousin , to keep the royal strain pure and to acquire land for political purposes . But , human beings and plants and animals are quite different . You can take racehorses and develop a breed ; and you can take plants and develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for a racehorse or a rose does not possess the human brain . But when people are so closely bred for centuries the result is not such a fine breed . We have laws in many States that prevent the marriages of cousins . Perhaps if European royalty had had these laws there would not have been reached in the eugenic scale some of the freaks which came to light during the war . " I am the vice-regent of God , I am His representative on earth . " You remember that ? Wilhelm , the result of much inbreeding , said it . And perhaps you recall how the Little Father of Allthe-Russias sat , shortly before the Revolution , with his unbathed charlatans and soothsayers around him , and peered into a crystal ball to learn what he should do . Nicholas was the result of much inbreeding . They tell a story in Stockholm of Prince Oscar who renounced his rights . One day when he was a little boy he asked the gorgeous Court Chamberlain , " Why is it that father and mother married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . " Of course , precocious ; and it gave the smooth-tongued Court Chamberlain a disconcerting moment before he could reply . " Your Royal Highness , " he said , " kings and queens can not take their feelings into consideration when they marry . They have to marry for the good of the nation . " All of which seemed to be supreme self-sacrifice , being as it  | was for the sake of the dear people for whom , of course , the kingly heart ever bleeds . " I 'm glad I 'm not a king , " said the young Swedish prince . " I hope I never will be . I do n't want to be unhappy . " That began the story of a prince who does not show any signs of being unscrambled in these days of dividing marriages that were contracted , of course , for the good of the people . For lo , the young Prince Oscar , after being dragged about by his mother from one foreign capital to another , after having several tempting , land-marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wisp of a girl with pale features and wonderful gray eyes , who bore the very unprincely. name of Ebba Munck . Nor could any amount of royal pressure induce him to separate from his un-royal bride . THE CROWN PRINCE 'S AMERICAN FLIRTATION NOT so fortunate was the Crown Prince of Germany , about whom the divorce rumors persist . Certain it is that even with a Restoration he will never see the German throne . His thirteen-year-old son , Wilhelm Friedrich , possibly with his wife Cecelie as regent , but Friedrich Wilhelm , never ! That he will be divorced is regarded as certain ; too many stories are drifting across from Europe for there not to be some serious basis for this . Of course , everyone knows that the Crown Prince treated Cecelie shamefully and that the lady had grounds for divorce during , - as well as before the war . But there was a time when Friedrich Wilhelm was very young , when he might have spared himself his present plight , the memories that must harass him , had he then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was in London . The Crown Prince , then unmarried , was utterly infatuated with her . She was a level-headed girl and she told him were she to marry him , that his father would bar him from the throne . How ironic that sounds today ! The then young Crown Prince said he did n't care , that he would officially renounce 219 all rights to the throne if she would marry him . To prove it he put upon her finger an ancient ring , a treasure of the Hohenzollerns that has never been out of that house . And the American girl had about made up her mind to marry him . In a few days there called upon her a representative of the German embassy in London , who demanded back the ring in the name of the Kaiser . Seeing what a mess was about to be stirred up , the American girl withdrew ? a very , very wise girl in the light of the years sketching the Crown Prince 's character more sharply . But perhaps she could have worked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand her ground and . that his father could go to the devil , she might have saved him from himself , and he might today be a happy man . For who can tell how things might be changed if the clock could only be turned back ? Undoubtedly one of the most successful land-marriers of Europe was King Nicholas of Montenegro . Only once was the wool pulled over the eyes of the ruler of the little mountain kingdom and that was when the Crown Prince Danilo brought back with him from Berlin a bride , the Duchess Jutta , of Mecklenburg=Strelitz . A SUCCESSFUL ROYAL MARRIAGE-BROKER NOW , good old Nicholas possessed six exceedingly beautiful daughters , and being a king , with the welfare of his people ever close to his heart ? his own fortunes being , of course , of no consequence ? he ' became a foxy old matchmaker . He sent the six girls to Russia for no other reason but to be educated . There was a very fine finishing school in Petrograd , the convent of Smolna ( where incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the direct protection of the Russian Empress . Of course , Nicholas did not send his girls there for that reason , but should any of them seem attractive in the eyes of powerful Russian princes , no harm was done . By way of passing , Nicholas at the time was angling for a complete understanding between Russia and Montenegro . He wanted the Czar to protect his kingdom . His six beautiful daughters remained at the convent  | a year or two after their education was completed . Then weddings were announced . One of them had landed the Grand Duke Peter and another Duke George . And the heart of the old King of Montenegro was very pleased . His country was united more solidly , politically , with Russia . Sweet and beautiful romance continued to smile upon the little mountain kingdom . The old man found the sympathies and the support of Great Britain to be quite desirable . Another daughter married Francis Joseph , Prince of Battenburg . This assured him the good will of Queen Victoria , whose youngest daughter Beatrice was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph was when he put a Montenegrin on the throne of Italy . His daughter , Helene , was united to Victor Emmanuel , then the Crown Prince , now king . This last match just happened to turn out very happily . Land was married to land , but the personalities of the man and the woman who were dragged into the marriage were such that a genuine love developed after marriage . But some of the other marriages of the old King 's daughters which were made in Heaven are not so happy , for land was just married to land and there is no spark of love in earth . Through no good motive on his part , for he was swayed merely by questions of foreign policy , the Kaiser prevented a marriage which had it taken place would today be susceptible to unscrambling . In the spring of 1914 , King Carol , then ruling Roumania , sent his nephew and heir , the Crown Prince Ferdinand , together with his wife , the Crown Princess , and their eldest son to Petrograd . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Russia , ever seeking matrimonial alliances with the kinsmen of the Czar , seeking protection , of course , against the inevitable day when the Teutons would sweep down from the north . The old Roumanian King did n't have long to live and he knew it . Ferdinand , the Crown Prince , was a man well along in years and the old King wanted to be sure that Ferdinand 's son married the right land , which was Russia .  | Getting news of this , the Kaiser lost no time . What did Ferdinand 's son want to marry in Russia for ? Were n't there plenty of long-footed German princesses ? The Kaiser 's cousin was n't sitting on the throne with the Czar for nothing . She whispered and the Grand Duchess Olga who was picked out to marry Ferdinand 's son , suddenly discovered that she would have nothing to do with him . So did a royal marriage go by the boards . It is interesting to note that , with the war at an end , this same young Roumanian , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died and Ferdinand now ruled , completely kicked over the traces of royal marriage . To Ferdinand he said : " I wo n't marry any princess to increase the power or popularity of our dynasty . I am going to marry as my heart tells me to . " , And he who was slated for the Grand Duchess Olga , married a comic-opera singer of Bucharest , renounced his rights to the throne and told them all precisely what he thought of state marriages . All of which means that the Duchess Olga was saved from a divorce . JOACHIM HOHENZOLLERN 'S DOWNFALL THERE is today in Campione , on Lake Lugano , which is the new Italian version of Monte Carlo , a quite young and quite feverish gambler . His name is Joachim Hohenzollern . The last time his wife was seen with him was more than a year ago in Munich when he was arrested for " complicity in the reactionary plot , " and she wept for mortification when he was led away , and begged that they would not injure the poor boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signs of romance . He had just come back to Berlin from the Russian front . He was not well . One refrains from the use of the word wounded because , although it was officially reported that he was hit by shi apnel , there were those who said he fell off his horse in a fit and broke his shoulder . But , of course , this was no food for the dolts who were letting their loved ones be killed by the hundreds of thousands . It is  | a human characteristic that peoples exalt , those of royal blood , imagining them to be beings totally different from themselves , and that then when these royal personages show that they are susceptible to human influences , these same peoples who have deified them , go into ecstasies ? " the Prince is just like anyone else . " So Joachim was " wounded just like anyone else . " His marriage came swift upon the heels of the wound or broken collar-bone , or whatever it was . A war marriage , very romantic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Duke of Anhalt , a very powerful German house dating back to the eleventh century , a house whose good will the Kaiser desired to solidify . And so today , with nobody caring a whoop about the House of Anhalt , Joachim is down at the Italian " Monte Carlo " and talking of the divorce ' courts . PRINCESS AND TRUCK DRIVER ANTHER of the Kaiser 's sons , August Wilhelm , is in matrimonial difficulties . This time it is the wife who is weary of the yoke . She , the Princess Alexandria Victoria , had considerable draft behind her name , being a princess of Schleswig. - Holstein - Sonderburg - Glucksburg . Also , she is a niece of the Kaiser , her family and his having had a common ancestry in the seventeenth century . The holy marriage of August Wilhelm and the princess was perpetrated in 1908 . She is a beautiful and vivacious woman with a sense of humor , incredibly rare among German princesses , a gift which stood her in good stead during her years under the Hohenzollern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were reasons of state that demanded it , but these are gone now and perhaps she is thinking of the right to happiness . A side-light on her : German troops were going to the front . She was in a railroad station in the uniform of the Red Cross , dispensing sausages and beer . A sergeant , who did n't know who she was from Eve , beamed upon her and said : " Sister , if I come back from the war , I shall marry none but you . "  | The sergeant used to drive a truck for a brewery , but the Princess did not elevate her brows ; instead she smiled and said : " Very well , we will wait and see if you are ready to keep your word . " Today she is talking divorce . The truck driver ? Who can tell ? Elinor Glyn has written of stranger things . Royalty will break out when reasons of state no longer hold it in check . A few years ago Alexander , the Crown Prince of Greece , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But one knows how diplomatic policies in the Balkans have been kicked aside since the war . From Athens we now have the news that King Alexander now wishes to marry an American girl of rare beauty and make her his queen . While in Switzerland , fugitives from Greece , his father Constantine and Sophie Hohenzollern , whom the Kaiser saddled upon him as a wife , are sitting on the opposites sides of a room in a cheap little chalet near Berne , and making faces at each other . ANY MORE MORGANATIC MARRIAGES ? T would seem that the necessity for morganatic marriages is at an end , unless of course , Europe reverts to its old political condition , which nobody but the pessimists expect . It may be that some day an American millionaire will create astonishment by permitting his daughter to marry a Savoy or a Windsor . For who can tell how far the reaction against autocracy will go ? Were it not for the eternal inconsistency of mankind , such things might come to pass . But even among us in our upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is built ' up around royal personages . For have we not the conduct of Americans at the various banquets given the young Prince of Wales to gaze upon ? occasions when the young Prince had to teach his hosts some things about democracy and of the asininity of seating him in a throne-like chair totally distinctive from that of any . other guest at the table . So , it may be that the day is not here when the fatuous worship of royalty is at an end . Perhaps we are only passing through a period and that history will again show  | itself to be immutable in its cycles and that there will swing back the worship of royalty , if not of royalty , of dictators . Do you recall the French Revolution ? The hatred of royalty , then the dictator , then royalty again ? So it may be that there will again return the necessity for these marriages of state , for the mating of lands with lands , of power with power . Whether they will come back or not depends entirely upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up in Europe , hacked out from old royalist lands . But today there are no cares of state for a good part of the princes and dukes oil the Continent . So the loveless marriages are being openly flouted . Grand duchy is being divorced from grand duchy . At an end , for the time being , are the marital intrigues to ally one nation with another . While mankind which set up kings , pampered their families , became foolishly happy when they discovered in them " human qualities , " and then dethroned them for not being divine , is now struggling , moiling around , trying to create democracies out of autocracy material . While its former princes and kings are selling their jewelry in Switzerland to pay divorce lawyers ' bills or are dining pleasantly among the trees of the Champs Elysee with very unroyal but very charming women , or are splitting wood , or are going mad .  |
