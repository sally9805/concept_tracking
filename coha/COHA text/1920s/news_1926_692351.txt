txt My attention has been called to the fact that the proposed Great Smoky Mountain National Park . conforming to lines recommended by the Secretary of the Interior , will not include the lakes which I mentioned in my recent article in Tse Truss . However , the lakes as formed by the Great Cove Creek Dam will be , it is hoped , preserved for public enjoyment by the creation of a second park to be known as the Tennessee National Paris , . This park , located west of the Tennessee River , would have almost exactly the same area as the Great Smoky Mountain Park . The development of the second area is still problematical . Meanwhile , plans for the Great Smoky Mountain Park have been fully developed and are on the verge of success . As you observed in your editorial which accompanied the article . these plans can not fail if our people are awakened to the facts . FRANK BOHN .
