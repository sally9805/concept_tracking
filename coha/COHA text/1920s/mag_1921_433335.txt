Vil riot v of animal , he hunts all night and dugs his sleeping by day . Somewhere ahead of us he is comfortably curled up , taking his nap and digesting the rabbit ; and as he has no idea that we are after him . he may be depended upon to wait t ill we come . His bed may be fifteen minutes ahead of us , or it may be an hi.or ; but , anyway , we have him on the line , nail he can not very well break the connect ion . We just keep trudging along . and sooner or later we shall find wlarc he put up for the day . ' In his den ? ' we inquire . It has sud-denly occurred to us that we should like to see a fox 's den . This alone would make the trip worth while . But it is evident that this query has no meaning to either Grandpa Dewey or Charlie . When we repeat the word , em-phasizing it , we see t hat it has no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins or his uncles or his aunts . Whereupon we say what we mean  --  his burrow , his hole in the ground , he place where he lives . But this elicits no look of understanding . It would be impossible to find a fox in such a place . A fox sleeps in the open , even in the coldest weather . He simply curls up and drops down in his tracks ; but . he always sleeps with his nose pointing back on the trail ; for he knows that , if he has callers , they are likely to come by that route . He may make his bed on the lee side of a juniper bush , or , if it is very cold , among the undergrowth of a tamarack swamp ; but he is fond of a slope facing south . He has even been known to make his bed on top of a pile of field-stone , possibly because it afforded himagood lookout . A fox finds safety by knowing what is going on around him , not by hiding in a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he would surely be cornered and caught . Grandpa Dewey knew a man who , several years ago , followed a trail that led to a burrow . It was a woodchuck bur-row , which some fox had enlarged the year before to put her cubs in . But this fox that hid in it was wounded . As this seems contrary to ? tfsop and the Bible , and even the lincyclopredia itself , it is not welcome news . We do not like to see authority put in the wrong . It is even contrary to the expression , a ' fox 's den . ' But Grandpa settles the whole matter by telling us that the best was is to wait and see . We shall find that this fox has been sleeping in the snow somewhere ahead of us . And so we decide that , as he has been following these records since the early sixties , and the fox has no way of erasing any of the facts by night or day , we had better hold our opinions in abeyance . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now resting , as we surely shall , we shall see his empty bed in the snow ; but there will be no fox in sight . And as we should never be able to overtake him , even though We had the swiftest horse in the county , that is another reason for not being in a hurry . It is a beautiful winter day , sparkling and crisp . The sun shines across he white fields ; it illumines the armfuls of snow that the trees have caught in their crotches , and makes the distant tamarack seem all the darker by contrast . And as the fox will khow that we are coming , by the rustle of our coats or the squeak of our boots in the snow , quite as well as if we were making what we should call a noise ; and as he would be likely to smell us if we made no noise whatever , there is no restraint upon us . We are free to admire the scenery and talk things over . After much trudging up hill and down dale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the fox 's bed ahead of him ? a round place in the snow ; whereupon he breaks into a running walk like that of an Indian . The moment he reaches it , he stoops over and passes his hand round its interior , and then straightens up , with his hurry all gone . Instead of being soft and spongy , as it would be if the fox had just left it , this bed has had time to freeze and form a crust . A touch of Grandpa 's finger has been enough to tell the story . A fox sett les down with the intention of spending the day ; but he does not always remain of one mind . Something disturbs him ; he becomes restless and suspicious , and finally moves on to another locality . This is what has happened here . And lest we should have conveyed a wrong impression by the word bed , let us explain that it is nothing that the fox makes . He simply curls up and lies down on t. he surface of the snow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the warmth of his body gradually settles the snow and melts it , and lets him down into it . Now WO know that the fox is not very far away . As we shall presently come upon I he bed I hat finally suited him , we follow along with rising expectations . .1leanwhile we seem to have lost Charlie T . Ile wandered off with the gun on his shoulder , to one side of our route and a considerable distance in ad vance . Now he is nowhere in sight , and we wonder what has become of him . He does not seem to care whether we start the fox or not ; and Grandpa Dewey , still carrying the bell by the clapper , does nothing but trudge along . Again be breaks into his jog-trot and makes for the summit of a little knoll . This time he has started the fox . The inside of t his bed is spongy and damp . The fox is only two or three minutes away . Immedial ely the bell comes into action . Grandpa sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were three or four dinner-bells , and all the dinners is a hurry . He explains that this is to let Charlie T know that the fox has been started . Charlie is ahead somewhere , a mile or more away . And then , having made so much ado about it , Grandpa settles into his former state of calm deliberation and follows along the trail , ringing the bell as he goes . Ins ( ead of hastening , now that he has the fox at hand , he becomes even more leisurely ; and the bell settles down to a steady , monotonous clangety-clang , swinging with every step and giving forth its note with the uninspired regularity of a scissors-grinder going his daily rouncls . It may be a long walk that we leave before us , and there is no use its wearing ourselves out . And besides , the slower we go , the sooner we are likely to get the fox . This , it seems , is about all we have to do . Meanwhile , we have learned the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in belling him . And we have learned fact number one , upon which these hunters always depend : which is , that a fox does not live in a den . Charlie T ? , III a mile or so ahead , has got to his present position by describing a big circle . And now his business is to keep well ahead and strictly out of that fox 's sight and out of his hearing and powers of smell . He must keep moving on in order to do it . He has not seen the fox ; because , if he had , the fox would have seen him . As for ourselves , we need observe no precautions . The fox is perfectly aware that we are behind him . He knew it before we reached his bed , and it took no bell to apprise him of the fact . if we had seen hint at the moment he left his bed , we should have seen little more than a streak of reddish color flashing across the snow . Once in a great while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had his bed on a hillside . and you came up the opposite side of the hill , with the wind blowing your scent away from him , and such snow underfoot that your boots did not crunch in the least , you might catch a fox in bed . But you would hardly be aware of his presence before he was aware of yours ; and then it would be too late to take action . A hunter near Pike Lake came across a fox in such favoring circumstances a few years ago . He had his shot-gun in hand , but could not get it . to his shoulder in time . It was , he said , just as if a puff of wind came along at that instant and blew the fox out of sight like a leaf . ' This was a very good description of the fox 's lightness and speed . His coloring , too , is that of the autumn leaf . One instant he flashed upon the sight , and then he was gone . The three parties to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chadic T -- - , are now moving along out of sight of one another . Charlie T ? , far in the lead , is listening to the bell and trying to strike a position where it will come steadily toward him . Br taking a stand and listening closely . Ile is able to tell whether it is corning straight on or veering to this side or that ; and he manoeuvres about accordingly . But when he corrects his course and takes up a new experimental position , he must also move on , and keep well in advance . By the sound of the bell , the fox 's route is being projected ahead of him . Charlie is very deliberately dealing with the fox 's future ; surveying it by sound . The fox is free to go where he will ; and if , after he has come straight on for a while , he suddenly strikes off , at an angle , the hunter has got to circle about and strike up another position . Sooner or later the fox will come straight on ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him . All this sounds very well in theory . But it strikes us as being altogether too deliberate a way of working with a fox . So here we begin to ask questions . If Charlie T --  has not seen the fox , how does he know that the fox is somewhere between him and the bell ? VOL. 127 ? NO. 0 This brings us to fact number two in fox-psychology . A fox will run no faster than lie is chased . This is a fact which may be stated without any reservations . It is no exaggeration to say that t here is no limit t o the slowness wit In which a fox will travel in suit Mg his pace to that of his pursuer . He will stop and look back , curiously . The veriest cripple , a man on crutches , could keep up with a fox as well as the average horse or hound . He will go fast or slow according as it is necessary to keep out of harm 's way ; but in neither case is he a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment he discovered your approach , you would no doubt think that the panic-stricken animal would keep on running till his fright Wore off . But not so . He goes like a streak until he has put his established distance between you and him ; and then he does not run at all . How fast he goes after that depends entirely upon yourself . A wolf will not act like this . When he is surprised by the human presence , he simply lights out ' ; he makes tracks for distant parts , wit Is the idea of leaving all - trouble behind . He becomes a fugitive at once . But the fox would rat her skulk than ruts . As I have said , he is a natural scout and spy . A man who hunts the fox with hounds is not in a position to learn this fact ; at least , not to its full extent . To see a hound running hour after hour behind a fox who manages to keep just so far ahead , you would be likely to think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost as fast as the fox . If the dog could only go a lit t le fast er ! It is nip and tuck ! And the owner of the hound , with that justifiable pride which every man feels in his clog , would be inclined to see it in the same way . But this is not the truth in the case . An experienced boiler of 1 he fox , underst . itiding the whole psychology of the animal , sees it from a quite different point of view . There is no race going on . The fox will run slow deleted material But we must get back to our belling . While we have been talking , the trail has led us across a wide field in the di-action of a range of hills . Suddenly , in the very middle of the field , the trail comes to an end . It stops as abruptly as if t he fox had taken wing and flown . Evidently the age of miracles is not past . We had been supposing that a fox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the snow . The fox has back-tracked . IL has turned carefully about and come toward us , following his own trail . But we have noticed no trail leading off from this one . It must have escaped our eye . The reason is that the fox , before striking out in a new direction , has leaped wide of the present trail , breaking t he connection . Moreover , he has linen at pains to let every footstep fall accurately into the tracks he made before . The result is that there is no double trail to show where he leaped off . That a fox will double on his trail has been known to fox-hunters since before the time of Shakespeare . A pack of hounds , hunting by scent and coming to this abrupt end of things , would be said to be ' at fault , ' or , to use an expression that . Shakespeare was fond of , they would be ' at a check . ' But the hunter who depends upon hounds , following the trail on the bare ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine attention to detail , which the bellman becomes so familiar with . The hounds in such a case as this would have to spread out in all directions , and scour the surrounding territory , in the effort to pick up the new trail . If they did not succeed , the huntsman might ' lift them , ' trying some place of his own purely by guess . Grandpa , Dewey , being his own hound , turns back at once , keeping his eyes about him . The fox has thrown him off the main track and run him into a blindswitch ; but he understands all this sort of work . Presently- he has found where the fox leaped off . The new trail leads off from the other like the branch line of a railroad , which falls short of connecting up with the main system . So now We are on our way again , elangety-elang , elangety-clang , the bell heralding our advance like the bell of a locomotive . This , of course , is not the only little trouble a fox can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route lies across a ploughed field , where t he snow has all blown into the furrows , leaving the clods standing bare . In crossing such a field the fox will keep to the bare places , carefully picking his way and stepping from clod to clod . This puts the hunter out and delays him in his work . Whether the fox does this purposely or not , we shall not presume to say ; but the hunter , thus impeded , puts it down to the rascality of the fox . Again , the fox 's preference for the south side of a hill as a place to spend the day helps him in breaking his trail . The prevailing Winds being from the north its winter , the tracks on the opposite side of the hill , Where he came up and over , arc in a position where they Will soon drift full of snow . If there is any wind moving . that important part of his trail will be obliterated . Such things so frequently happen just at the point where the fox is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hunter becomes convinced of their deliberate purpose . There is no question , however , that the fox has an instinct for breaking his trail . Closely pressed , he will run up the trunk of a half-fallen tree , for the sake of making a wide jump and putting is bigger hiatus its his line of scent ; and he seems to be quite as conscious of the visibility of his trail as of its telltale odor . A farmer of my acquaintance related to me , with some surprise , the following experience . lle WAS standing in his woods , thinking of some work to be done , when a fox came along , hotly pursued by a hound . Suddenly that fox ran right plumb at a big tree , quicker'n scat . ' He struck the tree a considerable distance from the ground ; and at the moment of striking , he gave another spring and shot off to one side , making a wide break in his trail . Considering what a fox will do with a tree that is half-fallen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a step further in his practice , to make use of a vertical surface in an emergency , especially as the rough bark would make the trick quite practicable . It is in line with his known instincts . Many things happen on the trail of a fox , some of them the most evident artifice and some of a nature that might be accounted for as mere chance , but are yet open to doubt . Usually the fox is considered the guilty party , the hunter knowing that he is quite capable of such things . As it is with a man 's reputation , so it is with that of the fox . If he is known as a rascal , everything he does comes under suspicion . If he has a reputat ion for business or political acumen , his most accidental success is imputed to him for surpassing wisdom . From a few such experiences on the trail , we begin to see that Grandpa Dewey has to be a man of parts . There is more to do than follow a plain track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the shrewd solver of mysteries , who knows the workings of the fox 's mind and can not be thrown off the trail . Charlie T ? , on the other hand , is the scout and spy , the master of stealth and camouflage . While the fox tries to fool Grandpa Dewey , Charlie undertakes to fool the fox . About this time , things ought to be growing interesting on the other end ; so we will leave the bellman to his own devices while we circle round and watch the outcome . Charlie T is still scouting about warily with his gun , keeping well ahead , taking a stand , and bending his ear to determine whether the bell is coming straight on . The bell grows plainer and plainer , neither to the left nor to I ho right . Several times he has done this ; then had to make a large , circuitous forward movement as the fox changed his course . In no case must the fox be allowed to come in sight . The sound of the bell serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems to have struck it right . The bell advances steadily in his direction . Charlie goes a little farther down the wind , making a final correction in his position . The bell COWS steadily on . He is coming to close quarters with the fox ; pretty soon the wary animal will appear on the scene . And now is the time for decisive action . Charlie T has had his eye on a tree that might serve as a screen to shoot from ; but this is no longer available . Not far along the route , he secs a small decayed log with a fringe of weeds and brush . He drops down flat behind this , pointing his gun over the top . From now on there must be no movement , no sign of life . The barrel of the gun MUM not move and wobble about in getting the prospective aim . Anything like t that would certainly be noticed . The prospective aim must already be taken . Charlie 's cap is of a dull russet color , blending with the weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hardly he advisable . Next to motion , color is the quickest to attract attention . The too together would be fatal . Form is not so important . Even the whole form of a man , if he remains quite motionless , is not readily picked out from the surroundings . Charlie has hardly got himself into position when the fox comes in sight , picking his way along . Sometimes he pauses and looks back , as if to make sure that he is well ahead of this strange sound that keeps haunting his trail . But there is no dog in the case , ? the fox is well aware of that , ? and hence no ? evasion for hurry . So he pursues his may way and keeps straight on . Meanwhile Charlie T , peering over the log , is as motionless as death . The cap does not bob up and down ; he does not become nervous with the gun . It is plain that he has a firm grip on fact number three . Ile waits till the fox crosses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . And the next instant it is all over . A beautiful specimen of the red male fox , with his fur tti its prime . Nor need we shed any tears over his fate , thus dishonestly dealt with and craftily waylaid . If he had conducted himself like a wolf , running from evil and giving it a wide berth , instead of flirting with it and placing such cheeky reliance on his trickery , he would not have come to this sad end . Moral : in any situation in life , the simple and straightforward method is the best . Be sure that your cunning will find you out . Summing up our knowledge , we find that this most effective way of hunting the fox divides itself under three heads ? starting the fox from his bed , following him with the bell , and waylaying hint . And the uniform success of the method is based upon three facts , which might be set down formally as follow ; . First , a fox does not live in a den . Second , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Third , you can not approach within gunshot of a fox ; but you may make arrangements to have him approach you . V Anyone at all familiar with the methods of the English fox-hunt , or who has read any one of thirty or forty books in the average public library , will find difficulty in accepting these facts as goodnatural history . Fact number one w ill be especially bothersome . The first move in an English fox-hunt is based upon the fact that the fox restarts to a den , not only in spring , when it has cubs to care for , but at all times . The English fox-bunt is a sport usually followed in late fall and winter . Of the Various functionaries of a fox-hunting establishment , t he one known as the earth-stopper ' goes forth to prepare for the hunt . As the fox is an animal that hunts by night , the earth stopper goes forth at night , and stops up the fox 's burrow in the covert ( a patch of gorse or undergrowth ) . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reason that , when the fox comes home in the morning , he takes to his den ; or , if he is lying near it , he will immediately run to it when the hounds are turned into the covert , and will refuse to come forth . To stop his burrow is the only way to get him started . The earth-stopper at the same time visits all other burrows in a large territory , and stops them up , together with any drains or other holes that the fox could get into . For t he fox , shut out of his own home , Will put out his best speed to reach some other burrow , which he has in mind or can find by the way . his whole instinct is toward a burrow . That this is the fox 's habit in England we can not question . The English fox-hunter knows a fox . This difference in the habits of the American and English fox would at first present no difficulty to the nature student . We should nat family infer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same species . But here the plot thickens . Science and history agree in telling us that the American red fox was imported from England . Ile is not a native of this country . The first red foxes seem to have been imported by the Maryland colonists in 1738 , and turned loose along the shores of the Chesapeake . It:tier , in 1760 , others were brought over and liberated on Long Island ; and these stocks multiplied rapidly in the new country . The colonists , who were good Englishmen and enamored of their national sport , ilk I not find t he native gray fox good at the game . It seems evident that t here were 110 red foxes in America , else they would not have sent to England for them . Science comes to the same conclusion in its own way . The bone eaves show pleat iful remains of t he gray fox , but they yield no traces of the red variety . If he was one of the original inhabitants of t his country , these places of ancient memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forced to the same conclusion . If this conclusion is correct , the American red fox is not only of the same species but is , in fact , the English fox himself . He is the offspring of English ancestors . How then are we to harmonize the habits of t lie two branches of the family ? I must admit that , fourteen years ago , when I moved into a fox neighborhood , I doubted the word of every old hunter who told me about his habits . I thought t hat tilOse hunters Were fatdtyobservers , like t hose neighbors who still plant their gardens by the phases of the moon . But 1 he time is long past when I doubted the American hunter 's knowledge of the fox . This was one of the disadvantages of a literary knowledge of a subject , without practical experience . When I had become thoroughly convinced that the fox had no instinct for a den in winter , and would hardly be caught dead in such it place , I began to look narrowly into the fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like oilier wild animals , has got to have a place to shell or and hide her young ; and the place has to be visited because the cubs need to be fed . But that is about all you can say about a fox 's den in spring . ' rho old foxes do not sleep in it , or be tray any instincts toward the burr as a place of habitation . And never is it a place to hide in . They hunt . by night ; and by day they give the den a wido berth , sleeping at a distance , but in a location that commands a full view of the hiding-place of the young and of the surrounding territory . If you approach a fox 's den , you will hear a peculiar yelping in the distance ? a warning to the young to lie low . Very often the burrow is in a location that seems recklessly open to observation . Several years ago , a pair of foxes had their young hidden near my place , on a hill opposite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be farmer came too near that place , he would hear the warning in the distance . It has been asked ( Burroughs puts this query ) why it is that a fox will make her den in such an open place . I think the allS , er is to be found in the fact that the fox finds his safety in knowing what is going on , not in mere hiding . A fox will not take refuge in a deli unless it is wounded or utterly exhausted and unable to go farther . The instances are so rare when a fox has been cornered in a burrow , that old hunters refer I o them as the work of ' fool foxes , ' the theory being that Nature occasionally produces an idiot , even among foxes . Considering that a fox 's trail can be followed , either by scent or by the tracks in the snow , a fox would be a fool to spend much time in such a place . ' rho oldest hunter I know ? he began hunting foxes in 1816 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in over seventy years . And usually t these cases are accounted for by the fact that the fox was young ; and having been raised in that burrow , dropped into it in passing , by way of a visit . The English fox resorts to a burrow at all times , regardless of having cubs to care for ; and there is no object in such a practice except that of hiding itself aWZ1V . The American fox sleeps out in the open in the severest weather , showint , 110 instinct toward a den ; and in spring and summer , the male fox gives the burrow a wide berth , remaining on teal ch , while the female makes visits to it . The English fox clings to a den ; the other stays away , when the whole call of his nature would be toward it . Thus my inquiry into the history of the red foe served but to accentuate the difference between the English and the Amerirnn in this regard . And now , as to harmonizing these C:uts . I hove been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fox in England is not living in a state of nature . A wider knowledge of animals in general , and the study of instinct as inherited experience , tends to strengthen his view . Wild animals accommodate themselves to the ways of man more than we are likely to think . We pride oursehus upon our study of animals , forgt t ing that the animals also study us . But setting aside any theory of instinct and getting down to the fox 's own problems , a study of the English fox-hunt brings the whole matter to a point . In England , the fox is sacred to the chase . To kill a fox except in fair pursuit with horse and hound is vulpicide , fox-murder , ? a social crime . An Englishman seldom sinks so low in the social scale as to trap or shoot a fox . The hunt is surrounded by laws , some statutory , some social and traditional . The fox was originally vermin , and was hunted as such . Though now he is the very opposite of vermin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still kept up for legal purposes ; for thus the riders get their right to chase him over the farmers ' land and tramp down fields that are in crop . But , aside from the statutes , there are other laws , ? gentlemen 's laws , ? as strong as those of the Medes and Persians . It is not usual , for instance , to dig a fox out of a burrow into which he has escaped after giving the field a good run . It is sometimes done , as when young dogs arts being given a practice run , and it is necessary to give them their first taste of blood . Here the little fox-terrier comes into play , his business being to hold the fox in a particular branch of his tunnel While the spade is being used . But this is exceptional ; it is not a recognized part of the sport . So , also , if a fox got into a burrow , in his own covert , which the cart h-stopper had missed , the assembled field of riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a run . They would rather go house , however disappointed , and call the day a ' blank . ' it is not part of the game . Consider then the red fox in full flight across an English moor , with a pack of thirty or forty hounds after him and to field of swift riders on his trail . The hounds have heels bred for speed , with the object of beating the fox in about thirty minutes . What are his chances for escape ? He may , if he should get far enough away and have time , try some of his tricks for delay ; but these will hardly avail him with such a regiment of hounds . H s one great resource will be to take advantage of law ? gentlemen 's law . If he has some distant burrow in mind , and his wind holds out till he can get to it , he is safe . A fox in a burrow has escaped . In view of this fact , and a long racial experience , would it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burrow ? Naturally , such a fox would have a burrow to which he religiously canoe home in the morning , and a complete repertoire of holes in the surrounding country , which he had discovered in his nightly hunts . Would he not he an idiot if he had not ? To apply the American language to the case , I ' It say he would . ' There can he no doubt that an Englishman knows a fox ; also that a fox knows an Englishman . I must confess that , when I finally evolved this theory , after much bafflement over the fox in public libraries , it was a great relief to me . A large part of our standard literature on the fox seems to have been taken from English tradition . It is rather disconcerting to read dozens of books and articles on the red fox , every one of which is at variance with your own positive knowledge of the animal . Thus the facts fall in agreeably with history and the evidence of the bone caves ; and no other way will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings harmony into a set of facts that were very elude at outs with each other . In short , the conduct of a fox in the midst of a fox-hunting aristocracy is no indication of what it fox will do who gets back to nature in a free country . And this is good zoology.
