After a slight pause a door out at the left is heard to close , and then CLARA comes in carrying a fancy box of candy . She glances about the room and crosses to the kitchen-door at the right . CLARA Anybody out there ? She crosses back again towards the left , laying the box of candy on the center-table as she passes . Upon reaching the parlor-doors , at the left , she opens them and calls into the parlorYou in there , Mom ? MRS . FISHER can be heard coming down the stairs . CLARA turns , with a glance toward the hall-door , and moves over to the mirror above the mantelpiece . MRS . FISHER appears in the hall-door and glances in at CLARA MRS . FISHER Oh , it 's you , Clara . She peers out into the hall CLARA Where is everybody ? MRS . FISHER I thought I heard that front-door open . CLARA Where are they all ? MRS . FISHER moving towards the parlor-door.Your Pop 's gone over to Gillespie 's for some tobacco : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the parlor , then turns and kisses CLARA . CLARA moves down to the chair at the left of the center-table and MRS . FISHER moves over to the kitchen-door at the rightI do n't know how you can stand that fur on you , Clara , a night like this . p. 3 CLARA It 's rather cool out . MRS . FISHER calling out through the kitchen-door.You out there , Joe ? CLARA sitting down.He is n't out there . MRS . FISHER turning around to the cellar-door at her left.He must be around here somewhere ; he was here not two minutes ago , when I went up-stairs . Opening the cellar-door and calling down You down there , Joey ? JOE from the cellar.Yes . MRS . FISHER All right . Closes the cellar-door JOE What do you want ? MRS . FISHER turning to the cellar-door again.What ? JOE and CLARA , speaking together JOE What do you want ? CLARA He sez , " What do you want ? " MRS . FISHER opening the cellar-door again.

He sez he can make one himself , but I sez , " I 'll believe it when I see it . " p. 4 CLARA There 's some of that candy you like . MRS . FISHER crossing to the center-table.Oh , did you bring me some more of that nice candy ? Beginning to untie the ribbon around the candyI never got a taste of that last you brought . CLARA Why not ? MRS . FISHER Why ,  --  Lady Jane took it away with her down to the office , and never brought it back . She sez the girls down there et it . I sez , " I guess you 're the girl that et it . " She sez she did n't , but I know she did . CLARA Well , I hope you 'll keep that out of sight , and do n't let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wo n't get her hands on this , I can promise you that . Let her buy her own candy if she 's so fond of it . CLARA opening the " Delineator " . She wo n't buy much of anything , if she can get hold of it any other way . MRS . FISHER Oh , is n't that lovely ! Look Clara  --  Tilting the box of candy towards CLARADo n't that look nice ? CLARA Yes , they do their candy up nice . p. 5 MRS . FISHER gingerly picking up the cover of lace paper.That looks just like Irish point lace , do n't it ? CLARA nods yesI think I 'll put that away somewhere ,  --  in a book or something . My , look at all the colors  --  look Clara  --  did you ever see so many colors ? CLARA It 's pretty , is n't it ? MRS . FISHER It 's beautiful  --  seems a pity to spoil it . Do you want a bit of it , Clara ? CLARA Not now , Mom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one here . I like the pick ones . She picks up the box and the lid and moves around to the chair at the right of the tableMind how they all have this little fancy paper around them . You 'd wonder they 'd bother , would n't you ?  --  just for a bit of candy . She tastes the candy and chews , criticallyThat 's nice candy , is n't it ? CLARA Yes , I like bonbons . MRS . FISHER sitting down. I do too  --  I think I like them better than most anything . Putting the box of candy down on the table I 'm sorry these are not all bonbons. p. 6 CLARA looking up from the " Delineator " . They are all bonbons  --  Her Mother looks at herThere 's nothing else in there . MRS . FISHER Oh , are they !  --  I thought only the pink ones were the bonbons . CLARA No , they 're all bonbons . MRS . FISHER Well , that 's lovely . I can eat any one of them I like , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rocks and chewsHow is it you 're not home to-night , Clara ? CLARA Frank had to go to a dinner of some kind at the Glenwood Club ; so I thought I 'd stay in town and get something . He said he might call for me here around eight o'clock . I was in anyway about my lamp . MRS . FISHER rocking.Men are always going to dinners somewhere . Seems to me they ca n't talk about anything unless they 've got a dinner in front of them . It 's no wonder so many of them are fat . CLARA turning a page of the " Delineator " . Where 's Amy ,  --  upstairs ? MRS . FISHER Yes , she 's gettin ' dressed . I was just hookin ' her when you came in . CLARA Is she going out ? p. 7 MRS . FISHER I do n't know whether she is or not ,  --  I did n't hear her say . Leaning a bit towards CLARA , and lowering her voiceBut it 's Wednesday night , you know . CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , right on the dot  --  such as he is . Sunday nights too now , as well as Wednesdays . It looks like a steady thing . And you never in your life heard anybody talk so much , Clara  --  I do n't know how she stands him . Your Pop can hardly stay in the room where he is . I believe in my heart that 's the reason he went over to Gillespie 's to-night  --  so he would n't be listenin ' to him . CLARA Does n't she take him into the parlor ? MRS . FISHER She does , yes ; but she might just as well leave him out here ; for he 's not in there five minutes till he 's out here again  --  talkin ' about Socialism . That 's all you hear ,  --  Socialism  --  and capital and labor . You 'd think he knew somethin ' about it . And the Pennsylvania Railroad . He 's always talkin ' about that , too . That 's where he works , you know . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's head of the freight department ; but as I sez to our Joe , I sez , " I do n't know how he can be head of anything , from the talk of him . " Joe sez he thinks he 's a nut . And your Pop told him right to his face last Sunday night  --  that he did n't know the meanin ' of the word Socialism . She checks herself and gets upI 'd better not be talkin ' so loud ,  --  he 's apt to walk in on us . She moves up towards the hall-door and glances outHe 's a great joker , you know  --  That 's what he did last Sunday night . Coming forward again to a point above the center-tableI never got such a fright in my life . Your Pop and me was sittin ' here talkin ' , just the way we are now , when , all of a sudden , I glanced up , and there he was ,  --  standin ' in the doorway there , doin ' this She points her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARA laughs faintly  --  as though he was a bandit , you know . Well ,  --  I thought the breath 'd leave my body . Then he sez , " Haha !  --  that 's the time I fooled you ! " I do n't know how long he 'd been standin ' there . But , as luck 'd have it , we was n't talkin ' about him at the time : altho we had been talkin ' about him not five minutes before . I do n't know whether he heard us or not , for I do n't know how long he 'd been standin ' there . I hope he did : it 'd just be the price of him , for bein ' so smart . With a glance toward the hall-door , and speaking very confidentiallyBut , you know , what 'd kill you , Clara , you ca n't say a word about him in front of her . CLARA movesOh , not a word . No matter what he sez , she thinks it 's lovely . When Joe told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she just laughed , and said that Joe was jealous of him  --  because he could express himself and he could n't . CLARA smilesYou never heard such talk . And , you know , Clara , I think he wears a wig . CLARA laughsI do , honestly . And our Joe sez he thinks he does too . But when I asked her about it here one mornin ' , I thought she 'd take the head right off me . You never seen anybody get themselves into such a temper . She sez , " It 's a lie , " she sez , " he do n't wear a wig . " She sez , " People always say somethin ' like that about a fellow that makes a good appearance . " But , I think he does , just the same ; and the first chance I get I 'm goin ' to take a good look . She moves around to her chair again , at the right of the tableHe often sits right here , you know , under this light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candyand I 'm goin ' to look close the very first chance I get . She sits down I can tell a wig as good as anybody . She rocks and looks straight out , chewingShe wo n't make a liar out of me. p. 8 AMY from the head of the stairs.Mom , did you see anything of that blue bar-pin of mine ? MRS . FISHER calling back to her.Which blue bar-pin ? AMY Well now , how many blue barpins have I got ? MRS . FISHER I do n't know how many you 've got , and I do n't care ! Turning back again and speaking rather to herselfSo do n't be botherin ' me about it . Calling up to AMY againIf you ca n't find it , go look for it . She resumes her rocking and her chewingShe thinks all she 's got to do is come to the head of them stairs and holler and everybody 'll jump .  --  But she 'll get sadly left .  --  I 've got somethin ' else to do besides waitin ' on her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARADid you get your lamp yet ? CLARA No , that 's what I was in town to-day about . The girl sez they have n't been able to match the silk till yesterday . MRS . FISHER I wish I could get somethin ' done to that one of mine there in the parlor ; the wire 's right out through the silk in two places . CLARA Why does n't Amy take it in some day MRS . FISHER makes a sound of amusement  --  when she 's going to work ? p. 9 MRS . FISHER Why do n't she ! It 's all Amy can do to take herself into work these days . I 've almost got to push her out the door every morning . CLARA Could n't she take it over at lunch-time ? MRS . FISHER She sez she has n't time at lunch-time . CLARA Oh , she has so time . MRS . FISHER Of course she has . CLARA It 's only at Ninth and Chestnut , and she 's at Eighth . MRS . FISHER That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was somethin ' for yourself you 'd have plenty of time . " Leaning towards CLARABut , you know ,  --  what I think , Clara  --  I think she 's meetin ' this fellow at lunch-time . Because in the mornin 's here she stands fixin ' herself there in front of that glass till it 's a wonder to me she do n't drop on the floor . And whenever you see them gettin ' very particular that way all of a sudden  --  there 's somethin ' in the wind . I sez to her the other mornin ' , when she was settlin ' herself there till I got tired lookin ' at her , I sez , " You must be goin ' to see him to-day , ai n't you ? " And she sez , " He must be on your mind , is n't he ? " " No , " I sez , " but by the looks of things , I think he 's on yours . And , " I sez , " maybe after you get him you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to . " Because , you know , Clara , she do n't know a thing about him ; except that he works in the Pennsylvania freight office  --  I believe he did tell her that much . But she do n't know whether he works there or not . He could tell her anything ; and she 'd believe it Taking another bite of candy and settling herself in her chair  --  before she 'd believe me. p. 10 CLARA That 's where he works Her Mother looks at her sharply  --  at the Pennsylvania freight office . MRS . FISHER How do you know ? CLARA Frank knows him . MRS . FISHER Frank Hyland ? CLARA Yes ,  --  he sez he he say he knows him ? CLARA Yes . He sez he 's seen him around there for a long time . I 've often heard him speak of him , but I did n't know it was the same fellow . Frank always called him Carnation Charlie . He sez he 's always got a big carnation in his buttonhole . MRS . FISHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always got it on when he comes here , too . CLARA Frank sez he 's never seen him without it . MRS . FISHER I have n't either . And I believe in my heart , Clara that 's what 's turned her head . CLARA smilesYou often see things like that , you know . The worst fool of a man can put a carnation in his coat or his hat over one eye , and half a dozen sensible women 'll be dyin ' about him . p. 11 CLARA Well , Frank sez this fellow 's absolutely crazy . MRS . FISHER That 's what your Father sez . CLARA He sez they kid the life out of him down around the restaurant there . MRS . FISHER Well , he do n't know who Frank Hyland is , does he ? CLARA No , Frank did n't tell him . He sez he just happened to get talking to him the other day and he mentioned that he was calling on a girl up this way named Fisher . So then Frank found out what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me about him . MRS . FISHER Well , is he sure it 's the same fellow ? CLARA He told him his name was Piper . MRS . FISHER with finality.That the name  --  Aubrey Piper . I do n't know where he got the Aubrey from ; I never heard of such a name before , did you ? CLARA Yes , I 've heard the name of Aubrey . MRS . FISHER rocking.Well , I never did . Sounds to me more like a place than a name . AMY can be heard coming down the stairsHere she comes . She snatches up the box of candy and puts it under her apron p. 12 CLARA Do n't say anything , now . MRS . FISHER It 'd be no use . Trying to be casualWhat color are you havin ' your lamp-shade made , Clara ? AMY hurrying in at the hall-door.Mom , you must have seen something of that bar-pin of mine ; I ca n't find it anywhere . She tosses a beaded bag onto the center-table and turns to the mantelpiece and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours in one of the drawers in the buffet there a few days ago , I do n't know whether it 's there yet or not . AMY hurrying across to the buffet at the right.How 's it you 're not home tonight , Clara ? She starts to rummage in the buffet-drawers CLARA casually.I had my dinner in town . AMY Is that parlor all right , Mom ? MRS . FISHER Certainly it 's all right . AMY Well , did you side it ? MRS . FISHER sharply.Certainly I sided it . p. 13 AMY All right , Mom , do n't make a speech about it . MRS . FISHER considerably ruffled.No , but you 'd think the way she sez it that I sat here all day with my two hands as long as each other . AMY finds the pin and slams the drawer shut , leaving various ends of tape and pieces of lace hanging out . Then she starts back towards the mirror over the mantelpieceDid you find it ? AMY disrespectfully.Yes . MRS . FISHER rising , still holding the candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a wonder you would n't leave these drawers the way you found them . She does that every time she goes near this buffet . She puts the various odds and ends back into the drawers and closes themShe 's in such a great rush lately . AMY settling herself at the mirror.Is n't that a new dress on you , Clara ? CLARA Yes . MRS . FISHER coming back to her chair.I 'd like to see the kind of house you 'll keep . AMY Well , I hope it wo n't be anything like this one , I 'll tell you that . p. 14 MRS . FISHER stopping halfway to her chair.Oh , go easy , lady ! You might be very glad to have half as good , if you live long enough . Continuing to her chair , and looking keenly at CLARA 'S dressI thought I had n't seen that dress on you before . She sits down CLARA No , I only got it last week . MRS . FISHER Stand up there till I see it . CLARA gets up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her skirt , then turns around to her left and faces her Mother . AMY comes down to the center-table , looking sharply at CLARA 'S dress CLARA I got it at a sale in Strawbridge 's . AMY opens her beaded purse on the table and looks at herself critically in the little inside mirror ; then adds a touch of powder MRS . FISHER It 's a nice length . CLARA I did n't have to have a thing touched on it . MRS . FISHER That 's what I was tellin ' you about the other day , Amy .  --  Do you see the way that dress hangs ? AMY Yeh . MRS . FISHER speaking directly to CLARA.There was a dress on Queen Mary in last Sunday 's Ledger that I was sayin ' to Amy I thought 'd look good on me . And it had all buttons up and down the front , the way that has . p. 15 CLARA coming back to her chair.A lot of the new dresses are made that way . MRS . FISHER How much was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nails MRS . FISHER turning away , with a lift of her eyes to Heaven.You must have plenty of money . AMY Mom , where 'd you put those roses I brought home ? MRS . FISHER They 're out there in the dining-room . AMY starts towards the rightI put them in some water . AMY goes out ; and MRS . FISHER rocks for a second or two ; then she turns and calls after AMYI think it 's time you lit the light in that parlor , Amy , if that fellow of yours is comin ' here tonight . She rocks a little bit more , then turns casually to CLARAWhat time is it by your watch there , Clara ? With a glance toward the mantelpiece at the backThat old clock of ours is stopped again . CLARA looking at her wrist-watch.Quarter past eight . MRS . FISHER getting up suddenly. I must tell her . The box of candy lands on the floorMy God , there goes the candy ! Pick that up , Clara , I ca n't stoop ; and put it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightIt 's a wonder I did n't do that while she was in here . Calling out after AMYAmy ! p. 16 AMY Yes ? MRS . FISHER Clara sez it 's a quarter past eight by her watch ;  --  you 'd better get some kind of a light in that parlor if that fellow 's comin ' . She moves back towards her chair , then speaks in a very subdued tone to CLARAShe brings flowers home with her from the city now , every night he 's coming . She must have flowers for him in the parlor . She sits down I told her , I sez , " I bet it 'd be a long time before you 'd bring any flowers home from the city to me . " CLARA That 's another new dress on her to-night , is n't it ? MRS . FISHER straightening the megazines on the table.She 's had it about a week . CLARA What 's she getting so many new dresses for lately ? MRS . FISHER Heaven knows , I do n't . CLARA That 's the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISHER Tryin ' to make him think she 's rich , I guess . I told her the other night she might not get so many after she gets him . AMY entering from the right , carrying a vase of roses , and crossing directly to the parlor-doors at the left. You need another box of matches out there , Mom . p. 17 MRS . FISHER Is that box of matches gone already ? AMY Pretty near . She goes into the parlor MRS . FISHER I swear I do n't know where all the matches go to ;  --  seems to me all I do is buy matches . AMY strikes a match in the parlorBe careful of them lace curtains there , now , Amy , if you 're goin ' to light that lamp . The lamp is lit in the parlor ; and AMY closes the parlor-doors CLARA rising and handing her Mother the box of candy , which she has been holding since she picked it up from the floor. I think I 'll go , before he comes . MRS . FISHER rising.You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARA moves up to the looking-glass over the mantelpiece , and MRS . FISHER crosses to the buffet with the candyFor if he ever starts talkin ' , you 'll never get out . She puts the candy into one of the drawers , then starts across towards the hall-door , up at the leftYou would n't mind , you know , if he 'd stay in there in the parlor ;  --  but the minute ever he hears a voice out here , he 's out like a jumpin ' - jack . AMY can be heard coughing out in the hallway , and , as MRS . FISHER passes back of CLARA , CLARA half turns and suggests with a movement of her hand that AMY might overhear her Oh , he 's not here yet ; you 'd know it if he was . She peers keenly out into the hallway , then turns and tiptoes back to CLARA , and speaks in a very low toneShe stands out there in the vestibule until she sees him get off the trolley , then she comes in and lets him ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for him . She tiptoes back and peers out into the hallway again , and CLARA moves over to the right , adjusting her neck-piece . MRS . FISHER comes back to the center-tableYou never seen anybody so crazy about a fellow . p. 18 CLARA Well , I think somebody ought to tell her about him , Mom . MRS . FISHER folding the ribbon and the paper from the candy-box.What 's the good of tellin ' her ;  --  she 'd only give you a look if you said anything about him . CLARA Well , I 'd say it anyway , whether she gave me a look or not ; for , remember what I 'm telling you , Mom , it 's you that 'll have them on your hands if she takes him . Her Mother looks at her sharply MRS . FISHER I 'll have them on my hands ? CLARA turning to her Mother.Well now , who else will , Mom ? You could n't leave her out on the street ; and that 's exactly where she 'll land if she takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along on a hundred and fifty dollars a month . MRS . FISHER Takes more than that to keep herself , never name a house and a husband . CLARA Well , that 's exactly what he gets , for he 's only a clerk down there . MRS . FISHER He told her he was the head of the department . CLARA He 's a clerk , Mom ,  --  like a hundred others down there : Frank knows what he does . p. 19 MRS . FISHER moving a step or two nearer to CLARA.Well , why do n't you say something to her , Clara ? CLARA Now , you know how much attention she 'd pay to anything I 'd say . MRS . FISHER with measured definiteness.She wo n't pay any attention to what anybody sez . CLARA Especially if she knew it was Frank Hyland that said it . MRS . FISHER She thinks everybody 's jealous of him ; and jealous of her because she 's gettin ' him . So let her get him . If she makes her bed , let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the trouble , Mom ; it is n't always the person that makes the bed that lies in it .  --  Very often somebody else has to lie in it . MRS . FISHER turning back to the table. Well , it 'll be nobody around here , I can promise you that . CLARA turning to the buffet-mirror.Maybe not . MRS . FISHER No maybe about it . CLARA But you know what you are , Mom , where Amy 's concerned . p. 20 MRS . FISHER taking a step towards CLARA.Why , do n't be silly , Clara . Do you think your Father 'd be listenin ' to that rattle-brain here every night ? CLARA turning and speaking directly to her Mother.He has to listen to him now , does n't he  --  or go out , as he did to-night . The front-door closes . They both turn and glance in the direction of the hallwayMaybe this is Frank now . There is a slight pause , then FRANK HYLAND comes in , and comes forward to the center-table MRS . FISHER Hello , Frank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts his hat down on the table CLARA I was just going ; I thought maybe you were n't coming . HYLAND looking at his watch.I could n't get away from there until nearly eight o'clock . MRS . FISHER Frank ,  --  Clara sez you know this fellow that 's comin ' to see our Amy . HYLAND Who , Piper ? MRS . FISHER Yes  --  the one that does so much talkin ' . HYLAND Yes , I know him . He moves to the left and sits down on the arm of the Morris-chair p. 21 MRS . FISHER I think he 's crazy , Frank ; HYLAND makes a sound of amusementI do , honestly ; and Pop and Joe sez they think he is , too . CLARA Mom sez he told Amy he was head of the freight department , Frank . MRS . FISHER He did , honestly , Frank ; and she believes him . But Clara sez you say he 's only a clerk down there . CLARA That 's all he is , Mom . MRS . FISHER He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank ? FRANK sits looking away off , dreamily CLARA Frank  --  HYLAND turning.I beg your pardon , what did you say , dear ? MRS . FISHER He is n't head of the freight department down there , is he ? HYLAND No , he 's just one of the clerks . MRS . FISHER turning to CLARA.Now , you see that  --  and she 'd only laugh at you if you told her that . Turning back to HYLANDHow much do them freight-clerks get a month , Frank ? HYLAND is gazing out of the window at the left p. 22 CLARA Frank , Mom is talking to you . HYLAND turning.Oh , I beg your pardon , what did you say , Mother ? MRS . FISHER I say , how much do them freight-clerks get a month ? HYLAND Why ,  --  about a hundred and forty or fifty dollars ,  --  I do n't know exactly ; but not any more than that . His eyes wander to the window again MRS . FISHER What are we goin ' to do about it , Frank ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday and Sunday nights now  --  and if she ever takes him , she 'll be the poorest woman in this city . You know how our Amy spends money . Turning to CLARAShe 's got seven pairs of shoes up in that hall-closet . HYLAND abstractedly.Amy certainly does let her money fly . MRS . FISHER gives him a stoney look MRS . FISHER Well , if she does she earns it . She might as well have a good time now while she 's young ;  --  God knows what 's ahead of her . The front door-bell rings ,  --  a series of funny little tapsHere he is now , I know his ring . She steps up to the mantelpiece and glances out into the hallway p. 23 CLARA turning towards the kitchendoor.We 'll go out the side-door . Come on , Frank . HYLAND rises and picks up his hat from the table , as he crosses below it HYLAND Good-night , Mother . MRS . FISHER is too occupied with her interests out in the hallwayDo you want to go to a picture , Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HYLAND following her.It 's only about twenty after eight . He glances at his watch CLARA We can get the second show at Broad and Columbia Avenue . MRS . FISHER following them out.Frank , I wish you 'd talk to Amy some time , and tell her what you told me ; she wo n't believe me . HYLAND I do n't suppose she 'd believe me , either , Mother . PIPER out at the front-door.Right on the job ! AMY Hello ! PIPER The pride of old West Philly ! He laughs a bit , boisterously p. 24 AMY I 'll take your hat , Aubrey . PIPER Anything to please the ladies . The front-door closesThe boy rode off with many thanks , and many a backward bow . He laughs again , rather wildly . MRS . FISHER tiptoes into the room from the right and stands listening , keenlyDo you know , I think I 'll have to get hold of an airship somewhere , Amy , to come out here to see you . AMY It is quite a trip for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , if you say it quick ; by the little old Brill special . And how is the Mother ? MRS . FISHER 'S face hardens , and a door closes . Then she tiptoes over to the double-doors at the left and listens . AUBREY 'S voice can be heard fairly distinctly from beyond the doorsSay , Amy  --  was n't that hold-up in last night 's paper somewhere out this way ? AMY Yes , it was right over here on Erie Avenue . MR . FISHER appears in the hall-door and stands , looking with amusement at his wife . He takes an old pipe and tobacco-pouch from the pocket of his knit-jacket and starts to fill the pipe PIPER A doctor 's house , was n't it ? AMY Yes , Doctor Donnelly 's . They got nearly two thousand dollars . p. 25 PIPER I do n't believe that , Amy . AMY Why not ? PIPER I do n't believe there 's that much money in North Philadelphia . He roars with laughter MR . FISHER gives his wife a little dig in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She starts violently smothering a little shriek MRS . FISHER Oh , you frightened me ! MR . FISHER continues to the center-table and sets his newspaper down MR . FISHER You ought to be pretty nearly frightened to death by this time , ought n't you ? He replaces the tobacco-pouch in his pocket MRS . FISHER Well , it 's no wonder I 'd be . MR . FISHER You 've been jumpin ' that way ever since I knew you . MRS . FISHER Well , what do you come pussy-footin ' in that way for , when you know how nervous I am ? MR . FISHER I did n't come pussy-footin ' in at all . MRS . FISHER You did so , or I 'd have heard you . MR . FISHER You would have heard me , if you were n't so busy listenin ' to somethin ' that 's none of your business . p. 26 MRS .

FISHER brushes the tobacco from the table-cloth MR . FISHER I 'm not spillin ' any of it . There 's a burst of laughter from AUBREY in the parlor , and MR . FISHER looks toward the parlor-doorWho 's in there  --  Windy ? MRS . FISHER nods , yes , and the old man moves down at the right of the center-table , picking up the newspaper and reaching into his vestpocket for his spectaclesWhat 's he doin ' , laughin ' at some more of them West Philadelphia jokes of his ? He sits down to read , in the chair at the right of the table , and MRS . FISHER comes tiptoeing towards the chair at the left of the table MRS . FISHER in a lowered tone.He was astin ' Amy about that robbery over at Doctor Donnelly 's yesterday mornin ' ; and when she told him the bandits got away with nearly two thousand dollars , he said it could n't be true , because there was n't that much money in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

AUBREY continues to laugh MR . FISHER settling himself to read.I 'll bet there would n't have to be much money up this way to be more than he 's got . There 's a sound of hammering in the cellar . MRS . FISHER hurries across to the cellar-door PIPER in the parlor.You know , I discovered tonight , Amy , that I can save a full fifteen minutes on this trip over here , by transferring up Twentyninth to the Lehigh Avenue car , instead of going on in and up Nineteenth . MRS . FISHER opening the cellar-door and calling down , in a subdued voice.Joe ! Stop that hammering down there , we ca n't hear our ears up here . The old man gives a hard chuckle . MRS FISHER tip-toes back towards the parlor-doors , looking at her husband stonilyWhat ails you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless you use the Park trolley .

AMY I do n't know how you ever found West Philadelphia . PIPER Lot of people think they have n't found it yet . He bursts into violent laughterLost somewhere between the Schuylkill River and Darby . He laughs some more . The old man looks piercingly over his spectacles at his wife MR . FISHER almost shouting.Come away from there , Josie ! MRS . FISHER is startled almost to death . She places her hand on her bosom and moves away from the door towards the center of the roomDo n't be listenin ' to that damned blatherskite . MRS .

She moves up to the little stand between the hall-door and the mantelpiece and picks up her knitting-bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said in the parlor . MRS .

He sez West Philadelphia ai n't been found yet ,  --  that it 's lost somewhere between the Schuylkill River and Darby . She moves over to the arm-chair at the right , in front of the window , and sits down p. 29 MR . FISHER I wish to God he 'd get lost some night , somewhere between here and the Schuylkill River . MRS . FISHER taking the needles and the pink wool out of the knitting-bagWhat 'd kill you , too , you know , he always dies laughin ' whenever he gets off one of them bum jokes . MR . FISHER Somebody 's got to laugh . PIPER from the parlor.Ha ! Ha ! That 's the time I fooled you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right over the plate . AMY has quite a laughing fit in the parlor . Her Mother looks narrowly toward the parlor-doors until AMY has finished laughing MRS . FISHER He 's got Amy laughin ' now , too . She commences to knit ; and there is a slight pause . Then she glances at the clock on the mantelpieceThat old clock has stopped again , Neil . MR . FISHER without moving.Needs fixin ' . MRS . FISHER It 's been fixed twice ,  --  do n't do no good . There is a pause , and MRS . FISHER sighsI think it 's terrible lonesome not to hear the clock  --  it 's too still in a room .  --  It always sounds to me like soap-bubbles meltin ' . p. 30 MR . FISHER H 'm  --  here 's a fellow here 's been left a quarter of a million dollars , and he wo n't take it . MRS . FISHER sharply.What 's the matter with him ? MR .

AUBREY laughs in the parlor . MRS . FISHER glances toward the parlor-doors ; then shifts her knittingEvery sweater I start I swear it 'll be the last  --  and then I start right in on another . She gives a faint little laugh and looks at her husband ; but he 's reading ; so she subsides and continues to knit . Suddenly she stops and rests her knitting in her lap , and thinks ; then turns to MR . FISHERWell now , what becomes of money like that , Neil , that people wo n't take ? p. 31 MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . FISHER I say , what becomes of money that people wo n't take that way ? MR .

FISHER is puzzled for a second MRS . FISHER resuming her knitting.Well , I 'll bet if they left it to me they would n't have to come and take it . MR . FISHER looking at her again with a shade of irritation.Who would n't have to come and take it ? MRS . FISHER losing her temper.Why , the people that wo n't take it ! MR .

JOE holding his work under the tablelamp to look at it closely.You do n't want me hammerin ' up here , do you ? MRS . FISHER I do n't want you hammerin ' anywhere . I want you to go out at night and get some air , and not be cooped up in that dusty old cellar . There 's a violent burst of laughter from AUBREY in the parlor . JOE glances towards the parlor-doors , then turns , with something of distress in his expression , to his Mother JOE Who 's in there  --  the Pennsylvania Railroad ? MRS . FISHER Yes , and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to the chair at the left of the center-table and sitting down.You wo n't say that when you 're sittin ' here listenin ' to the Grand Opera .

He moves to the mirror over the mantelpieceJust a little social attention ,  --  going right out again on the next train . He surveys himself critically in the mirror , touching his tie and toup gingerly . MRS . FISHER gives him a smouldering look , and JOE looks at his Father . AUBREY turns from the mirror , and indicates his reflection with a wide gestureThere you are , Mother ! Any woman 's fancy , what do you say ? Even to the little old carnation . He gives the table a double tap with his knuckles , then laughs , and moves up towards the kitchen-door , and calls out to AMYCome on , Amy , step on the United Gas out there ; customer in here waiting for the old aqua pura .

He laughs a little and looks from one to the other , patronizingly ; but nobody pays the slightest attention to himFather reading ,  --  Mother knitting ; MRS . FISHER withers him with a quick lookBut then , Mama is always knitting . She knits rapidly and AUBREY laughts , and moves up and across back of the tableAnd little Tommy Edison over here , working eighteen hours a day to make the rich man richer and the poor man poorer .

And little old Popsy-Wopsy getting sore and going to leave us flat . He laughs again considerably ; then turns to MRS . FISHERNevertheless , and notwithstanding , Mrs. Fisher , I 'd like to mention that the kid from West Philadelphia is giving the growing boy the said and done . He indicates JOE with a waving gesture . AMY comes in from the right with a glass of water . He turns and acknowledges her with even a wider gestureAnd there she is herself , and not a moving picture . AMY extends the glass of water , laughing , and with a touch of **26;2703;TOOLONG as she gave it , looking down  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMY giggles , and her Mother looks sharply at AMY 's shoes .

He punctuates this last remark with a series of patronizing taps on JOE 'S back  --  Take it or leave it  --  sign on the dotted line . He taps his knuckles on the table , and moves back again to MRS . FISHER 'S leftYes , sir ,  --  that 's exactly what they did to little old yours truly here .

Because I work for my living . That 's the said and done on the whole business . MRS . FISHER starts to put her things into the knitting-bag , preparatory to getting upKeep them poor and get them married ; and then , he looks away offas my darling old Mother used to say , " You 've got them on their beams and hinges .

FISHER is sitting at the right of the table asleep , her knitting lying in her lap ; and JOE , sitting at the left of the table , is endeavoring to pass the tap of a wire through a small eyelet on the base-board . AMY starts to play the piano in the parlor ; and , after the usual introduction , AUBREY begins to sing , " Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep " , in a heavy bass voice . PIPER singing'Rocked in the cradle of the deep , I lay me down ,  --  in peace to sleep  --  Secure I rest upon the wave , For Thou alone  --  MRS . FISHER starts slightly and wakens .

JOE reaching into his belt-pocket for an Ingersoll watch.The old Scientific American himself . A quarter of twelve . MRS . FISHER My God ! what 's he startin ' to sing at this hour for ! She steps to the buffet at the right and puts her knitting-bag into one of the drawers JOE Talent should never be suppressed at any time , Mother . MRS .

FISHER Oh , I would n't care if he bawled his head off , as far as I 'm concerned  --  I 'd be glad if he did ; but I do n't want him to waken your Father . She steps up to the hall-door and listens , at the foot of the stairsAnd that 's what he 'll be doin ' the first thing you know , and then the fat 'll be in the fire for sure . AUBREY reaches a high note , and JOE and his Mother stand looking at each other . Then JOE bursts out laughingAi n't that terrible , Joe ?

FISHER turns and looks at the parlor-doors . Then there 's a burst of wild laughter from AUBREY . This decides MRS . FISHER . She steps resolutely towards the doors with the ostensible purpose of opening them , but , before she can reach the knob , the door is yanked open from the inside , and AMY steps out , looking resentfully at her p. 42 AMY What 's the matter ? MRS . FISHER a trifie disconcerted.Why ,  --  a  --  I was just comin ' to tell you to be sure and put them lights out ; I 'm just goin ' up  --  it 's nearly twelve o'clock .

He bursts into a wild laugh and draws back into the parlor ; and MRS . FISHER , with a series of frantic gestures , intended to convey to AMY the imminence of her Father at the head of the stairs , steps back out of the range of the parlor-door . AMY makes an impatient movement of her body , and stamps her foot , then flounces into the parlor and slams the doorThe little old song at twilight , you know , Mother Fisher  --  to soothe the savage breast . He gives vent to another gale of laughter ; and MRS . FISHER stands petrified , expecting to hear her husband again MRS . FISHER as AUBREY 'S laugh subsides.The damn fool !

He goes laughing out into the hallway JOE coming in from the kitchen , mimicking AUBREY 'S laugh.Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! He passes his Mother without seeing her MRS . FISHER coming out of the alcove.Shush ! Do n't let him hear you , Joe . JOE turns and looks at his Mother , then continues across to the left to the hall-door JOE Is he goin ' ? MRS . FISHER following JOE to the center of the room.At last ! JOE glances out into the hallwayDo n't let him see you , now , Joe , or we 'll have him here for another hour .

FISHER That 's what you 're always talkin ' about , ai n't it ? JOE Yes , I was talkin ' to him about it one night here , while he was waitin ' for Amy to come down ; and he 's forgot where he heard it . MRS . FISHER Can you imagine !

She glances out into the hallway , then steps to the parlor-door , opens it quietly and glances in , and starts across towards the right . The front-door closes out in the hallway , then the vestibule-door . MRS . FISHER glances over her right shoulder toward the hallway , then continues to the kitchen-door . Just as she reaches the kitchen-door and glances out , the parlor-door is flung open and AMY comes in . She takes a couple of steps towards the middle of the room , then stands still , looking bitterly at her Mother . MRS . FISHER speaks without looking at herDid you put that light out in there ? AMY in a quiet rage.That was a nice trick you people did tonight ! Her Mother turns and looks at her MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Aubrey was talking . MRS .

AMY swinging to the mirror over the mantelpiece.I was never so mortified in my life . MRS . FISHER standing above the center-table.Oh , do n't waste your sympathy , Amy ! He do n't have to have anybody listen to him ; he 'd talk to the wall if there was n't anybody else around . AMY coming forward at her Mother 's right.What did Pop get into such a temper about ?

You tell our Clara for me the next time you see her , to mind her own damn business  --  She taps the back of the chair twice with her knuckles , emphasizing the words " damn " and " business " as far as Aubrey Piper is concerned . p. 51 MRS . FISHER before AMY has finished speaking.Oh , do n't fly into a temper , if anybody speaks to you ! She turns and crosses hurriedly to the hall-door to listen AMY stamping her foot.Well then , do n't speak to me about things that put me in a temper ! MRS .

She leans forward a little on the table and speaks with a steady precisionOnly remember this , Amy ,  --  if you do take him ,  --  be sure that you keep him  --  and that  --  he  --  keeps  --  you . AMY looks at her keenlyAnd do n't be comin ' around here cryin ' for your Pop to keep you . p. 52 AMY with a sound of amused derision , and flouncing down to the arm-chair at the right.

FISHER Because I know what he earns ;  --  She strikes the table with her fistand it is n't enough . AMY stamping her fcot.Oh , do n't go making up things , Mom !  --  You do n't know anything about what he earns . p. 53 MRS .

FISHER He knows what he does !  --  His business takes him in there all the time . AMY And what does he say he does ? MRS . FISHER Why , he sez he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of amusementlike a hundred others down there . AMY That shows how much he knows about it . MRS . FISHER But I suppose he told you he owns the Pennsylvania Railroad . AMY Well , I 'd take his word before I 'd take Frank Hyland 's . Her Mother looks at her narrowly , and there is a pause MRS . FISHER significantly.Why would you take his word before you would take Frank Hyland 's ? AMY Well , why should n't I ? MRS . FISHER losing her temper.Because he 's a fool !  --  of a blatherskite. p. 54 AMY That 's only your opinion , Mom . MRS . FISHER It 's the opinion of everybody that ever listened to him . But you 'd believe him before you 'd believe the word of a steady sensible man . AMY I do n't know anything about Frank Hyland . MRS . FISHER You know he 's been your brother-in-law for five years ; and what do you know about this other clown ? AMY Well , what do you want to know about him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him ; I know all I want to know about him . But before I 'd get the name of havin ' a fellow comin ' to see me steady , there 's a few things I 'd want to know about him , I 'll tell you that . She turns away and takes a step towards the back of the room AMY I 've told you where he lives and where he works ,  --  what else do you want to know about him ? MRS . FISHER There 's no use talkin ' to you , Amy . AMY No , and there 's no use talking to you , either . MRS . FISHER turning to her sharply.This fellow 's got you so crazy mad about him , that I believe you 'd take him if you knew he had a wife and family somewhere , and not two cents in his pocket . She moves towards the mantel-piece at the back , removing her spectacles p. 55 AMY Well , I guess we 'd get along some way even if I did . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FISHER turning upon AMY in a rage , and wiping the glasses in her apron.That 's the kind of talk that leaves them livin ' in garrets ! And back at their jobs ten days after the weddin ' . AMY Oh , you talk as though everybody that was married was starving to death . MRS . FISHER lifting the glasses toward AMY with a quiet , knowing gesture.There are ways of starvin ' to death , Amy , besides not gettin ' enough to eat . With a change to great shrewdness of tone and mannerAnd the funny part of it is , Amy ,  --  like a lot of others , you 're very shrewd about money while you 're at home , as far as what you give your Mother and Father is concerned ; but the minute some clown , with a flower in his coat and patent-leather shoes , winks at you , you seem to forget there 's such a thing in the world as a ton of coal . Crossing suddenly above the table towards AMY in quite a surge of temperAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your people that has to come to the rescue . AMY furiously.I wish I 'd been here while she was talking ! I bet I 'd a told her a thing or two ! p. 56 MRS . FISHER Oh , you need n't try to turn it onto Clara ;  --  she was n't talkin ' at all . AMY stamping her foot.She must have been talking ! MRS . FISHER She simply asked me where you were !  --  and I told her you were gettin ' dressed  --  that this fellow was comin ' here to-night : so then she told me that Frank Hyland knew him , and where he worked , and what he got and all about him . She turns away and moves to the left . There is a slight pause AMY half crying.I 'd just take him for spite now . MRS . FISHER comes to a stop , and turns slowly  --  and looks at her MRS . FISHER Well , let me tell you , Amy  --  the day a girl that 's used to spendin ' money the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one she 's spitin ' is herself . She moves slowly to the mantelpiece at the back and puts her glasses down definitely , then turns and starts to remove her apronThere 'll be no more permanent waves after that  --  she rolls her apron upyou can make up your mind to that . She flings the rolled apron onto the sofa at the right of the mantelpiece , and commences to unfasten the old-fashioned brooch in the front of her house-dressNor fifty-five dollar beaded dresses , neither . p. 57 AMY in a crying temper.Well , I 'd never bother anybody around here if I needed anything , I 'll tell you that . MRS . FISHER Maybe you wo n't . AMY I wo n't ,  --  you need n't worry . MRS . FISHER with a bitter levelness.Time 'll tell that , Lady Jane ; I 've heard the likes of you before . She detaches the brooch and goes to the hall-door , glances out into the hallway , then turns and looks back at AMYPut out that light and go to bed , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for a second , fuming , over at the right ; then she swings suddenly to the middle of the room and stops , with her hands on her hips , irresolute . Then she comes forward and stands above the table , thinking . As she clasps her hands together she becomes conscious of the ring in her hand . She tiptoes to the hall-door , stands listening for a second , then looks up . Then she hurries back to the center-table , looks at the ring , slides it onto the third finger of her left hand and holds it so that the diamond will catch the light from the chandelier . But , the reflection is evidenctly unsatisfactory ; so , with a furtive glance toward the hall-door , she shifts her position to a point neurer the table-lamp and holds her hand so that the ring will reflect that light . The curtain commences to descend slowly ; and she stands , holding her hand at arm 's length , lost in the melting wonder of her engagement ring@@ SCENE .  --  Same as preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday afternoon . MRS . FISHER is sitting in the arm-chair below the buffet , over at the right , listening in on the radio . Suddenly the front-door closes with a bang , and she starts , and looks in the direction of the hall-door . AUBREY bounces into the room , very much done up , with the traditional carnation , as ususal , and comes forward , putting his hat down on the table . PIPER Hello , Mother  --  Amy here ? He steps to the mirror at the back and gives himself a critical touch here and there MRS . FISHER commencing to remove the listeners.Our Amy ? PIPER Yes , have you seen anything of her ? MRS . FISHER rising . No , I have n't seen anything of her . She places the listeners on the buffet , and signs off PIPER turning from the glass.Wonder where she is ? MRS . FISHER Is n't she home ? PIPER No , I just came by there . MRS . FISHER picking up her knittingbag from the buffet.She has n't been here today . p. 59 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out looking for a house today ; I suppose she has n't got back yet . He gives the chair at the left of the center-table a double tap with his cane as he crosses down to the window at the leftI wanted to take her out to the Automobile Show tonight ; I got the loan of Harry Albright 's car . MRS . FISHER moving to the chair at the right of the center-table.Did you say she was out lookin ' for a house ? PIPER moving back , towards her.Yes , we 've got to get out of that place we 're in . The LePage printing people have bought the whole block : they 're going to put up a new building there . MRS . FISHER standing with her hand on the back of the chair.How soon do you have to get out ? PIPER Soon as we can find a place , I suppose . I understand they want to begin tearing down there about the first of the year . MRS . FISHER I 'm afraid you wo n't find it so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry . She sits down PIPER I do n't want a place as reasonable as that , if I can get something better . He plants himself at the left of the table and looks away off , with a dreamy narrowing of his eyes , and balancing himself on his toesI want a home  --  something with a bit of ground around it  --  where I can do a bit of tennis in the evening  --  he makes a couple of leisurely passes at an imaginary tennisballif I feel like it . p. 60 MRS . FISHER beginning to knit on a green sweater.Well , if you do you 'll pay for it . PIPER That is exactly what I expect to do , Mother Fisher , not giving you a short answer ,  --  that is exactly what I expect to do . He gives the table a double tap with the caneBut , I want what I 'm paying for , I 'll tell you that . No more of the old first-of-the-month business for this bambino . He 's all washed up , and signed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back MRS . FISHER They 're not puttin ' up any more houses , from what I can hear . PIPER Be yourself , now , Mother Fisher , be yourself . MRS . FISHER Well , where are they ? PIPER You ought to go out along the Boulevard some Sunday ,  --  see what they 're doing out there . MRS . FISHER Well , there 's no danger of you goin ' out along the Boulevard , except for a walk . PIPER moving to the hall-door and glancing out into the hallway.Lot of people out that way , Mother . MRS . FISHER Well , if there is they 're payin ' more than you 're able to pay . p. 61 PIPER Man 's got to live some-where , Mother . He swings forward to the window down at the left , and stands whistling to the canary MRS . FISHER Well , if he 's wise , he 'll live where he 's able to pay for it ;  --  unless he wants to be breakin ' up half a dozen times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Makin ' a big show . Buyin ' ten thousand dollar houses , and puttin ' fifty dollars down on them . He turns to herBesides , you have n't got any furniture for a house , even if you got one  --  unless you want to be sittin ' on the floor . PIPER The matter of furniture nowadays , Little Mother , is a very inconsequential item , from what I can gather . MRS . FISHER You ought to price it sometime when you 're in the city , and see how unconsequent it is . PIPER settling himself for a golf shot , using his cane for a club.I 've investigated the matter very thoroughly , Mrs. Fisher , and I find that there are at least fifteen first-class establishments right here in this city that will furnish a man 's house from garret to garage , and give him the rest of his life to pay for it . He hits the imaginary golf-ball , and pretends to follow it straight out with his eyes p. 62 MRS . FISHER They 'd need to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate they 're goin ' now . PIPER Give the growing boy a chance , Mrs. Fisher , give the growing boy a chance . You know what Mr. L. D. Brophy of the American Can Company said in the September number of the American Magazine , do n't you ? MRS . FISHER No , I do n't . PIPER Well , I 'll tell you . MRS . FISHER shifts her knitting , giving him a wearied glanceHe said , " I would say , to that innumerable host of young men , standing on the threshold of life , uncertain , and , mayhap , dismayed  --  as they contemplate the stress of modern industrial competition , Rome was not built in a day. " Those were his very words , I would n't kid you , and I think the old boy 's got it right , if you ask me . He moves up to the hall-door again and glances out MRS . FISHER What are you goin ' out to the Automobile Show for ? PIPER turning and coming forward again.Repeat the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , what are you goin ' out to the Automobile Show for ? PIPER coming to a point above the center-table.Ha ! Married five months ago today , Mother ; got to celebrate the happy event . Besides , one never knows what a day will bring , in the way of an opportunity to satisfy a long-felt want . And since she knocks but once  --  he taps his cane on the table , causing MRS . FISHER to start slightlyat each man 's door , the kid here does n't want to miss his chance by any uncertainty as to just what choo-choo he prefers . MRS . FISHER turns with an annoyed expression to find him pointing at her with his fore-finger and thumb . He laughs at her annoyanceWell , got to run along now , Mother , and see if Amy 's back as the house yet . He picks up his hat from the table and starts for the hall-door p. 63 MRS . FISHER What 'll I 'll tell her it she comes here after you 're gone ? PIPER stopping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harry Albright 's car , and I want her to see that new Jordan Six that I was telling her about , cut at the Show . And that I 'll be at Childs ' at Fifteenth and Chestnut until eight o'clock . He looks at his Ingersoll MRS . FISHER Fifteenth and Chestnut ? PIPER That 's the said and done , Mother . He laughs boisterouslyThe old Caf Infant . He laughs againOlive oil , Mother . He goes out the hall-door , breaking into another laugh , and in a second the front-door closes with a bang , causing MRS . FISHER to start again , and look irritatedly toward the hall-door . Then she resumes her knitting . The parlor-door opens and AMY drifts in , and starts across towards the chair at the left of the table AMY Hello ! MRS . FISHER starts again MRS . FISHER Oh , you frightened me , Amy  --  walkin ' in that way like a ghost ! When did you come in ? AMY sitting down , with a wearied air.A couple of minutes ago  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , your man just left here , did n't you see him ? AMY No , I heard him when I came in  --  I went in the parlor . MRS . FISHER He 's lookin ' for you  --  He sez he wants you to go to some kind of an Automobile Show with him . AMY I know ; I do n't want to go ; I 'm too tired . MRS . FISHER What 's he doin ' about his supper ? AMY I told him this morning to get something in town ; I knew I would n't be home till late . MRS . FISHER resumes her knitting ; and there is a slight pause MRS . FISHER He sez you 've got to get out of that place you 're in . AMY Yes , they 're going to tear those houses down . That 's what I was doing today  --  looking around for someplace . MRS . FISHER Did you see anything ? AMY I saw a couple of places that were fair , but they want too much money . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , Amy , wherever you go . AMY Thirty-eight dollars a month  --  for a little two-story house  --  that did n't even have a front porch . p. 65 MRS . FISHER Well , you 're surely not lookin ' for a house , Amy , are you ? AMY Yes , if I can find one . MRS . FISHER And have you any idea what they 're askin ' for houses these days ? AMY Well , Aubrey sez he will not live in rooms any longer . MRS . FISHER What the devil does it matter what he sez ! He do n't know what he 's sayin ' half the time . anyway . It 's you that has to stretch the money , and it 'll only go so far ; and the money that he gets wo n't cover any forty-dollar rents , you can make up your mind to that right now , before you go any further . And that 's what you 'll be asked to pay , Amy , remember I 'm tellin ' you . AMY He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . FISHER What on , thirty-two dollars a week ? AMY He sez he can put it into a new building society that he heard about , over in Frankford . MRS . FISHER Would n't he have to pay the building society ? AMY Well , he would n't have to pay it all at once . MRS . FISHER There 'd be more onces than he 'd be able to meet . I thought you had a little sense , but you 're nearly as bad as him . p. 66 AMY No , but you talk awfully silly , Mother ; you 'd think everybody that was married was living out in the street . MRS . FISHER That 's where a good many of them would be livin ' , Amy , only that somebody belongin ' to them is givin ' them a hand . Money 'll only go so far , and I 've been keepin ' house too long not to know just how far that far is . Nobody can tell me . AMY There was a girl down in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fellow she married did n't even get as much money as Aubrey gets ; he got about twenty-five a week  --  he was a guard in the Corn Exchange Bank ; and they bought a house , out in Kensington , and they say it 's beautiful . MRS . FISHER She 's back at her job , though , is n't she ? AMY with reluctant admission.She never left her job . MRS . FISHER Well ,  --  that 's how she 's doin ' it . You told me yourself there were five girls in your office that have married within the last two years . Do you think they 're hanging over books nine hours a day because they like it ? And you have n't got any furniture even if you got a house . AMY Oh , you can always get furniture . MRS . FISHER You can if you pay for it . And I do n't know how you expect to do all these wonders later on , when you find it so hard to make ends meet now , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're everlastin ' borrowin ' from me as it is. p. 67 AMY I always pay you , do n't I ? MRS . FISHER You do when you get it . But , that 's not the point , Amy ; it 's that what you get one week do n't last you till the next . AMY The reason I was short last week , Aubrey bought that new overcoat . MRS . FISHER And next week it 'll be something else . AMY Well , a man ca n't be shabby , Mom , in a position like Aubrey 's . He sez he 's got nearly eighty clerks down there in his department ; and he sez unless he sets some kind of an example of personal appearance , he sez there are some of them down there that 'd come in in overalls . MRS . FISHER laying her knitting on the table and looking keenly at AMY.How is it , Amy , that a girl like you  --  that was smart enough to keep books , has so little sense when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother steadily AMY Who do you mean , Aubrey ? MRS . FISHER Yes . AMY Why , what does he tell me that I have so little sense about ? MRS . FISHER That he has eighty clerks under him . AMY So he has . p. 68 MRS . FISHER And gets thirty-two dollars a week ? AMY He gets thirty-two fifty . MRS . FISHER resumes her knitting , shaking her head hopelesslyWell now , Mom , you know yourself what the Pennsylvania Railroad pays its men . MRS . FISHER I do n't know what anybody pays anybody . AMY Well , the Pennsylvania Railroad is notoricus . Aubrey sez that only that a couple of things have n't panned out just right with him , he 'd have left them long ago . He sez they just try to break your spirit . He sez that 's one of the main reasons why he pays so much attontion to his clothes .  --  He sez he just would n't please them . MRS . FISHER How much did he pay for that overcoat ? AMY Twenty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't have to pay it all at once ; the man said on account of it being so near Christmas he could let it go till the first of February . MRS . FISHER I guess he 'll be wantin ' a suit , now , the first you know , to go with the overcoat . AMY No , his suit 's all right ,  --  yet a while . But this suit of mine is beginning to go ; I 've worn it till I 'm tired looking at it . p. 69 MRS . FISHER People ca n't get things so handy once they 're married . AMY I thought I 'd be able to put something away out of this week , toward a suit ; but I do n't know where the money went to :  --  it just seemed to go . Honestly , I had exactly twelve cents in my purse when Aubrey gave me his pay . MRS . FISHER I do n't know what 'll become of you , Amy , if ever you have a houseful of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather troubled expression about the eyes , and her Mother continues to knit . Suddenly AMY bursts into tears . MRS . FISHER looks at her : then she gets up quietly , laying her knitting on the table , and crosses in front of the table to her  --  and lays her hand on her armNow , there 's no use a startin ' that kind a thing , now , Amy ; for it wo n't do you a bit of good . She continues across AMY I do n't know what I 'm going to do , Mom  --  I 'm nearly crazy . MRS . FISHER turning.I 'll tell you what you 're goin ' to do , Amy , if you 're a wise woman  --  You 're goin ' to realize that you 're married ; and that you 've got some kind of a house to keep up ; and just how much money you 're goin ' to get each week to keep it up on ; and then suit your ideas accordin ' . And if you do n't , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have nobody to thank but yourself , for you had nothing but impudence for them that tried to tell you  --  how many beans made five . The front-door is heard to closeI guess this is your Father . Go into the parlor there , and do n't let him see you cryin ' AMY rises and steps quickly across and thru the parlor-doors at the left into the parlor ; and MRS . FISHER crosses above the center-table to the buffet and puts her knitting into one of the drawers . CLARA appears in the hall-door p. 70 CLARA What 's the matter ? MRS . FISHER turns and looks at her MRS . FISHER There 's nothing at all the matter . CLARA What did Joe telephone me for ? MRS . FISHER Our Joe , do you mean ? CLARA Yes ; Bertha said he telephoned the house about four o'clock and told her to tell me to come right over home as soon as I came in . MRS . FISHER Well , I 'm sure I do n't know what he 'd want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me for you this morning . CLARA coming forward towards the center-table.I was over paying my Electric , and just got back ; so I came right over ; I thought maybe something was wrong here , and he was calling from next door . MRS . FISHER No , he has n't been home here today . CLARA puzzles for a second , then tosses her purse onto the table CLARA I wonder what he wanted me for . She turns to the mirror at the back and touches her hat MRS . FISHER Is that girl at your house sure it was our Joe ? CLARA coming back to the table.She said it was ; and I suppose she knows his voice ,  --  she 's often answered the ' phone when he 's called . She picks up a book from the table and glances casually at it p. 71 MRS . FISHER Well , maybe he wants to see you about something ; I 'd wait a while ; he 'll be here at six . CLARA looking suddenly at her Mother.Maybe he 's heard some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . FISHER coming over to the table . Oh , I guess he 'll be an old man before he ever hears anything from that . She folds and settles various things on the table , and CLARA glances through the book . Then , as she moves over to settle the upper left-hand corner of the table-cover , she gives CLARA a little pushLook out of my way , Clara , till I fix this cloth . CLARA just moves without looking up from the bookThat 's a book Joe brought home last night : about that woman that was left up on the North Pole . He sez it 's very nice . I 've got to put those potatoes on , for your Father 's supper ; he 'll be here around six . She moves to the door at the right CLARA standing at the left of the table , still looking at the book.Did you know that Amy 's got to get out of those rooms she 's in ? MRS . FISHER from the kitchen.Yes . CLARA They 're going to tear those houses down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room.So she was telling me . CLARA moving to the chair at the left of the table. What 's she going to do , tossing the book on to the tablecome in here to live ? She sits down MRS . FISHER Now , that 's a sensible question for you to ask , Clara ;  --  you know how much she 's comin ' in here to live . CLARA commencing to remove her gloves.I do n't know where else she 'll go ,  --  with rents the way they are now ;  --  unless she goes back to work . MRS . FISHER She 'll have to look around . CLARA What good will it do her to look around  --  she cetainly wo n't find anything as reasonable as where she is now : and when she 's not able to pay that , how does she expect to pay any more ? The parlor-door is whipped open and AMY is standing between the curtains looking tight-lipped at CLARA AMY How do you know I 'm not able to pay my rent where I am ? MRS . FISHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amy , your Pop 'll be here any minute . She looks out into the hallway p. 73 AMY speaking to her Mother , and idicating CLARA with a gesture.No , but I 'd like to know what business it is of hers whether I can pay my rent or not . I do n't see that anybody 's asking her to pay it for me . CLARA very sure of her ground.It 's a bit late in the day to talk that way , Amy ; your husband 's been to Frank Hyland twice already to pay it for you . AMY looks at her aghast , and MRS . FISHER comes forward between themIt 's time you quit this posing in front of me ; I know how you 're fixed better than you do yourself . She turns sharply away and flings her gloves onto the table AMY almost crying.Now , do you hear that , Mom ! MRS . FISHER Stop your talk , Amy ! Do you want your Father to walk in and hear you ? AMY lowering her voice , but still speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Hyland twice , for the loan of our rent . CLARA So he has . AMY You 're a liar ! MRS . FISHER gives her a slap on the back ; and there is a vibrant pause . Then AMY moves down towards the window at the left and bursts out crying p. 74 MRS . FISHER with controlled excitement.Will you stop when I speak to you ! There is a pauseWhat kind of talk do you call that ! She steps to the hall-door again and glances out into the hallway AMY whirling again upon CLARA.Well , that 's what she is ! Aubrey Piper never asked Frank Hyland for a cent in his life . CLARA He 's asked him a dozen times , and got it , too ; till I put a stop to it . MRS . FISHER coming forward again , and speaking with authority.Now , that 'll do , Clara !  --  I do n't want to hear another word  --  out of either one of you  --  I had enough of that when the two of you were at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sez about Aubrey Piper , just the same ! CLARA It 's very easily proved . Just come over to the house some night and I 'll show you a few of his letters . AMY What do you do , open them ? CLARA I do now , yes ,  --  since I found out who they 're from . MRS . FISHER keenly.Do you mean to tell me , Clara , that he 's writin ' to Frank Hyland for money ? p. 75 AMY No , he does n't do anything of the kind , Mom , that 's another of her lies ! MRS . FISHER before AMY has finished speaking.I 'm not talkin ' to you , Amy . AMY She just makes those things up . CLARA I make them up ! AMY crying.Yes ! CLARA And I 've got at least twelve letters right in my bureau-drawer this minute that he 's written within the last two months . MRS . FISHER What does he write letters for ? CLARA For money  --  so he can pay seven dollars for a seat out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Frank saw him there . MRS . FISHER Why do n't he just ast Frank Hyland for the money when he sees him , instead of writin ' to him ? CLARA I suppose he thinks a written request is more appropriate , coming from one of the heads of the Pennsylvania Railroad . MRS . FISHER How much does he ast for , when he asts him ? CLARA There was one a couple of weeks ago , for three hundred . AMY makes a sound of bitter amusement , and turns away p. 76 MRS . FISHER aghast.Three hundred dollars ? CLARA That 's what the letter said . MRS . FISHER . turns and looks at AMY MRS . FISHER What would he have wanted three hundred dollars for , Amy ? AMY Oh , ask her , Mom ; she 's good at making things up . She sweeps towards the parlor-doors MRS . FISHER taking a step or two after her. Oh , you would n't believe it , even if it was true , if it was against him . AMY Well , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bang MRS . FISHER raising her voice. You would n't believe your own Mother ,  --  never name your sister . She turns to CLARAShe flew at me like a wild-cat , when I told her he wore a wig . I guess she knows it herself by this time . CLARA She 's for him , Mom ; and the sooner you get that into your head the better . MRS . FISHER moving towards the right , above the table. I know very well she is , you need n't tell me . And she 'd turn on everyone belongin ' to her for him . The idea of askin ' anybody for three hundred dollars . She continues towards the kitchen-door , fuming ; then turnsI suppose he wanted to buy an automobile or something . That 's where he is tonight , out at the Automobile Show  --  and not two cents in his pocket  --  like a lot of others that 'll be out there I guess  --  And I 'll bet he 'll be doin ' more talk out there than them that 'll buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what he did want the money for . MRS . FISHER . It would n't surprise me ,  --  the damned fool . She steps to the mantelpiece and glances out into the hallwayIt 'd be fitter for him to be thinkin ' about gettin ' a house to live in . CLARA He does n't think he needs to think about that ; he thinks he 's coming in here . MRS . FISHER turning sharply , on her way back to the kitchen-door.Comin in here to live , do you mean ? CLARA That 's what he told Frank , the day before yesterday . MRS . FISHER Well , he 's very much mistaken if he does , I can tell you that . I 'd like to be listenin ' to that fellow seven days in the week . I 'd rather go over and live with your Aunt Ellie in Newark . CLARA rising , and picking up her gloves from the table. Well , that 's about what you 'll have to do , Mom , if you ever let them in on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FISHER I wo n't let them in on me , do n't fret . Your Father ' ud something to say about that . CLARA slipping off her neck-piece.Pop may not always be here , Mom . She turns around to her left and moves to a point above the table , and puts her fur and gloves down p. 78 MRS . FISHER Well , I 'll be here , if he is n't ; and the furniture is mine . And there 's very little danger of my walkin ' off and leavin ' it to any son-in law . The front-door closesI guess this is your Pop now , and I have n't even got the kettle on . She hurries out at the right . CLARA glances at the hall-door , and JOE appears in it , and stands for the fraction of a second , irresolute JOE Where 's Mom ? CLARA Out in the kitchen ,  --  why ? JOE motioning to her , causing the paper to drop from his hand.Come here ,  --  do n't let her hear you . CLARA steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and mannerListen , Clara  --  Pop had some kind of a stroke this afternoon at his work . CLARA Pop did ? JOE They found him layin ' in front of one of the boilers . CLARA Oh , my God ! JOE I tried to get you on the ' phone about four o'clock . CLARA I know  --  I came right over as soon as I came in . JOE You better tell Mom . He starts for the stairs , and CLARA turns towards the kitchen-door p. 79 CLARA turning sharply back again.Joe ! JOE stopping abruptly on the first step of the stairs.What ? CLARA Where 's Pop now ? JOE They took him to the Samaritan Hospital . I just came from there  --  they telephoned me to the office . CLARA Well , is he very bad ? JOE I think he 's done . CLARA Oh , do n't say that , Joe ! JOE That 's what the Doctor at the Hospital sez.  --  He has n't regained consciousness since three o'clock . So you 'd better tell Mom to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to change my clothes ; I went right up there from work . He starts up the stairs ; and CLARA moves vaguely towards the kitchendoor . She stops and stands looking toward the kitchen in a controlled panic of indecision . Then , abruptly she whirls round and steps quickly back to the halldoor CLARA in a subdued voice.Joe ! JOE What ? CLARA That Samaritan Hospital 's at Broad and Ontario , is n't it ? p. 80 JOE Yes . She turns slowly and looks out , irresolute . Then she stoops down abstractedly and picks up the newspaper that JOE dropped . The parlor-door opens sharply and AMY stands looking at her apprehensively . Their eyes meet AMY What is it ? MRS . FISHER appears in the door at the right , drying an agate-ware plate MRS . FISHER Was n't that your Pop that came in , Clara ? CLARA makes a deft , silencing gesture with her left hand to AMY , and moves towards the center-table CLARA No , it was n't , Mom , it was the boy with the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the clock.I wonder what 's keepin ' him ; he 's late to-night . CLARA leans against the center-table , keeping her face averted from her MotherHe 's nearly always here before this . She moves back again towards the kitchen AMY crossing quickly down to CLARA 'S left.What is it , Clara ? MRS . FISHER turning and looking at CLARA.What 's the matter with her ? CLARA tries to control her feelings p. 81 AMY I do n't know what 's the matter with her , Mom ! Something Joe just told her  --  he 's just gone upstairs . MRS . FISHER coming forward apprehensively at CLARA 'S right.What is it , Clara ,  --  somethin ' about your Father ? Is that what you 're cryin ' for ? AMY Why do n't you tell her , Clara ? MRS . FISHER Go to the foot of the stairs , Amy , and call Joe . AMY steps towards the foot of the stairsSomething 's happened to your Father , I know it . CLARA moving a step or two towards her Mother.Now , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a little spell of some kind at his work this afternoon , and they had to take him to the hospital . AMY comes forward eagerly , and crosses to a point below the tableJoe just came from there , and he sez we 'd better get our things on right away and go down there . MRS . FISHER sways a step forward , letting the agate-ware plate slide from her hands to the floor . AMY steps towards her Mother , lifting the chair from the right of the table and guiding her Mother into itHere , sit down here , Mom . MRS . FISHER slightly dazed.What is it she 's sayin ' happened to your Father , Amy ? AMY passes back of the chair to her Mother 's right , and CLARA comes to her left p. 82 CLARA Now , it 's nothing to get excited about , Mom ; it might be just a little heart-attack or something that he took . She takes the towel from her Mother 's hand and hands it to AMYPut this over there . AMY turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with your Father 's heart , Clara . CLARA Well , it 's pretty hot in there where he works , you know that . MRS . FISHER shakes her head up and down , knowinglyAnd men at Pop 's age are always taking little spells of some kind . MRS . FISHER with a long , heavy sigh.Ah , I guess it 's a stroke , Clara . CLARA It might not be , Mom , you ca n't tell . MRS . FISHER That 's how his two brothers went , you know . CLARA Amy , you 'd better go to the telephone next door and tell Frank Hyland I wo n't be home . AMY hurries across towards the hall-door , and CLARA follows her , continuing her instructionsIf he is n't home yet , tell Bertha to tell him to come right down to the Samaritan Hospital as soon as he comes . And tell Johnny Harbison to go to the corner for a taxi . The front-door closes after AMY , and CLARA steps back to her Mother 's side p. 83 MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Samaritan Hospital ? CLARA Yes ; it 's right down there near where he works , at Broad and Ontario . MRS . FISHER starting to cry.Your poor Father  --  I wonder what happened to him . CLARA reflects her Mother 's sentiment CLARA picking up the plate.Now , there 's no use looking on the dark side of it already , Mom . MRS . FISHER No , but me gettin ' his supper out there , and him not comin ' home to it at all . And maybe never comin ' home to it again , Clara , for all we know . CLARA He 'll be home again , Mom  --  Pop is a strong man . She puts the plate on the buffet MRS . FISHER suddenly. I guess he 's dead , now , and you 're not tellin ' me . CLARA coming to her Mother 's left.He is n't dead , Mom ; I 'd have told you if he was . MRS . FISHER What did Joe say ? CLARA Just what I told you ; that he 'd had a spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why did n't he tell me ! What 's he doin ' upstairs , anyway ? CLARA He 's changing his clothes ; he 's got to go right back down there again . MRS . FISHER He 's cryin ' I guess . You know , it 'll kill our poor Joe , Clara , if anything happens to your Father . CLARA He sez we 'd better go right down there , too , Mom ; so you 'd better go upstairs and fix yourself up a bit . Give me your apron . MRS . FISHER rising and commencing to remove her apron.I do n't know whether I 'll be able to dress myself now or not ; my hands are like lead . CLARA You do n't need to get all dressed up , Mom  --  just put on your black-silk waist ; that skirt 's good enough . She goes towards the door at the right with the apron and goes out MRS . FISHER taking the comb from the back of her head and commencing to comb her hair.Well , I 'm not goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARA coming quickly in again.Nobody 'll see you in the dark . She picks up the plate and towel from the buffet and straighters the runner p. 85 MRS . FISHER moving aimlessly about in front of the mantelpiece.It wo n't be dark in the hospital ; unless somethin ' happens to the lights . CLARA goes out againPut that gas out under them potatoes , Clara , I just lit it . And you 'd better pick up this room a bit while I 'm upstairs , you do n't know who might be comin ' here if they hear about your Father . She stops and looks helplessly about the roomOh , dear , Oh , dear , Oh , dear ! I do n't know what I 'm doin ' . CLARA comes in againTake all them papers off that table , Clara , and put them in the kitchen . CLARA crossing to the table and folding and gathering up the various papers.You 'd better bring your umbrella down with you , Mom , when you go up ,  --  it looked like rain when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Amy take my rubbers the last day she was here , and she never brings anything back . CLARA taking the papers out into the kitchen.You wo n't need rubbers . MRS . FISHER Oh , I get all my feet wet , when I do n't have rubbers . She is facing the hall-door , fastening the oldfashioned brooch at her throat . AUBREY frames himself in the door , with a bandage around his head , and looking a bit batteredMy God , what happened to you , now ! p. 86 PIPER coming forward at the left , removing his hat.It 's beginning to rain . He places his hat and cane on the table , and stands in front of the table removing his gloves MRS . FISHER following him with her eyes.Never mind the rain , the rain did n't do that to you . She comes forward at his left . CLARA comes in and stands over near the door at the right , looking at him I guess you ran into somebody , did n't you ? PIPER with a shade of nonchalance.Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the traffic-officer . MRS . FISHER You do n't mean to tell me that you ran into a traffic-officer ! CLARA comes forward at the right PIPER Control , now , Little Mother , I assure there is no occasion for undue solicitation . He turns and sees CLARAGood evening , Mrs. Hyland . CLARA Hello ! What happened to your head ? MRS . FISHER You look like a bandit . PIPER The veriest trifle , Mrs. Hyland  --  just a little spray from the wind-shield. p. 87 MRS . FISHER Where 's the car you borrowed ? Smashed , I guess , ai n't it ? PIPER The car I borrowed Mother Fisher , is now in the hands of the bandits of the law . The judicial gentlemen , who have entered into a conspiracy with the regulators of traffic  --  to collect fines from motorists  --  by ordering them to go one way  --  and then swearing that they told them to go another . MRS . FISHER Never mind your fancy talk , we 've heard too much of that already ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you did run into ; for I know you ran into somethin ' . And where 's the automobile that someone was fool enough to lend you ? PIPER The automobile , Little Mother , is perfectly safe  --  parked and pasturing  --  in the courtyard of the Twenty-second and Hunting Park Avenue Police Station . MRS . FISHER Did you get arrested , too ? PIPER I accompanied the officer as far as the station-house , yes ; and I told them a few things while I was there , too , about the condition of traffic in this city . MRS . FISHER I guess they told you a few things , too , did n't they ? PIPER Beg pardon ? MRS . FISHER starting abruptly for the hall-door.Never mind ; you 're welcome . p. 88 CLARA You 'd better change your shoes , Mom ; you ca n't go down there with those . MRS . FISHER pointing toward the cellar-door.See if my long black coat 's in the cellar-way there . CLARA goes quickly to the cellar-door , opens it , and looks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what I 'm doin ' . She goes out the hall-door and to her left , up the stairs . AUBREY moves over to the chair at the right , where MRS . FISHER collapsed , and sits down ,  --  quite ruffled in his dignity . CLARA closes the cellardoor and , with a glance toward the halldoor , comes quickly forward at AUBREY 'S left CLARA What did they do , fine you , Aubrey ? PIPER They were all set to fine me ; but when I got through with them they did n't have a leg to stand on . Sc they tried to cover themselves up as gracefully as possible , by trumping up a charge against me of driving an automobile without a license . CLARA What did they do , take the automobile away from you ? PIPER Nothing of the sort ; they simply complied with the usual procedure in a case of this kind  --  which is to release the defendent on bond , pending the extent of the victim 's injuries . p. 89 CLARA Was there somebody injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLARA For God 's sake , could n't you find anybody but the traffic-cop to run into ! PIPER I did not run into him , Mrs. Hyland  --  you do n't understand the circumstances of the case . CLARA Well , I understand this much about them  --  that they can give you ten years for a thing like that . And it 'd just serve you right if they did , too . Borrowin ' people 's automobiles , and knowing no more about running them than I do . She turns away to her right and moves across above the table towards the hall-door PIPER No time like the present to learn , Mrs. Hyland . CLARA turning to him sharply.Well , you 'll very likely have plenty of time , from now on ,  --  if that officer is seriously injured . She continues over and down to the window at the left , where she draws the drape aside and looks anxiously down the street for the taxi PIPER He was faking a broken arm around there when I left  --  But it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dotted line ; for he ran head on right into me. p. 90 CLARA crossing back towards him , in front of the Morris-chair.Was he in a car , too ? PIPER No , he was jay-walking  --  trying to beat me to the crossing , after giving me the right of way . CLARA Where did this thing happen ? PIPER Broad and Erie Avenue , I would n't kid you . CLARA Did they take the cop to the hospital ? PIPER Yes , we took him over there in the car . CLARA Did they let you run it ? PIPER Repeat the question , Mrs. Hyland . CLARA You heard me ,  --  I do n't need to repeat it . And take that silly-looking bandage off your head , before Amy sees you ; and do n't frighten the life out of her . She steps up to the hall-door and glances outShe 's got enough to worry her now without looking at you . AUBREY rises , and , detaching the hand-kerchief from around his head , moves across to a point above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door , telephoning , yes ; and she 'll be back in a minute . Coming forward a step or two at the leftPop just had a stroke of some kind at his work this afternoon , Joe just told us. p. 91 PIPER What are you doing , kidding me ? CLARA starting to cry.No , of course I 'm not kidding you ! What would I be kidding you about a thing like that for ? She crosses down and across in front of the center-table . The front-door closes PIPER Where is he now ? CLARA They took him to the Samaritan Hospital ; we 're just going down there . AMY appears in the hall-door , and stands looking questioningly at AUBREY AMY What 's the matter , Aubrey ? He turns and looks at her PIPER extending his arm and hand in a magnificent gesture.Well ! AMY comes forward to her husbandThe old kid herself ! AMY What is it , Aubrey ? PIPER taking her in his arms.Nothing in the world but this , Baby . He kisses her affectionately CLARA Did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISHER can be heard hurrying down the stairs AMY crossing above AUBREY and speaking directly to CLARA.He was n't home yet ; I told the girl to tell him as soon as he came in. p. 92 MRS . FISHER coming through the hall-door , and tossing her little knit-jacket onto the small stand at the left of the mantelpiece.Clara , is that automobilecab here yet ? CLARA It 'll be here in a minute , Mom . MRS . FISHER What do you think of this fellow , Amy ,  --  runnin ' wild through the city breakin ' policemen 's bones ! We did n't have enough trouble without that  --  with your poor Father layin dead for all we know ,  --  down in the Jewish hospital . She starts to cry and steps down to the window at the left to look out for the taxicabIt 's enough to make a body light-headed . CLARA Where 's your coat , Mom ? MRS . FISHER turning to her.Is n't it there in the cellar-way ? CLARA No , I just looked . MRS . FISHER going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at AUBREY 'S right. I thought you were out at the Automobile Show , Aubrey . MRS . FISHER at the foot of the stairs.Listen , Joe  --  p. 93 PIPER I had a little mix-up at Broad and Erie Avenue . AMY You did n't get hurt , did you ? MRS . FISHER and AUBREY , speaking together MRS . FISHER Throw down my long black coat ; you 'll find it on a hook there in the hall-closet . She starts for the buffet PIPER Nothing but a scratch or two , here on my forehead , from the glass in the wind-shield . Just a little shake-up . MRS . FISHER stopping and turning sharply at the right of the center-table.He nearly killed a traffic-officer !  --  That 's how much of a little shake-up it was . She continues to the buffet , where CLARA is standingGet out of my way , Clara , till I get a clean handker-chief out of here . She pushes CLARA out of her way and opens the left-hand drawer of the buffet and rummages for a handker-chief . CLARA passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left AMY You did n't , Aubrey , did you ! PIPER Certainly not , Amy  --  your Mother 's raving . MRS . FISHER finds the handkerchief , slams the drawer shut and turns p. 94 MRS . FISHER The man 's in the hospital !  --  I do n't know what more you want . The big black coat lands at the foot of the stairs with a thud , causing MRS . FISHER to start nervously ; then she hurries across at the back towards the hall-door , tucking the folded handkerchief at her waist AMY Is he , Aubrey ? PIPER Do you think I 'd be here , Kid , if he was ? MRS . FISHER on the way over.You would n't be here , only that someone was fool enough to bail you out ; instead of lettin ' you stay in where you could n't be killin ' people . CLARA has stepped up to the foot of the staire and picked the coat up immediately it fell , and now stands holding it for her Mother to put on ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the stairs and calling shrilly up to JOEJoe , why do n't you tell a body when you 're goin ' to throw a thing down that way , and not be frightenin ' the life out of people ! She comes back into the room again and CLARA assists her . AMY stands above the center-table looking wide-eyed at AUBREY , who sways forward at the left , and , crossing below the center-table to the chair at the right , where he has been previously seated , sits down p. 95 CLARA Are n't you going to put on another waist , Mom ? MRS . FISHER No , this one is good enough  --  I 'll keep the coat buttoned up . Put that collar inside . AMY in a lowered tone.Are you out on bail , Aubrey ? PIPER They always bail a man in a case like this , Amy ; they 've got my car on their hands . MRS . FISHER buttoning the coat , and moving to the mirror over the mantelpiece.Get my hat , will you , Clara ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . FISHER No , it 's in the parlor there , inside the top of the Victrola . CLARA comes back and goes into the parlor AMY Why did n't you bring the car back with you , Aubrey ?  --  That fellow might want it tomorrow . PIPER I 'll have it for him all right ; I 've got to call around there for it Monday morning at ten o'clock . MRS . FISHER turns sharply from her primping at the mirror MRS . FISHER I guess you 've got to go down there to a hearing Monday morning at ten o'clock ,  --  AMY turns and looks at her Motherand pay your fine ! Speaking directly to AMYI guess that 's the automobile he 's got to call for . CLARA hurries out of the parlor brushing the dust off an old black hat , with a bunch of cherries on it p. 96 CLARA I 'd better go out and get a whisk-broom and dust this , Mom . MRS . FISHER turning to her nervously.No , never mind , it 's good enough , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right.Your coat needs dusting . She takes a whisk-broom from a hook just inside the kitchen-door AMY How much did they fine you , Aubrey ? PIPER They did n't fine me at all . MRS . FISHER settling her hat.They 'll do that Monday . PIPER Time 'll tell that , Mother Fisher . CLARA hurries back and starts brushing her Mother 's coat MRS . FISHER And you 'll pay it , too , or go to jail ; and it'ud just be the price of you . PIPER They did n't seem very anxious to do any fining today , after I got through telling it to them . MRS . FISHER Am I all right , Clara ? PIPER I took a slam at the Pennsylvania Railroad , too , while I was at it . MRS . FISHER You 're always takin ' slams at somethin ' ; that 's what 's leavin ' you under bail right now . Are you ready , Clara ? She hurries to the foot of the stairs p. 97 CLARA hurrying back to the kitchen with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Mother Fisher . MRS . FISHER calling up the stairs.Are you goin ' down there with us , Joe ? JOE from upstairs.Comin ' right down . MRS . FISHER comes in to the mantelpiece and picks up her gloves . CLARA hurries in from the kitchen again to the center-table and picks up her neckpiece and gloves PIPER Only do n't be surprised if you hear of a very quiet little shake-up very soon  --  in the Department of Public Safety . MRS . FISHER Are you warm enough with that coat , Clara ? CLARA Yes , I 'm all right . How about the umbrella ? MRS . FISHER I think it 's out there in the hall-rack ; look and see . CLARA hurries out into the hallway , and MRS . FISHER stands putting on her gloves . AMY crosses to AUBREY 'S left AMY very quietlyHow much bail did they put you under , Aubrey ? PIPER One thousand berries , Amy . MRS . FISHER looks over at them keenly p. 98 AMY A thousand dollars ! PIPER That 's regulation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MRS . FISHER moves forward at the left to a point where she can see AUBREYA little chicken-feed for the stool-pigeons . MRS . FISHER Did he say they put him under a thousand dollars ' bail ? PIPER That 's what I said , Mrs. Fisher , one thousand trifles  --  I would n't kid you . MRS . FISHER You would n't kid anybody that 'd listen to you for five minutes . And who did you get to go a thousand dollars bail for you ? PIPER Do n't be alarmed , Little Mother ,  --  I saw that the affair was kept strictly within the family . MRS . FISHER Who do you mean ? PIPER Your other son-in-law  --  was kind enough to come forward . CLARA hurries in from the hallway with the umbrella , and comes forward at the extreme left MRS . FISHER Clara 's husband ! PIPER That 's the gentleman , Mrs. Fisher ,  --  Mr. Francis X. Hyland . MRS . FISHER helplessly.My God ! She turns around to her right till she locates CLARADo you hear that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got Frank Hyland to go his bail for a thousand dollars . CLARA looking bitterly at AUBREY.What did you do , write him another letter ? PIPER That was not necessary , Mrs. Hyland , not giving you a short answer . Your husband was fortunate enough to see the whole affair from the trolley-car . He was just returning from his business , and happened to be on the trolley-car that ran into me . MRS . FISHER How many more things ran into you ,  --  besides traffic cops and trolley-cars ! I suppose a couple of the buildin 's ran into you too , did n't they ? JOE hurries in from the hall-door buttoning his overcoat JOE Are you ready , Mom ? CLARA going up to the hall-door.Yes , we 're ready . JOE comes forward at the extreme left , looking questioningly from one to the other . CLARA goes out into the hall PIPER You 'll find out all about that Monday morning , Mrs. Fisher . MRS . FISHER moving up towards the hall-door.Well , see that nothin ' else runs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter ? MRS . FISHER We do n't want Frank Hyland losin ' any thousand-dollar bills on account of you . JOE What 's happened , Mom ? MRS . FISHER turning to JOE , and pointing at AUBREY with a wide gesture.Why , this crazy Jack here 's been runnin ' into everything in the city but ourselves ; and he got himself arrested ; and Frank Hyland had to bail him out for a thousand dollars . She starts to cry JOE What were you doin ' , Aubrey , joy-ridin ' ? MRS . FISHER No !  --  he was trolley-ridin ' ,  --  and traffic-cop-ridin ' ,  --  and every other kind of ridin ' ,  --  in an automobile that he borrowed . CLARA hurrying in from the hallway.I think I see that taxi coming , Mom . MRS . FISHER starting towards the hall-door.Come on here , Joe . JOE crosses up at the left of the center-table to the mirror over the mantelpiece , looking disapprovingly at AUBREY . AUBREY rises and strolls over to a point in front of the center-tableHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARA Right down Erie Ave . PIPER Too bad I left that car down there at the Station House , I could have run you down there . They all turn and look at him ; and MRS . FISHER . with poison in her right eye , moves forward at the left of the center-table , with a level , ominous slowness MRS . FISHER You would n't run me down there ,  --  do n't fret  --  not if you had a thousand cars . There 's enough of us in the hospital as it is . AUBREY simply regards her from a great heightAnd do n't you come down there neither ;  --  for you 'd only start talkin ' , and that 'd finish Pop quicker than a stroke . There 's a startling hoot from the taxicab horn outside , which almost throws MRS . FISHER from her balance CLARA going out.Come on , Joe . JOE following her out.Ai n't you comin ' down to the hospital , Amy ? MRS . FISHER going out.No , you 'd better stay here , Amy ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that fellow 'll be runnin ' into somethin ' else . You ought to have somethin ' heavier on you than that fur , Clara . AUBREY sits down at the left of the center-table p. 102 CLARA in the hallway.I 'm all right , we 'll be down there in a few minutes . MRS . FISHER Have you got your coat buttoned up good , Joe ? The front-door closes after them . AMY turns from the hall-door , where she has been standing , seeing them out , and comes forward to the back of the chair at the left of the center-table , where AUBREY is sitting AMY Where 's your toup , Aubrey ? Touching the sticking-plasters on his forehead PIPER In my pocket here . AMY stroking his hair.Is your head hurting you ? PIPER reaching for her hand and drawing it down over his left shoulder.Not a bit , Honey  --  just a couple of little scratches . He kisses her hand . She raises her eyes and looks straight ahead , with a troubled expression AMY Aubrey , what do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , do n't you worry about that , Sweetheart ; I 'll be right there if they try to pull anything . She moves over thoughtfully towards the upper right-hand corner of the center-table . Then a new thought occurs to her , and she turns her head and looks at him narrowly p. 103 AMY You had n't had anything to drink , had you , Aubrey ? PIPER looking at her quickly.Who , me ? AMY I mean I thought somebody might have treated you or something . PIPER making a statement.I had a glass of Champagne six months ago with a friend of mine in his suite at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel , and I have n't had a drink of anything since . AMY You better take off your overcoat , Aubrey ; we 'll have to stay here till they get back . He gets up and commences to remove the overcoat PIPER Yes , I guess we will .  --  I wonder how your Father is . AMY taking the overcoat from him.Pretty bad I guess ,  --  or they would n't have sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right of the mantelpiece , and AUBREY takes a huge cigar from his vest-pocket and feels for a matchI 'll get you a match , Aubrey . She goes out into the kitchen , and AUBREY moves to a point above the center-table , biting the tip of his cigar PIPER I thought I had some here , but I guess I have n't . Did they send for Joe ? p. 104 AMY Yes , they telephoned for him , to the place where he works . PIPER Your Mother said it was a stroke . AMY entering with some matches.I guess that 's what it is , too ; his two brothers died that way . PIPER taking the matches from her . I 'm sorry to heart that , Amy . But , you must n't worry , now , Kid . AMY It is n't only that I 'm worried about , Aubrey ;  --  I 'm thinking about you  --  Monday . She takes hold of the lapels of his coat and almost cries PIPER putting his arm around her.Now , listen to me , Baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , if there was anything to worry about . AMY But , they 're getting awfully strict in this city ; there 's been so many automobile accidents lately . PIPER They 're only strict , Honey , when a man 's driving under the influence of liquor . There 's a slight pause , and AMY thinks hard AMY What if that traffic-cop is hurt bad , Aubrey ? PIPER It 'd only be a fine for reckless driving , even if they could prove it was reckless driving ; and I can prove it was the copper 's fault . Detaching himself from herSo they 'll very likely be apologizing to me around there Monday morning , instead of fining me . He moves across and down to the window at the left ,  --  with ever so slight a touch of swagger p. 105 AMY Oh , I would n't care if they only fined you , Aubrey ; because I could go back to work until it was paid . PIPER looking out the window.You 'll never go back to work , Kid , while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Aubrey . PIPER Not while you 're my wife , Amy . He half turns to her , with considerable consequenceI 'd rather leave the Pennsylvania Railroad flat ; and go out and take one of the jobs that have been offered me where they pay a man what he 's worth . AMY You do n't think they might do anything else to you , do you , Aubrey ? PIPER turning to her. Oh , they might try to take away my license . AMY You have n't got a license , have you ? PIPER turning back to the window.No , I neglected to attend to it this year . AMY They can fine you for that , ca n't they ? PIPER Driving an automobile without a license , you mean ? AMY Yes . PIPER Sure  --  they can fine you for anything unless you know how to beat them to it . He strikes the match on the arm of the Morris-chair at his right . AMY rests her hands on the centertable , and looks straight out , wretchedly p. 106 AMY tonelessly.What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He is just holding the lighted match to the cigar , and , consequently , is unable to answer her immediately . The front doorbell rings . She glances apprehensively in the direction of the hall-door , then meets his eyes I wonder who that is . PIPER tossing the burnt match into the window at his left.Do you want me to answer it ? AMY I wish you would , Aubrey ; it might be something about Pop . He crosses in front of the Morris-chair and up at the left of the center-table to the mirror over the mantelpiece , where he stands settling his tie and vest . AMY turns to the couch and gathers up his coal , then steps forward to the center-table and picks up his hat and the bandage that he took off his head PIPER touching the plasters on his forehead.Does my head look all right ? AMY glancing at him , as she goes towards the hooks at the head of the cellarstairs.Yes , it 's all right , Aubrey . PIPER Wait a minute  --  He steps to her side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then steps back to the mirror and fixes it in his sackcoat p. 107 AMY Hurry up , Aubrey . The doorbell rings again PIPER going out into the hallway.All right  --  all right . AMY hangs the overcoat and hat up , then turns , opens the cellar-door , and tosses the bandage down the cellar-stairs . Then she crosses quickly to a point in front of the mantelpiece and listens intently GILL at the front-door.Good evenin ' . PIPER Good evening , sir . GILL Is this where Mr. Fisher lives ? PIPER This is Mr. Fisher 's residence , yes , sir . What can I do for you ? GILL Why , I got some things of his here that the boss ast me to leave . PIPER Oh , just step inside for a minute . Getting a little colder I think . The front-door closes GILL Well , we can look for it any time , now . PIPER Will you just step in this way , please ? AUBREY enters from the hallwayThere 's a gentleman here , Amy , with some things belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes forward a few steps at the left ; and GILL enters p. 108 GILL Good evenin ' . AMY Good evening . PIPER This is my wife , Mrs. Piper . GILL nodding.How do you do . AMY nods PIPER Mrs. Piper is Mr. Fisher 's daughter . The rest of the folks have gone down to the hospital . GILL I see . Turning to AMYHave you heard anything from the hospital yet ? AMY Not yet , no . PIPER We did n't know anything about it at all , till fifteen minutes ago . GILL It 's too bad . PIPER Those hospitals wo n't tell you anything . AMY Do you work with my Father ? GILL No , ma'am , I 'm a twister on the second floor . But , one of the machinist's-helpers that works with your Father knows I live out this way so he ast me to stop by with these things on me way home . He crosses towards AMY , with a hat and overcoat , and a more or less discolored lunch-box AMY taking the things.Thanks ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hat , and his lunch-box . AMY Thanks . GILL McMahon sez if he comes across anything else he 'll let me know . AMY crossing to the sofa with the things.No , I do n't imagine there 's anything else . GILL If there is , I 'll bring it up . AMY Well , that 's very nice of you . I 'm ever so much obliged to you . She comes back towards GILL PIPER Who is this McMahon ? GILL He 's one of the machinist's-helpers down there . PIPER I see . AMY Were you there when my Father was taken sick ? GILL No , ma'am , I was n't . I do n't think there was anybody there , to tell you the truth . McMahon sez he was talkin ' to him at a quarter of three , and he sez when he came back from the annex at three o'clock , he found Mr. Fisher layin ' in front of number five . PIPER with a suggestion of professionalism.Very likely a little touch of Angina Pectoria . GILL looks at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a stroke . PIPER Same thing . AMY Wo n't you sit down , Mr.  --  a  --  GILL No , thank you , ma'am , I ca n't stay ; I 've got to get along out home . There 's a rapping out at the right . They all look in the direction of the kitchen AMY Oh , I guess it 's Mrs. Harbison  --  I 'll go . She goes out at the right PIPER crossing above GILL towards the right. Do n't stand out there talking , now , Amy , with nothing around you . Surveying himself in the buffetmirror at the rightDo you live up this way , Governor ? GILL No , sir , I live out Richmond way . PIPER I see . GILL I take number thirty-two over Allegheny Avenue . PIPER turning and moving over towards the center-table.Too bad my car 's laid up , I could run you out there . GILL Oh , that 's all right ; the trolley takes me right to the door . PIPER I had to turn it in Thursday to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen-door.I 'm wanted on the telephone , Aubrey ; I 'll be right in . Will you excuse me for a minute ? GILL That 's all right , ma'am ; I 'm goin ' right along meself . PIPER Very likely some word from the Hospital . GILL I hope it ai n't any bad news . PIPER Well , you 've got to be prepared for most anything , Governor , when a man gets up around the old three-score mark . GILL That 's true , a lot of them push off about that age . PIPER Especially when a man 's worked hard all his life . GILL Yes , I guess Mr. Fisher 's worked pretty hard . PIPER Not an excuse in the world for it , either .  --  I 've said to him a thousand times if I 've said to him once , " Well , Pop , when are you going to take the big rest ? " " Oh , " he 'd say , " I 'll have lots of time to rest when I 'm through . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead ; only let me tell you , Pop , you 're going to be through ahead of schedule if you do n't take it soon . " GILL Well , I guess it comes pretty hard on a man that 's been active all his life to quit all of a sudden . p. 112 PIPER Well , he would n't have to quit exactly .  --  I mean , he 's a handy man ; he could putter around the house . There are lots of little things here and there that I 'm not any too well satisfied with . He glances around the room GILL Is Mr. Fisher 's wife livin ' ? PIPER Yes , she 's here with us too . GILL Well , that makes it nice . PIPER Well , it 's a pretty big house here ; so when I married last June , I said , " Come ahead , the more the merrier . " He laughs a little GILL ' T is a pretty big house this . PIPER Yes , they do n't make them like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here in Jenkintown . GILL Oh , yes . PIPER They just put up the twenty of them  --  kind of sample houses  --  ten on that side and ten on this . Of course , these on this side have the southern exposure ,  --  so a man 's got to do quite a bit of wire-pulling to get hold of one of these . GILL You 've got to do some wirepullin ' to get hold of any kind of a house these days . PIPER Well , I have a friend here in town that 's very close to the city architect , and he was able to fix it for me. p. 113 GILL glancing toward the window , at the left.It 's a nice street . PIPER Nice in summer . GILL I was surprised when I saw it , because when I ast a taxicab-driver down here where it was , he said he never heard of it . PIPER looking at him keenly.Never heard of Cresson Street ? GILL He said not . PIPER with pitying amusement.He must be an awful straw-ride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'll tell you , Governor ,  --  I do n't suppose they have many calls for taxicabs out this way . You see , most everybody in through here has his own car . GILL I see . PIPER Some of them have a half dozen , for that matter . He laughs , a bit consequentially GILL starting for the parlor-doors.There certainly is plenty of them knockin ' around . PIPER All over the ice . AUBREY indicates the hall-doorThis way , Governor . p. 114 GILL turning towards the hall-door.Oh , excuse me . PIPER moving towards the hall-door.Those doors go into the parlor . GILL I see . He turns at the hall-doorA fellow was tellin ' me over here in the cigar store that there was quite a smash-up about a half hour ago down here at Broad and Erie Avenue . PIPER That 's so ? GILL He sez there was some nut down there runnin ' into everything in sight . He sez he even ran into the traffic-cop ; and broke his arm . Can you imagine what they 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIPER What was the matter with him , was he stewed ? GILL No ,  --  the fellow in the cigar store sez he was just a nut . He sez they did n't know where he got hold of this car ; he sez it did n't belong to him . I guess he picked it up somewhere . They took it away from him and pinched him . Starting to go outSo I guess he wo n't be runnin ' into anything else for a while . PIPER following him out.Traffic 's in pretty bad shape in this town right now . p. 115 GILL Certainly is . Why , a man 's not safe walkin ' along the sidewalk , these days . I hope your wife 'll hear some good news . PIPER Well , while there 's life there 's hope , you know . GILL That 's right . No use lookin ' on the dark side of things . AMY enters from the right , with a wide-eyed , wan expression , and comes slowly down to the center-table PIPER Where do you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one right at the corner here , and transfer . PIPER Oh , that 's right , so you can . Well , we 're ever so much obliged to you . GILL Do n't mention it . PIPER Good-night , sir . GILL Good-night . The door closes PIPER coming in from the hall-door.When did you come in , Amy ? He stops to look at himself in the mantelpiece-mirror AMY without turning.I came in the side-door ; I thought that man 'd be still here . PIPER coming down to her.Well , Kid , what 's the good word ? p. 116 AMY breaking down.Aubrey , Pop is dead . She buries her face in the lapel of his coat . He takes her in his arms , looks straight ahead , and there is a long pause  --  during which AMY cries hard PIPER Do n't let it get you , Honey  --  you have nothing to regret ; and nothing to fear . The Kid from West Philly 'll never go back on you ,  --  you know that , do n't you , Baby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amy ? She does n't answer himAmy . AMY What ? PIPER You know I 'm with you , do n't you ? AMY Yes . He kisses her hair affectionately PIPER Do n't cry , Honey ; the old man 's better off than we are . He knows all about it now . He kisses her again ; then detaches himself and moves over and down at the left of the center-table AMY What do you think we ought to do , Aubrey ? PIPER There 's nothing at all that you can do that I can see , Sweetheart ; except to sit tight till the folks get back . They 'll be down there themselves in a few minutes , and they 'll know all about it . p. 117 AMY They said that Pop died at a quarter of six . PIPER Was that the Hospital on the telephone ? AMY Yes . PIPER moving up to a point above the center-table again.Something we ought to have in here , Amy ; a telephone  --  not be letting the whole neighborhood in on our business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and cries softlyNow , pull yourself together , Sweetheart . He crosses to her and puts his arm around her shoulders AMY This is where Pop always used to sit in the evening .  --  It 'll seem funny not to see him here anymore . She breaks down again PIPER after a slight pause.The old gent had to go sometime . He passes back of her , comes forward at the right and stands , looking at the tip of his cigarYour Mother 'll have you and me to comfort her now . He strolls across below the center-table and stops , thinking profoundly . AMY sinks down on the chair dejectedly AMY I do n't know how Mom 'll keep this house going now , just on Joe 's pay . p. 118 PIPER Why do n't you say something to your Mother about letting us come in here ? She 'll need a man in the house . And my salary ' ud cover the rent . AMY Mom does n't have to pay rent , Aubrey ,  --  she owns this house . Pop left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week after we were married . AUBREY looks at her keenlyClara got him to do it . PIPER Who 's the executor , do you know ? AMY Clara is . AUBREY nods comprehendingly PIPER looking away off.Too bad your Father did n't make me the executor of that will ;  --  I could have saved him a lot of money . He replaces the cigar in his mouth AMY I suppose he thought on account of Clara being the oldest . PIPER I wonder why your Father never liked me . AMY Pop never said he did n't like you , Aubrey . PIPER I always tried to be clubby with him . I used to slap him on the back whenever I spoke to him . AMY Pop was always very quiet . PIPER And the Kid from West Philly had too much to say . Well ,  --  forgive and forget .  --  It 's all over now .  --  And the old man can be as quiet as he likes . AMY cries again , and there is a pause . AUBREY stands smoking p. 119 AMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat tonight yet , have you , Aubrey ? PIPER coming out of his abstraction , and sauntering up at the left of the center-table.Do n't worry about me , Sweet-heart . AMY going to the buffet-drawer at the right for an apron.I 'll get you something . PIPER It 'll be all the same at the finish ,  --  whether I 've had my dinner or not . He rests his fist on the table , throws his head back , and looks to the stars " Sic transit gloria mundi . " And we never get used to it . He moves across to the upper right-hand corner of the center-tableThe paths of glory lead but to the grave . He stops again , leans on the table and looks out and away offAnd yet we go on ,  --  building up big fortunes  --  only to leave them to the generations yet unborn . Well , he moves forward to the chair at the right  --  so it goes . He sits down , throws one leg across his knee , and shakes his head up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sic transit gloria mundi . " AMY standing at his right.What does that mean , Aubrey , " Sic transit gloria mundi " ? p. 120 PIPER casually.It 's an old saying from the French  --  meaning , " we 're here to-day , and gone tomorrow . " AMY looking out , wretchedly.I 'm worried about tomorrow , Aubrey . He looks at her PIPER What are you worried about , Sweetheart ? AMY I mean Monday . PIPER extending his hand towards her.Now ,  --  " sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof " ,  --  you know that , do n't you , Baby ? She takes his hand and moves over to the back of his chair AMY But , you did n't have a license , Aubrey . And if that traffic-officer should be seriously injured  --  PIPER Do n't you worry about that , Sweetheart ;  --  we 're here today ; and if he 's seriously injured ,  --  we 'll know all about it Monday . The curtain commences to descend slowly@@ SCENE .  --  Same as preceding Act  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . FISHER is seated at the right of the center-table , in black , watching MR . ROGERS , the insurance agent , opposite her , writing on various papers . CLARA , also in mourning , is standing back of her Mother 's chair , watching MR . ROGERS . ROGERS handing MRS . FISHER an insurance receipt.Now , will you just sign that , Mrs. Fisher . Right on that line there . He hands her his fountainpen MRS . FISHER after a sincere attempt to write with the fountain-pen.It wo n't write . CLARA Press on it a bit , Mom . MRS . FISHER I am pressin ' on it . ROGERS Just let me have it a second , Mrs. Fisher . She hands him the pen MRS . FISHER I never saw one of them fountain-pens yet that 'd write . ROGERS holding the pen out and shaking it , in an attempt to force the ink forward.They cut up a little once in a while . MRS . FISHER looks keenly to see if her carpet is being stained p. 122 MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before last , and it 's been in that drawer there from that day to this . ROGERS handing her the pen again.There we are . I think you 'll find that all right . MRS . FISHER Right here ? ROGERS That 's right . He commences to collect his papers MRS . FISHER writing.It 's writin ' now all right . ROGERS It 's usually pretty satisfactory . She hands him the receipt , and he hands her anotherAnd that one also , Mrs. Fisher , if you please . MRS . FISHER In the same place ? ROGERS Yes ; right on the dotted line . It 's just a duplicate . She looks at him sharply , then signs it and hands it back to him ; and he puts it into his wallet . MRS . FISHER looks distrustfully at the point of the fountain-pen MRS . FISHER Here 's the pen . ROGERS Thank you . He signs a check and looks at it MRS . FISHER half-turning towards the cellar-door.See if that cellar-door is closed , Clara , I feel a draught from somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 123 ROGERS handing a check.There you are , Mrs. Fisher , one thousand dollars . MRS . FISHER Thank you . CLARA comes forward again ROGERS collecting his things.That 's the money we like to pay , Mrs. Fisher , and money we do n't like to pay . MRS . FISHER No , things are never very pleasant when this kind of money is bein ' paid . ROGERS rising , and putting his wallet into his inside-pocket.Well , at least , it does n't make things any less pleasant , Mrs. Fisher . MRS . FISHER rising . No , I 'm sure I do n't know what a lot of folks ' ud do without it . ROGERS Pretty hard to make a good many of them see it that way , Mrs. Fisher . MRS . FISHER moving around to a point above the table.Yes , I guess we do n't think much about trouble when we 're not havin ' it . ROGERS Lot of people think they 're never going to have trouble ; MRS . FISHER shakes her head knowinglyand never going to need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish . ROGERS Very foolish indeed . MRS . FISHER Everybody 'll have trouble if they live long enough . ROGERS Yes , indeed . MRS . FISHER Well now , what do I do with this check , Mr. Rogers ? ROGERS Why , you can deposit it if you like , Mrs. Fisher , or have it cashed  --  just whatever you like . CLARA Frank 'll get it cashed for you , Mom , downtown . MRS . FISHER I 'm not used to thousand-dollar checks , you know , Mr. Rogers . ROGERS I 'm not very used to them myself , Mrs. Fisher , except to pay them out to somebody else . He laughs a little MRS . FISHER Well , will you take this , then , Clara , and give it to Frank Hyland ? CLARA advancing.Yes ; I 'll give it to him tonight , Mom . Rogers moves to the window at the left and takes a paper from his pocket MRS . FISHER Do n't go layin it down somewhere , now , and forgettin ' where you left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your gloves . p. 125 CLARA crossing to the buffet where her purse is lying.I 'll put it in my purse here . MRS . FISHER comes forward at the right of the Morris-chair ROGERS turning and coming back a little from the window.Oh , by the way , Mrs. Fisher  --  would you give this to your son-in-law , Mr. Piper ? He hands her the paper MRS . FISHER What is it ? ROGERS Why , it 's a little explanstion of some of the features of a very attractive accident policy that our company has brought out recently ;  --  and I was talking to Mr. Piper about it the day I called for Mr. Fisher 's policy . He seemed to be very much interested . In fact , I find that people are usually a little more susceptible to the advantages of a good insurance policy , when they actually see it being paid to somebody else . Now , that particular policy there  --  is a kind of combination of accident and life-insurance policy ,  --  as well as disability and dividend features . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market today CLARA sits down in the arm-chair at the right window that offers the security or return that that particular policy described there does . The thing is really almost benevolent . p. 126 MRS . FISHER How much is it for ? ROGERS Why , we have them as low as ten thousand dollars ; but the policy that Mr. Piper was most interested in , was one of our fifty-thousand-dollar policies . CLARA laughs faintly , and her Mother looks over at her MRS . FISHER turning back to ROGERS.It 's no wonder she 's laughin ' , Mr. Rogers ; for if you knew Mr. Piper as well as she knows him , you 'd laugh too . He has just about as much notion of takin ' out a fifty-thousand-dollar insurance policy as I have . And just about as much chance of payin ' for it . ROGERS Why , he seemed very much interested , Mrs. Fisher . MRS . FISHER He was showin ' off , Mr. Rogers , what he 's always doin ' . Why , that fellow do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's premium on a policy like this . So , if I was you , I 'd just put this paper right back in my pocket , for you 're only wastin ' it to be givin ' it to him . ROGERS taking the paper.Seems rather funny that he 'd talk about it at all ,  --  I mean , if he had no idea of taking it . MRS . FISHER He never has any idea when he talks , Mr. Rogers  --  that 's the reason he talks so much ; it 's no effort . That 's the reason he 's gettin ' thirty-two dollars a week , down here in the Pennsylvania Freight Office . And it 's a wonder to me they give him that much , after listenin ' to him for five minutes . p. 127 ROGERS It 's particularly funny , because I spoke to Mr. Piper first about one of our ten-thousand-dollar policies ; but he did n't seem to be interested in anything but the fifty-thousand-dollar life and accident policy . MRS . FISHER Well , I can understand him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Monday . I suppose you heard about him runnin ' into everything here last Monday evening , did n't you ? Down here at Broad and Erie Avenue . ROGERS Oh , was that Mr. Piper ? MRS . FISHER That was him . He ran into a traffic-cop , and broke his arm . ROGERS Yes , I saw that in the paper ; but the name was spelled Pepper in my paper . MRS . FISHER Well , it was spelled Piper in our paper . ROGERS Well , what did they do about that , Mrs. Fisher ? MRS . FISHER Why , he 's down there today , at the Magistrate 's , gettin ' his hearin ' . God knows what they 'll do with him ; for he did n't own the car he was drivin ' , and did n't have a license to drive it . ROGERS Well , that 's very unfortunate . MRS . FISHER But , he 'll very likely tire the magistrate out so with his talk , that the man 'll discharge him just to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piper wo n't want to see me today when he comes back . MRS . FISHER He may not be back , for six months . ROGERS starting for the hall-door.Oh , well , let 's hope it wo n't be anything like that . Good afternoon , Mrs. Hyland . CLARA rising.Good afternoon , Mr. Rogers . He goes out into hallway ROGERS Good afternoon , Mrs. Fisher . MRS . FISHER Good afternoon , Mr. Rogers . Calling after him from the halldoorWill you close that vestibule-door tight after you , Mr. Rogers  --  ROGERS Yes , I will , Mrs. Fisher . MRS . FISHER This hallway gets awful cold when that vestibule-door is n't shut tight . A door closes in the hallway , then another door . And then MRS . FISHER turns , removing her glasses , and moves towards the mantelpieceI 'm glad you were here ; I do n't understand them insurance papers . She puts her glasses on the mantelpiece CLARA moving to the chair at the right of the center-table.What do you think you 'll do with that money , Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just put it into a bank somewhere ; everything is paid . And then I 'll have something in my old days . She comes forward to the chair at the left of the center-table CLARA Do you want me to put the check right into the bank ? MRS . FISHER No ,  --  I want to see the money first . She sits downBut , can you imagine that clown , Clara , takin ' up that man 's time talkin ' about a fifty-thousand-dollar policy ; and him in debt to his eyes . CLARA sitting down.What does it matter , Mom ; you can never change a man like Piper . MRS . FISHER No , but I hate to see him makin ' such a fool of Amy ; and of all of us ,  --  with his name in all the papers , and the whole city laughin ' at him . CLARA He does n't mind that , he likes it . MRS . FISHER But , Amy 's married to him , Clara ,  --  that 's the trouble . CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it 's Aubrey . MRS . FISHER Well , she ought to mind it , if she 's got any pride . CLARA looking straight ahead , wistfully.She 's in love with him , Mom  --  she does n't see him through the same eyes that other people do . p. 130 MRS . FISHER You 're always talkin ' about love ; you give me a pain . CLARA Well , do n't you think she is ? MRS . FISHER How do I know whether she is or not ? I do n't know anything about when people are in love ; except that they act silly  --  most everybody that I ever knew that was . I 'm sure she acted silly enough when she took him . CLARA She might have taken worse , Mom . MRS . FISHER looks at her ; and CLARA meets the lookHe does his best . He works every day , and he gives her his money ; and nobody ever heard of him looking at another woman . MRS . FISHER But , he 's such a rattle-brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are harder to put up with in a man than that , Mom . I know he 's terribly silly , and has too much to say , and all that , but ,  --  I do n't know , I feel kind of sorry for him sometimes . He 'd so love to be important ; and , of course , he never will be . MRS . FISHER Well , I swear I do n't know how Amy stands the everlastin ' talk of him . He 's been here now only a week , and I 'm tellin ' you , Clara , I 'm nearly light-headed . I 'll be glad when they go . CLARA I 'd rather have a man that talked too much than one of those silent ones . Honestly , Mom , I think sometimes if Frank Hyland does n't say something I 'll go out of my mind . p. 131 MRS . FISHER What do you want him to say ? CLARA Anything ; just so I 'd know he had a voice . MRS . FISHER He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talkin ' when he has nothin ' to say . CLARA I do n't think it 's so sensible , Mom , never to have anything to say . MRS . FISHER Well , lot 's of men are that way in the house . CLARA But there are usually children there ,  --  it is n't so bad . MRS . FISHER Well , if Amy ever has any children , and they have as much to say as their Father , I do n't know what 'll become of her . CLARA She 'll get along some way ; people always do . MRS . FISHER Leanin ' on somebody else ,  --  that 's how they get along . CLARA There are always the Leaners and the Bearers , Mom . But , if she 's in love with the man she 's married to ,  --  and he 's in love with her ,  --  and there are children  --  MRS . FISHER I never saw a married woman so full of love . CLARA I suppose that 's because I never had any of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . FISHER Do n't your man love you ? CLARA looks straight out , shaking her head slowly CLARA He loved someone else before he met me . MRS . FISHER How do you know ? CLARA The way he talks sometimes . MRS . FISHER Why did n't he marry her ? CLARA I think he lost her . I remember he said to me one time  --  " Always be kind , Clara , to anybody that loves you ; for , " he said , " a person always loses what he does n't appreciate . And , " he said , " it 's a terrible thing to lose love . " He said , " You never realize what it was worth until you 've lost it . " I think that 's the reason he gives Piper a hand once in a while ,  --  because he sees Amy 's in love with him , and he wants to make it easy for her ; because I have an idea he made it pretty hard for the woman that loved him . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a body ca n't have everything in this world , Clara . There is a pause : and CLARA touches her handkerchief to her eyes . Then the front-door closes softly , and MRS . FISHER gets upMaybe this is them now . She moves up to the hall-door . AMY comes in , looking wearied . She is in moarningWhat happened , Amy ? AMY wanders down to the chair at left of table and sits down , and her Mother follows her down at the leftWhere 's Aubrey Piper ? p. 133 AMY He 's coming . CLARA Is Frank with him ? AMY Yes . MRS . FISHER Where are they ? AMY Aubrey stopped at the corner to get some cigars . CLARA What happened down there ? AMY Oh , a lot of talk . MRS . FISHER leaning towards her , solicitously.Are you sick ? AMY No . MRS . FISHER Well , you look sick . AMY I have a headache ; we had to wait there so long . CLARA Why do n't you take off your hat ? AMY starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of tea ? AMY No , do n't bother , Mom ; I can get it myself . MRS . FISHER going towards the right door.It wo n't take a minute . AMY takes her handkerchief from her bag . CLARA glances toward the right door CLARA in a subdued tone.What did they do to Aubrey ? p. 134 AMY confidentially.Fined him  --  a thousand dollars . Do n't let Mom know . Recklessness , and driving without a license . CLARA Did Frank pay it ? AMY Yes ; I told him I 'd be responsible for it . CLARA How can you ever pay him a thousand dollars , Amy ? AMY I can go back to work for a while . I can always go back to the office . CLARA movesWell , it was either that or six months in jail . And Frank said we could n't have that . CLARA Was there anybody there that we know ? AMY I did n't see anybody . CLARA Was the traffic-cop there ? AMY Yes , there were fourteen witnesses . The traffic-cop 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken . The fellow that owned the car was there , too . CLARA When do you think you 'll go back to work ? AMY after a troubled pause.As soon as I get settled . There 's no use in my going back now ; I 'd only have to be leaving again pretty soon . CLARA looks at her p. 135 CLARA Does Mom know ? AMY No , I have n't told her . There is a pause . CLARA geis up ; and , with a glance toward the kitchen-door , moves around and crosses towards the left , above the center-table . She stops back of AMY 'S chair and looks at her for a second compassionately ; then she steps forward and lays her hand on her shoulder CLARA Do n't worry about it , Amy . She moves towards the window at the leftI wish to God it was me . There is a murmur of voices at the front-door ; then AUBREY 'S laugh rings through the house . AMY rises quickly , picks up her hat from the table , and signifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the parlor . CLARA moves across in front of the center-table PIPER entering , all dressed up , and with a little flourish of his cane to CLARA.Hello , Clara ! CLARA Hello . PIPER hanging up his hat and cane on the hooks at the head of the cellar-stairs.Where 's Amy ? CLARA She 's just gone in the parlor there . FRANK HYLAND appears in the hall-door and comes forward to the chair at the left of the table p. 136 HYLAND Hello ! AUBREY crosses to the parlor , removing his gloves PIPER You in there , Amy ? AMY Yes . He goes into the parlor ; and CLARA moves across above the center-table to HYLAND 'S left CLARA How is it you did n't go back to the office , Frank ? AUBREY hurries out of the parlor again and across to the hooks , removing his overcoat . MRS . FISHER appears in the kitchen-door , and stands , looking at him HYLAND It was so late when we got through down there I did n't think it was worth while . PIPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're back again . He hangs up his overcoat PIPER Right on the job , Mother ,  --  doing business at the old stand . He takes the carnation from the overcoat and fastens it in the sack-coat . MRS .

FISHER Well , I 'm not feelin ' good , Frank , I can tell you that . HYLAND What 's the trouble ? MRS . FISHER Why , I 'm troubled to think of all the bother you 've been put to in this business . HYLAND Do n't worry about that , Mother  --  we 've got to have a little bother once in a while . MRS . FISHER What did they do down there today , Frank ? HYLAND Why ,  --  they  --  PIPER coming forward , adjusting the carnation.I 'll tell you what they tried to do . MRS . FISHER Oh , shut up , you ! Nobody wants to hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARA crosses above the Morris-chair and looks out the window at the left PIPER Well , I told them down there what I had to say about it , whether they wanted to hear it or not . He goes up to the mirror at the back MRS . FISHER I guess they let you go just to get rid of you . He turns to his left and looks at her ; then starts for the parlor-doors CLARA Why do n't you take your coat off , Frank ? AUBREY goes into the parlor , looking back over his shoulder at his Mother-in-law , who has not taken her eyes off him p. 138 HYLAND looking at his watch.I 've got to meet that fellow at North Philadelphia Station at four o'clock . MRS . FISHER coming a step or two nearer to the table. What did they say to that fellow down there today , Frank ? HYLAND Why , nothing very much , Mother  --  just a little reprimand , for driving without a license . MRS . FISHER Did n't they fine him at all , for breakin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not very much .  --  You see , that was more or less in the nature of an accident . MRS . FISHER How much was it ? HYLAND Now , Mrs. Fisher , as Aubrey says , " It 's all washed up , and signed on the dotted line . " He laughs MRS . FISHER How much was it , Clara , do you know ? CLARA He has n't told me , Mom . MRS . FISHER Well , I 'll bet you paid it , Frank , whatever it was ; for I know he did n't have it . She sits at the right of the table HYLAND rising. Well , you know , it 's getting near Christmas , Mother  --  got to give some kind of a little present here and there . p. 139 MRS . FISHER Well , I do n't think it 's right that you should have to be goin ' around payin ' for that fellow 's mistakes . HYLAND standing up a bit toward the hall-door , putting on his gloves.That 's about all any of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for somebody 's mistakes  --  and somebody payin ' for ours , I suppose . MRS . FISHER Well , it do n't seem right to me . HYLAND Well , I 'll tell you , Mother  --  when you 've made a couple of mistakes that ca n't be paid for , why , then you try to forget about them by payin ' for the kind that can . He makes a little pallid sound of amusement . And there is a pause . MRS . FISHER rocks back and forth CLARA Will you be home for dinner tonight , Frank ? HYLAND coming suddenly out of an abstraction.What 'd you say ? CLARA I say , will you be home for dinner tonight ? HYLAND picking up his hat from the table. I do n't think so ; I 'll very likely have to go to dinner with him . He goes towards the hall-doorGood-bye , Mother . p. 140 MRS . FISHER Good-bye , Frank . HYLAND going out into the hallwayGood-bye , dear . CLARA wanders up to the hall-door and looks out after him CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a significant pause ; during which CLARA stands looking wistfully out into the hallway MRS . FISHER rising , and moving to a point above the table.Listen , Clara . CLARA comes towards her CLARA What ? MRS . FISHER Did n't he tell you how much they fined Aubrey ? CLARA No , he did n't , Mom , really . MRS . FISHER Did n't she tell you , while I was out puttin ' the tea on ? CLARA moving forward to the chair at the left of the table. Well now , what does it matter , Mom ? You wo n't have to pay it . She sits down MRS . FISHER Well , I 'll find out ; it 'll very likely be in the evening paper . CLARA Well , I would n't say anything to Amy about it , even if it is ; she has enough to bother her now . p. 141 MRS . FISHER Well , she brought it on herself if she has :  --  nobody could tell her anything . CLARA Well , there 's nothing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FISHER with conviction.There 's nothing can be done by anything , Clara ,  --  when once the main thing is done . And that 's the marriage . That 's where all the trouble starts  --  gettin ' married . CLARA If there were no marriages , Mom , there 'd be no world . MRS . FISHER moving around to the chair at the right of the table again. Oh , everybody sez that !  --  if there were no marriages there 'd be no world . CLARA Well , would there ? MRS . FISHER Well , what if there would n't ? She sits downDo you think it 'd be any worse than it is now ? I think there 'll be no world pretty soon , anyway , the way things are goin ' . A lot of whiffets gettin ' married , and not two cents to their names , and then throwin ' themselves on their people to keep them . They 're so full of love before they 're married . You 're about the only one I 've heard talkin ' about love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you have a roof over you ; for they never have , with that kind of talk . Like the two in the parlor there  --  that has to kiss each other , every time they meet on the floor . She bristles for a second or two ; and then there is a silence p. 142 CLARA quietly.Amy 's going to have a child , Mom . Her Mother looks at her MRS . FISHER How do you know ? CLARA She told me so . MRS . FISHER softening a bit.Why did n't she tell me ? CLARA I suppose she thought it 'd start a fight . MRS . FISHER indignant again. I do n't know why it 'd start a fight ; I never fight with anybody ; except him : and I would n't fight with him only for his impudence . CLARA Has Amy said anything to you about coming in here to live ? MRS . FISHER She said something to me the night your Father was laid out , but I was n't payin ' much attention to her . CLARA I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her Mother looks at herShe 'd be company for you , now that Pop is gone . And you do n't know what day Joe might take a notion to get married . MRS . FISHER What 's changed your ideas so much about lettin ' her come in here ? You were very much against it when she was married . p. 143 CLARA I 'd be against it now , if things around here were the way they were then . You did n't even own this house , Mom , when Amy was married : it was Pop 's ; and I knew if anything ever happened to him , and there was no will ,  --  you might not find it so easy to order anybody out of it . MRS . FISHER It is n't that I 'd mind lettin ' Amy come in here , Clara ,  --  but I would n't like to please him ; for I know the first thing I 'd know , he 'd very likely be tellin ' somebody that he 'd let me come in . CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 's told bigger lies than that . And if I ever found out that he said that ,  --  he 'd go out of here inside of five minutes , bag and baggage . The front door-bell ringsSee who that is , Clara . They rise ; and CLARA goes out  --  into the hallway , and MRS . FISHER crosses below the table to the parlor-doorsAre you in there , Amy ? She opens the door AMY Yes ; what is it , Mom ? MRS . FISHER This kettle 's boilin ' out here , if you want a cup of tea . AMY All right , Mom , I 'll be right out . MRS . FISHER crossing to the kitchendoor.I 'm goin ' to make it right away , so you 'd better come out if you want it hot . She goes out at the right p. 144 AMY coming out of parlor.Do you want a cup of tea , Aubrey ? She crosses to the mirror over the mantelpiece and touches her hair PIPER coming out of the parlor.No , thanks , Honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He strolls to the hall-door , glances out , then moves to AMY 'S side and puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her affectionately . Then he pats her on the shoulder . She moves towards the kitchen-door PIPER patting her hand.Everything 'll be all right , Kid . You know me . She goes out into the kitchen , and he settles himself at the mirror over the buffet at the right CLARA in the hallway.Yes , I think it is myself . Appearing in the hall-doorJust come right in , I 'll call my Mother . Is she out in the kitchen , Aubrey ? PIPER turning.Yes , she 's getting come tea . GILL appears in the hall-door GILL Well , you need n't bother , Ma'am , if she 's busy . I just wanted to leave this watch . PIPER How do you do . p. 145 GILL How do you do . CLARA stops and looks back at the watch PIPER And how is the young man ? GILL I ca n't complain . CLARA Is that my Father 's watch ? GILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLARA Yes . Close that door , Aubrey , will you ?  --  I do n't want Mom to see it . To GILLI 'd rather my Mother would n't see it . She takes the watch , and AUBREY closes the kitchendoor GILL That 's right . CLARA I believe she gave him this watch when they were married . AUBREY comes forward again , at right GILL Yes , it 'd make her feel bad . CLARA Thanks ever so much . GILL McMahon did n't notice it when he was gettin ' the rest of Mr. Fisher 's things together . CLARA I see . GILL He said it was hangin ' under the time-chart , back of number five . PIPER This is the gentleman that brought Pop 's lunch-box home . p. 146 CLARA Oh , is that so ? GILL I stopped by the day Mr. Fisher died . CLARA Did you work with my father ? GILL No , Ma'am ; I 'm a twister ; but I live out this way . PIPER How is it you 're not working today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule . PIPER I see . GILL But the hunkies do n't always get the stuff up to us . You got to keep right after them . Well , I guess I 'll be gettin ' along . He starts for the parlordoors , then remembers that that is not the way out , and turns to his left towards the hall-door CLARA I 'm ever so much obliged to you , for bringing this watch up . GILL turning to her , at the hall-door.Oh , that 's all right . I 'm only sorry for the reason I have to do it . CLARA Yes , it was very sad . GILL Mr. Fisher was a hard-workin ' man . CLARA I suppose he worked too hard , for his age . GILL Yes , I guess he did . p. 147 CLARA You could n't stop him , though . GILL No , that 's what your brother-in-law here was sayin ' the day I was here . He was tellin ' me about all the times he tried to get him to quit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess when a man 's worked as hard all his life as Mr. Fisher did , it ai n't so easy for him to quit . CLARA No , I guess not . GILL stepping a little forward again. I did n't know that was you , Mr. Piper , that was in that automobile smash-up that I was tellin ' you about the day I was here . PIPER turning.That so ? GILL I did n't know it till I saw your picture in the paper the next day . PIPER What paper did you see it in ? GILL I saw it in the Record . PIPER Was n't a very good picture of me , was it ? GILL I knew it was you , though , the minute I saw it . PIPER A friend of mine loaned me his car while mine was laid up , and something went wrong with the steer-gear. p. 148 GILL How did you make out about that traffic-cop ? PIPER Oh , I squared that up all right . CLARA Where do you live up here , Mr. a  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a house over this way more , on account of bein ' a little nearer my work , but I do n't see much chance . CLARA No , I do n't know of any vacant houses around here right now . GILL No , your brother-in-law was tellin ' me about the time he had gettin ' hold of this one . AUBREY turns to the buffet-mirror again and smooths his toup with considerable precisionWell , I 'll be gettin ' along . He starts out into the hallway CLARA with a bitter look over her shoulder at AUBREY , and following GILL out into the hallway.Well , thanks , ever so much , Mr. a  --  She puts the watch back of the statuette on the little stand at the left of the mantelpiece GILL Do n't mention it . CLARA I 'm sure Mother 'll be glad to have this watch . AUBREY turns and looks after them . Then , with a glance toward the kitchen-door , he moves carefully to the mantelpiece and tries to see what is going on at the front-door p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of them hunkies down there . CLARA Can you open it ? GILL Yes , I got it . Good-bye . CLARA Good-bye ; and thank you . GILL You 're welcome . The front-door closes ; and AUBREY glides hastily for the parlor-doors , in an attempt to avoid CLARA ;  --  but just as he reaches the parlor-doors , she appears in the hall-door , and , with a quick glance toward the kitchen-door , comes forward to the back of the Morris-chair CLARA Come here , Aubrey , I want to talk to you . He turns towards her , with an attempt at nonchalanceWhat do you mean by telling people that this is your house ? PIPER I did n't tell anybody it was my house . CLARA You must have told this man , or he would n't have said so . PIPER What do you think I am , a liar ? CLARA Yes , I do ; one of the best I know . PIPER Well , ask Amy what I said to him , she was here when I was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to ask anybody anything !  --  you were lying to him here to-day , right in front of me. p. 150 PIPER with a shade of challenge in his manner.What 'd I say ? CLARA That you 'd fixed the automobile thing up . PIPER It 's fixed up , is n't it ? CLARA You did n't fix it up . There is a slight pause , during which AUBREY , his dignity considerably outraged , moves forward and crosses in front of her to the front of the center-table , where he stops . CLARA moves down at the right of the Morris-chair to a point near him You 'd have gone to jail for six months only for Frank Hyland . And telling this man that you tried to persuade Pop to stop working . PIPER over his left shoulder.So I did . CLARA When ? PIPER I did n't say it to him . But I told Amy he ought to stop . And I think he 'd be right here to-day if he 'd taken my advice . CLARA He would n't be right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He moves further over to the right ; and she follows himAnd now , listen to me , Aubrey ; I want to talk seriously to you . You 've made a lot of trouble for us since you 've been in this family ; and I want you to stop it . There 's no reason my husband , because he happens to have a few dollars , should be going around paying your bills . p. 151 PIPER half-turning to her. What do you want me to do ? CLARA I want you to stop telling lies ; for that 's about all everything you do amounts to . Trying to make people believe you 're something that you 're not ;  --  when if you 'd just stop your talking and your showing-off , you might be the thing that you 're trying to make them believe you are . She glances toward the kitchen-door , and then speaks to him again , in a slightly lower toneYour wife 's going to have a child one of these days , Aubrey , and you want to pull yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a family should be . You 're smart enough ;  --  there 's no reason why a fellow like you should be living in two rooms over a barber shop . I should think you 'd have more respect for your wife . She turns and moves a few steps up towards the kitchen-door PIPER A man does n't stand much chance of getting ahead , Clara , when the boss has got a grudge against him . CLARA turning sharply to her right , and moving to the upper right-hand corner of the center-table.Well , stop your silly talk , and get rid of that carnation , and the boss might get rid of his grudge . She glances toward the kitchen-door again , leans across the table towards him , and lowers her voiceBut , what I wanted to tell you was this , Aubrey ,  --  I 've asked Mom to let you and Amy come in here ; and she sez she would n't mind it only that she knows that the first thing she 'd hear is that you 'd told someone that you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exactly what you 've done already ,  --  to this man that brought the watch . If I told Mom that there 'd be war . p. 152 PIPER Are you going to tell her ? CLARA with authoritative levelness.I 'm going to put that up to you . And the very first time I hear that you 've told anybody that this is your house ,  --  I 'll see to it that you 'll get a house that will be your own . AUBREY smiles , a bit smugly , and looks at her out of the sides of his eyes PIPER I guess your Mother ' ud have something to say about that , Clara . CLARA with a measured evenness.Well , the only thing that needs to worry you , is what I 'll have to say about it . AUBREY'S. smugness begins to fade  --  into a questioning narrowness.This is my house  --  Pop left it to me ; so that Mom'ud always have a roof over her . For he knew how long she 'd have it if Amy ever got round her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what she 'd do if it ever came to a choice between you and Mom . PIPER What are you doing , kidding me ? CLARA helds his eyes steadily for a fraction of a second CLARA I 'm giving you a tip ;  --  see that you keep it to yourself . AUBREY withdraws his eyes slowly and looks straight out , weighing this new bit of intelligence carefully in his mindBe wise , now , Aubrey  --  you 've got a chance to sit in here and live like a human being ; and if you throw it away , you 'll have nobody to blame but yourself . There is a sound at the front-door of a newspaper being thrown into the vestibule , and a man 's voice says , " Paper ! " Then the front-door is heard to closeOpen that door there , Mom 'll be wondering what it 's doing shut . She crosses up to the hall-door and goes out for the newspaper . AUBREY stands for a second thinking ; and then AMY opens the kitchen-door and comes in . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aubrey ? PIPER I think she 's out on the front porch . AMY glances toward the hall-door , then turns to her husbandHow are you feeling ? AMY All right , I just had some tea . Listen , Aubrey ,  --  She takes hold of the lapels of his coatMom said we could come in here to live . PIPER Yes , I got Clara to fix it up . AMY She said we could have my room . PIPER Is it a front room ? AMY No , it 's that one at the head of the stairs . PIPER Will we put that bureau of ours in there ? AMY I think the one that 's in there is better-looking . Let 's go up and see . She starts up towards the hall-door PIPER following her.You look nice in black , Amy . AMY glancing in the mantelpiecemirror as she passes it.This is the dress that Clara gave me . CLARA appears in the hall-door with the evening paper in her hand p. 154 CLARA It 's in the paper here about that trial today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't let Mom see it . AMY going out the hall-door and to her left up the stairs.I 'll take it upstairs . CLARA moves down towards the center-table , and AUBREY crosses above her towards the hall-door . As he passes her he excludes her with a look PIPER calling after AMY as he starts up the stairs.Has it got my picture in it ? CLARA looks after him , rather hopelessly . MRS . FISHER comes in from the kitchen and moves down to the buffet at the right for her knitting-bag MRS . FISHER You goin ' to stay here for supper to-night , Clara ? CLARA Yes , I might as well , Mom ; Frank wo n't be home . I think I 'll run in next door and tell Bertha I wo n't be home . She starts towards the kitchen-door MRS . FISHER crossing up to the man-telpiece for her spectacles.Yes , you 'd better ; she 'll be expectin ' you . Put somethin ' around you . CLARA stopping at the hooks at the head of the cellar-stairs.Is there some thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain coat of Joe 's around you ; it 's good enough . She moves forward to the chair at the right of the center-tableAnd go to the side-door , Clara ; and do n't be bringin ' Mrs. Harbison to the front She sits down and puts on her spectacles , and CLARA shakes the old raincoat out and puts it around her shouldersI told Amy she could have that side room upstairs . CLARA She might as well be using it , Mom . MRS . FISHER But I know I 'm not goin ' to hit it with him . CLARA Well , it 's better to be fighting than lonesome , Mom . She goes out at the right , and MRS . FISHER takes a purple sweater that she 's working on , out of the knitting-bag . A door out at the right closes after CLARA . MRS . FISHER commences to knit , when suddenly there is a shout of laughter from AUBREY upstairs . MRS . FISHER freezes instantly into a stoney stillness , and listens narrowly . There is another gale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She puts her knitting back into the bag , very definitely , puts the bag on the table , gets up and marches resolutely across in front of the table and up to the hall-door . Just as she reaches the hall-door , with the ostensible purpose of reminding AUBREY that this is not his house , there is another roar from him . AMY can be heard laughing this time , also . MRS . FISHER subsides , and thinks . She appears to suddenly realize the futility of all remonstrances against the irresponsibility of AUBREY ; and , after a thoughtful pause , to accept the situation . And as she moves back across the room , in front of the mantelpiece , to resume her chair at the right of the table , she seems a little older . Just as she reaches a point above the center-table , the front-door closes , with a bang . She starts nervously , and steps back to the mantelpiece to peer out into the hallway p. 156 MRS . FISHER Is that you , Joe ? JOE from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of the table.It 's a wonder you would n't take the door off the hinges , and be done with it . JOE hurries in from the hallway JOE How did they make out down there to-day , Mom ? He tosses the evening paper onto the center-table , and continues on over and up to the hooks at the head of the cellar-stairs , to hang up his hat and overcoat MRS . FISHER sitting down.Who do you mean , Aubrey Piper ? JOE Yes . Are they back yet ? MRS . FISHER They 're upstairs . JOE What 'd they do to him ? MRS . FISHER They fined him . JOE How much ? MRS . FISHER taking her knitting out of the bag.I do n't know ; they would n't tell me . Frank paid it . But , I 'll find out ; it 'll very likely be in the evening paper . JOE comes forward to the center-table p. 157 JOE picking up the paper from the table.It is n't in this paper , I looked . MRS . FISHER I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to-night 's paper , Mom . MRS .

" Philadelphia Youth Makes Important Chemical Discovery . Mr. Joseph Fisher of North Philadelphia Perfects Rust-Preventive Solution . " He gives his Mother a squeeze and a kiss MRS . FISHER startled , and giving him a little slap.Stop it , Joe ! He laughs exultantly , strikes the palms of his hands together , and strides across above the table towards the leftDid they buy the thing from you , Joe ? JOE turning to her , at the left of the center-table.One hundred thousand dollars , Mother ! They signed for it this afternoon in the lawyer 's office . He becomes aware that the shoe-lace of his right shoe is untied , and puts his foot up on the chair to tie it p. 158 MRS . FISHER leaning towards him.The Meyers and Stevens people ? JOE Yeh . They sent for me to come over there this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got hold of Farley right away , and we went over there . And they had the contracts all drawn up and everything . MRS .

JOE That 's what they paid for it this afternoon , on account ;  --  He starts across above the center-table and up to the hooks again at the right , removing his coalthen they 're to market it for me from their laboratories , and give me half the net . MRS . FISHER talking over her right shoulder.What 's the net ? JOE hanging his coat up.Whatever 's left after all expenses are paid . MRS . FISHER tries to encompass the situation MRS . FISHER I guess they 'll see that there ai n't much left , wo n't they ? JOE coming forward again to the center-table.Why , there 'll be a fortune out of this thing , Mom . Have you any idea what a rust-preventive means as an industrial chemical problem ? Why , they 'll make a million dollars out of is , within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , removing his tie p. 159 MRS .

MRS . FISHER shifts her eyes and tries to concentrate MRS . FISHER How many noughts is a hundred thousand ? JOE coming back to her left , taking a pencil from his vest-pocket.It 's a one , He leans over the table and writes it on the margin of the newspaper and two noughts , and three more noughts . MRS . FISHER looks at it closely . JOE replaces the pencil in his pocket and moves across again towards the leftThey paid that today on account . I knew it was coming , though ; their head chemist out at Bristol told me six weeks ago it was all set .

JOE Farley has it in his safe , down in the office . MRS . FISHER How much do you have to give him , half of it ? JOE No , he 's not a partner , he 's just my lawyer . I give him five per cent of all monies received . He moves forward at the left of the center-table MRS . FISHER How much will that be ? JOE Well , that was five thousand dollars right off the bat , today . Pretty soft for that bird . When I first talked to him he wanted to stick me for ten per cent ; but I nailed that quick ; I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FISHER What are you goin ' to do now , Joe , stop workin ' ? JOE No , of course not , I 'm not goin ' to stop working ; I 've got that oil-paint thing on the carpet , now . MRS . FISHER Well , wo n't you have to go to Washington or someplace ? JOE rolling his tie up on his finger , and stuffing it into his vest-pocket.No , that 's all been attended to . But I 'll tell you , Mom  --  I might go to Trenton. p. 161 MRS . FISHER New Jersey ? JOE Yes . MRS . FISHER Not to live , surely ? JOE I might  --  till I put this oilpaint thing through . MRS . FISHER Well , I think you 'd be very foolish , Joe , to go to Trenton at your age . JOE removing his cuff-links and dropping them into his vest-pocket.Well , the Meyers and Stevens people made me a proposition this afternoon that looks pretty good . They 've got one of the most perfectly equipped experimenting laboratories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's open day and night ; and that 's what I want .

So they want me to go up there on a salary , with a first look at anything I strike ; but I did n't want to say anything till I talked to you . MRS . FISHER What do you mean ? JOE I mean , I would n't like the idea of goin ' away , and leavin ' you alone in the house . MRS . FISHER resuming her knitting.Oh , you go ahead , Joe ,  --  if it 's for your good . Never mind me ,  --  I 'll get along some way . p. 162 JOE I do n't like the idea of leavin ' you here alone . MRS . FISHER Nearly every Mother is left alone , Joe , if she lives long enough .

She stops knitting and thinks , looking steadily at the floor in front of herThey 'll have to live somewhere ; and I guess it 'll have to be here . It 's just as our Clara said here one night ,  --  I remember it as if it was yesterday . She said , " Remember what I 'm telling you , Mom ,  --  it 's you that 'll have them on your hands if she takes him . " And I suppose that 's true .

JOE I 'm goin ' up to get fixed up a bit before I go over to that office . MRS . FISHER suddenly putting her knitting on the table , preparatory to getting up . Well , listen , Joe ! JOE stopping , with his foot on the first step of the stairs.What ? MRS . FISHER getting up and moving across in front of the center-table.Come here . JOE comes down to her leftDo n't say anything about this to him , Joe , or he 'll be wantin ' to go up and talk to the newspaper men , too . JOE laughs faintly , then looks away off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda feel that there 's somethin ' comin ' to that nut out of this thing . p. 164 MRS . FISHER How do you mean ? JOE He gave me an idea here one night . MRS . FISHER seizing him suddenly by both arms.Well , for God 's sake , do n't tell him that , Joe !  --  or , as sure as you live , he 'll be tellin ' everybody that he done the whole thing . JOE You remember the night he was sayin ' here about bein ' at work on a solution for the prevention of rust in iron and steel ? MRS . FISHER Yes . JOE Well , you know , I 'd been tellin ' him somethin ' about it a week or so before  --  MRS . FISHER Yes , you told me . JOE While he was waitin ' here for Amy one night . MRS . FISHER Yes . JOE Well , he forgot that night he was tellin ' me about it that it was me that had been tellin ' him about it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he does with everything . JOE And it was the way he got it mixed , Mom , that gave me the idea . He said ,  --  that it was a combination of chemical elements to be added to the metal in its molten state , instead of applied externally , as they had been doin ' . And I landed on it  --  the way Howe did when he dreamed of puttin ' the eye in the point of the needle instead of the other end . That was exactly what I 'd been doin '  --  applying the solution externally  --  in a mixture of paint . But the next day , I tried adding parts of it to the molten state of the metal , and it did the trick . Of course , he did n't know what he was sayin ' when he said it  --  p. 165 MRS . FISHER He never does . JOE And he did n't know anything about the solution-formula  --  But it was the way he got what I 'd been tellin ' him twisted , Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISHER Well , that 's no credit to him , Joe . JOE I know . MRS . FISHER He was only blowin ' when he said it . JOE Sure . MRS . FISHER He do n't know what a formula means . And I 'd have told him where he heard it , too , if I 'd been you . JOE thoughtfully.I 'd like to give him a little present of some kind . His Mother looks at him sharply MRS . FISHER What would you give him a present for ? JOE breaking into a little laugh.For makin ' a mistake . MRS . FISHER That 's all everybody 's doin ' around here ,  --  givin ' that fellow presents for makin ' mistakes . That 's what Frank Hyland said here to-day , when I ast him why he paid his fine . He said , " Oh , you 've got to give a little present here and there once in a while . " There 's no use tryin ' to be sensible anymore . p. 166 JOE I 'd like to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thinks for a second MRS . FISHER I 'll tell you what you can do , Joe , if you 're so anxious to give him somethin ' .  --  Find out what fine Frank Hyland paid for him this afternoon , and tell him you 're goin ' to give him that . But do n't tell him what you 're giving it to him for , Joe , or we wo n't be able to live in the house with him . And do n't give him money , Joe ; for he 'd only be goin ' from one room to another here in an automobile . And do n't give it to her neither , Joe ; for she 'll only hand it right over to him .  --  Give it to me . JOE looks at herAnd I 'll give it to them when I think they need it . A door closes out at the right ; and JOE steps up towards the mantelpiece to look offThat 's Clara ; she 's been next door telephonin ' . She turns to her left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again . CLARA comes in , slipping off the raincoat JOE Hello ! CLARA hanging the raincoat up on the hook.How 's it you 're home so early , Joe ? AUBREY enters from the hall-door , smoking a cigar JOE The long threatening has come at last ! p. 167 CLARA coming forward , looking at him seriously.What ? JOE The big news . CLARA The steel thing ? JOE laughsDid they buy it , Joe ? JOE One hundred thousand dollars !  --  first payment  --  they gave me the check this afternoon . CLARA Joe , you 're not telling me the truth ! PIPER coming forward.Something about the invention , Joe ? JOE Hello , Aubrey ! CLARA coming down to her Mother 's right.Did they , Mom ? JOE and MRS . FISHER , speaking together . MRS . FISHER So he sez . JOE They bought it this afternoon . CLARA Is n't that wonderful ! PIPER extending his hand to JOE.Congratulations ! JOE laughing.Thanks . PIPER So we put it over ! MRS . FISHER poisons him with a look p. 168 JOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings above AUBREY towards the hall-door PIPER turning and following him.No kidding ? JOE running up the stairs.The check 's in the safe , down in the lawyer 's office . PIPER calling up the stairs after him. Well , Kid , you know what I always told you ! JOE and CLARA , speaking together JOE Leave it to you to call the turn , Aubrey . CLARA running up to the hall-door.Joe ! Come here and tell us something about it . JOE calling back. I 've got to get dressed , Clara , I 'll tell you about it later . AUBREY comes forward at the left , laughing ; but suddenly he becomes conscious of MRS . FISHER 'S left eye , and his laugh freezes into a detached guze out the window at the left MRS . FISHER speaking to CLARA.He 's got to go down to see them people that bought the thing from him . CLARA coming forward to the centertable.Why , what will Joe do with all that money , Mom ? p. 169 MRS . FISHER knitting.Heaven knows , I do n't . CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? MRS . FISHER Joe sez it 's a one and two noughts , and then three more noughts . CLARA Why , it 's a fortune ! MRS . FISHER Well , he brought it on himself ; he 'll have to tend to it ; I 'm sure I wo n't . PIPER coming towards the center-table from the left.If he 's a wise bird , he 'll let me handle that money for him . MRS . FISHER pins him with a look , and her knitting slides to her lapI could give him a couple of very fly tips on that . MRS . FISHER with dangerous steadiness.He do n't want your tips ; nor your taps neither . We know about one tip you gave a man , and his arm has been in a sling ever since . CLARA picks up the " Delineator " from the table and moves over to the right to the buffet , to look at the styles PIPER That 's all right , Mrs. Fisher ; but if he 's a wise Bimbo ,  --  he 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left eye , very mysteriouslyand I 'll double that money for him , within the next two weeks ; MRS . FISHER resumes her knittingand give him an extra pair of trousers . p. 170 MRS . FISHER I guess he 'd need an extra pair of trousers , if he was sittin ' around waitin ' for you to double his money for him . PIPER Well , I 'm telling you , Mother ,  --  he 's an awful strawride if he does n't get in on some of that copper-clipping that those people are writing me about . She looks at him , hard MRS . FISHER What is it , a copper mine this time ? PIPER ' Tai n't a mine at all ,  --  it 's a mint . MRS . FISHER What are they writin ' to you about it for ? PIPER They 're writing to everybody . MRS . FISHER They must be . She resumes her knitting PIPER Prospective Investors  --  They hear a man 's got a few dollars laying around idle , and they get in touch with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have any dollars layin ' around idle , have they ? PIPER with a touch of consequence.Oh ,  --  I do n't know ,  --  they may have . MRS . FISHER stops knitting and leans towards him , stonily ,  --  her left elbow resting on the table p. 171 MRS . FISHER Listen , Boy ,  --  if you 've got any dollars layin ' around idle , it 'd be fitter for you to pay Frank Hyland the money he paid to keep you out of jail , than to be lookin ' around for an investment for it  --  in some old copper mine , out in God-Knows-Where  --  that you do n't know no more about than them that 's writin ' to you about it . She knits again , indignantly PIPER I know a whole lot about this proposition , Mrs. Fisher ; and so do &amp; lot of other people . Why ,  --  they say they can see enough copper in those rocks , right now , to keep this thing going for the next ten years . MRS . FISHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into solid rocks , eh ? MRS . FISHER putting her knitting down on the table and picking up the newspaper that JOE has left there.That 's what I said . AUBREY turns away , with a gesture of helplessness , and moves across in front of the Morris-chair to the window at the leftI read all about just how they do it , in a magazine not two weeks ago . Looking at the paperThen they shoot a lot of letters to the likes of you , and you shoot off about it . p. 172 AMY entering hurriedly from the halldoor and coming forward to the center-table.Mom , is it true what Joe sez about the invention ? MRS . FISHER looking sharply at something in the paper.Here it is in the paper . AUBREY moves across above the Morris-chair towards the center-table AMY Is n't that wonderful , Aubrey ? AUBREY nods and smiles MRS . FISHER to CLARA.I thought our Joe said it was n't in here . CLARA moving a step or two from the buffet.What is it ? AMY leaning over her Mother 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom ? MRS . FISHER reading.Mad Motorist Fined One Thousand Dollars for Reckless Driving . AUBREY glides forward and crosses in front of the Morrischair to the window at the left again . AMY straightens up and gives a distressed look at CLARA , who suggests , with a nod , that she go into the kitchenMr . Aubrey Piper , of 903 Lehigh Avenue , was arranged today before Magistrate Lister of the 22nd and Huntington Park Avenue Police Station , to answer to the charge of having diregarded traffic-signals at Broad Street and Erie Avenue last Monday evening ; resulting in rather serious injuries to Mr. Joseph Hart , a traffic-officer . The defendent was fined one thousand dollars for recklessness , disregard of traffic-signals , and operating an automobile without a license . She lowers the paper to her lap and looks at AUBREY p. 173 PIPER turning from the window , and with a magnificent gesture.That 's the law for you . He folds his arms and leans on the back of the Morris-chair , looking straight out MRS . FISHER What do you think of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffet at the right.Well , it 's all over now , Mom  --  Frank paid it . MRS . FISHER What did he pay it for ? CLARA sitting down.Well , it was either that or go to jail , Mom ; and you would n't want that , on account of Amy . She opens the " Delineator " MRS . FISHER Well , Frank Hyland did n't have to pay it  --  She sits looking straight out , fumingAmy 's got a Mother . Turning sharply to CLARAAnd you take that thousand-dollar insurance check that I gave you and give it to him as soon as ever you see him . I do n't want Frank Hyland goin ' around payin ' out thousand-dollar bills on account of this clown . She looks bitterly at AUBREY , who looks at her with an expression as though he were trying to come to some conclusion as to the most effectual means of putting her in her placeIt 's bad enough for me to have to do it . p. 174 CLARA calling to AMY.Amy . AMY from the kitchen.What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper back onto the table and resumes her knitting . AUBREY strolls over and sits down at the left of the center-table , reaching for the newspaper which MRS . FISHER has just put down . AMY comes in from the kitchen AMY What ? CLARA Here 's that skirt I was telling you about . AMY comes forward to CLARA 'S left and they look at a certain skirt in the " Delineator . " AUBREY deposits some ashes from his cigar on the little tray on the table , then sits back , takes a pair of tortoiseshell rimmed glasses , with a black-tape attachment for over the ear , from his vest-pocket , and settles them on his nose . His Mother-in-law gives him a look PIPER Was that Insurance man here to-day ? AMY opens the left-hand drawer of the buffet and takes out a package of Life-Savers . She takes one herself , then offers CLARA one ; CLARA takes it ; and the two continue their discussion of the styles in the " Delineator " MRS . FISHER What do you want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  I was just wondering if he got around this way to-day .  --  Did he leave a paper here for me ? MRS . FISHER knitting.He wanted to ; but I told him not to waste his time  --  AUBREY looks at her narrowlytalkin ' to you about fifty-thousand-dollar policies . PIPER Well , what about it ? MRS . FISHER looking at him.Nothin ' at all about it ; only the man was laughin ' up his sleeve at you . PIPER Is that so ? MRS . FISHER What else could he do ? He knows you have n't the faintest idea of takin ' out any such policy . PIPER How do you know he does ? MRS . FISHER Because he knows you 're only a clerk ; and that you do n't get enough salary in six months  --  to pay one year 's premium on a policy like that . PIPER What were you doing , handing out a line of gab about my business ? MRS . FISHER quietly knitting again.You have n't got any business for anybody to hand out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AMY moves slowly across above the center-table towards the left , picking up a newspaper p. 176 PIPER Well , whether I have any line of business or not , it is n't necessary for you to be gabbing to perfect strangers about it . MRS . FISHER getting mad.Then , you stop gabbin ' to people about fifty-thousand-dollar policies !  --  On your thirty-two dollars a week . Turning to him furiouslyI told him that , too . AMY touching AUBREY on the left shoulder , as she passes back of him.Keep quiet , Aubrey . MRS . FISHER So he 'd know how much attention to pay to you the next time you start . AMY moves forward to the Morris-chair at the left and sits down PIPER What else did you tell him ? MRS . FISHER I told him the truth !  --  whatever I told him .  --  And I guess that 's more than can be said for a whole lot you told him . She knits again PIPER resuming his paper.A man'ud certainly have a swell chance trying to make anything of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leans her elbow on the table MRS . FISHER Listen , Boy ,  --  any time you do n't like this hut , you go right straight back to Lehigh Avenue to your two rooms over the dago barber shop . And I 'll be glad to see your heels . p. 177 CLARA Stop talking , Mom . MRS . FISHER Nobody around here 's tryin ' to stop you from makin ' somethin ' of yourself . PIPER No , and nobody 's trying to help me any , either ; only trying to make me look like a pin-head  --  every chance they get . MRS . FISHER Nobody 'll have to try very hard to make you look like a pinhead ; your own silly talk 'll do that for you , any time at all . PIPER I suppose it 's silly talk to try to make a good impression . MRS . FISHER turning to him and speaking definitely.Yes ; it 's silly to try to make an impression of any kind ; for the only one that 'll be made 'll be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIPER Well , if you were out in the world as much as I am , you 'd very soon see how much easier it is for a fellow to get along  --  if people think he 's got something . MRS . FISHER Well , anybody that'ud listen to you very long'ud know you could n't have very much . PIPER Is that so . MRS . FISHER tersely.You heard me . CLARA rises and moves towards her Mother p. 178 PIPER reaching over to dispose of some more cigar-ashes.People that are smart enough to be able to make it easier for you  --  CLARA Aubrey ,  --  that 'll do . He is silenced ; and resumes his paper . CLARA shows her Mother a particular pattern in the " Delineator " Mom , that 'd look good for that new black crepe de chine of yours , No. 18 , there in the middle . MRS . FISHER But , I would n't want that bunch of fullness like that right there , Clara . JOE enters hurriedly from the hall-door , wearing a clean shirt and collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you 're always saying you look too thin ; and I think  --  Joe , tell me something about the invention . JOE crossing quickly to the hooks at the right for his coat.They telephoned for me this afternoon about two o'clock , and I got hold of Farley and we went right over there . And they had the contracts all drawn up and everything . CLARA having moved up towards the hooks with him. Well , did they really give you a hundred thousand dollars for it ? AUBREY gets up and moves around and up to the upper left-hand corner of the table p. 179 JOE coming forward , putting on his coat.Check 's in the safe , down in Farley 's office . PIPER flicking some ashes from his cigar.Joe !  --  what do you think we ought to do with that money ? JOE tries to hide his laughter , and steps down to his Mother 's right ; and CLARA comes forward and leans on the buffet JOE You know , it was a funny thing , Mom ,  --  when I first talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get fifty thousand dollars advance ; and when I went up there to-day they had the contracts all made out for a hundred thousand . PIPER And they 're getting away with murder at that . MRS . FISHER turning to him impatiently.Oh , keep still , you !  --  You do n't know anything about this at all . PIPER I made them think I knew something about it . MRS . FISHER You made who think ? PIPER The Meyers and Stevens people . JOE What are you talkin ' about , Aubrey , do you know ? PIPER Certainly , I know what I 'm talking about . I went to see those people , last Saturday afternoon , after you told me they 'd talked to you . p. 180 JOE crossing towards him , to a point above the center-table.And , what 'd you do up there ? PIPER Why , I told them ,  --  that they 'd have to double the advance , if they wanted to do business with us . MRS . FISHER And , what business was it of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ai n't I ? MRS . FISHER Who told you you were ? PIPER Well ,  --  he 's got to have somebody tend to his business , does n't he ?  --  He 's only a lad . MRS . FISHER Well , he does n't need you to tend to his business for him  --  He tended to his business long before he ever saw you . PIPER He never landed a hundred thousand dollars , though , till he saw me , did he ? JOE Well , what did you say to them , Aubrey ? PIPER Why ,  --  I simply told them that your Father was dead ,  --  and that I was acting in the capacity of business-adviser to you : and that , if this discovery of yours was as important as you had led me to believe it was , they were simply taking advantage of your youth by offering you fifty thousand dollars for it . And that I refused to allow you to negotiate further  --  unless they doubled the advance , market it at their expense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He flicks more ashes from his cigar p. 181 JOE Well , did they know who you were ? PIPER I told them  --  that I was head of the house here ; MRS . FISHER grips the edge of the table , threateninglyand that I was also connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad . MRS . FISHER It 's too bad they did n't know what you do down there ; and call your bluff . PIPER I beat them to it ; I called theirs first . He strolls towards the left , with a bit of swagger JOE Well , I certainly have to give you credit , Aubrey ; that 's the way the contract reads . PIPER strolling back again. I told it to them ; and I told it to your lawyer , too . JOE I 'll have to give you a little present of some kind out of this , Aubrey . PIPER dismissing the suggestion with a touch of ceremony.You 'll not give me any present , Joe ;  --  give it to your Mother . He strolls over to the left againShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward at the left of the Morris-chairAmy ,  --  have you got the financial page there ? p. 182 AMY handing him the newspaper.Is this it , Aubrey ? PIPER taking it.Thank you . He crosses in front of her to the chair at the left of the center-table and sits down . AMY gets up , looking at him wonderingly AMY Aubrey , you 're wonderful ! PIPER setting himself to look over the bond market.A little bit of bluff goes a long way sometimes , Amy . AMY Is n't he wonderful , Mom ? MRS . FISHER prepares to resume her knitting MRS . FISHER after a long sigh.God help me , from now on . The curtain descends slowly , with AMY standing lost in admiration of the wonder of AUBREY . When the curtain rises again AUBREY is reading , MRS . FISHER is knitting , CLARA is sitting reading the " Delineator " , over on the arm of the arm-chair at the right , JOE is putting on his overcoat and hat at the mantelpiece-mirror , and AMY is sitting in the Morris-chair at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
