Before them bowed Paderewski , come back to Rome for the first time in 28 years . Mendelssohn , Beethoven , Schumann , Liszt he played ; after every number , a storm of clapping . At the concert 's end , the Queen Mother herself stood up , smiled graciously at the pianist . <P> Next day , he went to the Vatican , called on Pope Pius .
