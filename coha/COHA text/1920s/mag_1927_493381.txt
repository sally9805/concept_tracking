The Week PRESIDENT COOLIDGE 'S repetition of his refusal to " run " for the presidency leaves the situation just as it was before , except in one import- ant respect . He is apparently still willing to accept the Republican nomination , if it is offered to him by a practically united party without a contest , but he will not have it on ally other terms . There is con ' 1equently now no reason why a member of his cab , Illet should not admit to being a candidate and do what he can to recruit delegates . There is also no reason why such a man should not tell his fellow - Republicans where he would stand , as President , 9,11. controverted issues . We trust that Mr. Hoover , for instance , will soon adopt this course . ' The re- htsal of Mr. Hughes , also , to " run " for the nomi-nati9n leaves to Mr. dear field in the East Hoover a comparatively ast and in the South . He ? vill .1 with no one against him except a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but will have to overcome opposition in the West , ) 3 gt he  - -  e . se ms to be developing more strength in that eglon ... than the wise men suspected . If Senator Norris puts in his claim for progressive delegates in opposition to Lowden and Dawes , it ought to help Mr. Hoover , who might be induced thereby to emphasize his own somewhat negative progressive propensities . In any event , he is much the best candidate whom the Republicans have any disposition to nominate , and , if nominated and elected , he would restore to the Washington government sonic of the initiative which it possessed under one or two of 14r . Coolidge 's predecessors . THE most formidable obstacle to Mr. Hoover 's nomination will not be any of his frank opponents , but the reluctance of many of the leaders and rank and file of the party to exchange a safe bet like Mr. Coolidge for some much more chancy successor . Thousands of them will hang back and refuse to commit themselves to any candidate in the hope that the Coolidge myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible magic . If , by the first of May , neither Mr. Hoover nor any other candidate has developed a sufficiently preponderant strength , and if it begins to look as if there would be a sharp and perhaps a prolonged fight in the convention before anybody is nominated , these tacit Coolidgeites will begin an underground movement in favor of nominating Coolidge without a contest , which might succeed . Those of us , conse- quently , who would rather see Hoover nominated than Mr. Coolidge renominated hope that Mr. Hoover will begin an aggressive open campaign for delegates and popular support . He is fighting the Coolidge myth as well as Lowden and Dawes , and his best tactics is to be aggressive ? that is , to arouse in the Republican party a positive desire to nominate as President a man with more momentum and a better direction to his life and mindthan. has Mr. Coolidge . E now harvest the fruits of Geneva . It is pr &; dieted that the Navy will ask an appropriation of a billion dollars in five years , the items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarines , eighteen destroyers and four new battleships . It is unlikely that Congress will approve this staggering total ; the navy men have learned to ask for a great deal and then accept as much whittling down as they are forced to . It is also likely that much of this is a paper program intended to give the United States a better bargaining position in any future naval conference . Even if it were carried into effect in its entirety , we should not have exceeded parity with Great Britain , nor violated the ten-year Washington agreements of 1921 . Yet it remains true that the building program of the United States is likely to be substantially larger than it would have been if the Geneva conference had been a success . We have enough ships now for every conceivable purpose except a war with Great Britain . Despite their repeated denials that such a thing is " thinkable , " our naval men are thinking of nothing else . THE League 's victory in the Polish-Lithuanian ' dispute is a substantial one , though not as heaven-shaking as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war between the two countries is to come to an end . All the questions at issue between them are to be investigated and , if possible , solved , by the League . On the surface , this represents a victory for Lithuania , which wants to get Vilna hack , and lives in terror of being gobbled up in toto by Poland . On the other hand , Pilsudski would hardly have dared to indulge in such a coup without first getting the consent of France . What has happened is that the League has done publicly what France and England have , on several occasions , done secretly behind the scenes . MASSACHUSEI I S , which never admitted during the Sacco-Vanzetti case that its judicial system was faulty , now takes steps to remedy the very defect which cost those men their lives . The Judicial Council of the state , an official body appointed to study the organization , procedure and practice of the courts , and recommend changes , has advised that the Supreme Judicial Court should be given the same right enjoyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance ? to review facts as well as law . Says the report : A single judge of the Superior Court now presides over murder trials and passes not only on questions of law involved in the trial of the indictment , but upon mixed questions of law and fact arising on motions for a new trial . The Supreme Judicial Court on appeal passes only on questions of law . As the verdict on such an indictment involves the issue of life and death , we think the responsibility too great to be thrown upon one man . If he errs in any matter of discretion as distinguished from law , the result is irreparable . Even if he is right , his decisions may be challenged , especially in a time of public excitement and there is no tribunal to establish the fact that he is right . It is vital that our Courts do justice ; it is also vital that people know that they do justice . While the Supreme Court may determine that , as matter of law , there was no evidence of guilt sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet if there was such evidence it is beyond the power Of the Supreme Court to pass upon its weight and to hold that the verdict of the jury was not justified upon the facts . It is true , the Council goes on to say , that ' decisions of the trial judge upon matters of discretion may be reversed if there has been what is called an " abuse " of discretion , that is to say if " no conscientious judge acting intelligently could have honestly taken the view expressed by the trial judge . " . ( See opinion of Wait , J. , in Commonwealth v. Sacco , Mass . Adv . Sh . 1927 , pp. 626-627 . ) It is needless to say that such an abuse will so rarely be found by the Supreme Court to have existed that there is 110 real appeal from that judicial act . It follows that the final decision of many of the most important questions which arise in connectio . with a murder trial , as in other cases , is committed so far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court . An unjust decision by hire upon such a question can be redressed by the governor and council alone , upon an application for a Par ' don or commutation of the sentence . From no source has come a stronger indictment of the judicial system under which Sacco and Vanzetti were done to death than this one penned by an official body of the state of Massachusetts . It rings as an ironic requiem across their graves . What now becomes of the statements of Dean Wigmore and others that Massachusetts procedure as it stands is altogether adequate to insure justice ? THE Senate could hardly do otherwise than to in ' vestigate the charges which have been made by the Hearst newspapers in a series of documents which they claim were taken from the Mexican archives ' The latest allegation , that $1,200,000 had been paid as bribes to an intermediary supposed to rep ? resent four United States Senators , was too serious to be overlooked . We hope the special committee will not rest until it has got to the bottom of the whole business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the allega ' tions made by Mr. Hearst are : That bribes of $25,000 each were paid to the editors of two American magazines , and $50,000 to the editor of a feature service . That $100,000 was sent to the British coal That $100,000 was sent to Russia and $50 , more to the Chinese Nationalists . whereby That a treaty was proposed to Japan v ; 4.  --  id Japanese emigrants to Mexico and Nicaragua . iv " for be aided on condition that they would bear arms Mexico . That a secret treaty was made with . Sacasa undeari which he repudiated the plan for an American cP through Nicaragua . Whether these documents arc genuine is for the Senate committee to say . Some of the earlier ones , stating Mexico was supporting the Sacasa revolution , sound fairly probable . Others seem fantastic . It is particularly hard to believe that if anything of the sort indicated were going on , President Calles would have left a complete , open and official record of it in the files , where it could be stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the documents up to the time the Senate committee stepped in . This was Dr. Ernest Gruening , editor of the Portland , Maine , Evening News , whom the Hearst documents accuse of having been Calles ' go-between with the British miners . Dr. Gruening denies all the statements about himself , categoric- ally . He has brought one suit for $500,000 for libel against the New York American , and announces similar suits against all the other papers which printed the allegation . Since this develop ' nlent , Mr. Hearst has adopted , the timid device of : Printing the documents with the names left out . We take it for granted the Senate will force him to supply all omitted names and either prove his allegations or retract them . TWO young Italians are on trial in New York City in a case which many persons believe threatens a Parallel to the Sacco-Vanzetti tragedy . Their names are Calogero Greco and Donato Carillo , and the crime of which they are accused is the murder of two other Italians , Joseph Carisi and Nicholas Amorroso , members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1927 . Those interested in the defense charge that efforts are being made by Italian Fascisti resident in the United States to railroad Greco and Carillo to the electric chair . The one eye-witness of the murders ( which took Place on an elevated railway platform ) was a fifth Italian named Caldora , a Fascist and a friend of one of the murdered men . It is said that the strong- ! St Pressure has been brought upon Caldora to per-Aire himself and identify Greco and Carillo as the C urderers , though he insists they were not present . riting in his anti-Fascist newspaper , Il Martell ? , do Tresca charges that the Fascist League of America is seeking a conviction of Greco and Ca- tillo by fair means or foul , in order to satisfy Mussolini 's demands for vengeance . Tresca also enatgcs the Fascist organization with responsibility meeting a bomb explosion which killed two men at a j Tl " ting of anti-Fascists in New York a year ago . trie. invites the Fascists and Count Thaon di Revel , h e ! r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proofs which he claims to have may be made a part of the Curt record . The Greco-Carillo defense is being at by Clarence Darrow , who has associ- jecl with him Arthur Garfield Hayes and Isaac iJnorr. - It is to be hoped that , whatever the out- oe , no doubt may be left that justice has been . America can not afford another Sacco-Vantragedy . GOVERNOR SMITH has suggested to the New York State Crime Commission a drastically different system for dealing with persons convicted of a felony . He would set up an expert board , whose members would receive high salaries , to determine the sentences in these cases . They would examine the men and decide whether they should go to the penitentiary or an insane asylum ; and in the former event , what the term of imprisonment should be , and whether parole should be granted . This suggestion is , in general , in line with the best thought of experts in penology and abnormal psychology , who agree that what can best be done with any prisoner should only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is opposed by those who support harsh , automatic measures like the Baumes laws , and call the alternative method " coddling . " The Governor 's suggestion is , of course , only a stop-gap . Our system of criminal prOcedure needs revision from top to bottom . We need a new concept of the aims of justice , and a much better quality of personnel in the lower courts . The psychiatrist ought to come upon the scene far earlier than Governor Smith proposes ? indeed , as soon as an arrest has been made . However , his suggestion gives the quickest and least expensive way of doing away with the worst of the present evils . NO more shocking instance of judicial inhumanity has been seen in years than the case of Russell Tremain . As our readers will remember , two years ago Russell , then aged nine , was taken from his parents , Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Tremain , by order of Judge W. P. Brown of Bellingham , Washington , on the ground that they were unfit to have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect , they refused to permit him to salute the flag , which is compulsory for all public school children , under a state law . For two years , Russell has not seen his father and mother , and for much of that time they have been kept in ignorance of his whereabouts . We are glad to report that this outrageous injustice has now been brought to an end . Judge E. E. Hardin of the Superior Court has overturned Judge Brown 's ruling , and issued an order restoring the boy to his parents . He will probably be put in a private school where flag exercises are not required . This common-sense solution might have been reached two years ago , and the state of Wash , ington spared a world-wide ignominy had not the sadistic impulses of the officials smothered their sense of justice . THE cases of Smith and Vare provide room for an honest difference of opinion among honest men . They obtained their nominations by the expenditure of vast sums of money , and there is no doubt that morally they are unfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no proof , such as a court could accept , that actual fraud was committed ; and the Supreme Court in 1921 declared unconstitutional the law limiting the sum spent in the effort to obtain a nomination . Section 5 of Article I of the Constitution says that " each House shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members , " but those who believe Smith and Vare should be seated argue that this clause refers merely to the questions of honest elections and proper technical qualifications . Their contention is that the people of any state have a right to send to the Senate whomever they please . If , after the scandalous expenditures in the primaries were well known , the voters of Pennsylvania and Illinois still preferred Vare and Smith , and properly elected them , the Senate has no right to nullify the voters ' selection . If it were to do so , the precedent thus created would be a dangerous one , since a future Senate might reject a properly elected man on the ground of radicalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of these arguments , the New Republic nevertheless believes that wise public policy requires that the Senate should reject Smith and Vare . The most pressing public ques-. tion in the United States today is control of public institutions by wealth . Vast expenditures , whether in primary or election , mean that political place is in fact bought , even though no actual fraud may be committed . This fact forced Newberry out of the Senate , though he spent only $195,000 as against Smith 's $300,000 and Vare 's $785,000 . It is difficult to see how the precedent created by a refusal to accept such political debauchery could be used against someone who was obnoxious to the majority of the Senate because of his political views . But in any case , it is a risk which , in the New Republic 's opinion , must be taken . If Smith and Vare were seated and allowed to serve , all bars would then be down . Any millionaire , or tool of millionaires , could buy his seat , merely being careful to make his heaviest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
