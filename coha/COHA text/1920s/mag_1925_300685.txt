There have been three major plans afoot for paying permanent tribute to the name and memory of Woodrow Wilson : <P> 1 ) The Woodrow Wilson Foundation , which some time ago raised some $800,000 . <P> 2 ) The Woodrow Wilson Birthplace Memorial Association , which plans shortly to raise $500,000 for a memorial to the late President at his birthplace in Staunton , Va . <P> 3 ) The National Woodrow Wilson Memorial Association , which has been planning to raise $5,500,000 to erect a Wilson Memorial University across the Potomac from Washington . <P> On the last of these the spotlight of unpleasant publicity last week centered . It was discovered that this association was headed by one A. Moulton Pettey , an income tax auditor in the Treasury , and that its drive for funds was headed by a professional promoter , one A. Winslow Lowell , working on commission . It appeared further that Mrs. Woodrow Wilson and close friends believed that the enterprise would be a failure and left the project strictly alone , although saying nothing . Mr. Pettey did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ( as a stenographer ) had taken down a speech he made . Promoter Lowell had never even seen Woodrow Wilson . How the sum of $5,500,000 was fixed upon and exactly how it was to be spent were points the two promoters did not make clear , except that they felt sure there was to be a university . It does not , however , appear that they planned to do anything dishonest . <P> But they sent out letters inviting prominent men to become patrons of the movement , and the prominent men lent the use of their names . There were 16 governors and eight senators , several representatives and other notables . Senator Copeland of New York , Senator McNary of Oregon , Secretary of the Navy Wilbur , James W. Gerard , Brigadier General Herbert M. Lord ( Director of the Budget ) , William Green ( President of the American Federation of Labor ) , Major General John L.

Walker of New York City , Senators Ferris , Fletcher , Robinson of Arkansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlight of publicity was turned on , the resignation of the worthies began to flow in . Secretary Wilbur resigned when he " came to doubt the enthusiasm of the people who should have been most interested . " Senator Copeland resigned saying he had decided on a course which he had " contemplated for several weeks . " Senator McNary , when informed of what was happening , exclaimed : " I make it a practice of investigating things eventually . It is not my habit to be associated with matters in which fraud or impracticability appears . Of course , I shall investigate this . " <P> Several others did likewise . Only Representative Frederick N. Zihlman of Maryland hesitated publicly to resign . It was said officially on his behalf : " He is ready to resign , but thinks the association will break up anyway and his resignation now might appear unsportsmanlike . He feels there is no disgrace in his connection as he is in good company , plenty of others having been caught . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
