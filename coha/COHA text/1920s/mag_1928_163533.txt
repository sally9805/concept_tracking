Four hundred years ago Tycho Brahe , Danish astronomer , desired silversmiths to make him a globe on which should be represented , " with exactitude , " the constellations of the stars . Silversmiths made the " undignified fanatic " his globe . It was about twelve inches in diameter ; its surface was carved with those bizarre and threatening shapes with which the ancients first identified the golden processionals of the sky . No celestial beast was missing ; goat , unicorn , fish , lion , hurrying crab crowds its shining convexity . After the death of the astronomer , his globe became famous in the country that had laughed at its inventor . A succession of noble families enjoyed its possession ; it was spoken of as " the great astronomical ball . " A month ago , Baron Ralamb , its owner , brought the great ball to Manhattan . Last week it was displayed to admiring crowds at the American Museum of Natural History . They were delighted with its appearance when they learned that its value was $108,000.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
