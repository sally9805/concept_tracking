When tens of thousands of Roman Catholics go , from every land , to a Eucharistic Congress it is not to quibble over prayer-books , nor to hold intra-denominational forensics over matters of faith or morals , nor to establish the status of the ape in history . The Catholics gather for prayer . There can be nothing controversial about a eucharistic congress : at journalistic best it provides a spectacle , is " good theatre . " <P> It was the Roman Catholic Church on parade , therefore , in Sydney last week . To fast-growing Sydney , largest city in Australia , capital of New South Wales , came many a priest , many a pilgrim . From Naples came Bonaventura Cardinal Cerreti , witty envoy of the Pope ; from San <P> Francisco came potent Archbishop Edward J. Hanna ; from New Zealand came Mita Taupopoki , chief of the Arawa tribe of Maoris , once the most warlike tribe in New Zealand ; from Manhattan came Bishop John J. Dunn , who brought greetings , regrets from Patrick Cardinal Hayes ; from many another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Chicago in 1926 and will go to Carthage , North Africa , in 1930 , so they flocked to the 29th Eucharistic Congress in Australia . <P> High upon a Sydney eminence is the new St. Mary 's Cathedral , costing 700,000 ( $3,400,000 ) . This modern pile was dedicated on the Sunday before the opening of the congress . <P> A Catholic stay-at-home could imagine the pretentious beauty of the masses &; other ceremonies ; he could picture thurifers , masters of ceremonies , acolytes in cassocks , surplices ; be-mitered bishops , birettaed priests ; gaudy canopies , ornate chasubles , elaborate dalmatics , humeral veils ; bejewelled chalices , ostensoria , ciboria.
