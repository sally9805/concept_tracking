Marie was kissing Marie ; mother was embracing daughter ; Dowager Queen Marie of Rumania was bidding a gracious , willowy farewell at Bucharest , last week , to Queen Marie of Jugoslavia , her recent house guest ( TIME , March 5 ) . <P> Rumanians learned of the parting with dour thoughts , Jugoslavs with joy . Reason : Queen Marie of Jugoslavia carried home to Belgrade in her special train , last week , documents transferring to her a huge cash legacy from her late father , King Ferdinand of Rumania ( TIME , Aug. i ) . Generous , the bequest amounts to 80,000,000 lei ( $4,800,000 ) , a sour grape for Rumanians , a plump plum for Jugoslavs . <P> By contrast , the bequests to Marie of Rumania from her late husband , are not in cash but in the form of a life tenancy of Cotroceni , her favorite palace in Bucharest , plus barely sufficient life grants and stipends to keep the wolf a decent , royal distance from her door . Therefore , the departure of Marie of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's nerves . So serene and queenly is Marie of Rumania , however , that two days later she was confiding optimistically to correspondents. * <P> Of her palace home she said : " I hope that Cotroceni will remain a hospitable centre for those who are suffering and are in need , for those who take an interest in art and literature or who work for charity , besides being a home for my children . In short , Cotroceni will continue to be the heart of the country . " <P> Twiddling the little key to her jewel box which always hangs from her left wrist , Queen Marie continued : <P> " I wrote a story lately for the children of America , as I had promised during my visit to the United States in 1926 . <P> " When I began to write my story I experienced difficulty in finding material that would interest them . I finally hit upon the following idea- " The old grandmother in a little American house brings a little orphan child a Rumanian doll . As soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life and starts to sing Rumanian songs . The child is fascinated . Then , as if by magic , the doll whisks the child away to distant Rumania . . . . <P> " The American child and the bewitched doll , accompanied by a little Rumanian shepherd child , travel through Rumania . Rumania would not hold such charm for American children if the Queen of Rumania did n't live there . It was not easy lo describe myself , but I hope I succeeded . <P> " In the meantime , the King dies . In order that the story be up-to-date , the children find the Queen in mourning among the lilies of the Black Sea , which is not black , but blue . Here the American child takes leave of the Queen . The child awakens and recognizes its grandmother , to whom it tells its impressions of Rumania . " <P> After pausing for an instant , Her Majesty added as a potent afterthought : " I am also writing the story of my life . . . . It is a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great personalities of the day . " <P> Speaking at last of her six-year-old grandson , King Mihai of Rumania , the Dowager Queen , 52 , said : " At present he speaks only two languages , Rumanian and English . He is a very understanding child and he often blurts out the most unex pected remarks . He is good looking . . . . But whenever I see him a certain sadness overcomes me , for we cherished other dreams for him . "
