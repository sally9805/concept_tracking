Fluctuations of nearly $15,000,000 in the total value of , shares in British Royal Mail-world 's largest shipping corporation-resulted last week when Tycoon Viscount St. Davids quarreled violently with his brother Tycoon Baron Kylsant , Chairman of the B. R. M. , " Lord of the Seven Seas . " <P> Months ago the brothers ceased speaking to each other . Last week Lord Kylsant intimated frigidly that on at least one occasion Lord St. Davids had written a letter expressly to inform his brother that he would not speak to him . It was a quarrel de luxe , peer against peer , brother against brother , tycoon against tycoon-over a $10,000,000 technicality . <P> The trouble started one year ago , when Lord Kylsant ordered the issuance of another $10,000,000 worth of debenture shares . Lord St. Davids was and is one of the two debenture trustees , the other being , until last week , the Duke of Abercorn . Lord St. Davids was not informed of the new issue and first became aware of it when he read an advertisement in the Times wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week that there was nothing illegal about such a procedure , Tycoon St. Davids was grievously vexed , brooded long , and one day demanded certain facts from the company auditor . Like most auditors , this one was a reserved gentleman . His reticence , and other aspects of the matter , so enraged the noble Lord that he issued a pamphlet setting forth his grievances , announcing that he would shortly resign as trustee . <P> Within a few minutes after the booklet was out , last week , shares of the British Royal Mail slumped from 55 to 45-representing an aggregate loss of something like $15,000,000 to thousands of small investors . Things looked all the blacker because for several months there has been a slow decline in BRM securities . <P> Tycoon had smitten tycoon . The thews and sinews of St. Davids were those of the Chairman of the Buenos Aires &; Pacific Railway , Argentine Great Western Railway , Costa Rica Co. , etc. , etc . When Tycoon Kylsant decided to smite back next day , he entered ! the lists as Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many another line , also as Knight of Justice of St. John of Jerusalem . Rising to address a shareholders ' meeting of one of his subsidiary companies the " Lord of the Seven Seas " shook his impressive mane of pure white hair and solemnly declared : <P> " The purpose of this personal attack by a relative is quite unknown to me . In 40 years the companies under my chairmanship have passed through difficult periods , but I never had to ask the stockholders to consent to the writing down of the capital of any shipping company . Statements have been circulated about a possible reconstruction of the Royal Mail Company which are absolutely without foundation . For the first six months of this year the results obtained are better than for 1928 . . . . " <P> When Lord Kylsant had fully set forth his position , the almost immediate result was to send Royal Mail shares bounding up almost to where they had been before the St. Davids pamphlet appeared . Victory seemed to perch on Tycoon Kylsant 's standard , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Mail Debenture stockholders was called-a meeting which both tycoons were in duty bound to attend .
