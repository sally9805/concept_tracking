London . The transfer of Ambassador Frank Billings Kellogg from London to the State Department sets up a train of consequences in the diplomatic service . After but a few days ' suspense for the hopefuls who would have liked to have followed in the diverse footsteps of Messrs . Page , Davis , Harvey and Kellogg , the President announced the name of Alanson B. Houghton as Mr. Kellogg 's successor . <P> Mr. Houghton for three years past has been Ambassador at Berlin . In a way Mr. Houghton is in accordance with the usual type of man appointed to the Court of St.James 's . He was born in Cambridge , Mass . He was educated at Harvard . He is wealthy enough not to mind the fact that his salary of $17,500 will , at London , be only a drop in the bucket of his expenses . On the other hand , he is not a literary man , nor is he a publisher , a politician , an editor , a lawyer-but a manufacturer. * <P> Three years ago , Mr. Houghton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding selected him for the job of reopening intercourse with Germany . He did so , and succeeded in winning the goodwill of the Germans to a marked degree . Knowing at first hand the aspects of Europe 's great problems , including reparations , he goes to London with a better schooling than many men who have been sent there before him . <P> Berlin . The President , in plugging up the vacancy made by the withdrawal of Mr. Kellogg from London , thereby made another vacancy in Berlin . Again the aspirants began to count their chances . <P> The foremost candidate was Senator Medill McCormick of Illinois , who leaves his comrades on Mar. 4 because the Republicans of Illinois did not see fit to renominate him last year . A number of Senators spoke a good word to the President on their colleague 's behalf-even Mr. Borah was reported to have done so . Yet while these movements were being made toward his appointment , others of the Senator 's friends advised him against going to Germany because of the political situation in Illinois-the hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings and Mr. McCormick have a chance to take hold . <P> Another man suggested as a possibility was Amdassador Henry B. Fletcher , now at Rome . It was said , however , that Mr. Fletcher would rather wait an opportunity to go to Paris in case Ambassador Herrick retired . Besides , the President had intimated that he might go out of the diplomatic service in making a choice because the problems at Berlin were " more economic than diplomatic . " <P> Other names suggested included : <P> William H. Crocker of San Francisco ( banker and Republican National Committeeman ) , Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman ( ex-President of Cornell University , now Minister to China ) , James R. Sheffield ( Ambassador to Mexico ) , Ogden H. Hammond ( retired banker of New Jersey ) , Walter J. Damrosch* ( famed orchestra conductor in Manhattan , son-in-law of the late James G. Elaine ) . Most of these were no more likely of choice than several score of others unnamed . <P>               @ @ @ @ @ @
