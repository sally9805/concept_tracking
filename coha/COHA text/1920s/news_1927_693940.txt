txt If anyone still harbors a lingering doubt as to the extent of the influence which the Interstate Commerce Commission exerts over railroad finance he need only glance at the terms upon which the Baltimore &; Ohio invites its stockholders to provide it with $rin , 000.000 additional partnership capital . Perhaps influence is not quite the word . The Commission may withhold its approval from financial " proposals for reasons which seen , good to it , under a statute which gives it the widest discretion and practically deprived applicants of any right to appeal . Indirectly it may thus interfere with management in questions concerning the terms of financial transactions and even such matters as dividend rates , where the intent of Congress may conceivably have been quite otherwise . From the point of view of the Commission to which the railroad must first submit its plans , the offer of new stock must appear sufficiently " conservative . " It was a bit too much so to suit the present mood of investors in junior securities , as the decline in the price of B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is not to say that the offer will not he wholly successful , as it deserves to be . Purchasers of B. &; 0 . common at $107.50 a share , who will receive a return of 5.68 per cent , thereon while the dividend rate remains at 6 per cent . on par value , will probably not be lacking . But old holders of the stock , whose average dividends since the beginning of this century have been no more than 41i per cent . on the par value of their shares , naturally felt some disappointment at being tendered subscription rights having a present value of only about $2.65 each . Members of the Commission have been known to express the belief that railroads should obtain their capital as they obtain their coal or steel rails , at the lowest price the market affords . The directors of the Baltimore &; Ohio appear to have acted in accordance with that principle , though also in harmony with the railroad 's long tradition of prudence in the distribution of its net income . But the stockholders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel . In bad weather they are not only expected but required to hold the umbrella over bondholders , shippers and employes . At any rate , the Baltimore &; Ohio has taken a long wise step in the direction of a better railroad finance . If the immediate results to the stockholders arc less than they might have been with the directors in a more generous frame of mind , the former may still have hope of a better dividend rate in the not too distant future .
