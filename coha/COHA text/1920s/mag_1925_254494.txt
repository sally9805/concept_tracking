Great numbers of medicos , some wearing the conventional air of sympathetic abstraction and , on their chins , the familiar bedside Vandyke , but a surprising number of them clean-shaven , brisk , straightforward men of business , convened , last week , in Chicago , at the annual Congress on Medical Education . Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur , President of Stanford University , presided ; Dr. Henry M. Tory , President of the University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada , stood up to address the brisk medicos . He told about the struggles to get a good medical school started in Canada . Others spoke on such topics as the progress of medical education in the U. S. in the last 25 years , improved methods of teaching , medical education of the public , etc . At last someone asked the question : " Why are the doctors leaving the country ? Where is the rural practitioner ? " The discussion ambled along ; listeners caught , in its labored periods , the clip-clop of slow hoofs , the rattle of a dry axle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a buggy swaying along with reins pulling slack from the hands of a threadbare , weary man who followed where his nag took him- down the lane , away from the sombre fields , the farmhouses smelling of disinfectant , toward the city . . . . There was , the physicians agreed , a general shortage of country doctors . Reasons ? The " unprofitableness of agriculture , " the " general unattractiveness of rural life . " Said Dr. Elias P. Lyon , Dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School : " There never was a time when the entire population of Minnesota had adequate medical service . " <P> A practical suggestion was made by Prof. William L. Bailey of Northwestern University . He proposed that field service be substituted for internship , that young doctors be permitted to serve their apprenticeships as assistants to rural physicians , as well as in city hospitals .
