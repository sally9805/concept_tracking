txt QUEZON FOR FREEDOM NOW . Filipino Leader Insists Period of Probation Is Unnecessary . To the Editor of The New York Times : In one of the editorials appearing in the issue of your paper of June 2 , entitled " Keeping Faith with the Filipinos , " I am reported as " assenting to the definite term of probation named in the Fairfield bill , twenty years . " In this connection I desire to state that I have never agreed that any further period of probation is necessary to determine the capacity of the Filipino people for seif-governinent . On the contrary , 1 maintain that they are now ready to establish an independent government and that they should be granted independence now . I agree - with you that the Fairfield bill is " a departure . from the spirit of the Jones law , " because , in accordance with the promise made in that law , independence should not be deferred another day .
