txt TOPICS 9F THE MTIMES . The Webb-Loomis A Good Bill bill , amending the Has Medical Practice Been Spoiled . act , was drafted a f ter prolonged study by a committee of the New York State Medical Society , in collaboration with the State Department of Education . Its chief purpose was to enforce the registration of all physicians and surgeons , after they had demonstrated to a board of examiners under the Board of Regents that they had the requisite education . The bill was open to criticism only on account of its enormous length and complexity , but it is to be presumed that both were necessary . After the bill had left the hands of this expert committee , however , there was added to it , from some seemingly mysterious source , *be long and one short eectlon which cause it to be probable that its passage would do more harm than good . As the bill now stands it would legalize medical practice by everybody professing to use one or another form of what it calls " physiotherapy " ? meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by surgery and the administration of drugs  --  and requiring of the applicant for a license only a bertificate of training from the various schools that pretend to teach everything a doctor should know , but really do little except accept fees from aspirants who do not want to spend the money and time required for a regular course . In other words , the Webb-Loomis bill , as amended , would legalize the practice of medicine by all the quacks and charlatans who now are practicing it illegally . Naturally , the antagonism to it , which at first was vehement on the part of all the " irregulars , " now has faded away and they would be delighted if they could get all the privileges of real doctors at the expense of paying a petty annual fee . Unless the Webb-Loomis bill can be restored to its original shape , the medical profession should exert all its influence to secure its defeat . Many will see in Courage Is the calmness with No Proof which Ginum CHAPof Innocence . ? MAN made his final plea for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died an innocent man  --  innocent , that is , of the particular crime for which the Connecticut court tried and convicted him . If CHAPMAN had been a victim of tyranny , brought to the gallows for supporting a noble cause , his behavior rightly could have been called a magnificent display of courage , untainted , by bravado . Between innocence and courage , however , there is no necessary relation . Far from all innocent men are brave , and it is not true that " conscience makes cowards of us all , " for some of us have no consciences . An unusual type of criminal CNAP . MAN was , but not unusual in the sense of having great skill in his chosen trade of preying on society . His successful coups were few . A. large part of his life had been passed in jail . He did , however , have a taste for reading , and so had acquired an education unique in his class ; and he even had a liking for poetry . His manners , too , when he chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a , model prisoner  --  till an opportunity to escape appeared or could be ' made . Probably these superiorities were exaggerated because of their unexpectedness in a thief and gunman . In the same way ordinary human kindness in a king or a great noble used to get I him a great reputation for amiability . ' As a matter of fact , behavior on the scaffold tells next to nothing concerning guilt or innocence . Possibly the innocent man is more apt to make a scene than the guilty one , but even that is uncertain , and , anyway , prisonl officials have and use means of putting brave and cowardly alike in a state of calmness that prevents unpleasant episodes at an execution . CHAPMAN had a fair trial and was ably defended by counsel familiar with all the technicalities of the statute book . He was guilty or else there is no justice in our courts . Probably the proposal , in the form of a joint resolution , introduced by State . Senator Commwarrer Nxcnu. , to send two colleagues and three Assemblymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how they handle the liquor traffic , will have little difficulty in passing . Not only will it provide a decidedly pleasant trip for the five statesmen , but , it they do their work well , they really may secure some valuable information for use here if ever the Prohibition law is mitigated in the ' United States . Aa.the experiences of the Canadians in dealing with intoxicants halts been ? the subject of innumerable articles in magazines and newspapers , as well as in whole books , probably the information desired could be secured more cheaply than by the expedition proposed . The chances are , anyway , that the legislative investigators will come back from their travels with minds unchanged . Such of them as are dry will have no difficulty in findir.g facts conclusively proving that none of the various plans tried in Canada have been successful , while the wet members of the committee will be equally fortunate in discovering that all is well in the Province of Quebec .

From Kansa s ? where anything Call happen  --  there comes a tale of six children who protested to the Probate Judge against his sending them back to the care of the mother , from whom they have been taken . They say that she is an unfit guardian because she bobs her hair sad wears gayly colored clothing ! This they call " unchristian . " The Judge , while he said that he could n't go as far as that . did commend the children for having such a fine sense of the proprieties , and told the mother-that she should be proud of her offspring . , ? But she insisted that the children were only repeating what they had been taught to say by persons who wanted to take them away from her , and indignantly denied that their criticisms were justified . If these are all the facts in the case , the impression , out of Kansas . will be that those children should be not praised but spanked , . as offensive little prigs who have fallen under evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short hair or the bright colors of her dresses .
