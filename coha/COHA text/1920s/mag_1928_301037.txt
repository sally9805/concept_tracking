During the campaign , certain newspapers achieved certain types of fame : <P> New York Herald Tribune , arch-Republican , surpassed all recent metropolitan precedents in the rabid partisanship of its headlines . <P> New York World , arch-Democratic , was so close to the Happy Warrior that it was accused of telling him what to say and how to run his campaign . <P> Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News , both outspokenly Wet , under the same ownership , supported Hoover and Smith , respectively . But the Chicago Tribune sensationally denounced the Ku Klux Klan and the Anti-Saloon League as " twin calamities " in the Hoover campaign ( see p. 9 ) . <P> The Scripps-Howard newspapers ( 26 ) clung to Hoover , though he frowned upon some of their policies and ignored their demand to oust Dr. Work . <P> The Fellowship Forum , a National Weekly Newspaper Devoted to the Fraternal Interpretation of the World 's Current Events , achieved more fame than it ever had before and , in percentage , it won more circulation and showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication . From the publisher 's standpoint , it won the campaign . " Fraternal " means that The Fellowship Forum is the organ of the Ku Klux Klan and all those who believe that the Pope and Al Smith want to hang 100% Protestant-American babies from the trees on the White House lawn . The Fellowship Forum boasts that its " million readers are a unit against Al Smith because he is wet and they are ardent prohibitionists , but were he dry , most of them would oppose him on religious grounds . " <P> Regularly during the campaign , The Fellowship Forum devoted eight out of its ten pages to violent , blatant and inaccurate attacks on Al Smith , the Pope and rum - by story , headline , editorial , cartoon and readers ' forum . The doings and speeches of Mrs. Willebrandt , Rev. John Roach Straton , Senator Heflin and many a minor bigot were faithfully reported . The technique in handling campaign trends was to ballyhoo a Hoover landslide : for example , " Smith to be Most Badly Defeated Candidate Ever Running for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drunk Negro Boosting Smith , " " Kissing Pope 's Ring Insult to Flag , " " Tirades on Religion and Liquor by Smith in West Turn Voters in Disgust . " But , here and there , The Fellowship Forum would say something nice ; one week , on the Women 's Page , was a glowing sketch of Mrs. Herbert Hoover . One of the owners of The Fellowship Forum was aboard the Hoover special train on the Tennessee trip . Another owner is the Republican nominee for Governor in Virginia . <P> How many thousands of dollars The Fellowship Forum collected during the campaign to carry on its work will never be precisely known . Its drive was unceasing . One week before Election Day , Editor James S. Vance sent through the mails a " final appeal " for funds . Many of the letters were despatched to northern Republicans with Park Avenue addresses . " I want financial help , " wrote Editor Vance , " that will enable me to single shot Alabama , Georgia , Kentucky , Mississippi , North Carolina , Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a certainty .
