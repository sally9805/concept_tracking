txt New Hampshire and World Court . It were to be wished that In every one of our States the workers for our aidiesion to the World Court might emula.e the example set by New Hampshire . A committee of 150 leading citizens , Republicans and Democrats , men and women , has there been created , with Governor Winant as its Chairman , to work untiringly for the cause and make the sentiment of the State felt at Washington before Dec. 17 . This Is the more significant and is attracting the more attention because Senator Moses of New Hampshire has not been friendly to the Court . If that La still his attitude . the Senator and the Governor , both Republicans , appear on opposite sides of the question , It has been intimated that Senator Moses is weakening in his opposition , and that in the end he may vote in accordance with the President 's policy . At any rate , a respectable report from New Hampshire nays that he is not now talking against the Court , and that he has frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Ho is a shrewd politician , and we hope he Is right . But Borah and Hiram Johnson and the other irreconcilables will not yield without a stiff fight ; and whether we are to see favorable action by the Senate before Christmas , or see another long-drawn-out debate , perhaps extending over months , will depend in no small degree upon whether the friends of the Court in other States are in dead earnest and as active as Governor Winant end his friends in New Hampshire . BRADLEY STONE . Boston , Nov. 27 , 1025.
