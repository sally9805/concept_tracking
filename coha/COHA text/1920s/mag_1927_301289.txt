<P> The course of Rumanian politics is an orbit , often fiery as a comet 's tail , yet at present circular and without end . Just as the earth 's solar year extends eternally from January to January , so the Rumanian political cycle starts when M. Jon Bratiano* becomes Premier , and is not full rounded until he has resigned and then resumed that office . Therefore , politically sneaking , it was " January " in Rumania last week , for M. Bratiano had just resumed the Premiership once more . He has been absent from office-not from power-for some 15 months . To sketch the events of those months is to trace the orbit , perhaps the horoscope , of Rumania . <P> The day of Jon Bratiano begins when his valet awakens him at 9 a.m. , presenting a light , Parisian breakfast of coffee and rolls . Although punctual about this breakfast hour , M. Bratiano is , thereafter , the acme of exquisite and sophisticated ease-of nicely timed delay . " I try to put off until tomorrow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to make today . " <P> Such is M. Bratiano 's outward , dilettante philosophy of life and statecraft . The pose has deceived many . A man with so much leisure for all that art and culture have to give must be , it would seem , extremely lucky to continue strong . In a measure Jon Bratiano has been lucky . He was fortunate , for example , to be born the son of that greater Jon C. Bratiano ( 1821-91 ) who freed Rumania from Turkey . <P> Born luckily to place and power , Premier Jon Bratiano has held and builded upon both . He and his brother Vintila , and brother-in-law Prince Babu Stirbey ( intimate of Queen Marie ) control the State . They dominate Rumanian banking , oil , manufactures . Their large estates are worked by peasants in a manner all but feudal . Because they have used their power to systematically exploit Rumania , a tide of public indignation periodically rises , and before it M. Bratiano resigns the Premiership , announces that he has " retired , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a tide of resentment was at the flood . It might have led King Ferdinand of Rumania on to better fortune for his dynasty , had he dared to brave Jon Bratiano then . Instead Ferdinand I , weak , invalided , accepted M. Bratiano 's resignation as Premier without comment , and meekly called one of the Bratiano henchmen , General Fofoza Alexander Averescu , to the Premiership . <P> The General , ruthless , instantly suppressed the news organ Lupta , which had commented despairingly : " In the face of the country 's unanimous expectation that it would receive a Government which it had indicated unquestionably was its choice , it is answered again with a Government by the Bratiano family . May God protect Rumania from . . . this the King 's deed . " <P> Thenceforward the Rumanian cycle has moved smoothly-with General Averescu masquerading as a defender of the citizenry but actually obedient to oligarchs Jon and Vintila Bratiano . These gentlemen resolved , recently , to resume power , sensing that popular resentment had guttered down .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
