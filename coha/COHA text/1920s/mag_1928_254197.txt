$3,700,000,000.00 <P> $3,700,000,000.00 <P> $3,700,000,000.00 <P> $3,700,000,000.00 <P> A newsgatherer good enough to be trusted with a moderately important story , a country doctor , a law clerk , an assistant branch manager of a plumbing concern , a young salesman get about $3,700 . Anyone who gets $3,700 per year can easily remember the figure $3,700,000,000.00 because that is just one million times his salary . To remember that figure became last week a patriotic duty , because that is the figure which Brig . Gen. Herbert Mayhew Lord , funny-story-telling Director of the Budget , put down as the cost of U. S. ( federal ) government for the fiscal year July 1 , 1929-June 30 , 1930 . All the columns and columns of additions and subtractions which totalled 3,700 million were placed by General Lord before President Coolidge at Brule , Wis . <P> Principally to be remembered by patriots among all the vast details within such a total are : <P> 1 ) The 1929-30 budget is a really considerable increase over the 1928-29 , in fact , half a billion dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the John D. Rockefellers Sr. &; Jr. , have given away . And the 1928-29 budget was already a considerable increase over the 1927-28 . And , further , these increases occur , in spite of the fact that the War caused public debt has decreased , thereby reducing interest , which is the biggest single annual expense . The conclusion seen in all this by financially minded Republican Senator Reed Smoot is that the U. S. must hereafter expect the cost of government to increase . The " low " of 1925-26 ( $3,105,517,645 ) may be a " low " for all time hereafter . <P> 2 ) The biggest group of items have to do with the national debt , a total exceeding a billion dollars , or nearly one-third of all expenses , being for reduction of the debt and payment of interest on the unpaid balance . The second biggest group is for national defense , $659,000,000 . <P> 3 ) The budget does not balance . That is , the calculable revenues were 100 million dollars less than the 3,700 million dollars of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried by what they called a " paper " deficit . <P> 4 ) Some sure items of expense and some probable ones are not included in the 3,700 million . Most notable : an almost certain Post Office deficit of 50 to 100 millions ; a likely appropriation of some 40 millions for cruisers which Congress failed to pass at its last session , although President Coolidge asked for it .
