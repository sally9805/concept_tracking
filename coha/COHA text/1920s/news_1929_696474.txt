txt DISTRUST OF FARM PLANS . Mr. Legge 's Appointment Has Led to Cynicism Among Agriculturists . To the Editor of The New York Times : R. J. Cornelius , in his letter to THE TIMES about the Federal Farm Board , touched on the weakness of the situation from the farmers ' standpoint , and I think fairly represented the feeling among his class as I find in my almost continual contact with them . I differ with him to some extent on his inferences . The Federal Farm Board 's usefulness depends entirely upon its ability to secure cooperation from the farmers themselves , and on this account the appointment of Mr. Legge is so great a mistake that it gives the impression of cynical indifference to their feelings . Rightly or wrongly , the majority of the farmers consider that the general manager of the Harvester Trust is their particular head devil . It is a fact that the products of this company have averaged higher than any other commodity . The farmer has compared its ascending price scale with the descending price scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of product against the increased efficiency of motor cars , with the result that he thinks that he has been robbed . If it is pointed out that the Harvester people have shown no such profits as some of the automobile companies , he retorts that they have had greater opportunities to collate resources and get advantage of continual production than any automobile manufacturer , and that if they have not made more money it must be on account of poor management . Talk of " supermen " may be all right in a political campaign or in time of war , but that also was a mis ? take . In spite of what Mr. Cornelius ? humorously , no doubt  --  says of the stupidity of farmers , they are too intelligent to take any stock in it . In fact , I find that most of them , like Mr. Cornelius , resent it . Mr. Legge 's first statement , in which he claimed partial credit for the board as a psychological effect for the recent advance in wheat , which was caused by prospective crop failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen these shifts occur many times and have seen much greater advances with less grounds . There is no solidarity in the rural thought . Many agreed with the methods proposed and more did not . However , on one thing they were agreed , following the election : This was that whatever the administration did it would be along business-like lines . They , supporters and opponents , firmly believed in that . Now , however , the appointment of Mr. Legge , the propaganda which accompanied the appointment and the statements of Mr. Legge have aroused a cynical distrust among their leaders . The farmers have leaders , and capable ones , ? make no mistake about that , although they are rarely the political leaders that the- East hears of and from . T. BUCHAN . Fargo , N. D. , July 22 , 1929 . Newfoundland 's Moderation . To the Editor of The'New Yolk Times : The liquor-control scheme adopted by Newfoundland on July 1 seems to a New Yorker temporarily sojourning here to work so beautifully that one is impelled to describe it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet camp and the dry . The more powerful beverages are sold in stores operated by government agents . One procures without cost a permit to purchase a maximum of three bottles a week . For beers and light wines no permit is needed . It is a land of very moderate drinkers . Even the Americans soon catch the spirit . I have not seen a drunken American since coming here , and only one slightly ' tipsy native . EDMOND HEARN . St. John 's . N. F .. July 24 , 1929 . Best Record of the Etruria. 7 , ) lh ?

Philadelphia , Pa. , July 29. 1929 . Concerning Cassandra . To the L'ditto of The New York Tiottat Ting TIMES ' remarks on The Emporia Gazette 's warning to would-oe speculators contain much sound sense , and it might be urged that The Gazette 's admonitions are logical and timely . It is surprising , however , to notice that you think proper to entitle the Kansas editor Cassandra . This caption causes some misapprehension , although the name is generally awarded to any one who attempts to forecast the future . Any student of Greek mythology knows that Cassandra was endowed by the gods with the gift of prophecy but coupled therewith was the curse that she should never be believed .
