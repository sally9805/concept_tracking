FOR the benefit of those who think our Navy has no luck , we wish to report that not a single piece of equipment either sank , fell , blew away , blew up , or unexpectedly fell apart on Navy Day . THE entrance of John Paul Jones and Edwin Booth into the Hall of Fame , legitimately raises the question of New York 's comical collection of good and bad statuary . We do n't happen to know of a publicly owned statue of John Paul Jones worth looking at , and Edmond Quinn 's statue of Booth , while good , can only be seen by nurses , children , and butlers who take dogs out in Gramercy Park . A popular subscription to raise statues to the chosen few would seem suitable in our eyes . The sculptor , however , if popular , ought to know how to make a statue .

Where is the Gas House Gang ? " Only the Old Sexton can answer the bulk of Mr. Van Vechten 's inquiries , but at least one of them can be satisfied here and now . Big Jim Redmond is to be found any evening about the Roaring Forties , where he has earned a just fame as the Ziegfeld of the Supper Clubs . Mr. Ted Lewis 's Parody Club , for instance , is the property of Mr. Redmond ; and several other and minor rendezvous of the near-elite nestle under his proprietorship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middlebottom , should be so inclined , there would be little difficulty about arranging the desired meeting .

Mr. Redmond is not exactly what is known as a well read person , but Mr. Van Vechten will appreciate the tribute to his art which led several score of friends of the former gangster to send him copies of " Firecrackers " . He is quite an interesting person , Big Jim Redmond . Tall , rangy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such crowded passages as the streets along which his supper clubs are situated . One hopes the meeting may be brought about one day . Indubitably , Mr. Redmond would enjoy Mr. Van Vechten thoroughly . Wraiths ONE by one , the great historic landmarks of New York 's social and convivial Golden Age are surrendering to the pressure of commerce or ostensible moral reform . First to capitulate , were the famous rendezvous of litterateurs , bon vivants , and playboys of the Social Revolution , such as Mouquin 's , Luke O'Connor 's saloon , where the late John Reed plotted against the Wilsonian democracy and where John Masefeld used to be a bartender before the emergence of " The Everlasting Mercy " . Next came the invasion of Fifth Avenue by the Huns of Trade , engulfing nearly all the celestial mansions which flamed with life and gayety when New York 's Four Thousand was a scant Four Hundred . The most recent landmark to succumb is the celebrated , or perhaps notorious , Murray Hill Baths , where the embattled hosts of revelry and chronic neurasthenia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respite and nepenthe . Was there a bachelor dinner at Delmonico 's , Sherry 's , or the Racquet Club ? Six o'clock in the morning would find revellers moaning under the magic hands of William Guldensuppe and his staff of rubbers at the Murray Hill . Were there twenty-four hour poker parties ? Daylight found the participants sweating in the fumes of the hot room , shifting like wraiths amid clouds of steam , or being belabored on marble slabs in one of the Murray Hill 's chambers of torture , before they were wrapped in sheets and laid snoring in the lone dormitory that faced Forty-second Street . Now all are gone , the dear familiar fixtures , from the brass railed ambit which enclosed the women 's swimming pool , to the statue of the nude Suzanna  --  Symbol of Health and Art  --  that stood in the foyer . F FFICIENTLY , but not without a proper sentimentality , the auc-tioneer 's voice booms at a group of " prominent Turkish bath proprietors " , eager to seize the choice morsels of the Murray Bill 's equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Regan , the auctioneer , " are worth $1,000 , if they are worth a dime .

" Ridiculous at such a price , " counters Mr. Regan . " Do n't you realize that William Guldensuppe , the famous rubber , who engineered these cabinets , was murdered by Mrs. Augusta Nack and her lover , Martin Thorn , and that Thorn was executed for the crime ? There 's history for you ! " " Fifty dollars , " says Dr. Muller . " Sold , " says Mr. Regan , briskly . " And now we have this statue of the lovely Suzanna , " continues Mr. Regan , searching his memory for another criminal association to enhance the lady 's value . " Outside these baths , where Suzanna greeted you , stood the murder car , the night Herman Rosenthal was killed by Gyp the Blood , Whitey Lewis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becker . How much am I offered ? " " One hundred and seventy dollars , " sobs Dr. Keough , who conducts a women 's sanitarium . " Sold , " says Mr. Regan regret-fully . And so another landmark of the Roaring Forties is picked clean . " What price history ? " asks an onlooker cynically . " Oh , about $5,000 so far , " replies Mr. Regan , preparing to auction off the water fountain . Repose Y the time this reaches print Mr. Sinclair Lewis should be gazing at the southern reaches of the Atlantic , en route to Bermuda . He is to write a play there  --  a comedy of the Middle West . And perhaps , also , he will find on that quiet island , seclusion , whilst his newest novel is appearing serially in - Weekly , which publication , it would seem , submitted the highest hid among the sealed offers recently proffered for the newest of Mr. Lewis 's works ; and so , naturally , won the contract . This newest novel is not a satire at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much after the He-Man School of Literature . The opening scene depicts the hero in a canoe , fighting bravely against the forces of Nature as represented by a raging torrent , somewhere in the Great ' West . Mr. James Oliver Cur-wood 's dentist should be looking forward to a profitable time , when he shall have to repair the ravages caused by the gnashing of his patient 's teeth upon his reading this first chapter . Yet all is not lost , possibly , to those who will allege that Mr. Lewis has engaged in a piece of pot-hoiling . Mr. Lewis has further plans . He is going tu do as well by religion in the nottoo-distant future , as he did by science with " Arrowsmith " , in the not-soremote past . This last news leads one 's thoughts quite naturally to Mr. Winston Churchill , the Sinclair Lewis of our fathers , who did somewhat the same thing in " The Inside of the Cup " . Mr. Churchill , incidentally , now is living in comparative seclusion in New Hampshire ; content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eminence as as the nation 's tractarian . Rewards IN these days of dimes from Rocke -- 1- feller , it is interesting to note another of our philanthropists and his custom of distributing largess . Recently Henry Ford purchased an Estee organ for his home . After it was installed , he was so pleased with its functions that he wrote the firm asking for the names of every individual connected with the making of his organ . The organ people were glad to comply ; the list comprising nearly everyone on the pay roll . Mr. Ford then sent his check for $ ton to every name on the list , with a letter of appreciation . The story should end there , but it has to be noted that the Ford personal bookkeeper spent considerable time thereafter writing the various recipients , begging them to take the checks out of the frames and have them cashed , so that he could balance the books . Ballet TNTERESTING is the news , that , A during the coming season , the Metropolitan is to present " Skyscrapers " , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N'amiez que madame  --  Won love nobody but me. ' " ter . This will be the first of NIr . Carpenter 's works to be seen at Thirty-ninth Street and Broadway , and it will , in more ways than one , be a departure for the Metropolitan , for the ballet is impressionistic , chiefly . It has no robust plot dealing with the " Awakening of Spring " , or " The Courtships of Dido " , such as once entranced dowager and debutante alike . The Carpenter opus is concerned with making pictures of American life . Glimpses of Coney Island , the thunder of a passing elevated train , the clatter of taxis  --  these are its material . One might do worse than study Signor Gatti-Casazza 's face on the evening of the premiere . In places , outside the Holy of Holies , Mr. Carpenter is not unknown to the operatic public . A few years ago the Chicago Opera Company , during its season at the Lexington Opera House  --  which is now a Loew 's moving picture theatre  --  presented " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Robert Edmond Jones , and danced by Adolf Bohn . And , again , at the Town Hall there was a presentation of " Krazy Kat " , foot-noted , a " jazz ballet " , for which Mr. Carpenter was responsible . It has not been divulged when " Skyscrapers " will be presented by the Metropolitan , nor who will dance it , but it is known , at least , that Robert Edmond Jones will do the scenery . Curtain THERE are those so unkind as to say that the anti-climax is perfect , nothing less . As to that , if you would decide , you must needs make a tour to the balcony of the Broadhurst Theatre and sit in watchfulness at the unfolding of " The Green Hat " . You will , if you make the venture , see the curtain descend on Katharine Cornell 's anguish as she declaims , " For purity , doctor  --  for purity . " And before the echoes of that agonized cry have died , you will hear the youthful candy butchers declaiming , " Purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Talk WE went , the other day , to a warehouse far west on Fifty-seventh Street and listened to the new Victor phonograph , which , according to its originators is to revolutionize the talking machine industry . Revolutionizing industry is a common enough phrase these days . But Mr. Victor , if such a man there be , has confidence in it . He is going to sell his new phonograph at prices starting somewhere around a hundred and ten dollars , and going up . He had his machine that day in a cubicle , and he handed us over to a pleasant man who described himself as " not a critic , gentlemen , but a talking machine man " , and who admirably dilated on the merits of the new and wonderful invention . It is not in appearances , this demonstration instrument , at least , at all like the Victor as we know it , except that there is a place for a record , and there 's the familiar needle and a Victorian handle to wind it up with . The old kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride of a salesman in his wares affecting , but in this case it was . Our pleasant man patted the square , homely demonstration case as he talked , as though it were the product of his own youth ; and his words rang with the exuberance of one who has held his tongue too long . Millions , as it were , had mourned the decline of the noble phonograph ! And now ! " Gentlemen , " he said , " this is the greatest phonograph ever invented . " While not willing to say anything about the revolutionizing of industry , we will say that we never heard so good a phonograph as this one that was turned on for us . It is immeasurably better than any other ; it would be idle to qualify . The old tinniness has gone , the shrieking has gone , the shudder that accompanies Caruso at his best has disappeared . As we listened , we could plainly see the piccolo player screwing up his forehead , and the cornet player 's derby hat , and the French horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Victor is a better phonograph ; and that 's that . It is amusing to note that the microphone into which radio talkers speak , and which was developed for the radio , has been used to make the new records . The radio , in other words , makes a gift to the phonograph . Which is only just after all ; for the radio must have made the phonograph business look a little uncertain of late . Viewpoint THERE was an assistant newspaper dramatic critic ( they tell ) who , on the occasion of the opening of a musical comedy , found himself deeply immersed in a poker game , from which the condition of his finances forebade withdrawal at the moment . So he telephoned his wife and asked her to attend the premiere for him , and to make notes on her program for his guidance in writing his review . All musical comedies are alike , anyway , he consoled himself for this dereliction from duty . In due time , his wife rescued the assistant critic from the gaming table , by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman dragged himself away to write . He opened the program and consulted the notes . Opposite the names of each of the principals , he found such entries as : Pink georgette dress . Wears dinner clothes well . Gorgeous gown  --  gold velvet material  --  must be Parisian . She should n't wear green with her coloring . It was thus that the assistant critic discovered that , while all musical comedies may be alike , viewpoints are different . Joyous Color GOOD news for the apostles of the picturesque who got the elevated painted yellow , and made it not a hit less unbearable , and who think what the world needs , at the moment , is more optical stimulation . The American motor car is said to be on the verge of discarding its present sober and chaste appearance and breaking out into brilliant plumage . That the temptation , at least , is at hand is deduced from rumors regarding the coming Automobile Salon at the Commodore of high priced and exclusive car models of this continent and the other . The Salon opens November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyous color such as adorns the parrot , the peacock , and the taxicab . No more dark blue , say the Salon Solons . The new movement had its origin , of course , on the other continent , but some credit , says our patriotic authority , must be given to the Lincoln and one or two other companies , who have had a staff of artists poring over the plumage of tropical birds in the American Museum of Natural History , a staff which takes the influence of plumage on automobiles most seriously . Ten varieties of birds , it is said , will be displayed at the Salon alongside the cars which they inspired . IT is not only the exteriors that are 1-sprucing up . The upholstery is following suit , especially in the closed cars . Last year , one company reproduced the tapestried lining of Queen Charlotte 's Adam sedan chair in one of its models , and this year will see the same sort of thing , only more so . One of the tendencies , I am told , is toward much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind a dismal , taxi-like interior , because it will he leather of softly brilliant hues , and of the most marvelous glove-like finish . The Salon , be it understood , is the criterion for what the well dressed motor will wear , not only this season , but next season also , and the season after . It is to the standard car trade what a Patou opening is to the department stores . The National Automobile Show which follows it in two months is the stamping ground for all our good old , quantity-produced American makes . But the Salon is a highly international affair , at which one may contemplate the gleaming masterpieces of the custom trade , and all else that Michael Arlen 's heroines mean when they say " motor car " . ?

" Preparations ALONG with the cold weather which is now getting under way , come other symptoms of the season ; among them being preparations for Park Avenue 's Christmas Bazaar , which is offered as this year 's equivalent for the late lamented street fair . Persons who mourn the passing of that colorful and unique institution are begged to remember that there were certain obstacles in the way of its continued happy achievement . One of them being the climate of New York ; for , as those experienced in street fairs have pointed out , by the time the weather is stable , the clientele has left town . And the Christmas Bazaar , it must be admitted , does not sound like a falling off , from all data that has come to hand . The plan is to turn part of the Grand Central Palace into a miniature city , where you can buy all the lovely and luxurious objects that a real city affords .
