Every proud U. S. city has one or more public golf links where , of a Sunday morning , there is a confusion of white knickers , strangely-hued sweaters , sliced drives , flubbed putts , loud curses , impertinent caddies . But these same links have also produced groups of players whose golf is a source of amazement to the Sunday crowds and who may often be seen practising on weekday afternoons . <P> Last week , the best public linksters met on the Cobbs Creek course , Philadelphia . Police Lieut . Samuel Graham , muscular Pittsburgher , won the qualifying medal and was put out in the second round by a left-handed carpenter from Washington . But Carl F. Kauffmann , 32 , dour-faced clerk , also of Pittsburgh , retained the championship which he won last year by defeating Philip Ogden of Cleveland in the finals . <P> Two Negro players , disqualified early in the tournament , were reinstated by a judge who said they were " lovers of the game .
