IT was the year of grace 1750 , and old Mother Corrigan sat outside her door in Slattern Alley , smoking her pipe with a relish ; and ' t was a good day with her , for she had told his fortune that morning for Squire Tyrconnel , on his way to fight a duel in the Phoenix Park with Lawyer Daly ; and when it was finished , says she to him : ? ' Let you count the buttons on his body-coat , your Honour , and fix the third from the top in your eye . And when you stand up to him , say a prayer and pink him with your swordeen in that very spot , and the Lord grant him a bed in heaven , the old villain , for he ' II never be asking one on earth again . ' And as she said , so it was , and old Daly turned up his toes and never spoke more , when the Squire got him in the third button . And an hour after , Squire Tyrconnel sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound of the best rappee to be found in the Four Courts , and all for Mother Corrigan , and she was a proud woman that day . Her house was stuffed as full of money as an egg of meat ; but no one would think it to look at her ; for she had it all hid away like an old fairy , so that no one would give a thought to it . She was sitting at her door at the top of Slattern Alley where it turns into Britain Street , and she in the best of good tempers , when a lady came by with two young daughters beside her ? a tall woman , with a fine blossoming colour in her face and an air like a peacock spreading his tail and her eyes as clear as spring water . It would be hard to see a finer woman of her age in a day 's walk , and all the gentlemen going to and from the Castle must turn to have another look at the three of them . Her dress might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see she had it held up with pins and stitches , and a bit of good lace fell over it to hide the wear in the front . Also , she drew her feet under her hoop , that they might not be noticed , though they were as small as a young child 's . And so she minced along with steps like mice , for fear of showing the burst in her shoe . But for all that she held up her head like the deer in the Lord Lieutenant 's park , and her pride was enough for a queen , and too much for a poor lady walking the Dublin streets and holding her skirt up out of the mud . But it was the two site had with her that any lady might be proud of . There were never two such out of heaven ; and sure it may be believed , for the world has said it often enough since that day , and will say it to the end of time . For the elder was a sweet rogue , with hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes like a blue June morning , and cheeks like May flowers that a rose has kissed , and lips that better than a rose would kneel to kiss one day ; and her smile lit up the street , and she tripped along as light as a spring breeze . But the younger ? sure the Lord was well pleased the day he made her face , for ' t was perfection 's self . Her hair was a dark brown veined with gold , and her eyes like purple violets with the rain on them ; and when she closed her long lashes ' t was like a cloud over the stars ; and her mouth , and the soft smile , and the dimple that dipped when she laughed ? a man would stand all day to watch her and not think long . ' T is a strange thing that one girl will be like that , all beauty and shining sweetness , and another perhaps as good , ? for better she could not be in her heart , ? will be a poor sorrowful little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark ! And old Mother Corrigan saw them coming , and she took her pipe out from between her teeth , and says she : ' Halt here , my ladies , the three of you , and hear the fortune that ' s waiting you ? the way you ' 11 be ready when it comes . ' Fortune ! ' says the lady , stopping , a girl in each hand ; " t is the black fortune and the sad fortune that befell me since the day the gold ring was on my finger . And I do n't want to hear any more , so I do n't ; for if I had more to bear than I have this minute I would n't face the morn 's morrow . ' But Mother Corrigan rose up as nimbly as a woman to a dance , and she looked the lady in the eyes as if she was as tall as herself , and , ' Come in , ' says she , ' for though ' t is a poor place , the beauty of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is here your luck begins . ' So they went in , and the lady said she had not so much as a silver bit to cross her hand with , and indeed would have pulled her daughters back ; but the old woman would not have it . Leave it so , ' says Mother Corrigan , what matters an empty hand to-day when you 'll fill the two hands of me with gold when the luck comes that ' s coming ? Give me your word , my lady , and I ' 11 take it for as good as five guineas . ' So she gave her word to fill Mother Corrigan 's hand with golden guineas ; and the two young girls were standing by , their cheeks like burning roses for fear and hope , as the old witch caught rho lady 's hand , and gabbled something that was not a prayer , and the words came from her like a person talking in their sleep . High blood and poverty . Sure , your father had a crown on his head and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her hand away angrily . Then you know who I ant . What ' s the good of play-acting ? I guessed this would be the way of it ! ' I do n't know and I do n't care , ' says the old woman with a grin . ' m telling you what I see , and till this minute I never laid eye on you or yours . Do n't you be speaking again , for there ' s /10 sense in that ; but harken So she told her her father was poor and proud , an Irish lord with a castle in a bog and an old coach with the cloth hanging off it in ( litters and the plough-horses to draw it ; and that he never gave her a penny since site married , for he had it not to give . And she told her her husband was no better , but running after the cards and dice all day , so that all the world cried folly on her for taking up with hint . But no matter ! ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed for yourself that day you stood up with him in the church . ' ' A good deed ! ' says the lady , very rosary . ' Do n't you be a foolish old woman , and you so near your end . For I got nothing out of it but care and crying and pinching poverty and five children that . I do n't know how to put the bread in their mouths ; and this minute I 'm as lonesome as a widow , for my husband is off and away in the country , and here am I hi Dublin ; and if I know how to get bit or sup for them it ' s as much as I do know . ' But the old woman shook her head till her teeth rattled . Let you be easy and take what ' s coming . I sec you sitting in a king'shouse , and the walls all gilded gold , and the carpets like moss that your foot would sink into , and riches and grandeur , and everyone bowing down to the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ' s true , ' says the lady , ' the first news should come to me is that I ' m a widow ; for ' t is impossible it should happen as you say with a husband that has n't one penny-piece to rattle on a tombstone . ' You ' 11 not be a widow for many a day , and ' t is your husband 's name brings the luck . ' ' You do n't know what his name is . You could n't ! If you ' II tell me his name , I ' II engage to believe any mortal thing you tell me . ' So the three looked at the old woman ; but . site took another look at the hand as she might be reading a book , noel : ? Good-day to you , Mrs Gunning , and good-day to his Lordship 's daughter , ? my Lord Mayo , ? and good-day to the mother of the two beauties that sweep the world . ' And site clucked and chuckled to herself , highly diverted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old woman did not know would make but a short story . was said she had informants over the whole countryside , like a Minister of the Crown . They stared , for they were new come to Dublin , running from their debts is Roscommon and taking the chance to pick up husbands in the city , and there was not one there who knew them . So she took the youngest girl 's hands in hers and says she : ? ' You 11 marry the highest man , liar one or two , in England . And you'II not be content with that ; for when yon bury him , you ' Ilmarry the highest man in Scotland ; and if I sat here till to-morrow , I could n't tell you the half of the riches and glory that ' s waiting for you . You ' II have to crawl through the black mud to get the first ; but after that ' t is a clear course , and the mud wo n't stick to a duchess 's gown , young Miss Elizabeth Gunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter stars , they so sparkled ? they would put out the light of diamonds . She held herself like a young poplar and says she : ' And if you ' re right , old woman , or anything like it , I ' 11 come and see you when I get promotion , and my Lord Duke shall fill your pockets with gold . ' But Mother Corrigan grinned like a dog . ' I have n't a pocket , my Lady 's Honour . My hand ' s good enough ; but I 'll not be here when you come riding back to poor old Dublin in yer coach and six ? and now for the fairy of the world ! ' ? And she took the hand of the eldest , who was shaking like a leaf and expecting to hear of a prince and his blue ribbon at the least , and her eyes fixed on the old witch like two blue lakes with the stars dipping in them . But she shook her head . ' A great man , but not so big a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked jealous daggers at Elizabeth . ) ' A fine man , and the gold lace on him , and velvet and silk stockings , and gold buckles shining in the shoes of him , and a big house to live in , and fine clothes for your back , and ? ' She stopped dead , like a horse pulled up on his haunches ; but the young Maria twitched her by the raggedy sleeve . ' Go on . What is it ? I want to hear . ' ' Do n't ask me , and you so beautiful ! ' ' I do ask , and I ' 11 have it out of you . I suppose you mean I ' II get old and ugly like yourself . ' ' You ' II never be old and ugly . Them that remembers you will remember the loveliest thing God ever made when he took clay in his two hands . ' ' I do n't know what she means , ' says Int . 1 90 ? NO. 3 Maria fretfully . ' But sure some women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luck come , and how ? ' With the Golden Vanity and a woman with a man 's name . And now leave me , my three queens , and I 'll have a drop to warm me old bones and a whiff of the pipe to put the life in me . But do n't forget the old woman when the great lords is kneeling before you and pouring the diamonds out of baskets before ye ? and send the golden guineas , and ? ' So she went on mumbling and muttering , and that was the first and last time the old hag told a fortune for love and not for money . She had not long to tell any , for she died next May , and not a soul to cry for her . They stepped out into the sunshine , their heads high , and scarce a word to say to each other ; for all three were thinking of the promises as light and glittering as soap bubbles . And Maria would not spare a word to Elizabeth , for not a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was all for leading . ' The Golden Vanity ! ' says Elizabeth . ' Mama , what should that be ? When I ' m a duchess ? ' ' I do n't know , and most likely ' t is not worth knowing . ' Mrs Gunning was angry . Her fine brows were drawn together . ' Leave talking of duchesses , you silly fools , and go get the herrings for tea . I have left the children too long as it is . ' So she marched down Britain Street like a queen , for all her burst shoe , ? a shabby street it was for such ladies , ? and the two walked off to Fishmonger 's Alley , and not a head but turned to look at them . ' Faith , they ' re goddesses and no mistake ! ' says gay Mr Councillor Egan , on the way from the Law Courts , with his mulberry face and his mulberry velvet coat . " I was to Lawyer Curran he said it , and in a small city like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Goddesses from that time . Old Corrigan 's words gave them courage for a while ; but what can hold up against a diet of herrings day in and day out ? And that was all the poor lady could give her family . What was she to do ? Mr Gunning had took himself off to Castle Coote , his beggarly place in the country , where he could dice and drink in peace with the neighboring squireens , and live off claret and the skinny fowls that pecked about the avenue ; and she had the weight of the children on her spare shoulders . ' T was about this time that young Harry Lepel , the first man they met , in a way of speaking , fell in love with Elizabeth , the younger . The way it happened was this . She was walking down Mount Street with Maria , and she let fall her purse , and nothing in it but a pocket-piece to save her gentility . Harry was strolling off to my Lord Cappoquin 's , from mounting guard at the Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square ) ; and indeed Mr Lepel was as fine a figure of a young man as a girl could wish to see , in his regimentals all laced with gold and his handsome head above them ? a brown man with dark eyes . And seeing a young madam drop her purse , he stooped for it and , coming up behind them , saluted very stiff and offered it , and the two turned and looked him in the face . ' T is certain a man might come up a thousand times behind a woman 's back and not be startled as Harry Lepel was when he saw them ; for there never was , nor will be , two such sisters . ' T was like a battery suddenly unmasked ; and what chance ' had the poor devil that was marching up to it like an innocent ? The only thing he could do was to surrender at discretion ? but to whichlady ? That was the trouble . Elizabeth Gunning settled it for him . ' I thank you , Sir , ' says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she was one that smiled with her eyes as well as her mouth a golden sunshine that the heart opened to naturally . He was stuttering and stammering . Madam , I thank you for the happiness of touching anything your hand hath blessed . ' ' T was sudden , I allow ; but then , so too was her beauty . At all events , he dared no more , not having the courage , though all the will , to linger , and was turning off when a queer thing happened . But ' t was to be . A drunken poltroon of a bargeman was coming up from Liffey-side , lurching and yawing like a Dutch hooker in a gale ; and seeing them in a little bunch on the cobblestones , he took an anger at them in his wooden head , and , whether purposely or not I know not , but he elbowed up against Miss Maria and drove her into the dirty kennel ; and she gave a faint scream , for her shoes were destroyed with the mud , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what does Mr Lepel do but let drive straight from the shoulder at the offender , and in a minute the shoes and the lady were out of the kennel and the bargeman lying there as snug as snug , and the oaths he let out of him blackening the air like a flight of crows . So Mr Lepel , smiling with set lips like a picture , says to the girls : ' Ladies , permit site to escort you to your home . ' T is much to be regretted the streets are not safe for beauty unattended , though to be sure I have the happiness to profit by the circumstance . I trust it hath been no shock to your sensibility ? ' And , indeed , tears had gathered in Elizabeth 's eyes ; but Maria was laughing like a Hebe , and looking up in his face the blue-eyed lovely rogue ! ' We thank you , Sir . ' T is what our own brother had done had he been more than five . But while he is in the nursery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Madam , I would not willingly remain a stranger , ' says Mr Harry , very eager , and touching his cocked hat . ' Permit me to present myself for want of a better introducer . My name is Harry Lepel . ' ' I thank you , Sir . ' T will be remembered with gratitude . May we now bid you farewell ? ' Miss Maria sank down , in a curtsey so well devised that it showed the littlest foot in the world , save only Elizabeth 's . A fortunate bootmaker later was to make five guineas an afternoon by showing their shoes at a penny a head to the mob that gathered to stare at them ; but that time was not yet come . Mr Lepel spoke earnestly : ? ' Madam , you ca n't suppose ? ' t is not possible I can permit you to return alone after such an adventure . The sun sinks and the streets are mighty ill lit . If my company is disagreeable , I can walk ten paces behind ; but otherwise ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek : ' The company of our protector ca n't be disagreeable ? ' t is a favour . But , Sir , I will be frank with you : we are in Dublin incognita ; our lodging is not equal to our pretensions to birth ; and in short ? ' She hesitated , with her eyes dropped and the lashes like night upon her cheek . The crimson bow of her upper lip trembled ? a seductive picture of troubled beauty . Anyhow it did Mr Harry 's business for him . He could no more have tore himself away at that moment than he could have embraced the bargeman swearing blue murder at his feet . ' Madam , these are misfortunes that may happen to the greatest , and ' t is easy seen that in your case breeding and birth combine with ? beauty . Is it indiscreet to ask the name of the ladies I have the honour to address ? ' " T is very indiscreet , ' says Miss Maria , with one of her bright side-glances ; ' but yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from so kind a friend . ' Elizabeth spoke eagerly . ' Our name , Sir , is Gunning , and we are granddaughters to the late Viscount Mayo and nieces to his present Lordship . And when I add that our parents have fallen into poverty , you will comprehend ? ' Her voice paused on a silver note , which had the beginning of a sob ; and when Elizabeth saddened , the world must sadden with her , so lovely were her long eyes and the drooping head . Pity poor Mr Harry ! Talk of Scylla and Charybdis ? he stood between the Sirens , and could he have halved his heart ( and many men have that power ) , one half had gone to either charmer . ' Madam , ' says he tenderly , ' I feel for your sorrows more than I can express . Might I but have the happiness to be presented to your mama ; for ' t is the most prodigious circumstance ? I am the son of Sir Francis Lepel of Tarring-ton in Yorkshire , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . His Lordship stood second to my grandfather in his famous duel with Lord Ayrshire thirty year since . My name will not be unknown . Permit me ? ' And again he saluted , very gallant , and the three proceeded down the street , the girls on thorns for thinking of the dingy rooms , and their mother down-at-heel , and the everlasting herrings sizzling on the grate , and Lucy and Kitty screaming for their supper . ' 1 ' was thinking thus that Maria touched Elizabeth 's arm , as much as to say : ' Shall we let him go ? ' For indeed these girls had a perfect language of signs between them , elaborated in the shifts and devices of their life ; and Miss Maria , at least , was an accomplished little schemer . But Elizabeth responded not to the pinch . Why , Sir , ' says she sweetly , ' the name is indeed familiar . Sitting on his Lordship 's knee , often have I heard him discourse of Sir Francis . You are no stranger . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My sister and I are debarred from all the pleasures of our rank , and our only concern is how to lighten our mama 's burden if we could . ' F is this makes us hesitate , for we ca n't offer you the hospitality we would . ' Name it not , Madam , I entreat , ' says Mr Harry , trying to look into those too seductive eyes . ' God forbid I should add to your anxieties . But had I the happiness to know your mama , whose beauty half Ireland knows by repute , sure I might be permitted to open the way to some pleasures . There is , for instance , a Birthnight ball to be celebrated at the Castle ? ' ' Sir , you are all goodness , but gentlemen understand little of the difficulties of poor young ladies of quality . How should they ? We have no dresses fit for the eyes of his Excellency . Even shoes ? ' She permitted a foot to appear beneath the edge of her petticoat and ambushed it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , Madam . But since that little marvel of a foot recalls Cinderella 's , permit me to say that a fairy godmother smoothed the way for that young lady to a certain ball , and there she met the prince whose throne she afterwards shared . ' There are no fairies in Dublin , Sir . ' Her voice was like flowing honey , while the little foot so commended was bestowing a sharp kick upon the fair Maria , and thus it said : ' Run ahead . Turn the corner and run like a lamp-lighter , and let mama know what is toward . Hide the herrings . Bundle the children to bed . Fling mama 's Irish lace over her head . I can hold him fifteen minutes . Speed ! ' ' T is much to be said in one kick , and it takes a woman to say and a woman to hear ; but Miss Maria was a woman , though but eighteen . She smiled like Truth 's self . Sister , if ' t is not disagreeable to you to spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flaherty 's , and will go forward and meet with you at our door . Excuse me , Mr Lepel . My sister is a slow walker and I a swift . I knew not ' t was so late . ' Off went Miss Maria . Turning the corner , she picked up her petticoats and legged it along like a hare at dawn . It may be thought that the acquaintance ripened in those fifteen minutes , which doubled into thirty . Elizabeth 's step was slower , her voice more musical , even as a nightingale sings her sweetest to the moon . The shade of my Lord Mayo might hover about them to safeguard propriety , but Mr Harry drew as near as the rampart of the lady 's hoop would permit , bending his head to catch her murmurs , and his nostrils inhaling the faint perfume of silken hair rolled back from the whitest browns the world . They made a pair that many would have remarked , but for the streets . Maria awaited them at the shabby door in Britain Street . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should scold me for leaving you ; and indeed I am but just arrived , ' says she demurely . And since she had not entered , ' t was singular how neat was the appearance of that clingy room ; foe ' t was dingy , do what you would . The fire burned brightly , and if there was a delicate odour of herrings and onions , ' t was the worst could be said , for none were to be seen . Indeed , a rich perfume fought with it , as if a hasty hand had dashed the odours of Araby here and there to discourage the herrings . A large velvet cloak , the worse for wear , disguised the rents of the sofa , whereon sat Mrs Gunning , majestic in another of faded purple satin , beneath which her dress remained conjectural . A noble square of Limerick point was flung over her head and hung veil-like by each ear ; and , indeed , with the little cherub Lucy at her feet , she might have sat for an aging Madonna . Kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and sure the picture was homelike , if you studied the handsome lady rather than the ragged chairs . ' T was the best they could do , poor souls , in fifteen minutes , and wonderful in the time . ' 1 ' is women for quick thinking and quick acting where men are concerned ; and , indeed , the look of astonishment Mrs Gunning gave as the three entered was inimitable , though already she had every particular set down in her mind . She swept the stateliest curtsey , and cast a rebuking maternal eye on her daughters ere she addressed Mr Lepel . But , when explanations were made , how did her brow clear and a fair-weather smile efface the frost ! She welcomed him with cordial kindness , with such reminiscences of his family as warmed his heart ; and though no hospitality was offered save one , ? a bottle of generous claret in a silver cup enriched with the Mayo arms , ? ' t was given with such good-will , and served by so lovely a cup-bearer , the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it worthy of the three ladies who tendered it . He toasted them one and all in turn , and if his bow to Elizabeth was a little lower , that circumstance did not displease Mrs Gunning , ' I leave you to judge , Mr Lepel , ' says she , what it costs a mother to see her dear ones exiled from all the little gay scenes where it would become them to appear . But what can I do ? My father 's grandchildren , Mr Gunning 's daughters , ca n't appear except with propriety ; and why should I hesitate to tell so kind a friend that ' t is beyond my power ? ' ' T was discussed between them all for an hour as to the Birthnight ball ; but Mrs Gunning was resolute , nor could Mr Harry dare to make the offers that trembled on his lips . He could have groaned aloud to think on the sums he wasted nightly on gaming ? one half of which would have adorned these beauties and set them free to flutter their wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-sad , told how they were promised luck by the old witch of Dublin , though she gave not all the particulars . She built not on it , she declared , nor yet did Elizabeth ; and she , a soft sigh parting her lips , confirmed her sister : ' the more so , ' says she , ' that none of us can imagine what is the Golden Vanity . Is there such a ship , to be the ship of our fortunes ? ' T is that it sounds most like . ' He shook his head . Mrs Gunning softly remonstrated : ' My dears , be not giddy , nor let your heads run on such follies . There is no such name and no such thing and ' t is impossible ? ' More she would have said , but a man came crying somewhat down the street , and beside him went another with a flambeau , that he might read a paper in his hand , and what the man cried was this : ? Let the fashion of Dublin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently to the theatre in Aungier Street the dramatic company which Mr Sheridan presents to his patrons in a new and luscious play , by name ? ' But here was the speaker 's voice drowned by a wagon passing on the cobblestones . ' What is it ? ' cries Mrs Gunning , running to the window ; for indeed she loved the play as well as did her girls . And , as if the question had reached him , the man turned towards her and bellowed like the bull of Bastian : ' The Golden Vanity ! ' The little company within stared transfixed upon one another . For the next fortnight did the three live in a kind of rapture ; and ' t is not to be wondered at , the name coming so pat on the prophecy . And sure , Mr Lepel was no less moved ; for he took a deeper than brotherly interest in all that touched them , his heart being caught that day in Dublin streets ; and if he then thought Elizabeth a beauty , it took not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out , he laid his heart and the reversion of the baronetcy at her foot , not regarding the worn little shoe that cased it . For , indeed , the sisters wore the same size , and Elizabeth being the better mistress of her wardrobe , ' t is to be feared she sought of ten for her own , to find them gadding abroad on Miss Maria 's feet and herself left to luck . " r was mortifying , and her heavenly blush was as much owing to this circumstance as to the gentleman 's ardour . However , taken by Mr Harry 's fine person and clothes ( and which was the most potent is not known ) , she accepted the heart , and he set about to inform his father of his good fortune , for mother lie had none . ' T was with inward quakings , for beauty , were it Helen 's own , is but a blunted arrow against a seasoned heart of seventy : and Sir Francis Lepel had reached that discreet age . ' T was vain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help us ! ' t is little he cared for the like . The baronetcy was poor and Mr Harryexpensive , and what Sir Francis looked to was a fat balance at Child 's the banker 's . Was the lady a fortune2 And when Mr Harry , trembling , avowed that a single doit could not be hoped in that quarter , the old gentleman , his temper as well as his foot highly inflamed with gout , swore to disinherit him if the matter went further . Poor Harry was in a sad quandary . He slept and ate ill , and ' t was provoking that Elizabeth bloomed like a rose and troubled not her fair head about Sir Francis . Her mind seemed possessed with but the one thought ? to attend the Birthright ball and , like the planet Venus , shine in her rightful heaven . And indeed Mr Harry could not fancy her heart so deeply engaged as he might wish ; for he could scarce get a word in while the two peered into the mercers ' shops , gloating on satin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn in by them , when word came of a card debt that their papa owed to Sir Horatius Blake , and the unfortunate lady received net even the pittance that provided herrings for six hungry mouths ; so that they were like to come down to dry bread , which event fairly ended all talk of the ball . ' T is not to be supposed that Mr Harry did not offer to set all the mantua-makers in Dublin to work , though ins his heart he knew his own credit did not stand immaculate . He stormed up and clown the room , protesting , voicing , exclaiming ; but Mrs Gunning would have none of it . Says sire : ' I do all justice to your kind heart , Mr Lepel , but ' t is not , because we are unfortunate , that we have no pride , and ' t is impossible Miss Gunning should accept garments front the gentleman site honours with her hand . ' And Elizabeth , lovelier than ever in grief , confirmed her mother , Maria stamping her foot like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t was a hard case . And since misfortunes do n't come alone , arrived a furious letter from Sir Francis , demanding instantly to see Mr Harry , and acquainting him that his appointment in the Guards was cancelled , and he must join his new regiment in London at a day 's notice . Sir Francis had good interest with the lady whose interest with His Majesty was unquestioned , and ' t is to be thought this event did not come by chance . Oh , then were wailings and passionate embraces on the part of Mr Lepel , Miss Elizabeth receiving them with wondering eyes . ' For London is not so far but we shall meet again , Harry , ' says she , with her angelical smile . He had preferred tears , no doubt ; but a man must take what comes his way , and be thankful . Ile , who had never before been guilty of the like , now composed a set of verses of atrocious demerit . Indeed , the first two lines will suffice : " T is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would you did not love me so ! A girl 's affections are cool and temperate , I think ? at least ' t is so with me . Forget me a little , ? though not too much , child , ? and be happy . ' It might have been her mother who spoke . ' T is certain no person ever had the appearance of sweet simplicity more than Elizabeth Gunning ; but whether ' t was wholly devoid of art ? Alt , well , shall we dissect the rose ? ' T is sometimes best to enjoy and ask no questions . The day of parting he came to Britain Street , and solemnly renewed his vows in the presence of Mrs Gunning and Maria . ' And , 0 my Elizabeth , ' cries he , : pledge me once more that hand which is all joy . Swear that neither raging seas ' ( ' t was a day calm as milk and the Irish sea like a mirror ) ' nor the brutish tyranny of man shall divide us , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises heavenly eyes , a glittering moisture enhancing their brilliance . ' Have I not pledged my word , Harry ; and if you believe not that , what will serve ? Sure ' t is you that rove and will see fairer faces ' ( frantic protestations from Mr Lepel ) ' yet I do n't doubt you . Farewell , dear Harry , and remember us when you are in the glitter of London . ' She covered her face with a handkerchief , and he took the last embrace , kissed Mrs Gunning 's hand and Maria 's , and hurried madly from the room . Elizabeth unveiled her face and folded the handkerchief for future use . ' He ' s gone , ' says poor Mrs Gunning , seeking her own ; ' and if I know where to-morrow 's dinner is to come from , for you all , I ' m ? a Dutchman ! ' They mingled their tears , and Elizabeth 's were real enough now . ' T is possible , could the matter be sifted , that many more tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly , though beauty may survive without the last , it can not without the first . There was so much of gloomy and terrible in their mama 's aspect , that Maria wept also ; and Kitty and Lucy , with the little John , who had all been secreted in the bedroom during the adieux , dashed in screaming at the tops of their voices , as if the heavens were falling ; and so sat the poor unfortunate family drowned in tears . ' T was not balls they thought of then , nor departing lovers , but simply bread and herrings . A lady came down the street , picking her way through the garbage that adorned it . Her dress was hooped in t he mode , and of a showy brocade , with much t inset terwoven and very glittering , so that the ragged children in the gutter stood , finger in mouth , to see . She had a muslin cross-over upon an expansive bosom , and ' t was finely laced with Mechlin , not too clean , and set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a clasp of paste . A large tilted hat tied beneath her chin shaded an arch and sparkling pair of eyes , which , though not in their first youth , lighted up a face with striking features and an air of easy good-humour . If her critics had accused this lady of being somewhat too good-humoured with the other sex , why ' t was perhaps natural to her circumstances and needs no further excuse . Her worst detractors never denied her a good heart , and an ear open to the lament of misery . In her hand she carried a cane of fine ebony , and altogether appeared a radiant vision of a fine woman in the purlieus of Britain Street . She paused and looked about her , bewildered . ' I declare I know not where I am got to ! ' says she , half aloud . ' And these barbarians ? ' t is hard to be understood or to tmderstand their gibberish . If now ? ' And even as the words left her lips , arose a piercing wail from across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Lucy , Kitty , and John , each outscreaming the other . Crimini ! : says Madam , what 's t his ? Is Herod abroad in Dublin ? ' The screams redoubled . She added : " T is almost to be wished he was ! ' And stood half-laughing , half-unwilling to pass on . I will ! ' says she ; and more doubtfully , ' I wo n't ! ' T is not my business . Sure I have enough stage tears and sobs to make inc distrust all I hear . ' She turned resolutely away , and halted again . Poor lady ! ' T is a lady soothing them , and weeping herself . I will ! She can but bid me exit . ' And so marched to the open door , and into the narrow passage , and rapped smartly with her cane on the door of the parlour , bringing all her natural assurance to bear . Dead silence . The screams halted , as if a tap was turned off : whoever was inside was all ears . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door , and six pairs of astonished eyes gloated on the stranger . And no less did hers on the party within ; for there sat Mrs Gunning , beautiful and maternal , with the little John 's curly pate on her bosom ; Elizabeth , lovely as the day , leaning on one shoulder of her mother ; Kitty and Lucy , golden-curled cherubs , clinging to her gown ; and Maria , like a sorrowful wood-nymph , holding the door . Sure , never was such a family , and these children seemed made of some more exquisite clay than ordinary . Lord , am I got into heaven , for I see the angels about me ! ' says Madam , advancing with a reverence lower than the paltry room demanded . ' Forgive an intruder , Madam , and confer a benefit . For being newly come to Dublin , I ' ye lost my way returning from Smock Alley , and while I called up courage to enter and ask it from any other than these savages , I heard a cry that hastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say if I can be of service to yourself and your sweet family ; for ' t is the plain truth ? I ' in dazzled as I stand , by the beauty of your olive branches . ' ' T is not possible to mistake the voice of sympathy , and Mrs Gunning. rising from her chair , curtseyed in her turn , and begged the visitor to be seated . ' Lord , Madam , ' says she , ' you catch us very unfit for company ; but so kind a heart needs no excuse , and I will be candid with you . We arc of birth and breeding like yourself . ' ( " I ' was a skilful compliment , and the lady simpered . ) ' And therefore , as a gentlewoman of quality , you shall understand my grief when I present myself as my Lord Viscount Mayo 's daughter , and add that I have not the wherewithal to clothe or feed these innocents ! You are yourself too young to be a mother , Madam , yet will comprehend a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and such is my condition ! ' She wept again . The lady applied a laced kerchief to either eye . Madam , a heart of marble must feel for you , and mine is not marble ? far from it . But sure such , beauty must open all doors . Marriage ? ' Alas , Madam , in these days of money-grubbing avarice , what is beauty ? My second ' ? she indicated Elizabeth ? ' is cruelly rejected by the father of a gentleman of birth not near so high as our own , because she has no estates pinned to her petticoat . ' Monster ! ' cries the lady with spirit . Mrs Gunning proceeded : ' And , 0 Madam , were you in want , as a lady of quality sometimes is , of a young lady to write letters , to keep accounts , and all those little useful arts such as mending lace and the like , I can truly say that in my Elizabeth you would find solid worth . She is graver than my Maria . Sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T was ordained you should walk in upon us . Permit me to ask the name of our benefactress . ' The lady hummed and hawed a little ; but not being easily daunted , she tossed up her head bravely enough ere she replied : ' Gemini , Madam ! We ca n't all be ladies of quality ; and if we could , I see not who could provide the wants and amusements of the fashionable . To be plain with you , I am an actress ? ' An actress ! ' screams Maria , all rapture . ' Sister , do you hear ? Was it not this very day I said , would I could go on the stage like the famous Mrs Woffington , and other beauties such as this lady . And then should I be happy and pour all the gold I made into my mama 's lap . ' The lady shook her head , a little melancholy . Gold ? Not much of that on the stage , young miss . ' T is found there ? true ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not . Madam . I am in no need of such an attendant as you describe , having my dresser and ? ' ' I might have guessed it ! When did hick ever come our way ? Farewell , Madam . Return to your own happiness and abandon us to our misery . ' Heartrending ! The lady drew nearer . Gemini , Madam ! You misjudge me . A woman can but offer what ' s in her power . A good word from me to our manager , Mr Sheridan , and with such faces I doubt not small parts can be found for your daughters in one of the plays to be produced here . We even now rehearse it , and the parts of Susan and Peggy Careless go begging . But dare I mention such a proposal ? ' Madam , you are all goodness and beauty ! ' cries Elizabeth . And Maria fell on her knees like one distraught and kissed the pretty hand in its black mitten . ' T was known to them that Mr Sheridan 's company was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sunburst through the cloud , for ' t was food , clothes , admiration , money , hope ? and many other charming things that set them dreaming on worlds to conquer . They swept their mama away on the wave of their delight ; and indeed that poor lady was always prone to take gilding for gold so long as it glittered sufficiently . And what , Madam , is this play in which Susan and Peggy appear ? ' ' Child , ' t is " The Golden Vanity " ? a play of a poor girl that weds a rich lord and ? ' Heavens and earth ! She could not continue , for how describe the joy and wonder of the family Reserve fled away . Prudence borrowed the wings of Hope , and dressed her face with rainbows . Crowding around the stranger , they entreated her name , that it might grace their prayers ; and she , radiant with the sunshine she dispensed , calls out : ' Why , girls , sure you have heard it . ' T is I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . I am George Anne Bellamy . ' George ! ' screams Mrs G. ' A woman with a man 's name , said old Mother Corrigan . Girls , your luck ' s come ! ' And with that falls into strong hysterics and frights them all to death . But joy is a strong cordial , and ' t was not long ere she sat up , with George Anne 's hand in hers , telling her the story of Mother Corrigan . ' T is to be supposed Mrs G. had heard that Mrs Bellamy 's heart was not marble ; but what was the lady to do ? For my Lord Mayo spent his rents five years ahead , and though his good nature would give the coat off his back , that would neither clothe nor feed her family ; while , as for Mr Gunning , that gentleman regarded his wife and children no more than the cuckoo that leaves her offspring to chance . Mrs Bellamy was all ears . ' T was prodigious , ' t was vastly astonishing , she vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had a comfortable dish of tea , with currant bread and what not ; and she told them tales of the stage and the fine matches made by Mrs This and Signorina That , and , by the time the candles were lit , they were all sworn friends . They parted with embraces ; for Mrs G. was as easy as George Anne , and the girls must needs follow the example set . She had her way with Mr Sheridan , and she returned next day to announce her success , triumphing and rattling on like a girl herself , so pleased was she with their pleasure . All was joy and gladness , and she named the hour of the first rehearsal and their introduction to Mr Sheridan , when Maria , turning archly upon her , says : ' Look you here , dearest Mrs Bellamy ! Think what it will cost us to refuse this . ' And so holds up a splendid card , thick as boards and embellished with a gilt edge and the Royal Arms and the Irish Harp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Gunning , and Miss Elizabeth Gunning to the Birthnight ball at the Castle , on the part of his Excellency , the Earl of Harrington . Diamonds were never so bright as the eyes that sparkled above it ; for the charming new prospect of the stage had quite effaced the ball , and poor Mr Harry 's trouble in securing the invitation was like to go for nothing . ' I care nothing now for it ! ' cries Maria , and Elizabeth echoed her ; while George Anne looked thoughtfully at the Lion and Unicorn guarding a Paradise she could not hope to enter . Maria made to tear the card across ; but Mrs Bellamy caught it from her hand and did not smile . Children , ' says she at last , ' you know not what you talk of . I would have a word alone with your mama . Take the little ones in your hand , and go out a while in the sunshine . ' She thrust some cream-cakes upon them , and they did so , looking doubtfully at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Mrs Gunning . Madam , you know well ' t is my wish to serve you and yours . But seeing this invitation , there ' s thoughts comes into my head that I must needs speak out . This ' ( she flicked the card ) ' is the life for the Miss Gunnings , and not the stage . ' T would scarce become me to tell a lady like yourself what must be faced there , but ? but ? ' t is much ! Ask Peg Woffington ? ask Kitty Clive ? ask George Anne Bellamy ! ' There was silence . Mrs G. stared at her , all aghast . Why , yesterday , all your talk was of pleasure and success . Sure , clear Mrs Bellamy , ' t was not like your kindness to draw on the poor things till they can think of naught else , and now so far otherwise . ' Why , Madam , I thought there was no other way . But seeing this , my mind misgives me and I falter . I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' t is easy to be seen your daughters are a world 's wonder . That being so , ' t is certain the clangers are tenfold for them . They 'll see the glories and grandeurs ? but not through a wedding ring . ' If you mean , Madam , that my daughters ? ' Mrs Gunning flamed out , furious ; but George Anne was not to be turned from her purpose . She raised her hand in a fine stage attitude . Madam , I wish vastly to serve you . Hear my proposal . Accept this invitation . ' Impossible . We have no dresses , no shoes , no equipage , and no means to get them . ' T is absurd ! ' " T is not absurd . Hear me . In the theatre properties is a fine dress for Lady Modish and two more for Peggy and Susan Careless . Not perhaps what such ladies might expect , but ? I know men . There ' s not a man will look at their gowns for looking at their faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I vow , Madam , you have so long lived beside the two that you forget what beauties they are . I wager my next benefit to a China orange that you ' II have no more care once they are seen . Indeed , your young madams are what one reads of in romances . Give them this chance , and if it fails , I 'm good for my offer ; but I ' m much mistook if you hold me to it . Madam , use your wits ! Would you have them what I wo n't name , when they may be what your old witch foretold ? ' She smiled her charming smile , and pressed Mrs G. 's hand . The lady pondered . " I ' was disagreeable to owe such a thing to a mere actress , and one , too , whose reputation was a trifle flyblown . The stage she might have swallowed , but an entry to the world where she and her daughters had a birthright ? Fie ! ' t was a very different pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be obeyed ; and seeing it , Mrs G. dropped her high tone and returned the pressure with an air of sensibility . " T was said by old Corrigan that ' t was you to bring us luck , dearest Madam , and ' t is certain you are pm-donee itself . If you will ensure us the dresses , I accept ; and , indeed , my Lord Harrington 's father was a friend of my own revered father in happier days . ' T is possible ? ' " T is certain , ' cries George Anne gaily . ' Not a word will I drop to Mr Sheridan who is a perfect Israelite where theatre matters are in hand . ' She was gone ere the girls returned , and ' t is needless to tell their wonder . They preferred the stage , yet condescended to say they would favour the ball , since Mrs Bellamy counselled it . But , never , never will it turn any heart from the charming footlights ! ' says Maria . ' What say you , sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieter than yours . I will tell you my mind the day after the ball . Poor Harry ? ' t is he has given us this . ' She would say no more , but sat thoughtful .
