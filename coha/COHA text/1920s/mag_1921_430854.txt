WHEN the white men first came to the western shores of the North Atlantic Ocean they found a people different in appearance and in ways of life from anything that they had known . These people belonged to the Stone Age . They knew nothing of the use of metal , except that , occasionally , when they found pieces of native copper , they hammered them out to make ornaments , or , in rare cases , ground them down to make a cutting edge . Cutting and piercing implements ? the points with which the hunter headed his arrow , or his lance ? were of stone or bone , chipped , hammered , and ground to an edge or to a sharp point . Clothing was of skin , and the movable habitations for the most part were of skin , bark , or mats stretched over a frame of wooden poles . There were some permanent dwellings , differently constructed in different parts of the continent . The Indians have been here a long time , so long that the tribes have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian is called one of the races of the earth ? the " red race . " The truth is , however , that Indians are not red skinned but brown ; but they commonly painted the face with red ochre , and those that first saw them supposed that this was the color of the skin and called them " red men . " MANY VARIED TRIBES Most people think that Indians are all alike and one who has been much among the Indians is sometimed asked if he speaks " Indian . " As a matter of fact , more than fifty  | distinct linguistic stocks have beer named among the Indians in Norti America , north of Mexico , and within a single stock there may be a dozer closely related languages , each unintelligible to people who speak other languages of the same stock . WE may understand just what this mean if we remember that the various European nations , as Swedes , English , Italian , and French , who belong to a single linguistic stock commonly called the IndoEuropean , speak different languages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistic stock also , there may be languages unintelligible to related tribes . The difference between two linguistic stocks , ? as , for example , Caddoan and Algonquian ? is as great as that between IndoEuropean and Semitic ; that is to say , as between English and Hebrew . Within some of these linguistic stocks are many tribes scattered over a wide extent of territory and living under widely different conditions . Thus the Algonquins ranged from Virginia north alongtheAtlantic Coast to Labrador , and thence west as far as the Rocky Mountains . How unlike were the habits of the shell-fish eating Algonquians of the Atlantic seacoast in Virginia and those of the buffalo hunters of the high dry plains ; or those of the fur-clad Athapascans who live at the mouth of the Mackenzie River and their naked relatives of the cactus grown plains of the Southwest . As all human beings try to get a living with the least possible effort , the surroundings of any tribe necessarily affect their mode of life . The people of the far North depended for food on the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their forests , and the wild fowl that reared their young in the swamps . These northern people traveled by canoe in summer and by sledge in winter , and  | occupied warm and comfortable dwellings of birch bark . Tribes living on the seacoast subsisted largely on fish and shell-fish , but killed deer and small animals and birds , and raised their crops . In the Southeast and quite generally in the occupied interior were permanent villages , often surrounded by a ring of palisades , erected to protect them from possible attacks by enemies . In the Middle West and on large rivers of the great plains , there were permanent houses built of poles set in the ground outside of which sods and earth were piled for walls and a roof , making a beehive-shaped lodge of earth which was dry , warm , and comfortable , and large enough to accommodate twentyfive or thirty people . On the great plains , and in portions of the lake region , conical bark or skin - covered lodges , of the form called tipi , were common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they could pack the rolled up bark in their canoes or the folded skins on their animals and move from place to place , camping at any advantageous point . Down in the Southwest are still found the towns ? pueblos ? occupied by different stocks of sedentary Indians who lived in community houses without doors or windows , formerly entered by movable ladders leading up to the roof , through which was the entrance to the house . The ladder could be drawn up , and , once on the roof , the people were safe from their Indian enemies . Some of these pueblos are still occupied , but there are great numbers of them that are now only sage-brush-covered mounds which hide all that remains of what was once an active , bustling , industrious community . Little by little . these ruins are being excavated , and each one reveals some surprise about the life-history of these ancient people . Far older than this pueblo civilization is that prehistoric mode of  | life in which the people built their stone houses on the ledges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies who might strive to attack them . These ruins may be seen in great numbers and extraordinary perfection in the Mesa Verde National Park , Colorado . Many tribes of Indians manufactured pottery , or basketry , or both , and others made vessels of birch bark . Of these pots and baskets there were varying degrees of excellence . The Indians had for a helper a single domestic animal , the dog . He was employed to some extent in hunting , but was chiefly useful as a beast of burden , aiding the people in transporting their possessions as they moved from place to place . Light packs were put on his back , and he also hauled the travois , which consisted of two short poles fastened together over the dog 's back and dragging on the ground on either side behind the animal . On these two dragging poles was fixed a platform and on the platform the load the dog was to haul . INDIAN FAITH AND FEARS The Indian 's life was passed in the open air and in close contact with nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild creatures that lived upon it . He was a part of nature , and better than anything else he knew nature . A close and constantly watchful observer , nothing escaped his eye . He read the signs of the earth and the sky , and the movements of birds and animals , knew what these things meant , and governed his acts by what  | these signs told him . Though a close observer , he was not a reasoner . Things were constantly happening all about him that he could not explain ? that were mysterious . The causes he assigned to account for these things were fantastic . He assigned some especial power to almost every object in nature . The sun , the moon , and the stars were persons . Birds and animals might transfer to him their power to do certain things , or when they uttered their cries he believed that they spoke to him ? and in a language that he understood ? of things that were happening at a distance or that were to take place in the future . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather he feared the power that caused them . He feared the mysterious dangers that . , surrounded him ; the arrow sent by the thunder ? the lightning ? the darts of disease that might be shot into him by some spirit lurking near a spring , or the under-water monsters that might seize and drag him down as he was crossing a lake . Because the Indian feared these mysterious things he prayed constantly that he might escape these dangers , and , in that sense , he was one of the most religious of men . He constantly implored the help of the unseen powers , and made sacrifices to them to win their favor . As with most primitive people , he believed that suffering and sacrifice were likely to win the favor of the superior powers , and the most acceptable sacrifice was that which a man most highly valued ? his own body ? and so the Indian often inflicted suffering on himself . When starting off on the warpath , each man , as he prayed for success , might offer to the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | INDIAN CHARACTER The Indian 's reputation for ferocity comes from people who have not seen much of him . He is much like other people in the world , ? kindly and friendly to those he likes , and sullen and revengeful toward those he considers foes . No injury was too severe to be inflicted on an enemy , while , for a friend , he would make any sacrifice , ? would starve and fight and die . Indian children were taught never to quarrel with their fellows , but to be always good-natured , and not to lose temper under any circumstances . In some tribes children were taught songs whose purport was that children should walk through life , side by side , with affection and helpfulness one toward another . This was the teaching , the feeling and the rule of action of an Indian camp , yet , as in every other group of people , there were differences in character among the people in an Indian camp . Some were always cheerful , kind , polite , and friendly ; others at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their lives long , while others were serious , grave , and well-balanced .  | INDIAN DEMOCRACY The government of the Indian camp was a democracy . There were chiefs , a council of chiefs , and groups of soldiers so-called ? societies of men who acted as police and carried out the chief 's orders ; but every individual was absolutely his own master . The chiefs gave orders , but rarely attempted to enforce obedience . They advised rather than commanded . The governing force of the camp was public opinion . If the chiefs declared that on the morrow the camp should move to a certain place , a band of the soldiers would see that the lodges were taken down and the people moved out ; but , on the other hand , a family , or a group of individuals , might determine to separate themselves from the main camp and to go off and live by themselves . If people did this , they were not interfered with . If fifteen or twenty or fifty men started off on the warpath under the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party might at any time leave the party and return to his village or might go off by himself . There was the greatest indi- vidual liberty and independence . Because of this independence and individual liberty the Indians never could organize , or hold together for any length of time for united action . Had they been able to organize , they might very likely have been able to hold back their enemies , and it is quite probable that today the white people would still be on the east side of the Mississippi River . Many popular errors prevail as to the ways of life of the Indian . One , given to us in books , is that which implies that the women are the laborers and that the men spend their time sleeping and smoking in the shade while the wives work . The fact is that the labors of an Indian camp were quite evenly divided between men and women , and this division was well understood . As everywhere , the woman cared for the home while the man was the provider and defender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied preparing the food , making ready the skins for use as clothing or for shelter , or packing up the family possessions if a move was to be made . The man , on the other hand , went off on the warpath to capture property , hunted for food in all sorts of weather , and was always ready to defend the tribe or his family . A ' person carrying a load on his back can not get about quickly and fight actively ; it was for this reason that the man went ahead , carrying only his arms , while the woman followed behind , leading the pack animals and perhaps herself carrying a burden .  | INDIAN IDEA OF LAND RIGHTS Until the coming of Europeans , the North American continent evidently belonged to the people who lived on it ? the Indians , and it is supposed that the white man gained possession of the continent by buying it from the Indian tribes . The first Europeans that came here and wanted to buy a piece of land naturally supposed that the Indian 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man held and that if a tribe owned the territory where it lived it could perfectly well , if the price was satisfactory , sell that territory , or a part of it . As a matter of fact , however , the Indian had no idea of ownership in land as we understand it , and could not conceive that an individual could absolutely own land ; and therefore he could not understand selling land . The Indian 's right in a piece of land was the right of occupancy . If he had taken possession of a piece of land and was using it , it was his to occupy as long as he lived , unless he were ousted from it by some stronger person . Nevertheless , he was no more than a life tenant . He possessed this right to occupy the land and make such use of it as he desired , but after him his children succeeded to his rights in the land and neither he nor they could part with these rights , for the children of his children possessed the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present day , one may sometimes hear old Indians speak of  | the land which they had loaned to the white people , the idea being always that some day , this land must be handed back to the tribal occupants who had temporarily parted with their right of occupancy . The view is so totally opposed to our traditions and manners of thought that it is not easy for the white man to comprehend ; but if not easy for the white man to understand , we can perhaps better comprehend how impossible it is for the Indian to understand the opposite view . Because we have read chiefly of the Indians of the plains who possessed horses , and followed the buffalo from place to place , we think of the Indians as nomads ? wanderers from one part of the earth to another , and without a settled home . This is quite a mistake . An Indian tribe usually had a narrow range , and did not wander very far from their usual camping places , except when ? as often they did ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , sometimes because of the difficulty of securing subsistence , a tribe might start off on a long journey , but such a journey ? a migration from one territory to another ? might be extended over many generations of time . Many of us are disposed to think of the Indian as a sort of irresponsible person who acts only on the whims and emotions of the moment , but as a matter of fact the Indian is conservative , and his life is governed largely by laws and rules based on customs handed down to him from his ancestors . These customs he is very unwilling to transgress . We think of the Indian as improvident , eating today all that he has , and taking no thought for the morrow . This is another wrong idea . If the Indians were not as provident as thrifty white men , they still tried to make some provision for the future , and stored up for winter use the fruits of the . earth ? wild and cultivated ? that they secured during the summer . They dried roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish that they procured in quantity , and held it over against a time of scarcity . Yet it is true that , under some special stress of circumstances , they suffered from lack of food and sometimes even starved . The Indian is simple , honest , and ? when one gets to know him ? very likable . The most interesting thing about him is that of which at first we are least likely to think , his humanity ? his quality of being human . In all respects he is like the average human being . Intimate relations with the Indian ; show us that , in the savage , may be found the same good qualities that our own people possess .  |
