txt " Price cuts in most of the principal steel products since the latter part of 1926 , combined with the slackening of operations in January , will naturally affect first quarter earnings of steel producers . Nevertheless it is likely that most of the big producers will show fair profits for the current quarter . It is , of course , impossible to make any definite estimates of the quarter 's results at this early date , but what figures am available indicate that January was a better month than might have been expected ; and increased op- : erations in February and March should go far toward offsetting the reductions in prices . In the closing quarter of 192G , U. S. Steel cal ned $5:1,502,523 , before charges , and net for common stock was equal to $4.88 a share . In the first quarter of 1926 , Steel earned $43,061,285 , with a net for common of $3 . SS a share . On the basis of general trade conditions . it would appear that results of the current quarter would be lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steel Corp . has shown for many years a stability of earning power that has often been surprising . Taking all factors into consideration , it is likely that the big company will report earnings of between $47,000,000 and $50,000,000 , with net for common of oNer $4 a share . Independent steel companies as a rule respond : noise rapidly to changes in trade conditions and steel prices than does the Steel Corp . As example of this was provided in the last 1926 quarter when , with declining output . C. S. Steel 's net reached record proportions for peace times , while the majority of its competitors showed smaller earnings than in eit  --  er the preceding throe months or in the first quarter of the year . Consequently it may be expected that the independents will show , in most cases , a more cr less decided falling off in profits compared with the last quarter of last Sear or the first of 192G . At the same time , it seems likely that all concerns now paying dividends will show these earned with a satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second quarter in steel should show an improvement in earnings , although this will naturally depend on the price trend . Operations have been on an expanding scale since the first of the year and an increase in the spring is normal and to be expected . The Steel Corp. , particularly , will again begin to receive profits from its railroads and from its cement subsidiary . Opinion in the trade generally is that prices are scraping bottom and that any marked change must be upwards ; but this remains to be seen . Steel prices in February reached the lowest level since 1922 , the DowJones average of eight important products declining to $50.46 in that month . In the past week the average increased 12 cents a ton , the present average being $50.58 . Some grumbling is now being heard in certain steel trade quarters regarding the " hand-to-mouth " buying policy adopted by consumers . While it is admitted that this policy eliminates the sharp ups and downs in the industry , some producers urge that it has been carried to an extent w @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a few days ahead . This , they say , increases cost of production . There seems to be sonic justification for this claim ; at the same time there is little doubt that the benefits of the policy have far outweighed its evils . It is plain , however , that luck of any important volume of forward orders makes price maintenance or price advancing difficult , and present prices allow a very small profit margin . This is doubtless the principal reason for the dissatisfaction of producers with " hand-to-mouth " buying .
