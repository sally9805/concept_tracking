txt After hours of heroic rescue work , during which three Coast Guardsmen from Manomet lost their lives , all of the 150 passengers and the 113 members of the crew on the stranded steamer Robert E. Lee were taken off safely shortly after noon today . The tragedy which took the lives of the three Coast Guardsmen occurred when a crew of eight men from the life saving station at Manomet Point were thrown into the water by the capsizing of their boat . One was drowned , another died ten minutes after he was rescued and a third died of exposure aboard the Paulding . A fourth was reported sc severely affected by the immersion and exposure that he may not recover . The steamer was still held fast on the rocks where she had grounded off Manomet Point last night while on her way from Boston to New York during the gale . The passengers were taken off the vessel in surf boats manned by Coast Guardsmen , and transferred to the 125-foot patrol boats Bonham and Active , and the CG-176 , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women and Children Taken First . Though some of the passengers had spent a night of discomfort on board the steamer , they were confident of being rescued and were in good spirits when they stepped ashore at Plymouth Rock . Seven of the passengers were put aboard the Coast Guard cutter Red Wing , and decided to return to Boston in that vessel . They were landed at the navy yard this afternoon . Captain Robinson of the Lee came to Boston this evening . He left three of the ship 's officers aboard the Coast Guard cutter Tuscarora standing by the stranded vessel . The passengers who landed at Plymouth said those who had staterooms on the lower deck of the liner were forced to the upper decks when the water which had leaked in flooded their rooms . Twenty-five women and children were first taken from the stranded steamer . The steamship officials had arranged to have a fleet of buses to carry the passengers to Boston . The first bus left for Boston at 1:30 this afternoon . It was followed by several others , which left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Station here and those who wished to go on received tickets for the New York train . The steamship passage money was refunded to others who remained here . The first passengers landed on the pier at Plymouth showed some signs of suffering from exposure and hunger and they : Jere taken to the Plymouth Rock House , where the Red Cross provided for their comfort . The entire rescue work was made under the most perilous circumstances , and the relief boats were in constant danger from the high seas . Life savers from the Sagamore station who had put out for thn wreck last night , were forced to return . As no news had been sent out regarding their return it was at first feared they had gone down . The men of the crew , with three others , put out again for rescue work today . Liner George Washington Stands By . The steamship George Washington of the Eastern Steamship Line ar- rived here at 11:30 today from New York . Her Captain reported that he stood by the stranded Robert E. Lee from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . There were high seas and the Washington was pitching and tossing so that many were seasick . Many of the Washington 's passengers did not know she was even standing by . Among her passengers who saw the Robert E. Lee was Mel Shepard , former 880-yard world 's champion , on his way here with a number of girl athletes from the Milhose Athletic Club , who participated in the women 's national track meet at the East Armory tonight . The Coast Guard cutter Red Wing brought forty passengers and fifty members of the crew of the Robert E. Lee directly from the scene of the wreck to the wharf of the Eastern Steamship Company here at 5:15 this afternoon . There the passengers were met by a representative of the company . who told them the sister ship cf the Lee . the George Washington , would taken them to New York , cc , if they preferred , they could go by rail at the company 's expense .

The three Coast Guardsmen who lost their lives were Surfman Frank Griswold , who was drowned ; Boatswain 's Mate William H. Cashman , commanding the Manomet station . who died of exposure ten minutes after he was pulled ashore , and Edward P. Stark of Taunton , who succumbed to exposure while being taken on the cutter Paulding to the Chelsea Naval Hospital . The Paulding landed Stark 's body here tonight , and also brought three of the surviving Coast Guardsmen . They are Alden Proctor , Ernest C. Douglas and Irving Wood , all of Plymouth . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight said they appeared to be in good condition . Although chilled and suffering from immersion and shock , they were able to eat and were put to bed . According to the stories told by the Coast Guard survivors , the men had put out to the Robert E. Lee after several heart-breaking attempts to launch their power dory had failed . Once aboard the vessel , they remained there until all passengers and members of the crew had been removed . Then , in a raging sea , they set out for shore . Giant waves dashed them about and finally capsized them . Nearly Frozen in Icy Waters . " We were nearly unable to move when we landed in the water , " Proctor said . " All of the seven men in the power dory were shocked so badly that we had all we could do to grab the boat . I was caught under the dory when she capsized , but I filled my lungs full of air under there and then dived . I came up on the surface and saw the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too cold . I was practically frozen . " Then the first thiit= I noticed was that Stark seemed to be helpless . I guess he must have been hit . I know that all the skin on both my legs seemed to have been torn off . One of the surfmcn  --  I did n't notice who it was  --  grabbed him and threw him on top of the boat . He lay there . exhausted . First thing I knew I began to feel awfully numb , It was a tough night to keep above water . I got all my strength together and I leaped up . Luckily I managed to make it ; that 's why I 'm alive , I guess . " Officers of the Robert E. Lee who came to Boston on the Coast Guard cutter Red Wing reported immediately to the ffice of the Eastern Steamship Company at India Wharf , where the cutter made her landing about 5:15 P. M. today . Captain H. W. Robinson went into conference with Andrew B. Sides , Vice President of the company .

Questioned by newspaper men after the conference , Captain Robinson had nothing to say -. oncerning the cause of the wreck or anything material in regard to conditions on shipboard during the night . When asked how he felt , Captain Robinson replied : " I feel all right . It 's a captain 's job to be on duty in such an emergency . so it is nothing to stay up all night . " He was asked who was the last to leave the ship and answered : " I am the ship 's captain . I left the ship last . I brought Patsy , the ship 's cat , with me on my shoulders . " The entire crew , with the exception of the first , second and third officers of the ship , came to Boston . Maurice Holland , aged 22 , of Freeport , L. I. , radio operator on the Robert E. Lee at the time of the crash , and John Smith , spare operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stations from 7:37. o'clock Friday night until 1:20 o'clock this afternoon . Friday night was his first experience at sending out an emergency S 0 S call , Holland said . More than 20,000 words were filed during the excitement , he added . Hunger the Worst Discomfort This business of being shipwrecked would n't be bad at all if the meals were n't served so irregularly , was the cheerful verdict of the great majority of the passengers . Restored to normal poise and appea  --  ance by their comfortable ride from Manomet to Boston , the men and women who had spent a night and morning in the wave-battered hulk on Mary Ann Rocks debarked smiling and not disinclined to tell their first-hand tales of " how it feel " to he on a steamship breaking upon a reef in a midnight gale . There were some who testified to things that were not as they should be aboard the crippled ship . They told of " bootlegging " in sandwiches by men who appeared to be stewards . and who charged 40 cents and 50 cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bottle of tonic . " You got no change back either , " said one survivor . " I handed over a two-dollar bill and got only one sandwich for it . " The opening of the Robert E. Lee 's seacocks , which allowed the ship to settle firmly on the rocks instead of grinding herself to pieces , was the principal factor in the preservation of all her passengers and crew , according to Gurdon S. Worcester of Cambridge , who gave a vivid story of the wreck . " I was in my stateroom on the saloon deck when there was a sickening , terrifying crash , " he related . " I went on deck and found the other passengers wandering nervously about , trying to find out what had happened . The snow was whirling thickly about the ship and I could see nothing . Suddenly , from some one came word that a girl had thrown herself overboard and that we were stopping to pick her up . Only a few moments ' investigation was needed to show the story was false . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative remarks that I heard later on . " Within five minutes the lights went out and we were left in darkness , and in the midst of a nervewracking medley of rasping noises from the bottom of the ship . For nearly half an hour this din , often like the slamming of heavy doors , continued . " Then suddenly the noise ceased . Some one had been inspired . 1 wi.s later told by members of the ere , r , to open the seacocks . As a result the ship settled comfortably into a natural cradle between the rocks an I the pounding against her steel plateb stopped . " We were told there was no danger , but it was hard to convince the passengers whose rooms were on the main deck that this was so . for the flooring there was awash . With no lights , no heat , no drinking water and very little food , our situation was far from comfortable , but as the evening wore on and nothing more exciting occurred most of us lost our nervousness and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair was the trip in small boats to the Red Wing . The Coast Guard men handled the boats marvelously. "
