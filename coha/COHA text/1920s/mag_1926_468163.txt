IT IS difficult to think of Charles William Eliot as a human being . He was some sort of remote superman , was he not , who lived and acted quite beyond the scale of ordinary mortals ? His years stretched well through three-quarters of the nineteenth century and quite through the first quarter of the twentieth . Only six of the twenty-nine Presidents of the United States had completed their terms of office before his birth ; he had lived three years before Victoria became Queen of England ; and he was almost ready to enter college when gold was discovered in California . He lived when matches and sewing-machines and reapers were being invented and perfected , and when manufacturers were trying to put rubber shoes on the market and keel ) them there ; when there were no railroads to speak of , no telegraph , no practical use for electricity , no scientific laboratories in the colleges , no surgery worthy the great name ; and when a confessed belief in man 's ultimate ability to talk over a wire or to fly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity . But he lived also when aircraft were circling the North Pole ; when men were talking not merely over a wire but through the ether ; when surgeons were performing the most delicate operations on limbs and brain ; and when scientists were looking through solid substances with a new light in a way that in his early life would have been regarded as a defiance of the Creator . To the young who look upon the Victorian Era as just within the horizon of history , and who can not remember the sky when there were no airplanes in it , the mere span of his life seems little short of eternity . In like manner there is a seeming limitlessness to what he accomplished . He helped to develop the entire current system of elementary and higher education in America ; he was prominent in establishing the beginnings of what today is regarded as modern medicine and modern science ; he was the chief instrument in changing his own institution from a. provincial college to one of the important universities of the world ; he participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the days of negro shivery to the fight for a World Court in 1925 . Between eighty and ninety , when most men are in their graves and forgotten , he was in the thick of the struggle for all sorts of great causes in American life . In that last decade alone he published one hundred and ninety-two articles on important questions ? and writing for the press was only one of his many means of making himself felt ! Little wonder that this record should amaze his contemporaries and disciples ! But is there not something interesting in the human being from whom so much has emanated ? Just what manner of man was it who experienced so much and contributed so much ? If the record itself is astounding , might there not be something deserving of brief consideration in the personal method and the personal life of the man by whom the record was made ? II It is not possible to approach an understanding of President Eliot without bearing in mind that , despite his persistent activity , he was much alone among men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed through the succeeding phases of his life ; but he never escaped it . Despite his intimate and loyal friendships , he somehow was a man apart . In his earlier years ? in truth , until he was well past what many men regard as middle life ? his loneliness was that of the fighter who has the odds against him . In his later life , when the long stretch of years had healed the wounds of battle , he often spoke with mock-seriousness about those combative days : " No , I was never lonely ; I always had a fight on my hands ! " But when he was serious , his reference to them was different . " Can you fight ? " he asked a young professor who had gone to him with a disconcerting problem . " Why , yes , " the man replied ; " that is , I think I can . " " Can you fight when you are in the minority ? " " I have done so occasionally . " " Can you fight when everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lend you support ? " " I am ready to try it if necessary , " " Then you need have no fear . But if you have convictions it will sometimes be necessary to do no less . " His willingness , even readiness , to engage in combat was stimulated by at least two sets of circumstances . In the first place , there was something in his appearance in youth and middle life ? and to a lesser degree in old age ? that induced antagonism in certain people . He was near-sighted ? " no oculist has ever been able to procure for me full vision " ? and moved about with head aloft in seeming disregard of other people ; and the prominent birthmark on the right side of his face distorted his upper lip into a suggestion of superciliousness . For some reason , boys on the Boston Common enjoyed " belting " this aristocratic , arrogant-looking contemporary , and ? perhaps for the same reason ? he enjoyed giving them in return everything the occasion required . In college he was known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young tutor at Harvard he was known for the same qualities . One year , among the undergraduates there were not enough oarsmen to make up a crew for the City of Boston Regatta on the Charles . So they called upon Eliot ? there seems to have been no occasion up to that time to invent eligibility rules ? and he responded . He was tall and slender then ? according to the records of the regatta he " weighed in " at one hundred and thirty-eight pounds ? but he did his full share in winning the six-mile race ? " six miles with three turns " ! Concerning his power as a teacher there were different opinions . But by the time he was thirty-five ? he was then professor of chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ? it was proposed to make him president of Harvard . Much opposition developed . Some of his opponents said that if he were made president they would henceforth have nothing to do with the institution . He would wreck it with his over-aggressive , cold-blooded methods ! There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the very same time his wife lay dying . Heartbroken and alone he walked the streets , caring little whether he was made president or not . But his appointment was confirmed . When he assumed the presidency he seems to have made every effort to reveal the catholicity of his views . His inaugural address ? October , 1869 -- would still constitute an excellent school for college administrators . But the situation which confronted him in his new office called for heroic treatment , and he was not the one who would hesitate to administer it . So with a reputation already established for enPORTRAIT OF joying a fight , and with a situation at Harvard that required many changes if the institution were to command the respect of the world of scholars , he very soon had a worse reputation for pugnacity than he had before he took up his duties . Many , to be sure , found assurance in his clear-sighted activity ; but when the professor in the Medical School asked him why so many changes had to be made , and he replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only convinced anew of the high-handed methods the new president meant to empl.oy . So he moved about in a world that was chiefly hostile . " In all the early part of my career as a teacher and an educational administrator , " he said in an address before the Massachusetts Historical Society a few months before his ninetieth birthday , " I was much engaged in controversy , not to say combat , and that at home as well as outside Harvard . In all my public appearances during those years , I had a vivid sense that I was addressing an adverse audience . " At home many of the members of his own faculty derided him and his educational schemes ; students ? some of whom later were made members of the faculty and became his staunch supporters ? enjoyed poking at him the kind of fun that carried a sting ; and in the outside world pretty nearly everybody welcomed an opportunity to make him a target . " One of the painful recollections of my life , " one of his lifelong friends once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and assailing him whenever he appeared in an educational meeting . " To all the other reasons for denouncing him , the friends of Yale added yet one more by showing how Yale had not ? at that time ? adopted Eliot 's pernicious system of letting college students choose their own course of study . Wherever he went he was grimly serene in the consciousness that most of the people around him were at heart his opponents . That he was able to survive this stormy period ? which reached into the last decade of the nineteenth century ? may be attributed to two or three qualities of his character . He was tenacious . In his later years he confided to younger men that he believed much of his success in combat resulted from his ability to turn aside at once when he was utterly blocked , and take up for the moment some simpler struggle where the promise of victory was greater ; then , when he had learned more strategy and had regained confidence in himself , to return to the major struggle , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he was once convinced that the idea for which he struggled was an essential one he did not often accept defeat . Another quality which enabled him to survive was his loftiness . He did not become embroiled in little affairs . He insisted that every struggle in which he participated should be conducted on a high level . There was nothing insinuating in his method ; he was not afraid to carry a position by frontal assault . He abhorred cunning , and he did not need it ; for he was strong . Once after a lively session of the Harvard Board of Overseers , he good-naturedly reprimanded one of his friends on the hoard , " Why did you not come to my support when you saw so many against me ? " The friend replied , " It was such good fun to see you flatten them out one by one , yourself . " In such struggles he was generous in hearing opposition and was ready to be convinced by it . But whether or not he was convinced , he gave his opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under certain circumstances should be allowed to graduate in three years , he met strong opposition in the faculty . Whether he was moved wholly by a generous fairness , or partly by a boyish readiness to give every advantage and prove that he could still win , he gave the opposing members the use of the university printing press in order that they might have every facility for combating his cherished scheme . ... . It must have been only his high sense of fairness ; for at the end of the year , with these men 's destinies in his hands , he promoted some of them to full professorships . When men came close to him , moreover , whether as opponents or as allies , they found in him another quality which added to his ability to survive . He was , despite the casual observation that he was a hard and cold New Englander , a man of profound emotional experience . He suffered deeply when he suffered , and he enjoyed deeply when he enjoyed ; and he had the great range of sympathy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a. family of children by the death of the first Mrs. Eliot , and for some years ? some of the stormiest of his public career ? he had to be not only president of Harvard , but father and mother in his own household . Then he met the spirited and beautiful Miss Hopkinson who was to become the second Mrs. Eliot ? and he proved to be just as aggressive a suitor as he was a college president . How could it matter what the watchful ladies of Cambridge thought ? He marched erect and in full view along Garden Street carrying a bouquet of flowers to the fascinating young creature ! She was beloved by her friends as a singer of unusual charm and as an irresistible mimic . When she became the second Mrs. Eliot she had her part in developing qualities in her husband that the less discerning had failed to detect in him at all . They began the day by singing : by singing hymns ; by singing ? according to veracious guests ? the most orthodox hymns ! They ro ( le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They entertained their old and young friends in great simplicity and in great good humor . On Christmas Eve they welcomed the Harvard students who were so far away from home that they had to remain in Cambridge over the holiday season . No one who was a guest atone of those evenings can forget the group that gathered round the fireplace , with President Eliot warming his hands in rapt silence , Mrs. Eliot beaming with sly good humor , and Charles Eliot . Norton , stooped with age into a great curve , reading with restraint and beauty the Gospel story of the birth of Jesus . Mrs. Eliot put him through the paces of a happy , objective , and not too serious life . To the end of her radiant days she whimsically corrected him when he did not see according to her standards of humor . After the international celebration of his ninetieth birthday lie was recounting with delight all that had taken place at the meeting . " But do you know , I could n't hear a word of Peabody 's prayer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't speaking to you , dear ! " Beneath the austerity which his years of combat accentuated , she knew him to be full of the great tenderness once so generally ascribed to women . When stern college discipline was required he could enforce it ; but he often did so with tears in his eyes . On one occasion when his conscience told him that he must support one of his deans who had dismissed from college the son of a widow who appeared at the president 's house in her son 's behalf , he finally withdrew from the conference . Later Mrs. Eliot came to explain that he was so moved he feared he could not talk . He was a sound sleeper ; he boasted in his old age that he could go from the stormiest debate late at night and he lost in sleep in a few minutes . Yet occasionally when he arrived at University Hall in the morning he admitted that he had been unable to sleep for thinking about the tragic misfortune of young So-and-so . That he was able to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious . Most men are chicken-hearted ; a tenacious man overawes them . Most men who undertake a struggle lose themselves in bickerings and in hot debates over non-essentials ; a man who keeps his head high and refuses to turn aside to enjoy the transient satisfaction of putting his adversaries in the hole , very soon finds that his fellows are looking to him for guidance . Most men expect an adversary to be without sympathetic understanding ; a man full of tenderness for fellow-mortals ? unregenerate though many of them be ? takes away their cherished basis on which to oppose him . Sometimes it becomes an honor to know such a man , even if the acquaintance has come through opposing him . " Do you suppose anybody ever called him Charley ? " one man asked another as they talked about his serene loftiness at seventy . Perhaps , they thought , the second Mrs. Eliot may have done so , since she was always taking liberties with him . Still , as they turned the question over , even that seemed improbable . He was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These two men had the greatest affection for him ? one of them , greater affection than for any other man he had ever known ? and they turned to him for counsel on every sort of problem . Yet they found it difficult to think of him as anybody 's intimate . Their feeling revealed the position occupied by President Eliot in his late middle life and earlier old age . His full height , his magnificent gray head , his deep , sensitively modulated voice , his firm but easy bearing , commanded profound respect . He had fought through many stormy years , and had developed a circumspect manner of looking at things . He had come to possess a rare capacity for disengaging not merely the essential things , but the things that give life its color , its bloom . So , despite all else that he did in this period , he came to be looked upon as a very august man who stood in a high place and dispensed wisdom on many matters . Not that he refrained from entering energetically into the affairsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in anything as a mere equal . He participated as a benevolent St. Bernard would enter into the play of puppies . Wherever he chanced to be , he towered above his associates . Many people said he uttered commonplaces as though they were oracular . His adversaries ? and he still had plenty of them ? protested that he thought himself infallible . They invented such pleasant instances as " President Eliot says , ' I think it shall rain this afternoon . ' They asked if there might not be found somewhere one tiny instance of his being very , very slightly in error . Nevertheless , it is doubtful whether any man continued to be consulted on so many diverse matters . The education of little children ; the best places to invest small sums of money ; the merit of this or that long manuscript ? on chemistry , philosophy , education , poetry ; the thing to do when the son of a millionaire marries the daughter of a boarding-house keeper in Cambridge ; the internal affairs of China ; the training of ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the negro ; landscape architecture ; the study of music and art in colleges for young women ? with countless matters of such variety his days and much of his nights were taken up . When he dealt with such matters there was in him a trace of the impetuous warrior , but of the warrior who has fought his way to a point of vantage . He stood in good-humored composure before a hostile audience of laborers in Faneuil Hall ? the chairman promised punishment for any delegates who indulged in catcalls while President Eliot spoke ! ? and explained just why he was opposed to picketing . He dealt with the picturesque , electric Theodore Roosevelt , President of the United States , precisely as a vigorous grandfather would spank an obstreperous ten-year-old boy . He stood before theologians and told them of the religion of the future and why it would " make Christ 's revelation seem more wonderful than ever to us . " He prepared ? with aid ? a five-foot shelf of books which he said would provide a liberal education for the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees could find no suitable inscriptions for public buildings and other monuments , he provided something lofty and enduring . In truth , the great dignity and gravity with which he said everything led many to believe he had no sense of humor . He had . Often he revealed the subtlest humor . But , as Dean Briggs once observed , his humor was " unreliable . " He was not pliant in the hands of a given occasion . There was sometimes a chasm between what the occasion would seem to call for and what President Eliot actually uttered . When a brilliant young scholar , about to be added to the teaching force at Harvard , was led to him for presentation and was fearful that his scholarship might not bear the unwonted strain , President Eliot bowed , and with grave serenity said , " I am very happy to meet you . But you are not large . " " No , " the young teacher admitted , " I am not very large . " " Are you vigorous ? " " Why , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you take exercise in the open air ? " " Yes , I walk several miles every day . " " It is a very excellent thing for a young man to do . Good-morning ! " But with all his top-heavy seriousness , men came to recognize in him the elements of greatness . He had rounded into that period of active life when a man 's contributions are beginning to stand revealed ? if they are probably ever to do so . Men began to sum him up , to speak about what they had seen him do . They had seen him change the Harvard Medical School from a careless institution where students attended instruction only four months in the year and were obliged to pass in only five chiefdepartments out of nine ? there are recorded instances where the graduates actually killed patients through professional ignorance ? into one of the important schools of the world . They had seen him convert the Harvard Law School into an institution of which an eminent foreign jurist said , " It is without equal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing judge of men and a person unmindful of petty enmities and prejudices , surround himself on all sides with scholars of distinguished ability and great personal power . They had seen him become a strong ally in the development of a more adequate education for women . And atop all , they had seen his despised elective system ? despite all the abuses to which it is open ? go to every part of the country and become a means of liberalizing men 's thinking . There were , moreover , less official achievements . He had enforced upon the world a theory about the sacredness of every man 's work ; a ditch-digger might become a " minister " if only he put enough character into his digging . He had been the chief American figure in making parents and teachers and school committees see that a boy experiences vastly more of the educative process when he works at a subject in which he delights . He had given to religion a new vigor through abundant fresh air , and to science a touch of the sacredness of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for greater social health throughout the country . He had become the accredited daily illustration of the effect of a serene spirit on physical health . And he had with great labor established in men 's minds one thought which all the intolerance of a post-war period can not wholly dislodge ; namely , that professors in universities must have the right not merely to think but to express their thoughts ; that the way to develop a great university is not to badger men into playing safe , but to place faith in their loyalty to the high pursuit of truth . Could anyone except a great man make all these contributions ? and many more ? Those who once ridiculed him and his ideas did not now protest when he was referred to as " the first citizen of the state , " and later " of the nation . " Why should not men turn to him for counsel ? Merely a glimpse of him as he walked erect and at peace with his own spirit was enough to reveal an extraordinary man . A student who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the country said , a dozen years after , that it was worth all the money he ever spent in Cambridge just to see President Eliot come from the little red-brick house on Quincy Street , glance about in the morning sunshine with the admiring reverence of a child , walk to University Hall , respond with amused but benevolent dignity to the salutation of the negro boy who gathered cigarette stubs , and then , very erect , mount the steps and disappear in the building . There was another informal proof of his accepted greatness : men were beginning to use him as a justification for reasonable conduct in daily affairs ! " I was a sophomore , " a man said twenty years after college , " and I had a sophomore 's notions of what constituted fitness . I would not have been seen crossing Harvard Square with a package of groceries in ray arm for any sum of money . In the course of the long vacation I chanced to be in Cambridge . The day was sweltering . Just before lunch time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a familiar voice and looked up . President Eliot was coming from the door with an enormous watermelon under his arm . He moved off in the direction of Quincy Street . At a distance , I followed . Half way home he put the melon down against the roots of an elm , took out his handkerchief , and mopped his brow and cheeks . But he did not rest long . Evidently somebody wanted that particular melon for lunch . So he lifted it to his arms again and moved on toward the house . " Nothing that Harvard College ever did for me was worth half so much as that five minutes of President Eliot 's life . For he knocked out of me all the nonsense there was in me ? and there was a great deal ! " Yes , there had been changes since the days when every audience he addressed was an " adverse audience . " If by chance he paid the street-car fare of some Italian woman who had lost her nickel as any man might be expected to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the newspapers . People liked to say that a Symphony could not begin without him . And to have him present at a wedding was scarcely less an honor than being married in the presence of the Pope ! Yet there remained in him a lofty inscrutability that discouraged intimate approach . The multitude did not try to hobnob with him . They wanted to see him , but they were content to peer at him through the wrought-iron fence of the College Yard . Even among the graduates of his own university , among men who now respected him , admired him , and sometimes loved him , there was an inclination always to appoint a committee , or name a delegate , to bear their greetings to him . He was a very wise , very good man , they felt , and he could offer the most acceptable counsel to be found anywhere . But it was not easy to feel that he entered instinctively into the everyday tribulations of his less sternly self-disciplined fellows . IV As he traveled majestically into his latter eighties . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " adverse audience " of his youth had given way to an eager audience ; the restraint of a public that admired his wisdom but never sought to become intimate with him gave way to warmth and an affectionate pride . Yet he was lonely . He was still a fighter ; be still gave out oracular wisdom ; but he was a mellow old man who no longer aroused antagonism or induced restraint . A few people , it is true , maintained an attitude of bitterness toward him , and still contended that he was the greatest single disintegrating force in American higher education . But the overwhelming majority looked upon him as a prophet ; or if not a prophet , at least one of truth 's very high priests . Men delighted in his benevolent attitude toward everyone and ? some of them ? were ashamed to think the t to_the . v had not discovered it before . ' - lei pointed to him as the great exai pie of a man who could change his mind with scrupulous honesty if he thought the evidence warranted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First Parish Church of Cambridge ? when he was eighty-nine ? and stated that all through his forty years as president of Harvard , and for many years thereafter , he had believed that a layman should not represent the church publicly . But in view of the present needs of the church , he had become convinced that he had been wrong , and he wished to make a declaration of his change of belief . He decided that , despite all the good fellowship and poetry surrounding the use of wine ? he had as president always served ice cream and sherry at the traditional meetings of the Divinity School faculty ? it were better as a social-health measure to have national prohibition ; and he was heard without being called either a Puritan or a fanatic . All else was lost in admiration for a man who could change his mind when he was nearer ninety than eighty . In this period he ceased to give all of his thought to the future , and became pleasantly reminiscent . More than that , he confessed one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the experience . He welcomed undergraduates to his house and told them about the early days . Occasionally he accepted invitations to sit with them in their own informal meetings , and delighted them by the hour . As he turned more and more to his past , he found that other men were doing so ? affectionately . One day a visiting lecturer at the university passed Memorial Hall on his way to lunch , and noticed many automobiles parked on every side . He slipped into the theater and found President Eliot ? then nearly ninety ? standing before a large audience , his head aloft , his hands clasped , and his thumbs moving steadily , while he discussed a problem in education . The visiting lecturer had not talked with him for a half-dozen years . So at the close of the meeting , while President Eliot waited twenty minutes for an automobile that was to carry him to a luncheon , the two sat alone on the stage in the high-vaulted , quiet theater and reviewed many matters . When they were ready to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees just the least bit ; so if you do n't mind , I believe take your arm while we go down the steps . " They marched down the steps together and toward the exit , the visitor proud to have the magnificent nonagenarian firmly grasping his arm . As they stepped out into the sunshine , the visitor said to him , " When I was a student I used to enjoy seeing you on your way to work in the early morning , and I often thought I should like to tell you . Of course , I never did ; but I want to tell you now . " President Eliot smiled , bright-eyed with a pleasure the visitor had never seen expressed in his face before . " Do you know , " he said , for a moment half lost in sublime retrospection , " that is the great joy of living to be an old man . Not a few Harvard men have said much the same thing to me within the past few years . If I had died at seventy or eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions of a more intimate affection on the part of younger men became more numerous until they culminated in the national ? even international ? celebration of his ninetieth birthday . It is doubtful whether a private citizen had ever before been honored with a meeting of such official brilliance and spontaneous good will . It is doubtful whether any man in any station ever received such an outpouring of expressions of high regard . He was delighted that there was nothing " mortuary " about it all , and entered upon his part with the enthusiasm of youth . He not only spoke at some length to all the assembled friends and dignitaries , but went a little later in the afternoon to the College Yard and there addressed the thousands of students assembled to do him honor . To the students he spoke with a vigor and cordiality scarcely surpassed in his most resolute years ? he advised them not to wait too long to marry ! Then he went to his own house and engaged in a less inclusive celebration there . He had come into his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told of the fruits of his long labors . Every public appearance was an ovation . Graduates referred to him affectionately as " a great old boy . " People stopped and watched in wonder and admiration when he stepped cautiously but with a trace of the old vigor from his automobile and entered the First Parish Church . But his contemporaries had gone . The gracious , beautiful Mrs. Eliot slipped quietly away into the shadows . With a few ? very few ? exceptions , all the people around him were younger ? much younger ? than he was . He sat in the long study upstairs and conferred with men about chemistry and the scientific mind ; about the rehabilitation of agriculture in Bulgaria ; about international good will ; and , with great concern and enthusiasm , about the religious life of college students . But he could not move abroad so readily as he once could . And most of the men who came to see him knew little of the times he knew best and loved most . In a new way , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were a very great , very benign curios-ity : how old he was when their grandfathers were born ; how long he had taught mathematics and chemistry before Darwin started all this discussion of evolution ; and why he never went as ambassador to the Court of St. James . Good Cambridge ladies said , " It would be nice if he could die now before he becomes too feeble . It must be dreadful just to sit and wait ! " But he had been alone before , and he could wait . When ' men came in from their rushing , excited w. , Id to offer their respect , he was full of questions stories , arguments . Was a man to up his radiance of youth simply be . se he chanced to be a little past ninety ? Just to know that there were still so many young fighters in the world was beautiful , very beautiful . When his eyes had become dim and his hand too palsied to hold a pen , a friend sent him a volume ? just off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lines to Oliver Wendell Holmes . President Eliot asked his secretary to send his thanks . " Tell him , " he said : ' Yet on our autumn boughs , unflown with spring , The evening thrushes sing . ' " So he sat and waited . Occasionally there were flashes of the old will , the old impetuosity ; there were so many things that ought to be done ; but there was not strength . Then the serenity came again . It was something , was it not , to have fought so valiantly and , all in all , so successfully ? It was something , was it not , to have contributed of one 's best judgment so generously ? It was something , was it not , to have men everywhere speak of one with grateful affection ? Could one hope for more of what he himself had modestly called " the fortunate circumstances of life " ? So , much alone , he waited .                   @ @
