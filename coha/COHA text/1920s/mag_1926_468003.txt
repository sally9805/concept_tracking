THE most important room at home was the library . Our house was the usual four-story brownstone segment in the unbroken wall of an upper West Side block . There were plenty of windows . Those to the north looked out upon the street where grocery wagons rattled by day and by night the gas lamps dimly slumbered . Those to the south gave a broad view of another wall of houses which at dark became fantastic with lighted windows holding many secrets and black silhouettes mysteriously alive behind drawn blinds . And beyond the houses was the glow of the great city . The library had but a single window ; it was too little for so large and low a room . Even by day the library was dark and , since the window opened on a strip of yard choked by an ugly ailanthus , I never looked through that window . When I was in this room New York did not come in ; New York stayed distant and silent . The real world became this world of books ; and almost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls were those of two Americans : Washington and Lincoln . But they had little to do with the America outside the window . They spoke to me less eloquently than the novelists and poets of England , than the thinkers of Germany , than the Athenians and Romans all living on the shelves . This library in my father 's house in the city of New York was a sanctuary of Europe . It glowed with a secluded quiet and with a life of itsown . And here my childhood lived with an intensity and depth of feeling that not school , not the streets could give me . My father nearly every year went to Europe . We would go down to the ship often , on the eve of his sailing , board the great vessel , and dine with the captain in his cabin . I was in Europe then : everything , from the food we ate to the words we heard , were strange to America . Father sailed away , and mother bundled us children into a train . We got at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even in the mountains Europe was not far distant . Letters would presently arrive with foreign stamps . They were long letters : page upon page of personal description in which my father narrated his adventures in Hamburg , in London , in Paris . His trips were short ? business trips . When he came back he brought Europe still more vividly along ; in the air of his clothes , in the scent of his label-plastered luggage . And then mother was always there : and that made more of Europe . Mother was an artist . She sang every day . Beethoven , Wagner , Brahms , Schubert , Schumann , Wolf ? these were the voices that came with us even to the mountains . My room in the city home was on the top floor . I was the youngest , a tragic fate since it meant my going earliest to bed . It was not easy , this clambering up from the lighted drawing-room filled with the cheer of guests , through the shadowed house . But the fourth floor was mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that my father would presently sit down at the organ or the piano to accompany my mother . I would then take a blanket from my bed , wrap myself snugly , and seat myself on the stair . My mother 's singing came clearly through the house . School was a dim fable beside the reality of those songs ; even the strong words on the library shelves were weak by contrast . That lovely , breathing voice with its perfect modulation and its subtle colors brought the lands across the sea miraculously near as I sat in guilt ? and in ecstasy -- -upon the stair . So when I went to Europe ( I went several times before I was old enough for college ) I found familiar lands . My upbringing , the library , above all , my mother 's profound art had made them mine . The American authors whom I knew meant little . Longfellow and Holmes and Lowell were , in another way , as European as my father . Whittier 's poems about slavery were less vivid than the tales of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South and who told us children of her adventures with the Yankee army that burned her house and robbed her of her goods , or of her running the blockade in a tiny rowboat in Mobile ( with mother , a baby in her arms ? and the constant fear that if the baby cried , the Yankee boats would find them ) . Cooper 's redskins and sea-rovers seemed more remote to me than the Londoners of Dickens or the Parisians of Baizac . And as to Poe , whose wistful little house my father showed me in a waste of goats and cans way out in Fordliamhis land was one of wraiths and silences , in no way kin to this rectangular array of streets that was called New York and that , for me , was all America . II In my fifteenth year I had a great adventure . I picked up a history of American literature which spoke , coldlyand slightingly enough , of an unknown poet , of whose curious style there was appended an example called " 0 Pioneers ! " I procured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title page in archaic type and the portrait of an ancient bearded sage , all gray , who signed himself Walt Whitman . I read , studied , annotated , as I might have done with the Bible if I had been reared religiously . Whitman stirred deep voices in my soul ; he inspired me . I believe in those early days I understood him well enough . But one so obvious fact escaped me , since I was not ready for it : the fact that this man . was an American , and that his experience was related to my own . He was as remote ? and holy ? as a Hebrew prophet ! That spring there was the annual oratory contest at the High School . The usual bright lads rose before an auditorium of a thousand people and bespoke " The Spirit of ' 76 , " " The Blessings of Democracy , " and so forth . And then a strange thing happened . A short , black-haired boy stood upon the rostrum and for half an hour harangued the audience about the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must have been eloquent as well as amusing , for the Judges gave him the Gold Medal for his effort . But the whole affair remained somehow outside of his experience as an American . These teachers who had rewarded him for praising Whitman kept on quoting Longfellow . Whitman had so little contact with this reality of New York life that his value seemed well symbolized by the useless medal of gold which the boy 's mother put away and which he never saw again . Whitman was an outsider , a myth ? almost an outcast . But Europe came ever closer . I was done with school and too young for college . So I was sent abroad . I discovered myself at sixteen , at seventeen , to be of an age which on the Continent was deemed the age of a man ! I consorted with students from every land of Europe : Russians , Spaniards , Serbians , Jews from Egypt , burly football players from Great Britain . They were not " pretty " fellows . They knew lifewomen ? books . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the air was less thick with tobacco smoke than with the thunder of exciting talk . Revolution , art , morality , death : all the old dwellers of the books which I had met in my father 's library took on flesh , grew warm , grew pressing . And here at last , so many miles from his Manhattan , Whitman became alive ; Poe found recognition . " America ? " said my European friends . " It is the place that gave us Poe and Whitman . " I had engaged my room at Harvard . But I wanted to go to IIeidelberg . I wanted , like my friends , to make the rounds of the great universities of Germany , England , Paris . I wanted to persevere in this world of midnight tea and rum with its dizzy flights into art and metaphysics . Europe beckoned me on , like some dark , mellow woman in whom the Mother eternally old and the Lover wondrously young were merged . And my father would not have stood against my will . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for the personality of others . A tyrant in matters of deportment , he hated all interference in adventures of the spirit . He had watched me , perhaps amused , perhaps with a hidden pang , go about at the age of twelve with my undigested load of Ibsen and Zola and Tolstoi . He had observed me , bored with school , become a truant , frequent the vaudeville shows or barricade myself from furious teachers in the office of our High School paper . Now , when the formal letters came from Heidelberg , telling the young American that he knew enough to be admitted , my father would not have said no , whatever his conviction . But my older brother was less philosophical . He came to Europe ; and in a hotel room high up above the Seine we had what for me was a decisive battle . " You are not going to Heidelberg , " said my brother . " You are going to be an American , by gum ! And what 's more , you are not going to Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be not only an American , but as human an American as I can make you . I 'm going to send you to a place that will smoothe out your angles and your crotchets . Yale for you . " . . . And to Yale I went . I suppose I had been ill-prepared for the " dear old Campus . " My classmates were engrossed in football , not in ideas ; in Greek-letter fraternities , not in secret revolutionary orders . They got drunk on beer and sang sentimental songs , whereas my friends in Europe had sipped their liquor soberly for the most part , and got drunk on Nietzsche . Good , groping , earnest fellows , my chums at Yale seemed children to me . I went through college a rather cantankerous rebel . To amuse myself , I wrote dramatic criticism for a local paper , losing no occasion to belay America 's woful " lack of culture " ; I played Bach ; I wrote a book on the Literature of Modern France ; and always my eyes continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism in New York was a leap from a nursery to a sort of jungle . The academic cloisters had struck me as anaemic imitations of the full-blooded youthfulness which I had seen in Europe . I liked sport well enough ; but was there not as well an athleticism in literature and in philosophy ? Now came New York once again : a New York of murders , robberies , politics , and visiting celebrities who spent the interviewer 's hour telling him pleasant things about America which were not so . This New York seemed wholly body . While the slums reeked with poverty and vice , while the high spirit of youth was trampled out by the thresh of a mechanical progress , the City seemed aware only of problems of traffic , of taxation , of money . A vast town , New York ; but since it was concerned only with the mechanics of sheer physical well-being , of sheer physical growth , it struck me as a baby ? a sort of Brobdingnagia , n baby . If a man proposed municipal ownership of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monster . If a woman was suspected of infidelity , it seemed right to drag her to a divorce court ; and the important thing ? the only important thing ? seemed to be to ascertain the fact ; the deep hidden significances of her character , of her unhappiness , of the subtle treatment of her husband all these elements of truth were ignored , were unguessed at . I could not accept this gross , this infantile America , which was all the America I knew . Being a child myself , I made the same old gross mistake : I imagined that my Paradise existed " over there , " across the sea . I packed a bag at last and went to live in Paris . When I arrived it was nightfall . I left my bags at a hotel and wandered up the Boul ' Mich ' ? the gaudy thoroughfare of the Latin Quarter . I saw no face that I knew in the thronged terraces of the caf ? s which made two continuous rivers from the Gardens of the Luxembourg down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . I began to write . I found myself in a world where writing ? the sheer creative act ? was considered a sacrament and a service : not because of what it brought , not for what it did ? for itself . It was in the air ? this rhythm of creation . Life was looked on as a lovely , mysterious adventure , and its true priests were they who sang of it , who pictured it , who revealed its beauty . I made friends . Here , among these swarms of enthusiasts who spent their days arguing about a picture or a poet , I found men after my own heart . And I found a woman , a true daughter of this world who took me in and made me part of it . And then , after a brief year , just as I was beginning truly to be at home , I packed my bags and I went back to New York ! What had happened ? I was having a good time and a successful one . Living was cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to send articles and stories to the United States , convert the few dollars into many francs , and live like a young lord in this perpetual holiday town where poverty was no disgrace , where there was as much honor in contributing to certain magazines as in being elected to the Senate ! Did not the wealthy ladies of Paris find the same thrill in climbing five musty stairs to the garret of an obscure American author that our own ladies found in dining with celebrities from Paris ? Was there indeed not a whole world here fashioned for the artist and ruled by his desire ? Paris itself , vast and modern , had the leisurely freedom of an aristocratic village . Here was a huge city in which there were happy people , in which there were trees and gardens , in which there was room for all moods , all liberties ? even for a bit of license . I had more than I had ever bad , and yet I gave it up quite simply because I did not want it , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris there gathered artists from America . Many of them had not been home in years ; most of them came from small places in the interior and had had no contact with Europe until they had come over . They spoke seldom of our country . But when they did , they sneered , they jeered , they swore that they were done with the barbaric land that had given them birth . I could not argue with them ; so much of what they said was simply fact . Yet it was in the company of these Americans that I began to feel most sharply my need of coming back . If what they said was true , all the more urgent was the return of men like themselves who claimed to be conveyers of the truth , creators of beauty ? men who could endow America with what they accused America of lacking . But I went little with these expatriates . My knowledge of the language , my love and , bit by bit , my work gained me an entrance into the true world of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of Europe . I was happy here , but I was not needed . I was being nourished by what other men , through centuries and ages , had created . I was a parasite . At least , so it seemed to me . I do not believe that I thought further in those youthful days . Certainly , I thought scarcely at all of what I was going to find when I returned . I knew simply that I was going home . I left the best friends that I had ever had , the most congenial home , I left my love ( she never understood ) . I took a boat . I rented a room in Washington Place . I stared at the dirty wall ? and wondered what madness had driven me along . IV The year was 1913 and I was twenty-three . I was alone and miserable as I had never been . In Paris they had not understood why I had left them . But in America no one even knew that I was here . I had outgrown my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man most needs --  companionship , ideas , love ? was beyond the ocean . Here ? I lay on my iron cot and stared at the blank walls ; I heard the elevated trains pound past and the arrogant motors shuffle and the crowds press , press in their weary quest for money ? in their vast indifference to all which made my world . I was unable to eat , unable to sleep ? unable to work . At times , in my weakness , I thought of what I had left behind in Paris . But always I knew that I was not going back nevergoing back until I had proven to my friends abroad , both the Europeans and the Americans , that I was right in leaving . Twelve brief years ago America was not what the young artist or writer finds to-day . There were no magazines hospitable to their virgin efforts , there were no Little Theaters , no liberal weeklies . The land seemed a hostile waste , consumed by the fires of possession and production . Whatever " literature and art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to find a market . But did not this fact prove that such as I were needed ? The very fact that life was hard here , that life did not seem to want me , that America was quite resigned to letting me starve ? did not this prove that I was needed , and that I had come home ? So I set to work upon the pleasant task of making myself wanted in a world that seemed to be getting along extremely well without me . I soon learned that it was getting on so well , chiefly on the surface . I had a vision then , in those dark impotent days , which gave me light and strength , and which has never left me . I saw our land as a fumbling giant child , idealistically hungry as was no other land in all the West , but helpless to express its hunger . Our forefathers had come here brimful of religious energy : all of them , whether they were Puritans from England , Catholics from Spain , or Jews from Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done : a continent to clear , bridges to build , a nation to house . Our fathers had learned to perform these substantial chores ; they had performed them so miraculously well because of the spiritual force which drove them . But now that they longed to express their deeper dreams , their subtler ideals , they did not know how . So that , for want of better , they poured all their poetry and most of their religion into the business at hand : made it express their idealism which they could not express otherwise at all ! We spent so much time making money because the poets had not yet come to teach us to make better things . We were so proud of our machines because the builders of more significant beauty had not yet come among us . We were such busy-bodies about the personal habits of our neighbors ? keeping them from an innocent drink or even from a cigarette ? because the teacher had not yet appeared to show us better ways of ennobling our souls . And finally , we marched about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew intolerant of the chaos of creeds and races in our midst because we were not yet strong enough , mature enough to conceive of a unity of inclusion rather than of exclusion . Now I was ready to see America . I had intellectually or in the flesh been " round the world . " I had known personally the men of modern Europe , studied the masters of ancient Greece , Israel , and India . I discovered America last ? which was the right way to discover it , since America is to be the last word , the summing up of all the yesterdays which have poured their blood upon the American shores . I went west . Under the noisy , dirty braggart mood of Chicago I felt a childlike spirit ? I found childlike men . I found a fertile and sweet world pushing up in this town which Sandburg called the Hog-butcher of the world ? pushing up under the coal and the grime like springtime grass beneath the muck of winter . I helped to edit a country paper in the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , lived with them . And though I had done the same thing with the intellectuals of Paris , I found a warmth here of response which I had not found abroad . Here in this crude corn-grower hungering to " git America and his dream together , " and in his overworked wife scheming to give her girls the " culture " she bad never had , was a Seed of the spirit which needed only nurture and the sun to flower . And I had talks in the kitchens of solitary farms that moved me in a way mysteriously deep and gave me strength . I lived with coal miners . I found them hungry for light , possessed of an infallible instinct for the tragic beauty of the world . They too were spiritual Seed long underground and ready to push up . And when a fellow who had mined since he was twelve and who hadnever seen his dad by light of day piloted me through a leaky shaft with a care that was loving and paternal , I realized what I had won by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south ? to the country which my mother had left as a baby . I spent months in lodgings in that slumberous aristocrat of cities , Richmond . Here , too , were re sthetes , weavers of silly images of distant Paradise . I did not see them . I saw a people , stricken still under the curse of a past and under the load of an intricate present : a people hungering for light , for expression ? a people hungering and , hence , a people growing . I came to know the negroes in the cypress swamps of Alabama and Mississippi . I lived with them , I spoke to them in their churches and their schools . In these dark breasts was a flame heightened with pathetic ease by the slightest show of understanding . I realized the wondrous wealth of spirit and of dream which America possesses in her uegroes . And I saw the Indians of the Southwest pueblos . In their classic ceremonial dances , in their deeply unselfish religion of nature , in the dignity and restraint of their lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American example . Here was a spiritual splendor which America had created . Like all life , it was waning . Would we create it anew in our own culture ? In South Dakota I lived for a while with a Norwegian banker who aimed to enter politics with the Sermon on the Mount as his sole platform . . . . I could go on . Everywhere I found spiritual energy , religious aspiration ? ignorance only of the means for their expression . Everywhere I found the same America ? my own America : an inarticulate land which yet had spoken loud and clear enough to call me back from Paris . So finally , last year , I went again to Europe . I had put my vision of America
