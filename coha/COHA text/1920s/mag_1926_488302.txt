T HE indications are that the Coolidge Republicans will lobe control of the Senate and probably of the House . We are strengthened in this belief by the tips being sent out from Washington from news sources favorable to Mr. Coolidge that , if the election goes against him , he will interpret it as having no possible meaning in regard to national policies . The various elections , it is being explained on behalf of the President , have degenerated into purely local contests and , therefore , have no bearing whatever upon any national issue . Nevertheless , knowing the ways of politicians , we are perfectly certain that if the election should result as Mr. Coolidge wishes it to , the heavens would ring with Republican assertions that the people have overwhelmingly sustained the President , his every wish , his every utterance , his every act , his every policy . That it is necessary now to discount defeat through the avenues of Coolidge publicity is proof that the White House expects the worst . Yet we , too , believe that the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mandate on any single issue , any more than could most of the recent primaries . This is not so much because the elections have degenerated into local contests as because the opposition stands for nothing , offers nothing , and affords no hope of any constructive reforms . We do not doubt that those are correct who , like Mark Sullivan , declare that the Democrats ' do not wish to control Congress . If they did they would be called upon to think , to act , to be consistent , and to plan ; and Heaven knows they are totally incapable of these things . Never did Congressional leadership so collapse as did that of the Democrats during the last session of Congress . The session seemed to begin brilliantly for the opposition . There were any number of openings in the armor of the Administration . The farm issue was at hand as if made to order , particularly in its relationship to the tariff . Nothing happened . What leadership there was passed to , or rather remained with , the insurgent Republicans . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as are to be found by the dozen in the British Parliament , could have made the Administration as sick and sorry-looking as it deserved to be , providing , of course , that they were backed up by their party . But their party was without harmony as it is without guidance or principle . It not only upheld Mellon , it sought to outdo him in tax benefits to the rich . It had no policy of its own in regard to the war debts  --  or anything else . It is so shot to piece 's on the question of the tariff that it is impossible to conceive of its drafting an honest or radical tariff-reform bill if it should control Congress . Why should there be a rush to vote for it ? It is fortunate , therefore , that there are at least local issues in some States ; that here and there a colorful personality like that of " Al " Smith should stir public interest , and that in three States , at least , Indiana , Illinois , and Pennsylvania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So confused is the situation as to the Wets and Drys that there will be no possibility of either side 's claiming a decisive victory . In some cases , too , the choice between the candidates is so poor that one should not be surprised if the vote should prove to be the smallest in years . Why , for instance , should anyone care whether Senator Willis , or his opponent , ex-Senator Atlee W. Pornerene , is chosen to represent Ohio ? Both are windbags of incredible dulness . In New York , on the other hand , the contest is between Senator James W. Wadsworth , Jr. , and Justice Robert F. Wagner , a Tammany man of German ancestry , of the same type as " Al " Smith . Senator Wadsworth is a militarist to the backbone , an imperialist , a devout upholder of the present order . He carries on the narrowest Republican traditions , but we must add that he does it with a boldness and directness most unusual in politicians , and we can not withhold from him our praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor issue . When it comes to the details of legislation he is useful in the Senate , yet his defeat is , we believe , most desirable . In Illinois , in Indiana , in Pennsylvania the issue is one . of corruption in political life . Since the prospects are for the election both of Congressman Vare in Pennsylvania and of Colonel Frank G. Smith in Illinois , it is at least satisfactory to note that there is small chance of their being allowed to take their seats . The voting in those States and in Indiana where the Republican Party has been a mere tool of the Ku Klux Klan will be significant only as it indicates whether or not the American electorate is beginning to turn against the wholesale corruption in our public life . In Colorado there is a most interesting contest for the Senatorship between ex-Governor Sweet , a good liberal , and Charles W. Waterman , with the chances favoring Mr. Sweet . In Oregon there is a three-cornered fight , variously depicted as turning upon the Administration of President Coolidge and as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent candidacy in defiance of his party leaders makes the Democrats hopeful that they may obtain a seat in that State . In Maryland Representative Tydings is certain to defeat his Republican opponent , Senator Weller . In far-away Arizona and Nevada the sitting members , Senators Cameron and Oddie , are opposed by able and vigorous Democrats whose election is much to be desired . As for Massachusetts , every possible effort is being made to reelect Senator Butler , whose candidacy is treated at length elsewhere in this issue of The Nation . Hbwever one may rate the statesmanship of David I. Walsh , no one who believes in the old-fashioned principles of liberty and free speech in America can vote for Senator Butler , who has demanded that there shall not only be no criticism of a President in war time , but that no unfavorable comment shall be - permitted in time of peace . For the present the hope of political progress in America continues to lie in the independent Senators of Republican faith , headed by ' the veteran George W. Norris of Nebraska , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Congressman Vare , the candidate of his own party . It is heartening , indeed , that this group will be reinforced by Governor Blaine of Wisconsin , by the reelection of ex-Senator Brookhart in Iowa , and of Senator Nye in North Dakota . If in their hands should lie the balance of power in the Senate the country might rejoice . Meanwhile , this election merely emphasizes anew the need for an honest and able third party , for lack of which our whole political life languishes . Cleaning Up the Slums H ENRY FORD set sail with the magnificent assurance to get the boys out of the trenches by Christmas . Now comes Mr. , August Heckscher sailing back to get the men and women out of the slums of New York by Easter  --  or thereabouts . The impulse in each case was , and is as decent and generous as the practical realization is dubious . But perhaps Mr. Heckscher has a better fighting chance . His proposal certainly deserves more than the shrug of the shoulders which the embattled realtors will give it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those super-philanthropists indigenous to the American scene . His $4,000,000 Children 's Foundation , his parks and his playgrounds , have given him no little front-page space , and have done no little good . When he proposed a $40 , - 000,000 farm for educating slum children , New York City officials said that the money could be spent to better effect in the slums themselves . Whereupon , as a " special emissary " of Mayor Walker , Mr. Heckscher went , abroad and proceeded to make a study of slum-reclamation projects in , Europe  --  particularly in London , Berlin , and Hamburg . He found Berlin , for all the financial pressure she was under , putting $40,000,000 into housing for the Poor last year , while London appropriated $34,000,000 for the same purpose . Both were municipal , not private-charity , enterprises . Meanwhile , he points out , tenements in New York which were condemned in 1885 as unfit for human habitation are still good rent-producers , with forty years ' depreciation added to their unspeakable wretchedness . He finds that 70 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,500 per year , thus utterly barring them from adequate housing facilities . In this impasse he proposes  --  take a deep breath  --  that " 500 wealthy and public-spirited citizens each promise a contribution of $100,000 annually for five years . " The State and city of New York shall jointly contribute a like sum over the same period . This will provide $500,000,000 " to get away to a real start on New York 's most pressing and immediate problem . " The total cost of eliminating the city 's slums he places at $1,500,000,000 . " The jab could be completed in from ten to fifteen , years . " He plans five-story " walk-ups , " with perhaps some ten-story model tenements equipped with fool-proof automatic elevators . He plans buildings more attractive than the English type , with shade trees , playgrounds , and plenty of air-space between . For himself , Mr. Heckscher is said to have promised many millions of his personal fortune . ? Now , this is an honest and altogether generous proposal . The difficulties are practical ones , and reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerable and degrading situation . He speaks the utter truth when he says : " New York 's slums are a disgrace to the city and the nation . So are those of other great American cities . " Better a thousand times that his plan be carried out , whatever its shortcomings , than that nothing should be done at all . The first difficulty is to find 500 millionaires with even a tithe of Mr. Heckscher 's sense of social obligation . Granting that they can be found , the next difficulty is to yoke them in double harness with the city and State governments . Governor Smith last spring proposed a housing law in which public authority should take the lead , , with no philanthropy in the enterprise at all . The bill received very wide and very favorable attention , including that of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company . The Republicans blocked certain cardinal provisions as a matter of practical politics , but who doubts that Governor Smith will return to the engagement ? To this proposal Mr. Heckscher pays not the slightest attention , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the two plans have equal chances of ultimate realization , there is no question that a straightforward job on the part of the State is infinitely to be preferred to a quasi-charitable enterprise in which control falls between three stools . If undertaken by public legislation , furthermore , all housing improvement would fall under some rough conception of regional planning ; care would be taken , with the power to enforce it , that the elimination of slums in Manhattan should not mean their prompt development in Brooklyn and the Bronx . Under the Heckscher plan this might readily prove to be the case . The task is too great , and the ramifications too widespread , to be solved successfully by private charity  --  even in nine figures . The Smith program is indeed the reverse of the shield of private charity . That the man on horseback should fling a saddlebag of gold to the crowd still remains something less than justice . Free citizens should build their own houses , and should finance them by such levies as will tend to keep land speculators and bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes , we must perforce welcome all honest slumming-parties . Investors , Beware ! T HE Supreme Court has just rendered a decision which marks an epoch in American history . It has confirmed the confiscation by the Alien Property Custodian of some 4,500 patents , worth perhaps half a billion dollars , for which the nominal sum of $50 each was deposited in the Treasury . The Supreme Court admits that this is confiscation , but states that the confiscation of private enemy property is not unconstitutional , that the procedure did not violate the criminal law or commit fraud , and that the confirmation of the deal by President Wilson placed the sanction of validity upon it . The Supreme Court did not say , as indeed it could not say , that the transaction was not grossly violative of international law . The patents thus acquired were distributed by the Chemical Foundation to the owners of the chemical industry of the United States , who were thus more than repaid for the propaganda money they had spent to mesmerize the public conscience . This propaganda has continued throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of the United States but for the benefit of private monopolists . Justice Stone , as Attorney General , in seeking to set aside as illegal so outrageous a piece of confiscation , remarked " It will be a dark day for this republic when public officials , charged with public duties and responsibilities , can do the acts disclosed by this record without any consequences to them and to those who claim under them . " For the first time in American history the Supreme Court has upheld the confiscation of private property  --  as it assumes , in time of war . For one hundred and fifty years the United States has upheld the immunity from confiscation of private property in time of war . It must be said ? that Congress in 1917 and 1918 did not dream of departing from this tradition . But , persuaded and deceived by A. Mitchell Palmer , that arch-enemy of Bolshevism , and supported by Senator Underwood , it passed an amendment in 1918 ( on the allegation that Palmer should not be making profits for absent owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sale , " in like manner as though he were . the absolute owner . " This was loose language , and Messrs . Palmer and Garvan took advantage of it to perpetrate a raid on the private property intrusted to them as trustees . International law was smashed . The consequences will be borne by the owners of private property , both foreigners in the United States and Americans abroad , for generations to come . When they are robbed of their property in future wars , they may thank Messrs . Palmer and Garvan , who established the precedent which will be applied . Nor will it be necessary to wait for the outbreak of war . Mere political differences may lead to reprisals between nations and to the confiscation of private property without war . This patent confiscation took place several months after the armistice . It was done , therefore , purely in the interests of spoliation and greed , not for the purpose of winning the war . It is but a short step from the post-armistice confiscation of German and Austrian patents to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? confiscation of foreign private property to the confiscation of domestic private property . The transaction is but another sign of the disintegration of the foundations of capitalistic society . Those who have participated in the deal do not realize that they have created a precedent which undermines the security of all private property in the United States and of every American investment abroad . That legal safeguard against confiscation which such investors had is now taken from them , and they are exposed to the whims and accidents of international politics in a way never heretofore contemplated . Americans now have 11 billions invested abroad , increasing at the rate of perhaps a billion a year . Foreign governments confiscating any part of this property need only refer a protesting United States government to the decision of our Supreme Court in the Chemical Foundation case . We have made Russia and Mexico look like amateurs in the arts of confiscation . Peace in the Encyclopaedia O LD-TIME readers of the " Encyclopaedia Britannica " ( we suspect there are many such ) have long regarded any one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammock-book and far more satisfactory for the passing of a winter evening by the fire than any of the detective stories or romances commonly recommended for such purposes . They will greet with glad accord the three new volumes which have just been issued and which seem to mark a return to the great traditions of the work . It is now sixteen years since the Encyclopaedia was completely revised and reprinted . During that time the proprietors have issued two sets of volumes before the present ones ; and neither was satisfactory . " These Eventful Years " was hardly more than a collection of competent magazine articles , and the volumes which constituted the so-called Twelfth Edition , prepared amid the hazes of wartime myopias , were not up to the standard of those which they were intended to supplement . Americanized advertising methods and an appeal to a wider audience than the old Encyclopaedia had ever contemplated also exerted an unfortunate influence . The planning was done from a slightly journalistic angle ; in the allotment of space there were obvious concessions to popular interest in matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be abandoning its position of undisputable supremacy as a summary of the world 's knowledge from the scholar 's viewpoint in order to compete in the already overcrowded field of merely popular education . Fortunately no such criticism can be successfully urged against the new volumes . One might , to be sure , pick some quarrels  --  though far fewer than formerly  --  with the proportionate space allotted to certain topics . Thus it is obviously absurd , sub specie aeternitatis , to allot four pages to recent developments in biochemistry and more than ten pages to the battle of Jutland ; war-shadows still cloud many pages ; but the work as a whole , judged by first tastes and tests , seems to be once more worthy of its great predecessors . The scholar in search of either a specific fact or that sense of refreshment which comes from the contemplation of any subject treated with competent knowledge and detachment may turn to it feeling reasonably sure that in its pages he may , for the time being at least , leave the idols of the market-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be disappointed . Only a blind partisanship , completely out of place in a work of reference , could have led J. C. Squire to leave James Joyce unmentioned in his article on recent English fiction or caused another curiously selected editor of the London Mercury , the author of the notice of Bertrand Russell , to devote the major part of the small space allowed him to a sneering attack upon Mr. Russell 's intellectual integrity . Such lapses are rare and the majority of the articles are marvels of clarity , condensation , and objective presentation . The very titles of these articles reveal succinctly the direction of contemporary discovery , taste , and achievement . In the Thirteenth Edition , Freud was unmentioned , the Quantum Theory unheard of ; today the latter gets three pages ' and the psychological system of the former two . Even in smaller things changes are recorded with minutest exactitude . Thus even in the last former supplementary volumes Theodore ? Dreiser was accorded only one line at the end of a paragraph which spoke in high praise of the novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article to himself , and that fact alone is more significant than anything which a critic or scholar can say of the novelist 's reputation . The Britannica is a sort of Hall of Fame for men , for ideas , and for sciences . To win in it a niche is to have achieved a distinction as significant as any which either the degrees of a college or the acclaim of the populace can give . Whatever is there has had a certain significance in the world ; whatever is not there lacks that special meaning . Curiously enough , the gigantic work begins by making itself ridiculous . This majestic panorama of the world 's knowledge , this grand survey of the terrestrial globe from the Aaland Islands to the Zuyder Zee , this great cooperative effort of the patience and learning of our civilization is dedicated , humbly and " by permission , " to a pair of amiable gentlemen neither majestic nor learned ? George of England and Calvin of America . Not since the present Prince of Wales assumed his presidency of the Royal Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
