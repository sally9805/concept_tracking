txt It goes cuckoo . as is usual , In its expiring days and nights . I wandered out of the mad house , where lawmakers were sweet Adelining and raising a tumult while the bill mumbler at the desk droned out bills on second reading and the bats and night swallows flew in the windows and swooped around the crystal chandeliers , with the portraits of Lincoln and Douglas looking on In astonishment , all of the uplifting of galleries crowded with the beauty and chivalry of the state pay roll . In the speaker 's room I found a bunch of statesmen . " %Visat do you think of the pande ? monium ? " mays one pocket . " Dante never dreamed anything hotter than thl.s. - " ? All they lack is a steam calliope , " says another . " And they call this a deliberative body . " " Deliberative , " says I. " Well , from what I 've seen . I 'd say both houses need new mottoes . " " Bokoo bushwa is the sign I 'd suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the door of the house chamber they might paint , to hell with decorum .

" " How about approprit.tions ? " asks another . - They may get in a Jam . " says T. " The senate is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joint conference sinless something unusual happens . And the house leaders say they will insist on the rule that no i conference report on appropriations shall be considered unless it has been on the desks for three legislative days . It crowds things pretty close to June 30 , one week hence . What wailing if next year 's pay did n't get through In time for the pay rollers . " " They 'll make it in time , " says the Egyptian . " But they ought to cut out the babel and roughhouse ? it gives me a headache . " " 0 , well . " says T. " boys will be boys . And it 's always been thus . But I did get a kick last night when somebody set oft a firecracker while the glee clubs were chanting ' Hail ! Hail ! the gang 's all here , ' and the speaker rapped on the desk and said ' Singing may be all right as a legslative exercise , but we 've got to draw the line at shooting .
