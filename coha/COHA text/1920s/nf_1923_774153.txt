txt  | I was recently discussing this and other kindred natters with a scientific friend , who put the following query to me : " Why have we overlooked these important points for so long ? " In reply I referred to the phrase now in such common use : " Life has become so complex . " In my opinion we have here the crux of the whole matter , and I venture to predict that before we can unravel the horribly tangled skein of our present existence , we must come to a full STOP , and return to conscious , simple living , believing in the unity underlying all things , and acting in a practical way in accordance with the laws and principles involved . In the midst of a world-wide tragedy such as we are witnessing at the present time , a tragedy which seems to have been increasing instead of decreasing in its intensity since the declaration of the Armistice and the work of the peacemakers , surely it behoves every individual to stop ? and I mean this in its fullest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly " psychological " knowledge , derived from his general education , from his religious , political , moral , ethical , social , legal , and economic training , and ask himself the plain , straightforward question , " Why do I believe these things ? " " By what process of reasoning did I arrive at these conclusions ? " If we are even and direct with ourselves in regard to our cherished ideas and ideals , the answer may at first prove a shock to us , to some of us , indeed , almost a knockdown blow . For the truth will be borne in upon us that much of our supposed knowledge has not been real knowledge , and too often the boasted truth a delusion . Many of us may awaken to the fact that the majority of our cherished ideas and ideals are the product , not of any process of reasoning , but of that unreasoning process called impulse , of unbalanced emotion and prejudice ? that is , of ideas and ideals associated with a psycho-physical condition in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need for Substituting in all Spheres the Principle of Prevention on a General Basis for Methods of Cure " on a Specific Basis As we have seen , unreliability of sensory appreciation has been and still is associated with a general deterioration in the  | standard of the health of mankind . Consequently , in the matter of making decisions , man 's conceptions and thoughts have been and still are conditioned by this unreliable sensory appreciation , and still lead him , as in the past , to erroneous conclusions and decisions in the settlement of the new problems with which he has been continually confronted . Nowhere can we find a better illustration of the erroneous conceptions , leading to unbalanced judgment , which are associated with unreliable sensory appreciation , than in man 's choice of a specific " cure " on the " end-gaining " principle ? namely , " physical exercises . " It was his erroneous estimate of the relative value of the principles of prevention and " cure " which permitted him to make this choice , and so to neglect the " means-whereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have evidence of similar unbalanced judgment in all other spheres where the attempted improvement of the individual is concerned , and the erroneous decisions and opinions which result from unbalanced judgment in these spheres are analogous to the error man made in choosing a specific " cure " in his attempts to stem the tide of general deterioration . Each generation has fallen into the same error in this connexion , and in this way has built up a heavy burden for the succeeding one , inasmuch as the necessity for " cure " has increased and still continues to increase at a pace which bids fair to heap upon the individuals of coming generations such a load as will be beyond the power of human endurance . If the methods which have led to this undesirable situation are ever reviewed by the individuals upon whom will devolve the onerous duty of carrying on the scheme called civilization , we shall probably be written down by them as poor , subconsciously directed human beings , rushing wildly from one extreme to another in the howling wilderness of twentieth-century wonders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of reliability of sensory appreciation in the human beings of our time , which has caused them to become overbalanced in many directions , and consequently has deluded them into experimenting blindly in too many spheres . Disaster has followed such experiments in chemistry and death-dealing machines , for instance , in exactly the same way as it would follow the activities of children well supplied with powder  | and matches . The historian of a century or two hence will be able to produce evidence of the psycho-physical state of the peoples of the twentieth century which will show that in this regard they have progressed little on the evolutionary plane beyond the man of the Stone Age , whilst , on the other hand , he will only have to refer to human activities during the years 1914 ? 18 and 1939 ? 45 to convince the most sceptical that human beings of our time have developed a new form of devilry and brutality that surpasses the best efforts of prehistoric man . Should we decide , however , at the present time upon a retrospection such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a psychological moment in man 's experience has undoubtedly arrived for a widespread consideration of the principle of prevention in its fullest application to human needs ( in all " physical , " " mental , " or " spiritual " spheres ) , as they are presented to us at this present world crisis . Investigation will show that the proportion of human energy devoted to prevention and " cure " in the twentieth century in all these spheres may fairly be said to be as nine to one in favour of " cure . " That this is so after some thousands of years of supposed civilization gives food for reflexion . For the idea of seeking and adopting a specific " cure " had its origin , as we have seen , in the experiences of a lowly evolved type of human creature belonging to an earlier period of human development . It goes with a view of life which is narrow and limited , since it represents an attempt on man 's part to gain an immediate " end " without consideration of larger issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto almost unrecognized , that our adoption of the principle of " cure , " with its associated " end-gaining " procedures , as the basis of our attempted reforms in all spheres , means that the foundation of too many of our cherished ideals and beliefs to-day is the same as that from which were built up the instinctive procedures of our earlier ancestors when they sought a " cure " in some specific herb or berry . On the other hand , a scheme of life in which prevention is the leading principle does not involve working for an immediate " end " ; its application , rather , is on a broad , constructive basis , without limits , humanly speaking , and is the product of a consciously conceived and consciously executed plan ? in  | short , it is the conception of a highly evolved type of human creature . Illustration I I need not detain my readers with the many obvious illustrations of the lack of reasoning associated with all methods of " cure . " I will give three instances , beginning with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels out of sorts and has suffered from certain symptoms for a year or more . He at last consults his medical adviser and is told that his liver is sluggish . He is ordered to take some grains of calomel or some such drug , and goes home with the conviction that all will now be well . He has his " remedy " and the plan is so simple . If the symptoms recur , all he has to do is to swallow the prescribed number of grains of his drug . This applies to the whole list of such " cures . " At this point I would beg my reader not to judge my standpoint until I have placed my evidence before him . We , the people of the twentieth century , pride ourselves that we are a reasoning race ; at any rate , that we have employed the processes of reasoning in far more spheres than our forbears of several centuries ago . This being so , why have the reasoning processes been so comparatively little employed in connexion with those problems on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us consider , for instance , how the person of our illustration reasons in connexion with his sluggish liver and his calomel remedy . It is quite understandable that , on the occasion of an acute attack , he should follow the instructions of his doctor , take his grains of calomel , and so get clear , as he considers it , of a crisis . But why does the matter end there , as far as he , presonally , is concerned ? He has probably been aware of trouble for quite a long time , and now he has it on his doctor 's authority that his liver is unduly inactive . As a matter of fact , he has suspected this himself , led to the conclusion by the presence of certain symptoms and by the knowledge that his sedentary life and his over-indulgence in certain foods and drinks , which are particularly gratifying to his none-too-reliable sensory appreciation ( in this case , particularly the sense of taste ) , are liable to have caused the  | trouble . This being so , one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . It would not require any special degree of reasoning to enable him to grapple successfully with the obvious facts of his case . But unfortunately he does not think beyond the crisis of the moment . He is set only on being " cured " of his specific ill , and so , in the twentieth century , he continues to act on the " endgaining " principle , a procedure which was excusable in his forbears of four thousand years ago . He has never applied either to himself or to the difficulties encountered in the sphere of his psycho-physical well-being , any other principle than that of working for an immediate " end . " In these spheres he has never adopted the plan of reasoning out first the common-sense means whereby an " end " may be secured . Why should he do it now ? He is simply a subconsciously controlled person in whom , in this connexion , the processes of reasoning are in abeyance . An interesting fact , however , is that the drug devotee , on discovering that calomel , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drug and yet another , and so on , in spite of numerous failures . This serves to show that within one narrow groove he is prepared to make changes , actually to reason out , for instance , that even if calomel fails , podophyllin may prove to be the liver elixir . But he is held down to the " cure idea " of the Stone Age by his confidence in drugs , and thus remains true to one of the most harmful habits which he has inherited as race instincts . Think for a moment of the harmful nature of the building process indicated in the foregoing illustration , where you have a man , supposedly advanced , still clinging to primitive methods of " cure , " instead of adopting the only principle a highly evolved , reasoning human creature could conceive of or tolerate ? the great comprehensive principle of prevention . If in all his decisions his reasoning processes had not been limited within such a narrow groove , it must have dawned upon him that his liver trouble was the sign that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a conception which would have tended to cause him to consider the guiding and controlling processes involved . For when a machine , animate or inanimate , has developed mechanical defects , that machine is not functioning at its  | maximum , and , with the continued use of the machine , these defects not only become more and more pronounced , but actually increase in number . It is obvious , then , that as soon as the mechanical defects are recognized , all possible means should at once be employed to restore the maximum standard of mechanical functioning . In order to accomplish this , a knowledge of the motive , adjusting , guiding , and controlling principles of the mechanism is needed . In the case of the human mechanisms , a knowledge of the psycho-mechanical principles involved is necessary to their co-ordinated use , and this knowledge implies the possession of a sensory appreciation which is reliable . For in all cases of so-called mental and physical shortcomings there are present imperfections and defects in the use of the psycho-physical organism . If the sense registers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reliable , how could these imperfections and defects have developed in a satisfactorily co-ordinated person ? And if the sense registers are so unreliable and deceptive that a person can develop imperfections and defects in the ordinary activities of life , what may be expected as a result of his activities in remedial and other spheres , i if he continues to be guided by the same imperfect sense registers which have deceived and are still deceiving him at every turn ? The time is not far distant when these facts will be widely recognized , and it will then be obvious that , immediately we decide to do something to remove a psycho-physical imperfection or defect , the first thing is to acquire gradually a reliable sensory appreciation during a process of re-education , readjustment , and co-ordination on a basis of constructive , conscious guidance and control . footnote i Many of my readers may object to these arguments and refer to some defect or imperfection which at sonic time they have removed , with or without aid , as the case may be . I am quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other defects and imperfections will have been cultivated in the process . As a matter of fact , I am prepared to prove this , if the objector will submit himself or herself for examination whilst he or she demonstrates the process adopted for the " cure . " Incidentally , I may mention that these examinations are made whilst the subject remains dressed .  | Illustration II This important point is unfortunately overlooked in all curative spheres , so that palliative and " end-gaining " specific methods prevail , and a good illustration of this may be found in the field of surgery . In all that follows on this point , however , I wish to make it clear that I am not lacking in the fullest appreciation of the value of surgery in special spheres , or of the good results that may accrue from skilful surgery within these spheres . But I should like , if I may , to suggest that it is possible for the surgeon to confer in the future far greater benefits on humanity than those which he is conferring at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation and his outlook to include the wider plan of prevention . Take , for instance , the major operations of the removal of the appendix or of the colon . The surgeon 's business is to remove these organs in cases where he finds a condition of deterioration which justifies him in concluding that the presence of these organs is harmful or even dangerous . It will be seen , therefore , that to this extent the sphere of surgery is confined within narrow limits . The surgeon is asked to examine an organ which is functioning imperfectly , and if he concludes from this examination that a certain stage of deterioration of the particular organ has been reached , he performs an operation . Under this method of procedure , little consideration is given to the cause or causes of the general interference with the functioning of the whole organism , an interference of which the specific deterioration in the appendix , or colon , is merely a symptom . Nor do I find that consideration is given , as a rule , to the fact that the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reliable sensory appreciation necessary to the readjustment and co-ordinated use of the mechanisms , by means of which adequate vital activity'will be restored and the dropped viscera caused to resume their normal and healthy position in the torso . This point is in no way affected by the fact that an operation may be entirely successful from the standpoint of the successful removal of an organ which , being in a state of deterioration , is a danger to the patient . The patient recovers from his operation , but , even so , what is implied by this ? The patient , it is true , has escaped the result of a crisis which  | might have proved fatal , but we are still face to face with the same old " end-gaining " principle . The appendix was diseased , the appendix was removed , and the patient recovers from the operation . Nothing , however , in all this has been done to introduce such a change in the working of the psychophysical mechanisms and general functioning as would prevent a continuance of the imperfect working and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This original imperfect functioning not only continues , but is bound to become more and more imperfect as time goes on , and , sooner or later , some other dangerous symptom ( due to increasingly imperfect functioning ) is almost certain to supervene , when the same palliative remedysurgery ? will again have to be called upon to give relief in a new direction . In the recognition of these facts lies the surge in 's opportunity to pass from the narrow sphere of curative work to the greater achievements that are awaiting him in the broad and comprehensive field of prevention . Illustration III Another form of treatment to which I should like to draw attention in this connexion is psycho-analysis . This method has enjoyed a certain publicity in recent years , but in spite of the " cures " which are claimed for it , I am prepared to demonstrate that it is based on the same specific " end-gaining " principle as the less modern methods which it is claimed by some to supersede . By way of illustration I will take the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to a psycho-analyst for help in overcoming it . We will suppose that in the course of the analysis , long or short as the case may be , the teacher and the pupil together unravel the knot and decide that the origin of the fear lies in some event , or train of events , which took place in the past and unduly excited the patient 's fear reflexes and established a " phobia . " For the sake of our illustration , we will say that a " cure " is made . What does this " cure " indicate , however ? Wherein lies the fundamental change in the patient 's psycho-physical condition ? Before we can answer these questions , we must take into consideration the all-important fact to which I drew attention  | at the very outset of this book ? namely , that all so-called mental activity is a process governed by our psycho-physical condition at the time when the particular stimulus is received . This being so , it is obvious that the reason a person falls a victim to some unreasoning fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he receives the stimulus , to which the fear is the reaction , is below a normal and satisfactory standard . ' For , if his condition of general functioning were normal , his reaction to the particular sensory stimulus would be a normal reaction , not an unreasoning " phobia . " It follows , therefore , that the patient of our illustration must have been below the standard of normal psycho-physical functioning at the time of the establishment of the " phobia " ? that is , he must have been beset with a condition of debauched kinesthesia , the result of imperfect co-ordination , imperfect adjustment , and unreliable and delusive sensory appreciation . The question , then , I must again ask is , What can be done by the " unravelling " procedure of psychoanalysis to remedy these serious defects of general psycho-physical functioning ? Will psychoanalysis as practised restore a reliable sensory appreciation to the patient , and co-ordinate and re-educate his psycho-physical mechanisms on a general basis ? Certainly . not . The psycho-physical condition which permitted the establishment of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed is the stimulus . The method of psychoanalysis , therefore , like other methods of treatment on a subconscious basis , is an instance of an " end-gaining " attempt to effect the " cure " of a specific trouble by specific means , without consideration being given to the necessity of restoring a satisfactory standard of general psycho-physical functioning and of sensory appreciation . Fundamental Defect in Our Plan of Civilization a Lack of Recognition of the Importance of the Principle of Prevention on a General Basis It is the recognition in practice of the principle of prevention which makes possible man 's advancement to higher and footnote It is common knowledge that a person is more subject to infections ( colds , etc. ) when he is , as we say , run down ? that is , in a more or less lowered psycho-physical condition .  | higher stages of evolution and opens up the greatest possibilities for human activities and accomplishment . I have illustrated and insisted upon this point thus fully because I wish to emphasize what in my opinion constitutes a fundamental defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ? namely , that in all attempts at reform or improvement in spheres where the well-being of the creature is concerned , human energy has been and still is expended mainly on the adoption of plans based upon methods of specific cure , instead of upon the principle of prevention . For many years past I have endeavoured to put this point of view before those who have consulted me , for I have found that in the case of a new pupil , even after I have made my diagnosis of the malconditions present , explained their actual cause or causes , and described the practical procedures I should adopt to remedy such malconditions , I am still generally asked , " Have you ever cured ' a case like mine ? " In answer I point out that I do not undertake to " cue " anything or anyone.l I footnote i As I write these words , I can imagine my readers , sooner or later , asking this question , " Why , then , if you advocate a plan of life founded on the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more or less curative sphere ? " The answer to this is simple . In the first place , the principle of prevention should be applied to children at a very early age ; and , secondly , up to the present it has proved impossible to create a sufficient demand for fundamental psycho-physical reeducation to induce young men and women to study it with a view to professional teaching in the preventive sphere . This implies that their work must be confined to children , and the reader will at once see the difficulty in which we are placed . We are faced with the inevitable law of supply and demand . Parents must first be themselves convinced of the need for fundamental psycho-physical re-education , and of the value of the technique I have to offer , before they will entrust their children for the time necessary and in sufficient numbers to create a demand that will make it possible for young men and women to take up the work on a sound professional and financial basis . Up till now what the parents have said is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you are able to eure ' our psycho-physical defects , we will consider the matter in relation to our children . " It is in vain that I protest that I do not set out to " cure " anything . " You see , " they reply , " for us to accept your work as the basis of our children 's education means such a complete change in all our views and methods ; it means practically beginning afresh , and giving up so much that we have been taught is e ; true up till now , that we can not interfere with our children 's education without first having the proof of your work in ourselves . " Some of my scientific supporters are no less insistent on these points . Under these  | merely look at the subject before me as a damaged machine , as it were , note the badly used mechanisms , the imperfect sensory direction and control , and in the light of my experience ask myself , " Can one restore this machine , improve the mechanical working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restore a well-co-ordinated condition of the psycho-physical organism as a whole ? " In other words , instead of trying to remove specific symptoms directly ( method of " cure " ) , I endeavour to bring about such a readjustment of the organism as a whole that the symptoms in question disappear in the process and are not likely to recur if the new conditions are maintained ( principle of prevention ) . This implies in the case of some pupils a long process , for it means a gradual building-up of new and satisfactory psycho-physical use , and the pupils ' co-operation in this process must be based upon a reasoning , rather than a blind acceptance of the principles involved . If , at the end of our talk , I consider that there is any doubt on the part of the prospective pupil , I beg him to read my book , study the principles therein set down , and then , if he comprehends and believes in these principles , I suggest that he should come to me for help , but not otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come simply footnote circumstances , my reader will understand that I am forced to work in a so-called curative sphere with adults , in the hope that they may help me in my efforts to gain a wide recognition of the necessity for re-education on a general basis and for preventive measures for the children . For once we have created among parents a demand for teachers of the work in the interests of the children , the first part of the problem will have been solved , for the supply , the material will be there , and will in time bring the right type of man and woman into the work . I am anxious and ready to devote the rest of my life , and the experience I have gained , relatively small though this may be , to preparing teachers to teach the children . To this end we need to establish a school for the education of teachers . Such a plan , however , is not without its difficulties , if the right type of man or woman is to be induced to take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America have been working with me to the end of establishing such a school . We are all aware of the harm we can do to the cause if we attempt to gain this end quickly , at the cost of training only those people who are able to bear the financial burden involved during the necessary years of training , irrespective of the standard to which those psycho-physical potentialities , which go to the making of a teacher , have been developed in their case . Such an attempt could end only in comparative failure , and in the long run do much to delay the wide acceptance of the principles involved .  | because he believes that I can " cure " him of something . I am ready to admit that anything will sometimes effect a " cure , " as " cure " is generally understood , but the case of the exceptional " cure , " by whatever means ? whether by a course of medical treatment , by suggestion , transfer , or by any other method , accompanied as these " cures " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in attempting or promising a continuance of " cures " on these lines . I hold that we have reached a stage in our development when all attempts to remove the cause or causes of suffering which do not come within the scope of reasoned , practical procedure must , with the broader view , be definitely abandoned , and that we should ere now have passed that stage of ignorance and narrowness which permits the human creature to entertain for a moment the idea of a miracle . The miracle-worker and the advocates of " cure " methods have had free scope for over two thousand years , but despite this fact there has been a gradual increase in malconditions and in the symptoms and complications connected therewith , and therefore a correspondingly increasing need for " cure . " I would even state that in my opinion the fact that man has not been guided by his reasoning processes in connexion with the problems of his well-being is responsible for the tragedy of his progress in civilization . The crisis of 1914 serves to show us that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by means of which millions of his fellow-beings have been swept from the earth , and it would seem that man is simply preparing the way for his own extinction unless those energies , which in the past have been directed into harmful channels in the outside world , are in future directed and controlled by reasoning processes which have been primarily employed in connexion with the use of his psycho-physical organism . This horrible recrudescence of barbarity is for the moment held in check , but , like a fire whose white-heated embers have been cooled by water on the outside ? a process which has merely served to intensify the degree of heat of the embers which this drenched crust encloses  --  it will sooner or later burst once more into flame ) . Every ember , which in our analogy footnote 1 These words , written after the 1914-18 war , have been borne out by the events of I939-45. - F.M . A.  | represents an individual human being , must be dealt with singly and separately , and if we wish to prevent another fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will be as difficult to fire it as it is to fire a piece of stone . Similar treatment of the individual human creature on a basis of constructive conscious control will bring nearer that stage of evolutionary development where the masses , when thrown together , will no longer exhibit the inflammable traits associated with the herd instinct . It is clear , then , that our first efforts to enable man to rise above the depths in which he is now struggling , and from which many people to-day believe he can not extricate himself , should be devoted to the establishment in the individual of a reliable sensory appreciation by means of conscious , reasoning guidance , so as to prevent the recurrence of the disasters which have hitherto been associated with the activities of men and women whose judgments , opinions , and policies have been based more upon a deteriorated sense of feeling than upon reasoning . Just stop for a moment and think , for instance , of the lack of reasoning associated with the continuance of a plan of life under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted gradually to develop imperfections and defects , so that long ere the age of adolescence is reached , some curative method of treatment has to be adopted in an attempt to eradicate imperfections and defects which , under a reasoning plan of life , would never have been permitted to become present . Under such a reasoning plan of life , the principle of prevention would be the fundamental underlying the child 's education , which means that from the beginning preventive measures would be adopted where the well-being of the child is concerned . The attempt to deal with a form of education based on a principle of prevention will lead into many fields of discussion , and probably force me , by way of illustration , to set down descriptions of technical evolutions , a procedure which , on the face of it , would seem to be an encouragement to people to cling to the " curative " and to neglect the preventive plan of life . But I wish here to free myself from responsibility for any such serious harm as invariably follows the attempt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions for some exercise , drill , etc. , with the aim of eradicating a defect or imperfection . I have already pointed out in Man 's Supreme Inheritance that even though a person may succeed by this means in eradicating some specific defect or imperfection , he will be cultivating in the process quite a number of other defects , and in what follows I hope to make clear the reason for this generally unrecognized fact . For the fundamental shortcoming underlying all human psycho-physical defects , imperfections , and peculiarities is an imperfect and often delusive sensory appreciation , and until those conditions are restored in which the sensory appreciation ( sense register ) becomes again a more or less reliable guide , all exercises are a positive danger . A reliable sensory appreciation , therefore , is an essential , and we will proceed to consider the part which this invaluable human endowment must play in any reasoned and satisfactory plan of education . I shall therefore devote the rest of this volume to an examination of the part played by sensory appreciation in the process called education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is clear from tragic evidence all around us that , despite the influence of our past education , we have not been enabled to stem the rapid progress of human psycho-physical deterioration . I shall attempt by practical illustrations to demonstrate that the establishment of a reliable sensory appreciation must be the foundation of education of children and of adults in what we call the act of learning and learning to do , or in the performance of all the activities which make up the daily round of occupations and recreations.  | AT no time in our history has the same general interest been shown in education ( taking this word in its widest sense ) as is manifested at the present day . The experiences of the War and of the world-wide unrest which has followed it have caused all thinking men and women to put to themselves searching questions as to the validity of long-cherished beliefs in every sphere , and nowhere has the searchlight been more vigorously used than in the sphere of education . Articles dealing with defects in educational methods appear with regularity in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of new methods are being advocated , so that the state of confusion and uncertainty , of which we are all so conscious in the world outside , is equally apparent in the educational world . This state of confusion and uncertainty , experienced in the practical application of educational theories , has its parallel in that which is experienced in our attempts to decide as to the merit or demerit of any particular system , and for the reason that until now such decisions have remained within the doubtful range of individual opinion , which is too often formed subconsciously and based chiefly upon results . In the endeavour to make plain what , in my opinion , constitutes the fundamental cause of this generally chaotic condition , I should like to begin by drawing attention to a fact which , though well known , has been practically disregarded in all forms of past and present education , and , indeed , in all our dealings with our fellow-beings in every sphere . This fact is that whenever we wish to convey to anyone a new idea , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , to teach him something , the person wishing to make use of it  | by that psycho-physical activity which we call learning something must first get his or her conception of what is indicated by those written or spoken words , and his practical use of the new idea will be conditioned by this conception . This applies equally when similar attempts are made by any process of self-instruction ( auto-education ) . It then follows that in the sphere of acquiring knowledge , especially psycho-physical knowledge , this matter of the particular person 's conception of written or spoken words is all-important , for it is the construction which the learner , adult or child , places upon what he hears or reads which determines the course of his actions or the trend of his opinions . Yet the ordinary teacher acts and the ordinary teaching methods are based on the assumption that the pupil 's conception of a new idea is identical with that of the teacher , the words " teacher " and " pupil " being here used in the widest possible sense . Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently disappointment and failure in their studies , or anything else , are due to their not understanding exactly what is required of them . The daily experiences of life are studded with instances of misunderstanding , not only in trivial matters , but also in matters of great importance , and , if the broad view is taken , I think we may justly say that the great majority of these experiences constitute one long series of specific and general misunderstandings and lead us to the conclusion that , where misunderstanding occurs , there is present some impeding factor ( or factors ) which interferes with the process of reasoning , a process inseparable from what is called understanding or " mental conception . " The significance , however , of the fact that a person 's attempt to make practical use of a new idea is conditioned by his conception of the written or spoken word can not be fully realized until we connect it with the further fact , that this conception , in its turn , is conditioned by the standard of the psychophysical functioning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensory appreciation ; in other words , that the accuracy or otherwise of the individual conception depends upon the standard of psycho-physical functioning and of sensory appreciation present . It is our total disregard of this fundamental fact that , in my opinion , is at the root of all the confusion and uncertainty so prevalent to-day  | in the sphere of education , and , for that matter , in every sphere of practical life . For , if the foregoing is true , we can see at once how essential it is that in the matter of conveying and imparting knowledge ? in other words , in education ? we should be able to command a high standard of psycho-physical functioning iii the whole organism , associated with that growth and development which makes for the continuous raising both of this standard and of the standard of sensory appreciation ; and , further , that in order to arrive at sound conclusions concerning the fundamentals upon which any scheme of education should be based , we must first take into consideration the standard of psycho-physical functioning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in what we hope is to be a progressive future . Unfortunately , a satisfactory standard of psycho-physical functioning has not been considered an essential either in the early or subsequent schemes of education which man , whilst depending mainly upon subconscious guidance and control , has adopted in the attempt to make what is known as " mental " progress . Even to-day this essential factor does not seem to be considered an essential , for in this regard modern methods of education are as lacking as those which have obtained for generations . The seriousness of this position is at once apparent when we take into consideration the fact that , during the past two hundred years , the standard of sensory appreciation in the great majority of people has become harmfully lowered , with the result that mankind has generally become more and more imperfectly co-ordinated and has developed serious defects . Yet , in spite of this , the teachers and originators of modern systems , like those of an earlier date , are still trying to help individuals to progress towards a higher state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving them dependent on subconscious experiences for guidance and control , without any consideration or , indeed , understanding of the harm that results from attempts to obey instructions made by people who are guiding themselves by an unreliable and often delusive appreciation . The problem , then , with which we are faced is that the human beings to be educated to-day are already saddled with  | a more or less debauched kinxsthesia , a condition in which psycho-physical reactions are abnormal and harmful . Satisfactory education is incompatible with abnormal and harmful reactions , and a teaching technique , therefore , to be satisfactory , must be one that will meet the needs of those who are beset with the varying and more or less serious defects in the employment of the psycho-physical mechanisms which are responsible for unsatisfactory and harmful reactions . We shall now attempt to outline some of these defects and to indicate the difficulties they present to both teacher and pupil in any attempt to teach or to learn something , and we will start by E considering them in connexion with the child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that , though there may be a large increase in the number of parents who do not need compulsion in the matter of sending their children to school , ti the idea that a child should go to school is too often a preconceived idea with them , not a reasoned conviction . It is probable that very few parents have given due consideration to the effect of sending a child to school , other than that it should be educated . To most people the educational process is one by means of which the child is to acquire knowledge and be put right in all matters where he is judged to be wrong . This judgment is usually the outcome of the combined experience of his teacher and parents , the former being influenced by the latter , as all parents have more or less fixed ideas in regard to the present and future needs of the child , and choose the school in accordance with their ideas in this particular.l They also have very definite ideas concerning the processes which should be involved , in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have justified them in holding these fixed opinions . Further , it occurs to very few of them to consider whether , in this process of " education " ( i.e. , in certain specific directions ) , the child 's fear reflexes will not be unduly and harmfully excited by the injunction that it must always try to " be right , " 2 indeed , that it is almost a footnote Incidentally , I should like to say that in a properly constituted civilization based on a principle of conscious control , parents would be qualified by training and experience to know their child 's needs , and , what is more to the point , they would know how to satisfy these , if need be . 2 The idea of " right " is almost always associated with product or result , not with method of operation . We have only to listen to any  | disgrace to be wrong ; that the teachers concerned do not even know how to prevent the child from acquiring the very worst psycho-physical use of itself whilst standing or sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or performing its other duties ; that on account of the methods of cramming and other means adopted in the act of learning , there is being cultivated a harmful psycho-physical condition ? one result being recognized in a loss of memory ? which in our time has developed to such a serious point that it has paved the way for the exploitation of educated people by means of various methods , such as " memory systems , " etc . " In this matter of sending children to school , we must realize that any undue excitement of the fear reflexes in the daily routine of school work has a very serious effect upon the respiratory processes , 2 which are so closely linked up with the emotions , and when in addition we consider the detrimental effect upon these processes of the defective use of the organism : s footnote lesson from this point of view to realize that the directions the child receives , such as " sit up straight , " " speak out , " " take a deep breath , " " see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific " end-gaining " instructions which rarely include the correct means whereby he can carry them out . It is only when instructions include the correct " meanswhereby " that the process of carrying them out involves the satisfactory use of the psycho-physical mechanisms concerned . 1 All these systems , being framed , however , on the " specific " or " end-gaining " principle , are devoid of the fundamentals of satisfactory psycho-physical development . Incidentally , in connexion with failing memory , the following is exceedingly interesting . We are all aware that a sluggish liver does not make for the best use of the " mental " powers , and we know people who , through bad habits of over-indulgence , have reached a stage of liver and kidney disorder when their reasoning processes are seriously interfered with and they are conscious of a temporary comparative loss of memory . Facts such as these serve to remind us of the interdependence of " mental " and " physical " activity . If the vital functioning of the " physical " mechanisms and organs is inadequate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mental " machinery gradually less and less efficient . In such a case it is very difficult to understand in what mysterious way the ordinary memory system can enable one to remedy the " physical " disorders indicated , and if it does not , a successful result is highly improbable . See , further , Chapter on " Memory and Feeling . " 2 As Byron wrote : " Breathless as we stand when feeling most . " 2 This defective use will be even more pronounced when the arms are employed in the ordinary acts of life , particularly in the acts of writing ,  | during study at school desks and in school chairs ( for in study , as in deep sleep , the respiratory processes are reduced to their minimum of activity ) , in standing , walking , and , in fact , during the assumption of any ordinary posture , we are faced with a problem which no scheme on a subconscious basis will solve . For when harmful conditions such as have been mentioned are present in the child , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general activities . In the attempt to improve its handwriting , for instance , new faults will be developed in the general use of the psycho-physical mechanisms , and the established defects will tend to become more pronounced . It is obvious that knowledge , acquired in this way , is being acquired at a cost represented by an interference with the general control , and particularly with the use of those psycho-physical mechanisms upon which respiratory control depends . With these conditions present , the child lacks the psycho-physical equipment essential to the best efforts in learning something . The gradual lowering of the respiratory and other vital processes during study is undoubtedly one of the impeding factors which make for the dreamy condition ? often amounting almost to stupor ? into which people of the student and orthodox " thinking class " drift . I am ready to admit that there is a steadily growing minority of parents who want more for their children than for them to read and write , do sums , etc. , and who will say that what they desire for them is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there have been changes and modifications in certain spheres of education , whilst in others attempts have been made to counter supposed evils or defects . These attempts , unfortunately , are too often merely a reaction from one extreme to another . But beyond this , the fatal defect in all such instances of attempted reforms on a subconscious plane is that they have been , and still are , based footnote drawing , etc . The arm resting on the table or desk will be wrongly employed as a support for the body , and the arm , hand , and fingers engaged in the movements necessary for the act of writing will also come in for criticism , the result being harmful to the child 's organism as a whole , thereby seriously impeding progress in the act of learning penmanship , and , in many cases , making a satisfactory result practically impossible .  | on the principle of a specific , not of a general development , and that whatever form the attempt may take in a particular school , we shall find that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's organism as a whole , nor with any recognition of the fact that the child of to-day does not start life with the standard of co-ordination and sensory appreciation enjoyed by the children of , say , two hundred years ago.1 Its psycho-physical mechanisms are not nearly as reliable , nor its ingenuity at a given age as great as theirs in relation to most psycho-physical acts in the practical way of life . As a result , by the time the ordinary child reaches school age , certain wrong uses of the psycho-physical mechanism have become established , constituting a serious condition which baffles the most thoughtful teachers.2 Anyone having a doubt in this connexion will be convinced by visiting any school with an expert capable of pointing out the defects of which we speak , and of indicating the influence of these defects upon the whole organism in daily activity . The head of an important preparatory school came to consult the writer in the hope that some solution might be found for what she rightly considered the problem of the school . She said that although all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , and opportunity for " free expression " had been adopted in this school , the problem still remained unsolved , whilst the urgency for its solution became more and more apparent to all concerned . She admitted that , until she had read Man 's Supreme Inheritance , she could not understand why the active outdoor life did not serve to prevent or eradicate the physical defects and shortcomings in the children which gave cause for such serious consideration . But of what avail are good hygienic conditions , an outdoor life , a greatly improved environment , " free activi- footnote I have drawn attention to this fact in Man 's Supreme Inheritance . 2 As one teacher wrote : " No one who observes carefully the predominant characteristics of the present generation can fail to note : " ( I ) Alarming imperfections of physique , i.e. , defects of spine , wrong posture , lack of correct co-ordination of muscles in bodily acts , depressed stature , etc. " ( 2 ) No less great limitations in the purely mental field , e.g. , domination by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of view , failure to grasp the essentials of freedom , etc . All this is symptomatic of some underlying cause . "  | ties , " and " physical exercises , " whilst the child that is to be given an " all-round development " under these conditions is actually allowed to use himself during his activities in ways which interfere to such an extent with the psycho-mechanics of his respiratory processes that these are working nearer to their minimum than to their maximum capacity , and this in spite of the fact that his teachers would unanimously agree that the proper working of these processes is the most vital element in the child 's development ? 1 The almost universal call for physical drill , or physical exercises , in schools , for training in posture , breathing exercises , etc. , coming from parents , teachers , and all concerned , is an admission that there is a great need in this direction , but , unfortunately , these methods will not give the necessary help . The harmful effects of the child 's psycho-physical experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of the movements involved in any forms of exercises , drill , posture , calisthenics , etc. , for the defects resulting from these daily psycho-physical experiences are the manifestations of a badly adjusted and imperfectly co-ordinated machine , guided and controlled by a delusive sensory appreciation , and therefore functioning much nearer to its minimum than to its maximum capabilities . The problem is further complicated in that there has been and still is a continual increase in the educational demands which are being made upon the child , unavoidably , it is supposed , in the present stage of civilization . For the increase in the degree of mal-co-ordination present in the child continues in the same ratio as the difficulties to be overcome in any attempt to eradicate defects , whilst at the same time the degree of difficulty which the child will encounter in connexion with its lessons or other activities will be in accord with the degree of imperfect general functioning . This again means that the child , to ensure success , must of necessity devote more and more time to these subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him , involving longer footnote 1 I must refer my reader to Man 's Supreme dnheyitance in regard to the failure of " physical exercises " and drill to eradicate such defects as are present . It is possible to prove by demonstration that even if a specific defect should chance to be eradicated , several others , often more harmful , will be cultivated during the process of eradication.  | hours of work and increased effort , and the increasing complications these imply . How can the psycho-physical mechanisms of the children meet these demands satisfactorily , when they are functioning much nearer to their minimum than to their maximum possibilities ? And what is to happen if the educational demands continue to increase , whilst the psychophysical possibilities of the children continue to decrease , as they surely will , unless the defects which make for badly coordinated use of the psycho-physical self are eradicated , and instead there is set in motion a process of genuine development on a plane of conscious control in the use of the organism ? We must remember also that every attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire knowledge makes a psycho-physical demand , and that the child 's efforts , when judged on a general and not a specific basis , will always be in accordance with the standard of psycho-physical functioning of its organism . Where harmful conditions such as those we have indicated above are present in a child , the teacher , in any attempt to remedy specific defects ( such as , for instance , defects in a child 's handwriting ) , must take into account the standard of the general psycho-physical use of the child , otherwise the attempt will result not only in the development of new faults in this use , but also in a tendency to strengthen any old-established imperfect uses . It follows , therefore , that in those cases where the psychophysical mechanism is imperfect and functioning more or less inadequately , we can not expect the best results in the conveyance or the acquisition of knowledge . There is a lack of co-ordination of the parts of the organism involved in the process called education , so that any attempts made to learn something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally to all processes of self-instruction ) must tend to the cultivation of new psycho-physical defects and can not fail to exaggerate the old ones . The child 's early efforts in learning any simple subject which forms part of the curriculum are on a specific basis ; that is , the child 's work is planned for him from the beginning on " end-gaining " lines of teaching him to do specific things in specific ways , and of teaching him to try to get these specific things " right , " and long ere the stage of adolescence is reached , this " end-gaining " procedure will have become established , associated with a bad psycho-physical  | attitude towards the acceptance of new ideas and new experiences , and too often with a serious deterioration in memory . When these defects and shortcomings are present , they constitute two impeding factors which could account for the general lack in the majority of adults to link up knowledge.i Knowledge is of little use in itself ; it is the linking up of what we know with that which comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences which is of value , and this ability to link up is inseparable from the processes concerned with remembering . In other words , the value of knowledge lies in our power to make use of it in association with the greater knowledge which should come to us as we increase in years of experience , and as we substitute reasoning for instinct and for what Professor Dewey calls " emotional gusts . " Our first consideration , therefore , in all forms of education must be in regard to securing for the child the highest possible standard of psycho-physical functioning during his attempts to master the different processes which make up the educational scheme . In this way the child will make a fair start , and , what is more to the point , he will continue to improve the conditions involved , hand in hand with his efforts as a pupil in all other spheres of activity . The plan of education we advocate is a comprehensive one , such as will not only meet the needs of the human creature at the present stage of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he passes from this present stage of subconscious guidance and control through the progressive evolutionary stages which lead to a higher and still higher state of civilization . The test of man 's advance in this connexion demands a consideration of ( I ) the plane of consciousness reached in his recognition of incorrect psycho-physical use within the organism , and footnote I fully realize that efforts are being made to link up and correlate subjects in the school curriculum which were formerly taught as separate subjects , or to group various subjects round one central idea , as the teaching of history in connexion with drama , mathematics , and carpentering , nature with the drawing lesson , etc . But this again is specific correlation , and does not affect the point I have raised as to the need for co-ordination of the child 's organism as a whole and for the co-ordinated use of this organism in every activity and interest in life .  | in the employment of that organism in all psycho-physical activity in every-day life ; ( 2 ) the standard of his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he has become convinced of its value and of its superiority to older and longcherished ideas , associated with a keen desire for the new experiences which go hand in hand with new and expanding ideas , and for that standard of psycho-physical development which will enable him to profit by the experiences ; ( 3 ) the standard of his ability to adapt himself to the rapid changes of environment in civilization with benefit , instead of detriment or injury , to his psycho-physical self ; ( 4 ) the standard of his ability to hold in abeyance the fear of giving up his job , in whatever profession , trade , or calling this may be , and boldly to make the necessary change , should he find that the fundamental principles concerned are defective ; and to make the necessary adjustmerits which are essential to the acceptance and assimilation of new and approved knowledge whilst going on with his job . The foregoing serves to outline principles which are worthy of first consideration in all forms of education which are to meet satisfactorily the present and future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that the knowledge of the satisfactory and adequate use of the organism is of first importance , for it is upon this satisfactory and adequate use that the degree of our success depends in meeting the demands made upon us in educational and all other spheres of activity . The consideration of principles in connexion with any plan of education leads naturally to the consideration of the technique , the means whereby these principles are to be carried out , and in the pages of this book we are concerned with the technique to be employed in putting the principles I have outlined to practical use in the work of re-education , co-ordination , and readjustment on a conscious plane . At this point it is necessary to remember that all teaching methods on the subconscious basis are formulated on the principle that if a pupil suffers from some defect , imperfection , or peculiarity that needs to be eradicated , he must at once do  | something ( usually with the help of a teacher ) to eradicate the defect or defects . The teacher on a subconscious basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his business to teach the pupil to do something to eradicate his defects , the " doing " in this connexion meaning to the pupil simply the performance of a series of physical movements to be carried out in accordance with the pupil 's conception of the teacher 's instructions . The fact that the teacher fails in this attempt in the great majority of cases may disturb him , but does not undermine his faith in his methods or change his attitude towards his original premiss . He may point to some successes , but unfortunately he lacks that keenness of observation , he has not reached that desirable state of awareness , which would reveal to him the fact that his success is merely a specific one and that , in the process of eradicating the particular defect , he has permitted the pupil to cultivate several others more harmful than the original , and of which teacher and pupil alike remain in blissful ignorance . On the other hand , the whole procedure of teaching on a plane of constructive conscious control is based on the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition in which the sensory appreciation ( feeling ) is more or less imperfect and deceptive , can not expect to succeed in remedying this condition by relying upon this same deceptive feeling for guidance in their efforts in re-education , readjustment , and co-ordination , or in their attempts to put right something they know to be wrong with the psycho-physical organism . For immediately the child or adult attempts to perform any psycho-physical act , that use of himself which is the manifestation of his inherited and cultivated instincts ( i.e. , of his habits ) becomes the dominating factor . It then follows that if a pupil is more or less badly co-ordinated , the use of his psycho-physical self will be imperfect and therefore more or less harmful . This means that he will be beset with defects , that his sensory appreciation ( feeling ) of what he is doing will be deceptive , and that immediately he makes any attempt to correct these defects , he will be at a still greater disadvantage in consequence of the lack of correct guidance through reliable sensory appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out fully if we follow our argument a step farther . For if the  | foregoing is true ( and I assert that it is capable of practical demonstration ) , it follows that in the case of a child who is found to experience difficulty in carrying out some simple activity , or to be suffering from certain defects and imperfections , it is of no use , indeed it is unreasoning , for its teachers to ask it to do anything itself with the aim of helping it over its difficulty , or of eradicating its defects , because ( and this is the point that is overlooked in all schemes of reform or remedial work with which I have come in contact ) the only guidance the child has to rely upon in doing anything to carry out the teacher 's instructions is the very same delusive subconscious guidance ( unreliable sensory appreciation ) that was instrumental in causing the defects to develop and become established in the first instance . For all defects and imperfections are symptoms of a condition of mal-co-ordination and of maladjustment , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand with the possession of an unreliable sensory appreciation . In the same way , we shall find that where a condition of unreliable sensory appreciation exists in the child or adult ( and all that is written here applies with even greater force to the adult ) there will also be present a condition of mal-co-ordination , in some form or other , and some incorrect adjustment . Any attempt , then , made by the child that is imperfectly co-ordinated to use its unreliable sensory appreciation as a guide in its efforts to do something in obedience to directions in order to correct a defect , is bound to result in some form of misdirected activity , accompanied by an increase of the original defect or imperfection , and by the undue development of the fear reflexes . This brings us face to face with the demand for a teaching technique which will meet this difficulty , and such a technique involves correct manipulation on the part of the teacher in the matter of giving the pupil correct experiences in sensory appreciation , in the spheres of re-education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give these satisfactory sensory experiences , the teacher must himself be in possession of a reliable sensory mechanism and have gained the experience in re-education and co-ordination that is required for a satisfactory readjustment of the organism . But in this connexion it must always be clearly understood that the correct sensory experiences to be acquired by means of this technique can not be described in writing or by the  | spoken word in such a way as to be of practical value . As a friend of mine , a well-known scientific man , replied to a query in this connexion , " We can not write a kineesthesia , any more than we can write the sense of sound . We can only write the symbols of sound , notes of music , for instance . " It is necessary to emphasize this point , as it is one that is so constantly overlooked . Many people have said to me , for instance , with quite a friendly knowing look , " You know , that book of yours , Man 's Supreme Inheritance , is quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their reason , the same answer is always forthcoming : " Because you give us enough to make us interested in your theory and just lead us to the point where we realize we must go to you for lessons . " It has happened in my experience over and over again that , after I have carefully explained to a pupil that he needed reeducation because of his lack of reliable sensory appreciation , and have even shown him by practical demonstration that he was actually developing harmful defects , because he was guiding himself in his movements by a deceptive " feeling , " the pupil has turned to me and said , " Please give me some exercise that I can practise at home . " Beyond this I have emphasized in my book the point that manipulation is necessary for the development and establishment of reliable sensory appreciation in the case of individuals who have developed defects , because in everything they are doing themselves by the usual methods to remedy these defects they are guiding themselves by an unreliable sense of feeling , thus adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by unreliable sensory appreciation . Yet in spite of all that I have written on this point , I have been criticized for " keeping things back , " because I would not give in my book instructions and set exercises that people could do at home by themselves ! In all such instances I point out that I will not be guilty at this stage of my teaching experience of adding to the mass of literature on the subject of exercises , or take the grave responsibility for the harmful consequences which are certain to result from the practice of exercises , according to written instructions , by people whose sensory appreciation is unreliable and often positively delusive . The technique , therefore , in which we are interested has been developed throughout from the premiss that , if something is wrong with us , it is  | because we have been guided by unreliable sensory appreciation , leading to incorrect sensory experiences and resulting in misdirected activities . These misdirected activities manifest themselves in the use of the psycho-physical mechanism in connexion with all the general activities of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual idiosyncrasies . They are influenced by and associated with our incorrect conceptions , our imperfect sensory appreciation , our unduly excited fear reflexes and uncontrolled emotions and prejudices , and our imperfectly adjusted mechanisms . These psycho-physical derangements in the process of formation are the forerunners of a psycho-physical attitude towards the conduct of life in general which must be considered perverted , and because these misdirected activities are so closely connected with this perverted attitude , they present a problem of great difficulty to both teacher and pupil in any endeavour to convey or acquire knowledge , particularly in regard to the satisfactory use of the psycho-physical mechanisms . I shall now go on to consider this problem in relation to incorrect conception .  | IN the matter of conception , the first step is to convince the pupil that his present misdirected activities are the result of incorrect conception and of imperfect sensory appreciation ( feeling ) . Now , in this regard I would at once warn those who are inexperienced in this matter that the pupil , as a rule , will not be convinced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , indeed , often assure his teacher that he sees the argument , and from his standpoint this statement may be true . But in my experience there is only one way by which a teacher can really convince a pupil that his sense of feeling is misleading him when he starts to carry out a movement , and that is by demonstration upon the pupil 's own organism . A mirror should be used , so that the pupil , as far as possible , can have ocular demonstration as well . The next point of importance to be impressed upon the pupil is the necessity for listening carefully to the teacher 's words , and for being quite clear as to the meaning that these words are intended to convey , before he attempts to act upon them . This may seem a truism , but , as a matter of fact , it is at this point that we come up against a rock on which even a highly experienced teacher may make shipwreck . For , in every case , the pupil 's conception of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in accordance with his ( the pupil 's ) psycho-physical make-up.l If , for instance , the pupil has fixed ideas in some particular direction , these fixed ideas must inevitably limit his capacity for " listening carefully " ( a capacity which we are apt to take so much for granted ) ? that is , for receiving the new ideas as the teacher is trying to convey them to him . In this connexion , therefore , a teacher , in dealing with the shortcomings of a particular case , must give due consideration to the pupil 's fixed conceptions , otherwise these will greatly complicate the footnote 1 In this sense it can be truly said that a pupil hears only what he wants to hear , because what he wants is decided by the standards fixed by his present habits .  | problem for both teacher and pupil . Certain of these fixed ideas are encountered in the case of almost every pupil ; fixed ideas , for example , as to what constitutes the right and what the wrong method of going to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity for concentration , if success is to attend the efforts of pupil and teacher ; also a fixed belief ( based on subconscious guidance ) that , if a pupil is corrected for a defect , he should be taught to do something in order to correct it , instead of being taught , as a first principle , how to prevent ( inhibition ) the wrong thing from being done . The teacher experienced in the work of re-education can diagnose at once , by the expression and use of the pupil 's eyes , the degree of influence upon him of such conceptions , and at each step in the training he should take preventive measures to counteract this influence . It is absurd to try to teach a person who is in a more or less agitated or even anxious condition . We must have that calm condition which is characteristic of a person whose reasoning processes are operative . The list of fixed conceptions given above might be increased a hundredfold . The peculiarities of fixed conceptions , like peculiarities of handwriting , differ greatly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the case of handwriting again , upon the individual psycho-physical make-up . ' A teaching experience of over twenty-five years in a psychophysical sphere has given me a very real knowledge of the psycho-physical difficulties which stand in the way of many adults who need re-education and co-ordination , and , as the result of this experience , I have no hesitation in stating that the pupil 's fixed ideas and conceptions are the cause of the major part of his difficulties . I will now take certain of these fixed conceptions from my teaching experience , because they are so widespread and have such far-reaching and harmful effects upon life in general , and I will begin with the habit which has become established in most pupils trained on a subconscious basis , and to which we have already referred ? viz. , that of trying to correct one defect by doing something else . footnote 1 All that is written here about fixed conceptions applies equally to the teacher as to the pupil .  | Illustration I. " Doing It Right " Let us suppose that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain teacher and comes for the first lesson . The teacher proceeds to indicate to the pupil , firstly , the results of his diagnosis of the pupil 's psycho-physical peculiarities , delusions , and defects which he proposes to attempt to eradicate ; and , secondly , the means whereby the eradication is to be effected . It invariably follows that by the time the teacher has concluded his statement , the pupil will have formed his own conception ( often diametrically the reverse of his teacher 's ) of the facts disclosed , and unless he is a very unusual person , he will already have come to a decision in accordance with his preconceived ideas , ( 1 ) as to the cause or causes underlying the facts disclosed ; ( 2 ) as to the ends that will be gained by the removal of these causes ; and , most important of all , ( 3 ) as to the means he will adopt in order to gain these ends . In this last decision he will be influenced by his fixed belief that in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something ( as he understands " doing " ) , and to do it right ( as he understands " doing it right " ) . This is not surprising , as it is probable that all his former teachers will have instilled into him from his earliest days the idea that when something is wrong , he must do something to try to get it right . Beyond this , he will have been told that , if he is conscientious , he will always try to , be right , not wrong , so that this desire to " be right " will have become an obsession in which , as in so many other matters , his conscience must be satisfied. ) footnote 1 If we think the matter out , we shall be forced to admit that in such matters a person 's insistence on satisfying conscience is too often merely an attempt to unload responsibility . He is aware of certain orthodox ways of dealing with his difficulties . His own experience of these ways is that they have mostly ended in failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail , he at least has done his best . In other words , he tries to satisfy his conscience , not his reasoning intelligence . He embraces this way of going to work because it is the easy  | As soon as the teacher observes that the pupil ( following out his fixed idea ) is setting out to do something he thinks right to bring about the end he desires , he will point out to the pupil that , in trying to remedy his defects by " doing something " himself , he is relying upon his own judgment , but that his ( the pupil 's ) judgment can not be sound in this respect , based as it is on his previous incorrect sensory experiences . The teacher will therefore advise the pupil to stop relying on his own judgment in these matters , and , instead , to listen to the new instructions , and to allow the teacher to give him by means of manipulation the new correct sensory experiences . The idea , however , of ceasing to do the wrong thing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no appeal at first to the average pupil , who , in most cases , goes on trying to " be right " in spite of his experience and of all that his teacher may say.l There are many reasons for this , chief among them being , in my opinion , the fact to which I have already drawn the reader 's attention ? namely , that in our conception of how to employ the different parts of our mechanisms , we are guided almost entirely by a sense of feeling which is more or less unreliable . We get into the habit of performing a certain act in a certain way , and we experience a certain feeling in connexion with it which we recognize as " right . " The act and the particular feeling associated with it becomes one in our recognition . If anything should cause us to change our con- footnote way . If he once stopped to reason the thing out , and based his judgment on the experience gained from the knowledge of his previous failures , he would have to discard these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the easy way . It would be the difficult way . It would mean , among other things , a painful dissection of his psychophysical peculiarities , defects , prejudices , sensory excesses , and these are to him just as much a manifestation of his malconditions as are the diseased liver and kidney in the case of the drunkard . To give his liver and kidneys a chance , the drunkard would have to give up drinking wine , but he has not the control to do this . So with the pupil in our illustration . He knows that certain psycho-physical habits are responsible for his condition , but these habits have become a part of him ; they appeal to his perverted sense of feeling , and so he will not make the effort to give them up . 1 He is so possessed with the idea of " specific cure " that the principle of prevention ( inhibition ) is accepted by him at such a low valuation that , in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred , it will be ignored .  | ception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , and if we adopt a new method in accordance with this changed conception , we shall experience a new feeling in performing the act which we do not recognize as " right . " We then realize that what we have hitherto recognized as " right " is wrong . For instance , suppose the teacher , in trying to change some malcondition in the pupil , asks him to bend his knees . The pupil , thinking only of what his teacher asks him ( the " end " ) , and desiring to do it right ( as he understands " doing it right " in connexion with the act of bending his knees ) , bends his knees , and bends them as he has always bent them ? that is , with a great amount of unnecessary tension and pressure , interfering with his equilibrium , shortening his spine 1 ( by increasing the curve , etc. ) , stiffening his neck , and so attains his end ( the bending of his knees ) , but at the cost of undue strain and disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , of course , that the pupil is conscious of all this . He has probably never thought out how ( the " means-whereby " ) he has performed such acts as " bending his knees , " and though he knows in a general way that something is wrong with him ( else it is improbable that he would be coming to a teacher at all ) , he has not associated this " something wrong " with anything that he has been doing himself ? that is , with his own misdirected activities . Therefore , when he bends his knees in response to his teacher 's request , he is not conscious of anything being wrong in his manner of doing it . He bends them as he has always been accustomed to bend them . This satisfies him , it feels right to him . Now suppose that the teacher , after drawing the pupil 's attention to the very disadvantageous manner in which he has been using himself during the process of bending his knees , gives him some help ( into the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and succeeds in inducing him to bend his knees to the best advantage in the general use of his mechanisms . When this occurs , the act of bending the knees becomes , as far as this pupil is concerned , to all intents and purposes a new act , bringing with it a new feeling . This time the act is not what he is accustomed to , and so it feels wrong to him . footnote 1 See Chapter : " Illustration . "  | Henceforward , whenever the conception of bending the knees comes to this pupil ( whether in response to his teacher 's directions or through his own initiative ) , the choice lies before him of bending them in the old way ( i.e. , at great disadvantage to himself ) and " feeling right , " or of changing the manner in which he performs the act and " feeling wrong . " As a little girl said quaintly when this point was explained to her in connexion with something she was doing , " Oh , I see ! If I feel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel wrong , I must n't feel . " Unfortunately , the average adult pupil , unlike the little girl , does not " see , " or , if he does , he will not act accordingly . Indeed , we have to face the fact that the adult , as a rule , does not like a new feeling ; in some cases he is positively afraid of it . A new " feeling " gives him a sense of insecurity when he experiences it in connexion with acts that he has been accustomed to associate with a different feeling all his life . This sense of insecurity is particularly marked in connexion with the maintenance of his equilibrium in the acts of standing , walking , etc. , in accordance with the newly acquired feeling . ' - And so it comes about that , when a pupil is faced with the alternative of using his mechanisms badly and " feeling right , " or of using them well and " feeling wrong , " he is apt , as we say , to lose his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , inhibit ) , and falls back upon " feeling right . " This is only one example of the difficulty which a pupil 's incorrect conceptions and misdirected activities in certain directions will present both to him and his teacher in any endeavour to convey or acquire knowledge in the psychophysical sphere . In such a case as the one we have cited , the pupil 's fixed ideas as to what constitutes " right " and what " wrong " in certain conditions will produce a deadlock . For how can new and correct experiences be given to a pupil who , in all the movements he makes , is working subconsciously to reproduce certain feelings that he has grown used to and footnote 1 Incidentally , I would point out that , in cases where a person develops a " phobia " in connexion with crossing streets , travelling by train , crossing bridges or open spaces , being alone in a room , being unduly alarmed by ordinary noises , etc. , there is already present in that person a serious condition of unsatisfactory psycho-physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus responsible for the " phobia. "  | likes ? The situation is one that no teacher , be he ever so expert , can deal with satisfactorily , one from which the pupil can not possibly be extricated , until he stops trying to get things right ? stops , that is , working blindly for his ends , and gives thought instead to the new means i given to him by his teacher , whereby his ends can be attained . Illustration II . Doing Things " His Way " I will now take an equally fixed and unreasoning conception which is common to most pupils who need re-education and co-ordination ? namely , their fixed ideas as to what they can and can not do . Their judgment on these points , of course , can only be based on their previous misleading experiences , but , in spite of this fact , they are not ready to change their ideas , even when their teacher has given them practical proof that their judgment on these points is not to be relied on . Now , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain teacher because he believes the teacher can help him to overcome some difficulty would take that teacher 's word for it as to whether he is capable or not of doing what he is asked to do at a particular point . But too often the opposite is the case . For if a teacher during a lesson should ask a pupil to do something which happens to be among the things which , in the days before he came for lessons , he was convinced he could not do ( i.e. , his difficulty ) , the pupil will immediately baulk . He may not openly refuse to follow out the new instructions given to him , but , what amounts to the same thing , he will make a " mental reservation , " as we say , when he receives them . The reason for this is that he subconsciously believes that he knows more than his teacher about the things he can or can not do . So that , when he receives the instructions , he starts to carry them out on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way " ? and so intent is he on this plan that the new instructions do not reach his consciousness ? that is , they do not make upon him that due impression which is required for carrying them out satisfactorily , or even for remembering them accurately . Curiously enough , a pupil 's confidence in " his way " of footnote 1 The matter of these new means will be dealt with in the next chapter .  | doing things is not in the least disturbed by the fact that " his way " has never worked well in the past , and , as his teacher is careful to point out to him , can never work well in the future , for the simple reason that " his way " is essentially wrong for his purpose , that , in fact , what he thinks of as a " difficulty " is not a difficulty in itself , but simply the result of " his way " of going to work . Further , the teacher will point out that any reason he may have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing things no longer exists , because the practical help that the teacher is able to give him places him in a totally new position in regard to his " difficulty " ; so that all he has to do is to stop trying to overcome his difficulty " his way , " and , instead , to remember and follow out the new instructions , by which means he will obtain the result he desires . This can not be called an unreasonable proposition , if we have once allowed that a teacher should be trusted to know more than his pupil about the particular matter in hand . In my experience , however , the pupil who has been brought up on subconscious methods is not attracted , as a rule , by this form of reasoning when faced with a " difficulty . " And so it comes about that , although a teacher may demonstrate to a pupil over and over again that he will never be able to do what he is trying to do unless he changes his " meanswhereby " ( gives up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) , the pupil will still go on trying to overcome his difficulty " his way . " 1 Similarly , although a teacher may assure his pupil over and over again that , if only he will adopt the new means given to him , he will be able to do quite easily the thing he has always believed he can not do , the pupil will not make any attempt to adopt the new means . He will go on , in fact , trying to be right " his way , " and always being wrong . More unreasonable still , after a certain time he will actually begin to worry because he finds that he is not getting on , that " his way " is not working . Could anything be more unreasonable ? Suppose a man starts out to reach a certain destination and footnote It must be pointed out that in such instances as the one we are discussing , the pupil 's " right way " is the wrong way . The right way ( that is , the teacher 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized by the pupil as the " right way , " because this right way has never yet come within the pupil 's experiences .  | comes to a place where the road branches into two . Not knowing the way , he takes the wrong road of the two and gets lost . He asks the way of someone he meets and is told to go straight back to the crossroads and take the other road , which will lead him directly to the place he wants to reach . What should we say if we heard that the man had gone back to the crossroads as directed , but had there concluded that he knew better after all than his adviser , had taken again his old road , and again got lost , and had done this thing not once or twice , but over and over again ? Still more , what should we say if we heard that he was worrying dreadfully because he kept getting lost , and seemed no nearer to getting to his destination ? I can see the reader 's look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any rate , could not be guilty of the crime of not really attempting to do that which he knows he can do , or of not ceasing to try to do that which the experience of hours , days ? nay , of years ? has proved to be the impossible in his particular case . Yet this is more or less what happens in the case of every pupil , even of those who are accounted the most intelligent , the most highly educated , the most scientifically trained , and this serves to strengthen my conviction that the principles underlying present methods of education are erroneous . Indeed , it would seem that our educational systems , our methods of training in scientific and professional spheres , have tended actually to cultivate and establish the defect to which I have referred . To call it a defect is to use a word that is inadequate to express what really amounts to the loss of onehalf of our original psycho-physical endowment by the gradually decreasing use of the invaluable process called inhibition . And I repeat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the erroneous principles which underlie our teaching methods in all spheres . Those who are responsible for these methods have not realized the importance of holding the balance true in every sphere of life between the desire to do ( volition ) and the ability to check that desire ( inhibition ) . The words " volition " and " inhibition " are in constant use in these pages and I wish at this point to make it clearly understood that they are used merely as names for two respective acts , volition standing for the act of responding to some stimulus ( or stimuli ) to psycho-physical action ( doing ) , and inhibition  | standing for the act of refusing to respond to some stimulus ( or stimuli ) to psycho-physical action ( not doing ) . In other words , volition is used to name what we intend to do , and inhibition to name what we refuse to do ? that is , to name what we wish to hold in check , we wish to prevent . We are not interested here in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volition and inhibition are different manifestations of the same force , or even as to what this force is , any more than the engineer who is using electricity as a power to a particular end is immediately interested as to what electricity is . We prophesy , however , that before we have acquired accurate knowledge as to the latter , we may possibly have solved the former by means of that consciously acquired knowledge which is coming to us through the practical understanding of our psycho-sensory potentialities upon which a higher and higher standard of human psycho-physical functioning depends . In the sense , then , implied by a process enabling one to stop , a process concerned not with " ends , " however good in themselves , but with the means whereby these " ends " can be brought about , I maintain that there is a lack of inhibition in all spheres . In no sphere , however , has the lack of inhibitory development been fraught with such danger as in matters concerned with the actual use of the psycho-physical mechanism in the activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce in the individual a state of unbalanced psycho-physical functioning throughout the whole organism . Indeed , all our methods of educational training make for rigidity rather than mobility in educational use . Small wonder , then , that adults in whom such psycho-physical conditions have become established in childhood , manifest , where their activities are concerned , an almost total lack of the most ordinary common sense , associated with unreliable sensory appreciation . Illustration III . Not Seeing Ourselves as Others See Us Perhaps the most striking and at the same time the most pathetic instance of human delusion is to be found in the human creature 's attitude towards his own psycho-physical defects , disadvantages , peculiarities , etc. , on one hand , and  | towards his merits , advantages , and natural gifts on the other . " To thine own self be true , " is an inspiring incentive when the human creature 's co-ordinated psycho-physical development has reached a point where that self can not be duped by its sensations . As a striking instance in this field of human delusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things he thinks of as " right " or " wrong " in himself , when he is faced with the practical problem of speaking in everyday life . The case to which I refer is just one instance of many that have come within the writer 's experience during investigations made in the past thirty years . The pupil , in this particular case , was what is generally called a bad stutterer , but he made rapid progress during his lessons , and in an unusually short space of time was able to speak without any sign of stuttering as long as he spoke slowly . He reached a point where he could carry on a conversation with his teacher without being troubled with the old defects , provided that he enunciated the words slowly and deliberately . The teacher then said , " I want you to speak in the way that you are speaking to me now , during your conversations throughout the whole day . " The pupil at once became agitated , thus disturbing temporarily his new and developing control , and relapsed into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! I could n't do that ; everyone would notice me ! " Now , if we try to analyse the condition of a person who can seriously make a remark like this ( and the pupil was quite sincere , he meant it ) , we shall see that his agitation caused him to revert to a condition associated with his previous malco-ordination , in which he had been accustomed to hypnotize himself where the facts of his shortcomings and peculiarities were concerned . We may try to explain his remark by saying that he had become so used to the conditions of his stuttering , that he no longer cared what " the other fellow " thought about it , or else that he had determined to ignore the disagreeable fact that he stuttered , and in this way had deluded himself into thinking that the " other fellow " did not notice his contortions . ' The fact remains that he had reached such a footnote I This is the opposite delusion of that of the person who becomes self-conscious over a comparatively unnoticeable peculiarity . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and comparatively  | stage of defective sensory appreciation and self-hypnotic indulgence that his whole outlook was topsy-turvy . He no longer saw things as they were , and was out of communication with reasoning , where his consciousness of his defects was concerned . He was therefore able to persuade himself that the normal condition would be conspicuous , whilst the abnormal would pass unnoticed . In this he was relying almost entirely on his perverted sense of feeling . The point on which we should lay particular stress is that the condition of delusion and selfdeception indicated in this illustration will be found to be more or less present in all people who are imperfectly co-ordinated and have an unreliable sensory appreciation . Illustration IV . " Out of Shape " In connexion with unreliable sensory appreciation and with perverted ideas or conceptions of what is " right " or " wrong , " where the human creature 's uses of his own mechanisms are concerned , the following is a most significant illustration . A little girl who had been unable to walk properly for some years was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the use of the psycho-physical mechanisms which were responsible for her more or less crippled state . ' When this had been done , a request was made that a demonstration should be given to those present of the manipulative side of the work ( the child , of course , to be the subject to be manipulated ) , so that certain readjustments and co-ordinations might be temporarily secured , thus showing , in keeping with the diagnosis , the possibilities of re-education on a general basis in a case of this kind . The demonstration was successful from this point of view . For the time being the child 's body was comparatively straightened out ? that is , without the extreme twists and distortions that had been so noticeable when she footnote unnoticeable , peculiarity to such a degree that he becomes self-conscious about it and imagines that everywhere he goes people are looking at him on account of it , whereas the defect is so slight that it would not be noticed by outsiders . I have pointed out in the chapter entitled " Individual Errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harmful effects that may follow a person 's misguided attempts to conceal or change characteristics which they believe to be very serious drawbacks to their appearance , but which , compared with other very serious defects which they completely overlook , are relatively minor peculiarities.  | came into the room . When this was done , the little girl looked across at her mother and said to her in an indescribable tone : " Oh ! Mummie , he 's pulled me out of shape . " Here , indeed , is food for reflection for all who are concerned in any attempt to eradicate psycho-physical defects ! In accordance with this poor little child 's judgment , her crookedness was straightness , her sensory appreciation of her " out-ofshape " condition was that it was " in shape . " Imagine , then , what would be the result of her trying to get anything " right " by doing something herself , as she had always tried and had always been urged to try to do , whilst practising remedial exercises according to the directions and under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach her had resulted in failure ! Consideration of the foregoing can not but lead us to a full realization of what would have been the psycho-physical condition of such a child when she reached adolescence , if the orthodox methods of teaching in all spheres had been employed to help her . The child 's remark is proof positive that , where her defects were concerned , her ideas and conceptions were dominated by her sensory appreciation , and that this sensory appreciation was not only unreliable , but actually delusive . Her experiences in connexion with the functioning of her organism were consequently incorrect and harmful experiences , and as her judgment in these spheres was the result of these experiences , little wonder that her judgment of what was right and what wrong in her case was not only practically worthless , but constituted a positive danger to her future development . Unless in such cases a child is re-educated and co-ordinated on a basis of conscious control , it can not acquire a new and reliable sensory appreciation , and , lacking this , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to become more and more so with the advance of time . Incorrect experiences and bad judgment will be associated with this delusive guidance of the mechanisms in the functioning of the organism , and all its efforts in the different spheres of the activities of life will be in accordance with this functioning . The point that comes out clearly in all these illustrations is that conceptions which are mainly influenced by unreliable  | sensory appreciation , acting and reacting subconsciously and harmfully on the processes involved , are incorrect conceptions , and that in these cases unreliable sensory appreciation goes hand in hand with incorrect and deceptive experiences in the psychophysical functioning . And when we remember that ( as we saw in the case of the little girl of the last illustration ) our judgment is based on experience , we must also see that , where this experience is incorrect and deceptive , the resulting judgment is bound to be misleading and out of touch with reality . We have to recognize , therefore , that our sensory peculiarities are the foundation of what we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nine out of ten of the opinions we form are rather the result of what we feel 1 than what we think . Our emotional defects also are linked up with our sensory peculiarities , so that , given the slightest disturbance in these directions , we must be temporarily thrown into a danger zone 2 where serious and uncontrolled psycho-physical conditions prevail . We can now see how far this line of thought has brought us . For the fact that emerges from all these considerations is that our approach to life generally , our activities , beliefs , emotions , opinions , judgments in whatever sphere , are conditioned by the preceding conceptions , which are associated with the individual use of the psycho-physical mechanisms and conditioned by the standard of reliability of our individual sensory appreciation . This is the great fact which must be realized by our leaders footnote i It is only reasonable to conclude that it is because the opinions of most people are much more the manifestation of their sensory peculiarities ( feeling ) than of their reasoning processes that we find so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single simple point , or serious subject . It is positively alarming that reasoning plays so small a part in most of the opinions we hold , and in our judgment with regard to things that matter . It is for this reason that we find ourselves in such a fearful muddle after two thousand years of struggle towards a better standard of psycho-physical functioning , struggle which it was hoped would bring in an era of goodwill , universal unity , tolerance , and mutual understanding . 2 It only needs a certain number of repetitions of harmful experiences , such as are alluded to above , to produce one or other of the different phases which we place within the borderland of insanity . Many phases of this development of temporary insanity are accompanied by violent physical manifestations.  | in educational , religious , moral , social , political , and all other spheres of human activities before there can be any " uplifting " of the human creature out of the present chaotic conditions . We all think and act ( except when forced to do otherwise ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We read a particular paper each morning because the policy of that paper is the one we believe in and we can read there what we want to read ; we cultivate friendships with people who think as we think , and we ignore or are antagonized by those who do not ; the preacher attracts to church only those . who want to go to church ; we start to read a book , but immediately we reach a point with which we disagree our more or less debauched kinesthesia can not control the impulses which , when set in motion , put us out of communication with our reasoning . Yet in spite of all this , books are written , lectures given , sermons preached , speeches made in the belief that ideas which are given out by these means can be satisfactorily assimilated by hearers or readers , and that good ideas may thus be passed on for the uplifting of mankind in social , religious , political , and other spheres of activity . Here we have a great delusion . For , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and unfamiliar idea , or to overcome our prejudices in connexion with our cherished ideas and beliefs , depends upon our individual conception of such ideas and beliefs , and this conception is conditioned by the standard of individual psycho-physical co-ordination and of reliability of the sensory appreciation . Had this fact not been overlooked , writers , lecturers , preachers , orators , etc. , would long since have shown some practical interest in the means whereby their hearers and readers could reach such a standard of functioning of the psycho-physical organism that they would be able to assimilate satisfactorily new ideas and teachings . For how , I ask , can those who have developed a condition of unreliable sensory appreciation ( with all the incorrect experiences , beliefs , and judgments that we now know to be inevitably associated with this condition ) assimilate satisfactorily ideas that do not fit in with these experiences ? Correct apprehension and reliable sensory appreciation go hand in hand.l footnote 1 As a friend , a member of the medical profession , wrote to me recently : " I am getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know . "  | The mass is made up of individuals , and reliable sensory appreciation can not be given on the mass-teaching principle or by precept or exhortation . This can be done only by individual teaching and individual work . Moreover , people who are massed together are apt to be governed by the " herdinstinct , " and we need to help man to evolve beyond that influence as soon as possible , and to this end we must have conscious and individual development .  | ThE problem , then , before us is to find a means whereby a reliable sensory appreciation can be developed and maintained throughout the organism , and the basis for my argument is that both in education and in re-education this must be brought about in every case by the reliance of the individual , not upon subconscious , but upon conscious , reasoning guidance and control . For we find that the human creature , subjected to the present processes of civilization , develops defects and imperfections in the use of the organism , even in cases where a reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst in the much larger number of cases , where defects have already been developed , we find that satisfactory results can not be secured unless during the process a new and reliable sensory appreciation is being gradually acquired . Almost all civilized human creatures have developed a condition in which the sensory appreciation ( feeling ) is more or less imperfect and deceptive , and it naturally follows that it can not be relied upon in re-education , readjustment , and coordination , or in our attempts to put right something we know to be wrong with our psycho-physical selves . The connexion 1 between psycho-physical defects and incorrect sensory guidance must therefore be recognized by the teacher in the practical work of re-education . This recognition will make it impossible for him to expect a pupil to be able to perform satisfactorily any new psycho-physical act until the new correct experiences in sensory appreciation involved have become established . I will now endeavour to outline as clearly as possible the general scheme which I advocate ill connexion with the development of reliable sensory appreciation , first setting out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illustration which will show the application of these principles to the practical work of co-ordination and re-education . footnote i The recognition of this vital connexion marks the point of departure between methods of teaching on a conscious and on a subconscious basis .  | First , then , this scheme demands in particular on the part of the teacher a recognition of the almost alarming dominance of the pupil 's psycho-physical processes by an incorrect sensory appreciation during the attempted performance of any psychophysical activity . It is therefore of primary importance that the teacher should recognize and endeavour to awaken his pupil to the fact of his ( the pupil 's ) unreliable sensory appreciation , and that during the processes involved in the performance of the pupil 's practical work he should cultivate and develop in him the new and reliable sensory appreciation upon which a satisfactory standard of co-ordination depends . To this end the mode of procedure is as follows . The teacher , having made his diagnosis of the cause or causes of the imperfections or defects which the pupil has developed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pupil the new sensory experiences required for the satisfactory use of the mechanisms concerned , the while giving him the correct guiding orders or directions which are the counterpart of the new sensory experiences which he is endeavouring to develop by means of his manipulation . This procedure constitutes the means whereby the teacher makes it possible for the pupil to prevent ( inhibition ) the misdirected activities which are causing his psycho-physical imperfections . In this work the inhibitory process must take first place , and remain the primary factor in each and every new experience which is to be gained and become established during the cultivation and development of reliable sensory appreciation upon which a satisfactory standard of co-ordination depends . With this aim in view ? that is , the prevention of misdirected activities ? the teacher from the outset carefully explains to the pupil that his part in this scheme is very different from that which is usually assigned to pupils under other teaching methods . He tells the pupil that , on receiving the directions or guiding orders , he must not attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must inhibit the desire to do so in the case of each and every order which is given to him . He must instead project the guiding orders as given to him , whilst his teacher at the same time , by means of manipulation , will make the required readjustments and bring about the necessary co-ordinations , in this way performing for the pupil the particular movement or movements required , and giving him the  | new reliable sensory appreciation and the very best opportunity possible to connect the different guiding orders before attempting to put them into practice . This linking-up of the guiding orders or directions is all-important , for it is the counterpart of that linking-up of the parts of the organism which constitutes what we call co-ordination . The aim of re-education on a general basis is to bring about at all times and for all purposes , not a series of correct positions or postures , but a coordinated use of the mechanisms in general . The second point to be noted in connexion with the technique we are advocating is that the directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every case on the principle of ceasing to work in blind pursuit of an " end , " and of attending instead to the means whereby this " end " can be attained . We have already considered this principle in its general application , but I am anxious to lay stress upon it again at this point , because it is of the utmost importance that the pupil should both accept this principle and apply it to his work in the sphere of re-education , for by no other method can he get the better of his old subconscious habits and build up consciously the new and improved condition which he is anxious to bring about . If we consider for a moment , we shall see the reason for this . For if the pupil thinks of a certain " end " as desirable and starts to pursue it directly , he will certainly take the course of action in regard to it that he has been accustomed to take in like conditions . In other words , he will follow his habitual procedure in regard to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose ( and the fact that he needs reeducation proves this to be the case ) , he only strengthens the incorrect experiences in connexion with it by using this procedure again . If , on the other hand , the pupil stops himsel from going to work in his usual way ( inhibition ) , and proceeds to replace his old subconscious means by the new conscious means which his teacher has given him , and which he has therefore every reason to believe will bring about the desired result , he will have taken the first and most important step towards the breaking-down of a habit , and towards that constructive , conscious , and reasoning control which tends towards a mastery of the situation ) . footnote 1 This applies equally to the breaking of habit in every sphere of activity .  | It is therefore impressed on the pupil from the beginning that , as the essential preliminary to any successful work on his part , he must refuse to work directly for his " end , " and keep his attention entirely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration which will shortly be given it will be noticed that it is left to the teacher 's discretion whether , in the case of a particular evolution , the pupil shall or shall not be told beforehand what the " end " is for which he and the teacher are working . But in either case everything possible is done to convince him that the " end " does not matter , because given : ? ( I ) the teacher 's knowledge of the correct means whereby the particular " end " can be secured ; ( 2 ) the pupil 's correct apprehension and conscious repetition of the guiding orders or directions relating to these " means-whereby " ; ( 3 ) the manipulation by the teacher , who , with his expert hands , gives to the pupil the reliable sensory appreciation which should result from such directive orders , it is then merely a matter of timer before the desired end will be secured . In other words , the pupil is asked to take care of the " means , " and the " end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all responsibility for the final result is taken off the pupil . He has no " end " to work for , and therefore nothing to get right . All that is asked of him is , when he receives a guiding order , to listen and wait ; to wait , because only by waiting can he be certain of preventing himself from relapsing into his old subconscious habits , and to listen , so that he learns to remember gradually and connect up the guiding orders which are the counterpart of the means-whereby which the teacher is employing to bring about the desired " end . " In other words , he is asked to adopt consciously a principle of footnote 1 In this connexion the length of time that may be required in the process of re-education before the new and correct experiences can become established has proved a stumbling-block to some enquirers ; but here again , if we reason the matter out , we shall see that the ability to break with habits that are sometimes very long-established must depend upon certain natural aptitudes and qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acuteness of his sense perceptions , and of the development of his ability to inhibit.  | prevention as the basis of his practical work , and in every other way to leave the teacher a free hand . Now it would seem that this procedure , by relieving the pupil from all responsibility as to results , should , from any common-sense point of view , relieve him also from strain and anxiety ; and those pupils who are satisfied that they do not know how to put themselves right , and are therefore willing to remain quietly giving themselves certain guiding orders or directions at the prompting of the teacher , but leaving to him all responsibility in the matter of enabling them to bring about the desired result , are able to gain the new and correct experiences without strain and with a gradually increasing sense of power and control . But the teacher experienced in the work of re-education on a general basis is well aware of the difficulties which pupils actually make for themselves in this procedure , for the immediate call of instinctive habit is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bringing into use and developing his power to inhibit , he is almost certain to fall back into his old and harmful habit of blindly pursuing his " end , " which means that he forgets to project his directive orders ( the " means whereby " ) and falls back again for guidance upon his unreliable and delusive sensory appreciation ( f ( ? eling ) . And it is rare in my experience to find adult pupils who are awake to the necessity of preventing themselves from falling back into their old subconscious habits , even though the necessity for this is proved to them over and over again . Very few , moreover , have any idea of giving themselves a guiding order or direction without making an attempt to carry it out . They do not separate the order they are asked to give from the act or acts of which it is the forerunner . Therefore , as soon as they are asked to give a certain continuous order , they rush impulsively into action according to t heir habitual subconscious use of the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher asks the pupil to prevent , because it renders a successful result impossible from the outset , and reinforces all the incorrect experiences , associated by the pupil with this use of the parts , the very experiences that the teacher is endeavouring to replace by new and correct ones . Let us take , for example , the case of a pupil who has been accustomed to stiffen the muscles of his neck in all his daily  | activities . His teacher points this out to him , and explains that this habit of stiffening his neck has come about because he is endeavouring to make his neck perform the functions of other parts of his psycho-physical mechanism , so that it is not an isolated defect , but connected with other harmful imperfections in the use of himself . His stiffened neck , in fact , is merely a symptom of general mal-co-ordination in the use of the mechanisms , and any direct attempt to relax it means that he is dealing with it as a " cause " and not as a " symptom , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfactory co-ordinated use of the mechanism in general is restored . The teacher further explains that , as the pupil 's sensory appreciation is unreliable , ) it is unlikely that he will be able to do anything himself to remedy these defects , but that if he will inhibit his desire to stiffen his neck , and give himself the guiding orders or directions to relax it , the teacher will be able by means of manipulation to bring about such a general readjustment of his body that , as a result , his neck will be relaxed . If , after this explanation , the pupil gives himself the order to relax his neck ( i.e. , inhibits his desire to stiffen it ) , his teacher , provided he has the necessary knowledge and experience , will be able to assist him to bring about those general conditions upon which relaxation of the neck depends . If , on the other hand , the pupil forgets to inhibit , and so , when he is asked to order his neck to relax , tries to relax it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of relaxing it ) , he will in this attempt either do exactly what he has always done with his neck ( i.e. , stiffen it ) , or else bring about in one or more parts , or perhaps in the whole organism , a more or less collapsed condition , and until he stops trying to relax it by direct means , the teacher , be he ever so expert , will be able to do little towards bringing about those conditions which make for a satisfactory state of relaxation of the neck . footnote 1 In this regard , it is significant that the pupil whose sensory appreciation in connexion with the use of his organism is most unreliable ( the pupil , for example , who " feels " that his head is going forward when he is carefully putting it back ) is the one who is most unwilling to believe that he really does not know what he is doing with himself , and who , in spite of all remonstrances , will persist in trying to carry out the orders himself , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in carrying them out .  | Another difficulty which pupils make for themselves is in connexion with the giving of guiding orders or directions . They speak sometimes as if it were a strange and new thing to ask them to give themselves orders , forgetting that they have been doing this subconsciously from their earliest days , else they would not be able to stand up without help , much less move about . The point that is new in the scheme we are considering is that the pupil is asked consciously to give himself orders , evolved from a consideration of the requirements , not of a subconscious , but of a conscious , reasoning use of the organism , orders and directions , moreover , the satisfactory employment of which depends on the pupil 's clear understanding ( I ) as to which of these orders are primary , to be given , but not to be carried out ( inhibition ) , and ( 2 ) as to which are to follow and to be actually carried out . To make this clear let us suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Now if he obeys this order at once and sits down , he will be guided in doing so by the unreliable sensory appreciation established in connexion with the performance of the act in his case ; that is , he will simply repeat his usual faulty subconscious manner of sitting down . The object of his re-education is to eradicate such psycho-physical faults , and so , as soon as he is asked to sit down , he immediately says " No , " and gives himself the order not to sit down , thereby inhibiting the misdirected activity hitherto connected with the act , a procedure which prevents indulgence in the old subconscious faults . The old faulty activity being prevented by the processes r just indicated , the pupil will then proceed to give his attention to the different guiding or directing orders which the teacher considers essential to the correct direction and control of those psycho-mechanics ( the correct " means-whereby " ) concerned with the satisfactory use of the organism as a whole in the act of sitting down . These are the orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows , then , that the orders which are to be given , but not to be carried out , are those which , if carried out , would result in the habitual faulty use of the mechanisms . They can therefore be referred to as " preventive orders . " All orders which follow preventive orders are to be carried out ( at first by the teacher ) , for if the teaching technique is reliable ,  | such orders will be concerned with the correct means whereby the new and co-ordinated use of the mechanism can be secured . I have already pointed out that children from the first moment of school life onwards manifest a lack of inhibitory development , and the fact that in most cases they learn to obey orders at once , l without stopping to consider the " why and the wherefore , " is a contributing factor to this harmful condition . As a result of this early training , many pupils have become so accustomed to react quickly and subconsciously to any directions they receive , or to any idea that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a habit with them that they find hard to break . And so , when pupils insist that giving orders is a difficulty , what they really mean is that because of their long-established habit of reacting quickly and unthinkingly to a direction , a habit fostered by years of training , they find it difficult to stop , to wait , to be content just to give orders and to say " No " when the impulse comes to carry out the orders . In other words , they find it difficult not to want to be obedient , not to want to be right , not to work directly for their end . The difficulty , however , as in the case of most human difficulties , lies , not in the thing itself , but in the " breaking of a habit , " the indulgence of which not only impedes the pupil 's progress , but , if persisted in , makes it impossible for him to achieve his desired end . It will be found that in every case a pupil 's success in achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that only by continually attending to the " means-whereby " essential to the successful achievement of his " end " can a satisfactory result be secured . This applies equally , ( I ) whether the pupil is in the early stages of his work , where he is asked merely to give orders and to leave the carrying-out of these orders to the teacher footnote 1 I know that I shall be told that if children are to be taught to inhibit in the sense in which I use the word , i.e. , the prevention of misdirected activities , so much time will be taken up in this part of the work that they will not be able to get through their studies . Children have said to me more than once in this connexion : " I could not stop like this at school . They tell us to hurry . " In answer I can only say that time spent in teaching children to inhibit impulses to unreasoning activity to which otherwise they must later on become slaves is time not lost , but actually saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later stage where , under his teacher 's supervision , he is gradually developing a reliable sensory appreciation upon which he can rely in carrying out the orders himself ; or ( 3 ) whether he is working by himself at his ordinary activities outside . Our discussion of inhibition in the foregoing leads us to the consideration of the individual 's ability to wait ( inhibit ) 1 before reacting to a stimulus ( or stimuli ) to pursue some " end " in the ordinary way of life , and it may be of interest to give some facts in regard to the experiences in this connexion of people taking lessons in speaking , breathing , singing , etc . Most people who need lessons in speaking have a tendency to speak too quickly , and they fail to pause , to wait between their sentences . This tendency , of course , has to be checked , but in the work of re-education on a conscious plane we do not try to check the tendency directly , but rely instead on the use of certain means-whereby " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of telling the pupil directly to pause at certain places , the teacher points out to him that he is gasping at the end of his lines or sentences , and that he is sniffing or " sucking in air " through the mouth , and he endeavours to make the pupil realize that these bad habits are the result of his incorrect subconscious conceptions in connexion with the act of breathing , and with the incorrect use of the psycho-physical mechanisms upon the correct use of which satisfactory breathing depends . From this it follows that in all vocal use the pupil must have a correct conception as to the nature of the respiratory act , associated with a conscious , reasoned understanding of the principles underlying the correct use of the psycho-mechanics involved in the act of breathing , before he makes any attempt to put these principles into practice . When this point has been reached , the teacher will be justified in asking the pupil to stop , to wait at the end of each sentence in speaking or reading ( or at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take another breath until he has inhibited the footnote 1 This " wait " is to give himself time to comprehend and consciously rehearse the orders which are the counterpart of the correct means whereby he is to attain his end .  | habitually incorrect , subconscious guidance and direction concerned with the act of taking a breath ( which , in his case , is responsible for the imperfect uses of the mechanism as diagnosed by his teacher ) , and , further , has substituted for these imperfect uses the new , correct conscious orders which make for increasingly satisfactory use . The teacher therefore asks him to perform : ( i ) An inhibitory act , by inhibiting " his way " of taking breath ? in other words , by preventing or holding in check , in connexion with the act , the wrong subconscious guidance and direction , which constitutes the bad habit he has formed when taking breath at the end of each sentence . ( 2 ) A volitionary act , by giving himself certain orders which are the means whereby a more satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to go on to the next sentence . Now , in connexion with the latter act , the pupil will very likely raise the objection that if he stops to give the new orders before going on to speak , he will attract unpleasant attention to himself , because he will have to wait so long between his sentences that his way of speaking will appear slow and stilted . This objection only means , however , that he has not realized that his old habit of breathing audibly through the mouth , instead of through the nostrils , and of running his sentences into one another were noticeable defects to other people , however little he may have been aware of them himself . He is quick enough to object to the new way of speaking , which , he believes , will draw unpleasant attention to himself , and also to the new instructions because in carrying these out he is forced to break with habits which are familiar and therefore satisfying to him ; but he is not so quick to observe defects in his own old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act in accordance with the new instructions , his defects will gradually disappear , because he will have learned to prevent the wrong use of the mechanisms responsible for these defects . The time taken to give , first , the preventive order to stop and wait at the end of the vocal effort and , secondly , the correct directing and controlling orders in connexion with the processes concerned with the respiratory act will constitute the necessary pause between the sentences . After this , it is merely a matter of  | time before the activities , which result from the series of psycho-physical experiences detailed above , become continuously operative , and , because they are now consciously directed , they will be henceforth under the pupil 's constructive , conscious guidance and control . The same difficulty is encountered in any pupil who breathes imperfectly , immediately he begins the actual practice of singing . This pupil also is so intent on his " end " ( singing ) that he finds it irksome to wait to take breath properly . He also " sniffs " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the nostrils , and , as a rule , audibly . It is unlikely that such defects as these can be eradicated or that the cultivation of new defects can be prevented by those processes which we find associated with " breathing exercises " or lessons in " deep-breathing . " But if the pupil attacks his difficulties ? i.e. , his general condition of mal-co-ordinationby means of re-education on a plane of constructive , conscious control , he can be helped to overcome them by learning , firstly , to hold in check his subconscious desire to " take breath " at the end of each phrase ( inhibitory act ) , and , secondly , to give the guiding orders and directions in connexion with the correct psycho-mechanics of respiration ( volitionary act ) . This pupil also will probably make the objection that he can not pause , giving as his reason that if he pauses he can not keep time in his song . This objection , of course , will not hold any more than the previous one , for when once the necessary control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for giving the necessary orders will be only momentary . But even if we suppose , for the sake of argument , that the objection holds , of what avail can it be to keep time , if thereby the primary principles which are essential to good singing ? namely , those concerned with the correct and adequate use of the psycho-physical mechanisms connected with respiration ? are treated in practice as secondary factors , and are being actually perverted in use ? In all these considerations we must bear in mind that , in the sphere of acquiring satisfactory psycho-physical functioning , though speed will follow as the result of the necessary experience in the correct use of the parts concerned , a correct use can hardly follow a speed which has been achieved at the cost of an incorrect use of those parts .  | Now that I have indicated the principles which underlie the general scheme which I advocate in connexion with the development of a reliable sensory appreciation , I will go on to describe in detail one of the technical evolutions 1 which I use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should be the attitude of the pupil towards the practical work in connexion with the cultivation and development of the new sensory appreciation during the processes involved in the performance of the evolution , but more particularly as an illustration of the means whereby we may develop a reliable sense appreciation of the minimum of so-called " physical tension " ; for in this sphere of sensory appreciation , the most difficult problem to be solved , in most cases , is concerned with the matter of developing a correct register of the due and proper amount of so-called " muscular tension " necessary at a given time . It is not possible , of course , to tell the pupil in terms of relativity the degree of muscular tension which will be his or her required minimum at any particular moment . Furthermore , even if this were possible , what chance is there that the pupil will be able to register this minimum accurately , when the very factor upon which he will rely for guidance in this connexion ( viz. , his sensory appreciation ) is unreliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known cases where a pupil failed to recognize a difference in muscular tension whether his arms were hanging loosely at his sides , as in the act of walking , or were being used for the performance of an act requiring extreme tension . The question , then , of dealing with the matter of a correct or incorrect degree of " physical tension " is probably , from the teacher 's point of view , the most difficult problem to be solved in the scheme that we are considering . It is clear that this problem can not be solved by the technique involved in the performance of " physical exercises " as such , and the chief danger involved in the performance of exercises associated'with systems of physical culture , posture , etc. , lies in the fact that this fundamental difficulty concerned with muscular tension has been ignored . If ever a plan of development by means of exercises to be performed according to written or spoken instructions ? minus manipulative help ? is to be evolved , this problem will have to be satisfactorily solved . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first published in 1910.  | ever , that in its particular application to the evolution about to be described , this problem has been solved , and in a very practical way , and the unfolding of this part of the technique should prove of great interest to the student . Special attention is directed in this connexion to the instructions given in the following illustration to the pupil in regard to the work to be done with his hands and arms , associated with a more or less co-ordinated body , and particularly to the position of his fingers , wrists , and elbows when placed on the chair as directed . I would add that the correct performance of this evolution calls for the co-ordinated use of the body , legs , and arms , and of the muscular system in general ; it calls , in particular , for their co-ordinated use during the movement of bringing the body forward , and during the act of placing the hands in position on the top rail of the chair , also during the final work to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it to be very clearly understood that when I write of the arms , legs , hands , feet , etc. , I always imply their co-ordinated use with the body as a co-ordinated support . Indeed , we might say that in this sense the body represents the trunk of a tree and the arms the limbs . It must be clearly understood that in what follows it is taken for granted that the pupil gives special attention to the primary principles laid down for him by his teacher , before he attempts to carry out any instructions given him . ' If this is done , the majority of the experiences that the pupil receives should be correct experiences , thus making for the development of confidence and for the continuance of the processes involved in the eradication of defects . footnote 1 It is not possible , of course , to give here all the detailed instructions that would meet every case , because these instructions naturally vary according to the tendencies and peculiarities of the particular pupil . An experienced teacher , however , should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technique to meet the needs of the individual case . We must learn in this connexion to differentiate between the variations of a teacher 's art and the principles of the teaching technique which is being employed .  | IN the technical evolution about to be set down it is necessary to use certain phrases employed in the teaching technique , phrases which I consider call for comment , seeing that they do not always adequately express my meaning and that , furthermore , they can not be defended as being demonstrably accurate . My reader may justly ask , then , why I use them . Readers of Man 's Supreme Inheritance will remember that when I used the phrase " position of mechanical advantage , " I pointed out that I did so because a better one was not forthcoming , and I mentioned then that I had called to my aid a number of scientific and literary friends . I have pursued the same course in regard to the phrases which will follow . As I have already stated , I think them inadequate , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them , they serve their purpose . The phrases are ; r . Shortening the Spine An objector might justly say that this is practically impossible , but we are dealing with the use of the spine , and one of the most common defects among human beings to-day is an undue curving of the spine in the use of the self in the acts of everyday life , and naturally this causes a shortening in stature . As a practical demonstration , take a piece of paper , and after placing it flat on another sheet , draw a line along the extreme ends of the top piece , thereby recording the length by the pencil marks on the paper underneath . Now lift the top piece and curve it slightly and replace it with one end touching one line , and without interfering with the curve . It will then be seen that the other end of the paper does not reach the other line . 2 . Lengthening the Spine The foregoing will serve to show that if we modify the curve in the spine , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to our illustration , if we take the curve out of the top piece io8  | of paper , and replace it as in the first instance , it will reach both lines , showing that during this experiment a lengthening process has been operative . 3 . Relax the Neck There is considerable confusion on the part of the pupil when he attempts to obey directions to relax some part of the organism . In ordinary teaching , pupils and teachers are quite convinced that if some part of the organism is too tense , they can relax it ? that is , do the relaxing by direct means . This is a delusion on their part , but it is difficult to convince them of it . In the first place , if they do chance to get rid of the specific tension it will be by a partial collapse of the parts concerned , or of other parts , possibly even by a general collapse of the whole organism . In the second place , it is obvious that if some part of the organism is unduly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it the work of some other part or parts , often work for which it is quite unsuited. 4 . Head Forward and Up This is one of the most inadequate and often confusing phrases used as a means of conveying our ideas in words , and it is a dangerous instruction to give to any pupil , unless the teacher first demonstrates his meaning by giving to the pupil , by means of manipulation , the exact experiences involved . 5 . Widen the Back This instruction rivals the last one in its shortcomings , when considered as a phrase for the conveyance of an idea which we expect a pupil to construe correctly , unless it is given by a teacher who is capable of demonstrating what he means by readjusting the pupil 's organism so that the conditions desired may be brought about . What really occurs is that there is brought about a very marked change in the position of the bony structures of the thorax ? particularly noticeable if a posterior view is taken ? also a permanent enlargement of the thoracic cavity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle tension of the whole of the mechanisms involved .  | 6 . Support the Body with the Arms This instruction is given to the pupil when he is holding the back of a chair , whilst sitting or standing , in order to give the teacher the opportunity to secure more quickly and easily for the pupil certain experiences essential at a particular stage of his work in co-ordination . The varying details of the means whereby the use indicated of the arms and body is to be gained could not be set down in writing to meet the requirements of each pupil , for they vary with each slight stage of progress . It is for this reason that " correct positions " or " postures " find no place in the practical teaching technique employed in the work of re-education advocated in this book . A correct position or posture indicates a fixed position , and a person held to a fixed position can not grow , as we understand growth . The correct position to-day can not be the correct position a week later for any person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 7 . Widen the Arms Whilst Supporting and Raising the Body This is the most deceptive of the list of instructions set down in these pages . In the first place , if carried out without manipulative assistance , it is a contradictory instruction , seeing that if you widen the arms , as the act is generally understood , the body would be lowered , not raised . The tendency of the pupil in this movement is to contract unduly the inner muscles of the upper part of the arms , a procedure which interferes with the work the teacher has in view . This must be prevented , and a skilful teacher can employ the above instructions successfully to this end . We will now pass on to our illustration . THE PUPIL IS ASKED TO SIT IN A CHAIR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUE SPECIALLY SET DOWN FOR THE ACT OF SITTING AND STANDING IN Man 's Supreme Inheritance . When he is seated , his body being supported by the back of the chair on which he is sitting , another chair is placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS THEN ASKED TO GIVE THE FOLLOWING PREVENTIVE ORDERS .  | In the way of correct direction and guidance , HE IS ASKED TO ORDER THE NECK TO RELAX , TO ORDER THE HEAD FORWARD AND UP TO LENGTHEN THE SPINE . It must here be clearly understood that in the previous manipulative and other work done in connexion with the technique , the pupil will have been made familiar in theory and practice with Order I. He is able to give certain orders correctly and also to put them into effect . In the present instance , it is explained to him that the order given is to be merely preventive ? a projected wish without any attempt on the pupil 's part to carry it out successfully . THE TEACHER REPEATS THE ORDERS AND WITH HIS HANDS HE PROCEEDS TO BRING THE PUPIL 'S BODY GENTLY FORWARD FROM THE HIPS . It is important to note here that the imperfectly co-ordinated person tends to shorten the stature and pull the head back in making this movement forward . Unless , therefore , the pupil remembers this subconscious tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will counteract this subconscious tendency , his old habit will prove too strong for him , and at the first touch from the teacher to bring his body forward , though this touch may be so light that it would not move an inch-thick pinehoard of the same length and width as the torso of the pupil , the latter will start to move forward at a ratio of , say , seventy-five per cent . subconscious response to his old habit , and only twenty-five per cent . conscious response to the new directive and guiding orders . This latter estimate is , in most cases , too liberal a one , for , as a rule , the slightest touch releases the old sensory activities associated subconsciously in the pupil 's conception with the act of " moving forward , " this being an " end " which the pupil , in spite of all warnings to the contrary , has already decided upon , and he becomes so dominated by the idea of " moving forward " ( his " end " ) , that the new conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old subconscious directive orders associated with his bad habits and with his unreliable sensory appreciation hold sway , and so , in the place of ordering his neck to relax , his head forward and up , in order to secure the necessary lengthening , he will actually throw his head back , stiffen his neck , and tend to shorten his spine by unduly curving it , in accordance with his old lixed habit in moving forward . These particular faults are accompanied , more or less , by an undue and incorrect tension of the legs and other parts of the organism , and also by a stiffening at the hip joints , the defective use of the  | parts culminating in an expenditure of energy out of all proportion to the requirements of the evolution . When this happens , the teacher must point out to the pupil that he has not quite comprehended what is required of him , and he must again place the whole position before the pupil , and from as many angles as possible , until he is certain that the pupil understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are preventive orders , and that if he gives these preventive orders ( inhibition of the old misdirected activities ) , and then proceeds to give the new ones , his spine will be kept at its greatest possible length ( not shortened ) , whilst the body will be moved forward from the hips easily and satisfactorily , without interfering with the generally relative position of the torso ( except in the matter of angle ) , just as a door moves on its hinges . THE TEACHER WILL THEN RENEW THE REQUEST TO THE PUPIL TO GIVE THE ORDERS , AND WITH HIS HANDS WILL COMMAND FOR HIM THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF THE MOVEMENT , of which these orders are the counterpart . Sometimes it may be suggested that the pupil shall himself request the teacher to move his body forward for him whilst he ( the pupil ) gives his orders or directions . When the teacher is satisfied that the pupil is giving due attention to the directive orders up to this point , and has gained a due appreciation of their relative value as primary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct sensory experiences , made possible by the teacher 's help in the way of readjustment and re-education , have been sufficiently repeated , the pupil can be taken a step farther in the evolution . At every step in the work it is essential that the pupil should rehearse his orders from the beginning , because these earlier orders constitute the means whereby a further step may be successfully taken . In giving himself orders , the pupil must on every occasion begin with the primary orders before going on to the secondary orders , and so on . THE PUPIL MUST NOW AGAIN , ORDER THE NECK TO RELAX , THE HEAD FORWARD AND UP , WHILST THE TEACHER WITH HIS HANDS SECURES THAT POSITION OF THE TORSO IN WHICH THE BACK MAY BE SAID TO BE WIDENED . These orders should be repeated several times and be continued WHILST THE TEACHER TAKES  | THE PUPIL 'S RIGHT ARM WITH HIS HANDS , AND MOVES IT FORWARD UNTIL THE PUPIL 'S HAND IS ABOVE THE TOP RAIL OF THE BACK OF THE CHAIR . THE PUPIL SHOULD THEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEGINNING OF THIS PARAGRAPH , AND THEN TO TAKE THE WEIGHT OF THE ARM ENTIRELY , AS THE TEACHER DISENGAGES HIS HANDS FROM THE SUPPORTED ARM . Great care must be taken to see that the pupil has not interfered with the mechanism of the torso in the effort to take the weight of the arm . This interference can take place in various ways , but it always implies that the pupil has forgotten his orders and has harked back to one or other of his subconscious habits . What is essential here is a co-ordinated use of the arms , and the only way by which he can secure this is , first , by giving the necessary preventive orders , and then by rehearsing the series of new orders given by the teacher , in which the movement of the arms is linked up with the use of the other parts of the body . If the pupil has not interfered with the mechanism of the torso in the effort to take the weight of the arm , HE SHOULD NEXT BE REQUESTED TO GRASP THE TOP RAIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEEPING THE FINGERS AS straight AS POSSIBLE AND QUITE FLAT AGAINST THE WOOD OF THE FRONT PORTION OF THE TOP RAIL OF THE CHAIR , THE THUMB ALSO TO BE KEPT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE , BEING CALLED UPON TO DO DUTY ON THE BACK PORTION OF THE TOP RAIL OF THE CHAIR , WITH THE WRIST CURVED SLIGHTLY INWARDS TOWARDS THE LEFT . The teacher will , of course , as far as possible , assist the pupil with these hand movements . If , however , as is too often the case , the pupil fails to continue to give his orders , and so interferes with the mechanisms of the torso during the movement of the arm towards the chair , the pupil must be requested to begin once more at the very first step in the evolution , and this must be continued until a satisfactory result has been secured . This principle must be applied in every instance in this work of re-education and readjustment . It should be realized here that , during the course of this work , a process of building is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a specific basis . It will perhaps make this clearer if we use the analogy of building with bricks , for the processes concerned with this fundamental sensory building calls for the use of directive orders , just as the process of ordinary building calls for the use of bricks .  | THE PUPIL MUST THEN BE ASKED AGAIN TO ORDER THE NECK TO RELAX , THE HEAD FORWARD AND UP , AND THE TEACHER WILL REPEAT HIS PREVIOUS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH THAT CONDITION OF THE TORSO AND BACK ESSENTIAL TO SATISFACTORY ARM WORK , WHILST HE REPEATS WITH THE PUPIL 'S LEFT ARM THE EVOLUTION JUST PERFORMED WITH THE RIGHT , SO THAT THE PUPIL WILL BE GRASPING THE BACK OF THE CHAIR WITH THE LEFT HAND IN THE SAME WAY AS HE HAS BEEN HOLDING IT WITH THE RIGHT , the teacher giving such assistance in this movement as he deems necessary in the light of his experience . It will be found that at this , as at every other step in the work , one pupil will need more assistance than another . One pupil will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next will need it at another part , and so on . It may even , in some cases , be necessary for the teacher to give a pupil as much assistance in bringing forward the left arm as he gave him in bringing forward the right arm . In all these matters the decision must be left to the discretion of the teacher . To command success , correct experiences in sensory appreciation must follow the giving of correct directive and guiding orders . By the repetition of this process the pupil reaches a stage where he can depend on himself with confidence . At this point THE PUPIL SHOULD BE ASKED TO RECONSIDER THE DIFFERENT means whereby HE HAS BEEN ENABLED TO REACH THIS STAGE OF HIS WORK , AND TO REPEAT ORALLY THE DIRECTIONS AND GUIDING ORDERS EXACTLY IN THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO IIM BY HIS TEACHER , AS PRIMARY , SECONDARY , AND FOLLOWING FACTORS . In this way the teacher will be able to test the pupil 's accuracy or otherwise in this connexion . Whilst the pupil repeats the orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been secured during the performance of the evolution . When the teacher is satisfied that his pupil has succeeded up to this point , he may go on to give him the additional guiding orders , and proceed to help him to put them into practical effect during the completion of the evolution . The following are the new directive orders . The pupil is asked : ( I ) To CONTINUE TO HOLD THE TOP OF THE CHAIR BY KEEPING THE FINGERS QUITE STRAIGHT FROM THE FIRST JOINTS OF THE FINGERS TO THEIR TIPS , WITH THE THUMBS  | AND FINGERS KEPT FLAT AGAINST THE TOP RAIL OF THE CHAIR AS PREVIOUSLY INDICATED . ( 2 ) To ALLOW THE WRIST OF THE LEFT ARM TO BE CURVED INWARDS TOWARDS THE RIGHT , AND THE WRIST OF THE RIGHT ARM TO BE CURVED INWARDS TOWARDS THE LEFT . ( 3 ) To ALLOW THE ELBOW OF THE LEFT ARM TO BE CURVED OUTWARDS TOWARDS THE LEFT , AND THE ELBOW OF THE RIGHT ARM TO BE CURVED OUTWARDS TOWARDS THE RIGHT . In order that the pupil may hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the position indicated above , HE SHOULD REHEARSE ALL THE DIRECTIVE ORDERS PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO HIM AND WHICH HE HAS ALREADY ORALLY REPEATED TO HIS TEACHER . The teacher 's aim is now to give the pupil the experiences necessary to a gentle , forearm pull from the fingers , and to this end HE WILL TAKE HOLD OF THE PUPIL 'S ELBOWS AND DIRECT THEM OUTWARDS AND SLIGHTLY DOWNWARDS , and , following this , will give the sensory experiences required in DIRECTING THE UPPER PARTS OF THE ARMS ( ABOVE TIE ELBOW ) AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER ( THE RIGHT ARM TOWARDS TBE RIGHT AND THE LEFT ARM TOWARDS THE LEFT ) , IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PUPIL WILL BE SUPPORTING THE TORSO WT1I Ills ARMS . THE PUPIL WILL NOW BE ASKED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE TORSO IN THIS WAY , CONTINUING TO RIDIEARSE HIS ORDERS , whilst the teacher so adjusts the torso that the large " lifting " muscles of the back will be employed co-ordinately with the other parts of the organism in bringing about such use of the respiratory mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of development reached from day to day . Success in this part of the evolutionl will bring about a change in the condition of the back which would be described by the ordinary observer as a " widening of the back . " These orders are the means whereby such use of the mechanisms may be brought about , associated with a satisfactory readjustment of the back , as will cause the floating ribs to move freely , and also tend to develop the maximum intra-thoracic capacity and to establish the most effective use of the respiratory mechanism during the sleeping as well as the waking hours .  | In my opinion , it is expedient here to set down some of the impeding conditions which , in my teaching experience , will be found present , more or less , in the case of every pupil during the attempt at co-ordination at this stage of the movement . The muscular tension , for instance , employed in the use of the fingers and arms is almost always a harmful and unnecessary one . Very frequently this undue tension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers to anything like the best advantage in holding the chair . I have even known instances in which the fingers would actually be kept away from the wood without the pupil 's knowing it . This undue tension is particularly noticeable in the case of the contractor muscles of the arm in the region of the biceps and in that of the pectoral muscles in the front of the chest , whereas in a satisfactory state of sensory appreciation these muscles would remain more or less relaxed during the movement , and the greater part of the work would fall on the muscles of the opposite side of the arm and the back ( chiefly on the latissimus dorsi ) . These would thus be the chief factors in the act , factors which make both for the maximum activity of the respiratory processes , with the minimum of effort , and also for an increased intra-thoracic capacity accompanied by a broadening of the costal arch ( increased vital capacity ) . Other impeding conditions are apt to occur at the pupil 's first attempt to pull gently with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either one or other or all the fingers will become bent and the wrists will be curved outwards , exactly the reverse of the action indicated by the orders or of the one desired . This failure to carry out the given orders is due chiefly to the fact that the pupil 's sensory appreciation in the matter of due and proper muscular tension is sadly inadequate . This leads us directly to a consideration of the means we have adopted whereby a new and reliable sensory appreciation can be developed in the pupil , the means whereby he will be enabled to perform this evolution with the minimum of muscular tension . In this connexion the reader 's attention is specially directed to the following : If the pupil will carry out the act of the forearm pull and attend to the widening of the upper parts of the arms , whilst continuing to recognize as factors of primary importance the keeping of the fingers straight and the wrists curved inwards , the minimum tension will be exerted . Immediately the pupil interferes with the position of the fingers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them outwards instead of inwards ) , this will indicate that the point of minimum muscular tension has been passed .  | It should be remembered here that the pupil 's position in this act is an ideal one for watching the hands and wrists . Therefore , if the pupil will watch carefully any tendency to the incorrect movements described above , these can be checked as soon as they show themselves . But here again we have one of the numerous instances where a person will refrain from doing the thing he knows he can do ( in this instance , to watch the hands ? " means-whereby " ) , and will prefer to depend instead on the old haphazard method of " trying to do it right " guided by his feeling , and this despite the fact that in every experience in which he has taken " feeling " for a guide he has found it to be unreliable and even delusive . There has just come to my knowledge an interesting objection to the importance which I attach to the process of inhibition as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I advocate , and the objection is made on the ground that this use of inhibition will cause harmful suppression in the individual concerned . I shall proceed to show that such an objection is the outcome of a total misunderstanding of the fundamental psycho-physical processes concerned with the application of the preventive principles employed in my technique . There has been and still is a growing tendency to attempt to free children from undue external restraint , both at home and at school , with the idea of preventing those harmful suppressions supposed to be the result of the inhibitions associated with the imposition of the restraint characteristic of less modern methods . The idea concerned is conceived on a specific and curative basis and is generally accepted , particularly in schools where an effort is being made to create conditions of environment and occupation to meet the pupil 's needs . The points I wish to emphasize in this connexion are : ( I ) that the process of inhibition involved is employed in connexion with ideas directly associated with the gaining of " ends , " these ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from some primary desire or need , and ( 2 ) ? and this is all-important ? that the stimulus ( or stimuli ) to inhibit this response comes from without , and the process of inhibition is forced upon the pupil . This means that his desire is thwarted in consequence of compliance with a command from an outside authority , and this could account for the disturbed emotional conditions associated with what is known as suppression .  | Now the inhibitory process involved in my technique has little in common with that to which reference has just been made . For the idea concerned with inhibition in my technique is conceived on a general and preventive basis , and the process of inhibition involved is employed primarily in connexion with ideas which are dissociated from any direct attempt to gain an " end , " but associated instead with that indirect procedure inseparable from the practical application of the principles concerned with the means whereby an end may be gained . These ideas are the response to a stimulus ( or stimuli ) arising from a reasoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles concerned with the " means-whereby , " and as the procedure concerned with the application of these principles involves the prevention of " endgaining " acts , the performance of which is associated with misdirected activities , it follows that the pupil 's acceptance of the need for and efficacy of such procedure includes also his acceptance of the principle of inhibition of primary desires concerned with such " end-gaining " acts . This , again , really means that in the application of my technique the process of inhibition ? that is , the act of refusing to respond to the primary desire to gain an " end " ? becomes the act of responding ( volitionary act ) to the conscious reasoned desire to employ the means whereby that " end " may be gained . The stimulus to inhibit , therefore , in this case comes from within , and the process of inhibition is not forced upon the pupil . This means that the pupil 's desire or desires will be satisfied , not thwarted , and that there will be present desirable emotional and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suppression in any form . ' footnote i There are many persons who pride themselves on self-control who are really victims of enslavement to a fixed end " ? that is , they do not control themselves by stopping to think out the " means-whereby " to their " ends , " but by excluding everything which does not agree with the " ends " which they have set up as right and proper . They themselves may contend that their control is purely self-imposed and not externally imposed , but to other persons it manifests itself as a form of rigidity . On the other hand , control which results from stopping to reason out the means whereby desired ends may be secured is unassociated with that rigidity which is inseparable from enslavement to preconceived and unreasoned ideas and beliefs , or to hard-and-fast rules in regard to what is right and proper in conduct and procedure .  | The tendency of people on a subconscious plane to speak and act without adequate thought or consideration is a particularly marked manifestation , when there is present an unusually potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice and emotional disturbances . We are all familiar with the phrases , " Why do n't you think before you act ? " , " Think before you speak , " and so on . When the human creature 's activities are on a plane of constructive , conscious control , he will have reached a standard of development and use of the processes of inhibition ( as outlined in the technique which I advocate ) which will enable him to apply in practice to his activities in the outside world the very principles concerned with the processes of inhibition which he has applied to the use of his psycho-physical self , with accruing benefit in both spheres of application . In this connexion I will now give an incident which I think is of particular interest and pertinence as showing the application of the technique employed in the work of re-education on a general basis to the practical ways of life , and also the analogy which exists between the process of " linking-up " ( association of ideas ) during the lessons , and the process of linking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of everyday life . I also give it in proof of the fundamental value of the principle of inhibition involved . A pupil of mine , an author , had been in a serious state of health for some time , and had at last readied the point where he was unable to carry on his literary work . After finishing his latest book he passed through a crisis which was described as a " break-down , " with the result that even a few hours of work caused him great fatigue and brought on a state of painful depression . From the outset of his lessons , therefore , I expressly stipulated that he should stop and make a break at the end of each half-hour 's writing , and should then either do fifteen minutes ' work in respiratory re-education , or take a walk in the open air before resuming his writing . One afternoon he came to his lesson unusually depressed and enervated , and , in response to my inquiries , he admitted that he had been indulging in his literary work that morning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my express stipulation that he must make frequent breaks . I pointed out to him that if he had been continuing his work for four hours without a break ,  | we could not be surprised at the unfortunate result , for , as I explained to him , during deep thought , as in sleep , the activity of the respiratory processes is reduced to a minimum , a very harmful minimum in his case , owing to the inadequacy of his intra-thoracic capacity , this latter condition being one of the symptoms of his break-down . " But I am unable to stop when once I get into my work , " said my pupil . I suggested that if this were so , it must come from some lack of control on his part . " But surely , " my pupil objected , " it must be a mistake to break a train of thought ? " I answered that my experience went to show that this was not the case , that , on the contrary , as far as I could see , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring thought , and take it up again , as it is to carry on a train of thought , whilst taking a walk with all its attendant interruptions , and that this should be possible not only without loss of connexion , but with accruing benefit fo the individual concerned . In all this I was really preparing the way to a special end ? namely , the attempt to show my pupil the analogy that existed between the point in question and his difficulty in accomplishing certain simple parts of the technique in his lessons through his disinclination to stop . I wished to convince him that the gaining of control in the simple psycho-physical evolutions in which we were engaged during the lessons meant sooner or later the gaining of control in the practical spheres of his daily life . My pupil had failed to make this all-important connexion between his work in re-education and his outside activities , and therefore the connexion between the difficulty he experienced in " stopping " in his lessons and " stopping " in the midst of his literary work had completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in like case with thousands of other well-educated and intelligent people who , in dealing with a situation , fail to make an obvious association of ideas , and so miss most important connecting links between different factors in a case . In this particular instance , had my pupil made the necessary connexion between the difficulty he had in " stopping " in his lessons and " stopping " in his activities outside , this recognition would have given a new meaning , and therefore an added stimulus , to the psycho-physical effort upon which the successful working-out of the technique depends. ,  | WE shall probably find the best practical illustration of the need for correct sensory experiences in guidance and control if we consider sensory appreciation in its connexion with the psycho-mechanics of respiration . It is universally admitted that there are harmful defects in the use of the respiratory mechanisms and a corresponding deterioration in the chest capacity and mobility of the great majority of people . The scientific medical man describes certain types of children as born with a " low respiratory need , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more or less imperfectly coordinated and its organism is functioning much nearer to its minimum than to its maximum capacity . This condition of inadequate vital functioning is present in the greater number of men , women , and children of to-day , and is one that is commonly associated with what we speak of as " bad breathing . " For we say that a person is a " bad breather , " or that he " breathes imperfectly . " But we must remember that this so-called " bad breathing " is only a symptom and not a primary cause of his malcondition , for the standard of breathing depends upon the standard of general co-ordinated use of the psycho-physical mechanisms . What we ought to say , therefore , in such a case is not that a person " breathes badly , " but that he is badly co-ordinated . The truth is that when we refer to this mal-co-ordinated condition as " bad breathing , " we are rnistaking a general malcondition for a specific defect , and the conception of the respiratory act which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of expressing it , provides yet another instance of the dominance of our general attitude by the " end-gaining " principle . This " end-gaining " principle is again dominant when it is decided that a person who is spoken of as a " bad breather " needs specific " breathing exercises " or " lessons in breathing . " We shall see that in this , as in so many other spheres , a vicious circle is developed . In the attempt to make this clear we must give consideration to the fundamental principles upon which these breath-  | ing exercises ( usually called " deep-breathing " exercises ) or " lessons in breathing " are based . Take any book on breathing , whether written by a scientific author or by an expert in vocal or " physical culture , " and read the written instructions in connexion with the exercises therein advocated . Take the opportunity also , when possible , to be present when the unfortunate children or adults in a gymnasium are being given a lesson in breathing or are performing their breathing exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes concerned are directed towards specific and not general improvement , and though the people who are guilty of teaching " breathing exercises " may differ in detail of method , they all base their work alike on the same specific " endgaining " principle . I shall now proceed to detail the processes involved . The pupil is asked to take a deep breath . He may also be asked to perform some " physical " movement at the same time as he takes the deep breath , the idea behind this request being that the performance of the movement may help to increase the chest expansion . Yet it is a scientific fact that all " physical " tension tends to cause thoracic ( chest ) rigidity and breathlessness ( lack of respiratory control ) , two conditions which should be avoided as far as possible by such pupils during their attempts to pass from . conditions which are symptomatic of bad breathing to those which ensure satisfactory respiratory functioning . It will be necessary for the layman to watch the pupil ' ( or pupils ) carefully during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connexion with " deep breathing . " Specific defects and peculiarities to be noted during the process have already been set down in Man 's Supreme Inheritance . Here we wish to refer only to the defective general use of the psycho-physical organism during these attempts . In order to make the point , we must refer to the fact that the pupil or the teacher , or both , must have recognized certain harmful manifestations which called for some remedial procedure on the lines of " deep-breathing , " etc . Hence the decision to employ " deep-breathing " as a remedy . These harmful manifestations would be the result of certain incorrect psycho-physical uses of the organism . This would indicate that the sensory appreciation in the  | sphere of guidance and control of the psycho-physical mechanisms concerned must have become unreliable and defective , and in the present instance , so far as the observation of the teacher and pupil is concerned , certain defects must have been particularly noticeable in the use of the breathing mechanisms . Here we have a clear case of certain established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unreliable sensory guidance and control , and any effort to remedy these incorrect uses by means of such processes as " Beeping " or " lessons in breathing " is merely an attempt to correct a general defective condition of psycho-mechanics by a specific remedial process . In other words , it is an attempt to correct the imperfect uses by the performance of exercises , the guidance and direction in such performance being associated with the same imperfect sensory appreciation which was already established when the lessons began . This means that with the continued practice of the exercises , the original defects in the general use of the mechanisms will become more and more pronounced and , what is more , increase in number . It may be argued that , as the result of the lessons , the pupil 's chest measurements are increased , that he " feels better , " and so on . We are quite ready to admit that this may be so , but owing to the unreliability of his sensory appreciation , what he feels is as likely as not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it for the pupil to " feel better , " if he is still left with a defective sensory appreciation to guide him in all his activities during his waking moments as well as his sleeping hours ? It is only a matter of time before the unfortunate pupil will be awakened from his dream by discovering that he has developed certain other serious conditions . I should like here to point out that . these serious conditions must result , sooner or later , from the lack in such cases of a reliable guiding sensory appreciation , also from the lack of psycho-physical co-ordination which is associated therewith , and which continues to increase whilst these conditions are present . We have all known people who tell of the improvement in their chest measurement from the practice of exercises . The writer has examined many such in the course of thirty years ' professional investigation . In the majority of these cases the supposed increase in chest capacity has been chiefly due to muscular development on the outside of the  | bony chest , in other cases to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to that co-ordinated use of the psycho-physical system which is associated with a real increase in the intra-thoracic ( inner chest ) capacity ) . And it is the same in the case of those who tell you that they " feel better " as the result of these exercises , for to the expert observer it is obvious that the habit of " sniffing " ( sucking in air ) , the contraction of the alae nasi , the depression of the larynx , and all the accompanying defective use of the organism associated with the practice of the exercises must , sooner or later , cause serious nose , ear , eye , and throat troubles . In other words , the exponents of these breathing exercises act in direct pursuance of their " end , " remaining oblivious to the harmfulness of the means whereby they are attempting to bring this " end " about , and to the many wrong uses they are cultivating during the process . This method of procedure , as we have seen , is the very opposite of that which underlies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conscious , general basis , and we will consider the application of this process to a satisfactory use of the psycho-physical mechanisms . We will begin by a consideration of the fundamental psychophysical principles underlying the act of breathing . In the course of this consideration it will be found that breathing is many times removed from the primary principle concerned , and that , therefore , it is incorrect and harmful to speak of " teaching a person to breathe , " or of " giving lessons in breathing or deep-breathing . " Such a stimulus to the subconsciously controlled person at once induces projections of all the established incorrect guiding orders associated with imperfect or inadequate breathing processes ; in other words , this stimulus sets in motion all our bad habits in breathing . Breathing is that psycho-physical act by means of which air is taken into and expelled from the lungs of the creature . The lungs are an extremely interesting part of our anatomy . They consist of two bags containing a network of cells capable of contraction and expansion , with air passages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnote 1 An interesting delusion prevalent with teachers of breathing exercises is that of mistaking an increase in the muscle development on the outer walls of the chest for increase in intra-chest ( thoracic ) capacity .  | tained in the air , when taken into the lungs , can be absorbed through the tissue of the blood-vessels and cells and air passages , whilst carbonic acid gas ( poison ) passes through this tissue from the blood-vessels into the lung cells to be expelled from the lungs . The thorax ( chest ) has a bony structure , made up of the vertebrae of the spine , the different ribs , and the sternum ( breast-bone ) , those ribs which are attached to the sternum as well as to the spine being much less mobile than those which are not attached to the sternum , the most mobile being known as " floating ribs . " The lungs are enclosed within the cavity of this bony thorax of which the diaphragm is the floor , and the only entrance to which is through the trachea ( windpipe ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less constant air pressure ( atmospheric pressure ) within the lungs , but not any air pressure on the outside of the lungs . Air pressure is sufficient to overcome the elasticity of the tissue of the air-cells , and to increase their size , when not held in check by the pressure of the walls of the thorax upon the lung-bag itself . The lungs are subject , however , to this pressure exerted by the walls of the thorax during the contraction , and to the release of this pressure during the expansion of the thoracic cavity . The pressure that can be exerted by the walls of the thorax on the outside of the lungbag is much greater than that which results from the atmospheric pressure ( air pressure ) within the lungs . Therefore , when we wish , as we say , to " take a breath " ( inspiration ) , all we have to do is to reduce the pressure exerted upon the lungs by the chest walls , and to employ those muscular coordinations which increase the intra-thoracic capacity of the lungs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lung-cells of which atmospheric pressure takes advantage , by increasing the size of the cells and thus the amount of air in the lungs . It then follows that if we wish to exhale breath ( expiration ) , we merely have to increase the pressure on the lungs by contracting the walls of the thorax , thereby overcoming the atmospheric pressure exerted within the lungs , and thus forcing the air out of them . It must be remembered that in all these contractions and expansions , the floor of the cavity ( diaphragm ) plays its part , moving upwards or downwards in sympathy with the particular adjustment of the bony thorax.  | Consideration of the foregoing will serve to convince the reader that if anyone desires , either by his own effort or with the help of a teacher , to secure the maximum control and development in breathing , all that he has to do is to be able to command the maximum functioning of the psycho-physical mechanisms concerned with the satisfactory expansion and contraction of the walls of the thoracic ( chest ) cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking a breath ; as a matter of fact , it is more or less harmful to do so , when such psycho-physical conditions are present as call for re-education on a general basis . The crux of the whole matter , then , is how to gain this control in expanding and contracting the chest , as we say , and thus permanently to increase its capacity and mobility . The answer to this question calls for a comprehensive consideration of the primary , secondary , and other psycho-physical factors involved . Naturally , the most potent stimulus to the use of the respiratory mechanisms is the necessity for an adequate supply of oxygen , and for the elimination of carbonic acid gas ( poison ) from the blood . But we must not overlook the fact that in any attempt to gain for a pupil the desired control and the increased thoracic capacity , the pupil 's incorrect use of the mechanisms involved is an impeding factor , and so , in attempts to correct such imperfect use , the first consideration must be to prevent the psycho-physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and employment of the pupil 's ability to inhibit . This demands from the teacher a correct diagnosis of the pupil 's numerous bad habits in connexion with the act of respiration in everyday life , and a comprehensive understanding of the imperfections in sensory appreciation , conception , adjustment , and co-ordination which are manifested in these bad habits . As a result of the diagnosis , the teacher will go on to explain to the pupil why certain readjustments and improved coordinations are necessary in his case , and will then give him a reasoned consideration of the means whereby these readjustments and improved co-ordinations may be secured . To this end the teacher will first name the preventive guiding orders or directions which the pupil is to give to himself in the way of inhibiting the deceptive guiding sensations concerned with the defective use of the mechanisms responsible for what we  | call bad habits in breathing . The teacher must make certain that the pupil remembers these guiding orders or directions in the sequence in which they are to be employed . When this has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the work of prevention . This means a series of repeated experiences on the part of the pupil in refusing to try for the end , " and in positively pausing to think of the original faults pointed out by the teacher , and refusing to repeat them . For instance , suppose that a pupil has a special desire to increase his chest capacity . This desire acts as a stimulus to the psycho-physical processes involved and sets in motion all the unreliable guiding and directing sensations associated with his established idea of chest expansion . The only way , then , by which he can prevent the old subconscious habits from gaining the upper hand is for him to refuse to act upon this idea . This means that as soon as the idea or desire comes to him he definitely stops and says to himself : " No . I wo n't do what I should like to do to increase my chest capacity , because , if I do what I feel will increase it , I shall only use my mechanisms as I have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I know I have been using them incorrectly up to now , else why do I need these lessons ? " In other words , he inhibits his desire to act . The teacher , of course , must decide when the pupil can proceed from the preventive to the next stage of his work . He must then proceed to name for the pupil the new orders in connexion with the satisfactory guiding sensations concerned with the correct use of the mechanisms involved . The pupil should recall and give himself these new guiding orders , whilst the teacher , by means of his manipulation , assists him to secure the correct readjustment and co-ordination ( the desired " end " ) , thus ensuring a series of satisfactory experiences which should be repeated until the bad habits are eradicated and the new and correct experiences replace t hem and become established . Repetition of these correct experiences is all that is required to establish a satisfactory use of the co-ordinated psychophysical mechanisms concerned , when an increase or decrease in the intra-thoracic ( chest ) capacity can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mathematical precision . The increase in the intra-thoracic ( chest ) capacity indicated decreases the pressure on the outside of the lung-  | bag and causes a momentary partial vacuum in the lungs . This vacuum is promptly filled with air , in consequence of the atmospheric pressure exerted upon the inside of the lung-cells , and this process increases the amount of air in the lungs , constituting the act of what we call " taking a breath " ( inspiration ) . The marvellous efficiency of the respiratory machine , when properly employed , becomes apparent when we realize that we have only to continue to employ the same means whereby we secure the increase ( expansion ) to secure the decrease ( contraction ) of the intra-thoracic capacity , which means that in process the contracting chest walls exert such increased pressure on the lungs that the air-pressure within is overcome , and the air consequently expelled , this process constituting " expiration " ; the expiration and previous inspiration being the completed act of breathing . When a satisfactory , coordinated use of the mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the teacher may then proceed to help the pupil to employ this co-ordinated use in connexion with all vocal effort . As has been pointed out in Man 's Supreme Inheritance , this should begin with whispered vocalization , preferably the vowel sound " Ah , " as this form of vocal use , being so little employed in everyday life , is rarely associated with ordinary bad psycho-physical habits in vocalization . For this reason , the teacher will begin by helping the pupil to make the expiration on a whispered " Ah . " This calls for a knowledge of the psycho-physical " means-whereby " of the use of the organism in general , and of the acts of opening the mouth , using the lips , tongue , soft palate , etc. , with freedom from stress and strain of the vocal mechanisms , and to this end a definite technique is employed . The process involved prevents sniffing and " sucking in air , " undue depression of the larynx , and undue stiffening of the muscles of the throat , vocal organs , and neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the chest during inspiration , its undue depression during expiration , and also many other defects which are developed by any imperfectly co-ordinated person who attempts to learn " breathing " or " deep-breathing , " etc. , guided by the unreliable sensory appreciation which is always associated with an imperfectly co-ordinated condition of the psycho-physical mechanism .  | THERE can be little doubt that the process of reasoning tends to develop more quickly and to reach a higher standard in a person whose attitude towards life might be described as calm and collected . In such a person the psycho-physical processes called " habits " are governed by moderation , and his inhibitory processes are adequately developed in all spheres of activity . Their use is not limited to those comparatively few spheres where it was considered necessary to establish taboos during the early and later periods of man 's struggle with the problems which arose in the various stages of the civilizing process . In these spheres there has been a harmful and exaggerated development of the inhibitory processes , often causing virtues to become almost vices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful lack of the development of inhibition , particularly in those spheres connected with the use of the psycho-physical mechanisms in practical activity . This represents an unbalanced use of this wonderful process of inhibition , and tends to produce , as a general result , a state of unbalanced psycho-physical functioning throughout the whole organism , and to establish what we shall refer to as " the unduly excited reflex " process . This unbalanced psycho-physical condition of the civilized human creature is apparent in most spheres of activity , and the child of to-day is more predisposed to the factors which make for this condition than his parents or their ancestors . This child , therefore , starts his school career with a comparatively poor equipment on the inhibitory side . Now volition and inhibition are invaluable birthrights of the human creature and should be developed equally , as it were , hand in hand , but from the first moment of a child 's school life right on to adolescence the training 1 he receives tends to interfere with footnote The fact of the great number of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implicit obedience expected of them at school and at home , does not affect my contention that the children of to-day manifest a serious lack on the inhibitory side in all activity involving the use of the psycho-physical organism .  | his balanced development , and so is another factor in the cultivation of those psycho-physical defects and abnormalities which make for the unbalanced conditions to which we have already referred . Unduly excited fear reflexes , uncontrolled emotions , prejudices , and fixed habits , are retarding factors in all human development . They need our serious attention , for they are linked up with all psycho-physical processes employed in growth and development on the subconscious plane . Hence , by the time adolescence is reached these retarding factors have become present in a more or less degree , and the processes thus established in psycho-physical use will make for the continued development of such retarding factors . This is particularly the case when a person endeavours to learn something calling for new experiences . It is only necessary to watch adult pupils at their lessons to realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less uncontrolled emotions are a striking feature in their endeavours to carry out new instructions correctly . Watch the fixed expression of these pupils , for instance , their jerky , uncontrolled movements , and their tendency to hold the breath by assuming a harmful posture and exerting an exaggerated strain such as they would employ in performing strenuous " physical " acts . In many cases there will be a twitching of the muscles of the mouth and cheeks , or of the fingers . In each case the stimulus to these misdirected activities is the pupil 's idea or conception that he must try to do correctly whatever the teacher requests , and , as we have seen , on the subconscious plane the teacher insists upon this . The teacher of re-education on a conscious plane does not make this demand of his pupils , for he knows by experience , and has to face the fact that in cases where there is an imperfect functioning of the organism , an individual can not always do as he is told correctly . He may " want " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to do it , but as long as the psycho-mechanics by which he tries to carry out his teacher 's directions are not working satisfactorily , every attempt he makes to carry out his teacher 's directions " correctly " ( trying to be right ) is bound to end in comparative failure . For in making these attempts , as we point out elsewhere , the pupil has only his own judgment to depend on as to what is correct , and since his judgment is based cm incorrect  | direction and delusive sensory appreciation , he is held within the vicious circle of his old habits as long as he tries to carry out the directions " correctly . " Paradoxical as it may seem , the pupil 's only chance of success lies , not in " trying to be right , " but , on the contrary , in " wanting to be wrong " ? wrong , that is , according to any standard of his own . In this connexion it is most important to remember that every unsuccessful " try " not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conception of a particular act , but involves at the same time new emotional experiences of discouragement , worry , fear , and anxiety , so that the wrong experiences and the unduly excited reflex process involved in these experiences become one in the pupil 's recognition ; they " make the meat they feed on , " and the more conscientious the teacher and the pupil are on this plan , the worse the situation becomes for both . It is for this reason that the teacher on a conscious plane does not expect a pupil , as I have pointed out , to perform " correctly " a new act calling for new experiences , but instead , by means of manipulation , gives to the pupil the new experiences , repeating them until they become established . We have seen , indeed , in Chapter III that he asks his pupil not to make any attempt to gain the " end " at all , but instead to learn gradually to remember the guiding orders or directions , which are the forerunners of the means whereby the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to-day , to-morrow , or the next day , but it will be : the pupil will then be able to repeat the act with mathematical precision at all times and under all circumstances , for such retarding factors as unduly excited fear reflexes , uncontrolled emotions , and fixed prejudices will not have been developed in the process just outlined . Indeed , a process which does not involve a pupil 's being asked to perform any act until his teacher has prepared the way by raising the standard of t lie pupil 's sensory appreciation and psycho-physical co-ordination to that satisfactory state which will enable him to perform the act , as we say , easily , will be a process which ensures that the pupil 's experiences will be , with rare exceptions , satisfactory experiences , which make for confidence and are not associated with those emotional disturbances which tend towards the minimum instead of the maximum functioning .  | The relation of all this to the very important question of the ability to " keep one 's head " at critical moments is clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have raised in the foregoing to such activities as playing games and to other performances in which skill and so-called " presence of mind " are required . We constantly hear in this connexion remarks like the following : " I did n't do so badly at it at first , but the longer I play the worse I play . " One writer in the public Press remarks that it is a curious feature of golf that " the more one knows about it . the more difficult it seems to become " ; and another writes that a well-known professional had " confessed . that golf had become almost too much for him . " All this applies equally , of course , to other games , but I have chosen golf for my illustration because it happens that writers on golf , commenting on some of the incidents that have occurred at matches during the past two years or so , have unwittingly emphasized the existence of the problem which underlies these admissions and with which I am dealing in the present book . For instance , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some simple stroke when under an unusual stress and at a moment when success depends on their not throwing a chance away ; they have pointed to the tendency of some players to become confused and to hurry their strokes through anxiety to " get it over " ; " truly heart-breaking " is the description of one such incident , words that will be echoed by many who have had similar discouraging experiences in other matters besides golf . We are told that this is all a matter of " nerves " and so forth . It is undoubtedly a case of the undue excitement of fear reflexes on the player 's part ? fear , for instance , that he may miss a shot which he knows he is not in the habit of missing and ought not to miss . As a pupil once said to me at a first interview : " I am always coming up again " st things that I know I can do , and yet when it comes to the point , I ca n't do them . " The fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear reflexes are unduly and harmfully excited by the teaching methods employed , according to which demands are made upon us that we are not able to fulfil . So , for a time , we get bad results , with the undue and harmful development of emotional reflex processes which , as we have  | seen , inevitably accompanies these unsuccessful attempts . We continue to practise on wrong lines , so that our successful experiences are few and our unsuccessful experiences many . We attempt on a subconscious basis to develop a particular stroke , and in any failure to make the stroke satisfactorily the imperfect use of the psycho-physical mechanisms plays more than its fair share . It is experiences like this which cause disappointment and undue excitement of fear reflexes and serious emotional disturbances , and nothing whatever is done at this later stage of the process to nullify these effects of the psycho-physical experiences cultivated during the earlier stages . These emotional disturbances were part and parcel of an unbalanced psycho-physical condition , of a state of anxiety and confusion , and there can be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to bring about a recurrence of the same disturbed psycho-physical condition as was experienced by the subject during his early efforts to make the stroke . But , beyond this , we must remember that it is only the small minority of experts in any line who really know how they get their results and effects , l in the case of golf , for instance , how they perform their most successful strokes . Therefore directly anything puts them " off their game , " they experience considerable difficulty , at any rate , in getting on to it again . It is only by having a clear conception of what is required for the successful performance of a certain stroke or other act , combined with a knowledge of the psycho-physical means whereby those requirements can he met , that there is any reasonable possibility of their attaining sureness and confidence during performance . I would here refer my readers to my earlier volume , where this point was dealt with at some length in connexion with golf , and I have the less hesitation in doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the endorsement of such a distinguished golfer as Mr. John Duncan Dunn , 2 a matter , footnote The same thing applies to the expert singer who does not know how he sings , any more than the political and social leaders of our time know how much more they are influenced in their decisions and actions by their prejudices and " emotional gusts " than by their reasoning processes . 2 Author of ABC of Golf . Intimate Golf Talks ( Dunn and Jessup ) .  | naturally , of great gratification to me . I there attempted to make clear that the success of any particular process in golf , such as , for instance , " following through , " must depend , primarily , on the general condition of psycho-physical development and control present , because a player whose sensory appreciation is in any way at fault can not satisfactorily carry out directions given to him . For the indispensable preliminary to success is a reliable sensory appreciation which will guide the particular player in his efforts to reach and maintain during the stroke an adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This satisfactory general use is essential to satisfactory specific use . By chance or good luck a man may make a good stroke without having attained to a good standard in the general use of himself , but he can never be reasonably certain of repeating it , and the experiences associated with this state of uncertainty do not make for the growth of confidence , but rather for the development of undue fear reflexes and serious emotional disturbances ) . We must realize that if an individual is to reach that satisfactory stage of progress where he can be reasonably certain of success in achieving his " ends , " those principles must be observed which imply reliance in all activities upon the means whereby an " end " may be gained , irrespective of whether , during the progress of the activities concerned , the perform- footnote The following quoted from the Times , October 29th , 192I , is a delightful little parable showing the fallacy of expecting pupils to be able to put right some defect unless the means whereby they can correct it is first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the course , I came across two elderly gentlemen playing a short hole .

The application of these principles in any sphere of learning means that the teacher during lessons must be able to supply the pupil 's needs in the matter of reliable sensory appreciation , by giving him from day to day the necessary experiences until they become established . No technique which does not meet the demands herein indicated will prove satisfactory as a means of re-educating a pupil on a general basis to a reliable plane of conscious activity . When this plane is reached , the individual comes to rely upon his " means-whereby , " and does not become disturbed by wondering whether the activities concerned will be right or wrong . Why should he , seeing that the confidence with which he proceeds with his task is a confidence born of experiences , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexes ? This confidence is further reinforced by his confidence in the reliability of his sensory appreciation which ensures that any interference with the coordinated use of himself will come to his consciousness as soon as it occurs ( awareness ) . This consciousness is really a state of acute awareness which has been developed in him during the processes of re-education and co-ordination on a general basis , and the confidence associated with it is not likely to desert him in moments of crisis . It is true that he may be put off the right track , but he knows that it will be only momentarily , as he is certain that his awareness , associated as it is with reliable sensory appreciation , will not fail him in such situations or crises , but will prove his protector and reliable guide ; for this state of awareness means that he will be able at such moments to remember , to reason , and to judge ( that is , to size up the situation , as we say ) , and the resultant judgment , based as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unduly excited fear reflexes , will be in its turn a sound and reliable judgment . This matter of unduly excited fear reflexes has been referred to in the chapter on education , and here I wish to discuss processes used in tests made on children in this connexion . In some schools special mechanical tests are made in order to discover the potentialities and qualities of the children and to grade them accordingly . The young and undeveloped organism of the child 's " mental apparatus " is , as it were , put upon the rack , and his intellectual status and probably  | his educational fate depend upon the result of these tests which are supposed to be a reliable guide , not only as to the line of procedure to be taken in regard to the details of his school education , but also as to the particular career for which he will be best adapted when the state of adolescence is reached . A teacher recently told me of an interesting personal experience in this connexion . She visited a modern school where a psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy , muscular control , observation , etc . She was taken into a small room set apart for the purpose of such tests . A boy of seven was waiting there to be tested for " control . " He had shown various symptoms which were described as " nervous , " and the test to be taken was to enable the school authorities to prescribe a curriculum to meet his special needs . The test was made as follows . An apparatus , electrically worked , was placed in front of the child . It consisted of a metal tray in which were sunk two rows of shallow circular holes decreasing gradually in size from that of a shilling to a very small size . The boy was told to touch the centre of each hole with a small metal rod tapering to a point like a pencil . If he made a mistake and touched the side of a hole in his effort to get the centre , an electric flash would be the result . The child , so I was told , was already in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , " Now you must try to touch the centre of each hole , and do not touch the side of any hole or else you will make a flash , " he at once became so excited through the fear of making a mistake that his hand shook and he stiffened and tensed his whole body unduly in making the first try . He was therefore unable to control his hand to find the centre of the first hole , touched the side and produced a flash . Still more frightened by this , still more anxious not to do the wrong thing again , he/ proceeded from hole to hole , making flash after flash , realizing that every mistake he made was being noted by the " tester , " against him , as he thought , so that by the time he had reached the last hole his condition was one of undue excitement . It is obvious that a test taken with such emotional conditions present was not a reliable test of his control or a trustworthy guide to anyone wishing to estimate his potentialities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove by demon-  | stration that nine out of ten of the children now being submitted to tests are imperfectly co-ordinated , and that a great number are beset with very serious psycho-physical defects . Now in this matter of tests , because the human organism is an animate machine , I wish to carry the reader on to a consideration of an inanimate machine ? say a motor car . Would any sane person attempt to test a motor car on the road if he were certain that a number of the important parts of the mechanism were imperfectly adjusted ? And if he happened to be foolish enough to do this with his badly adjusted machine , could he expect to judge of the standard of functioning of that particular make of car by the result of these tests ? These are unreasonable propositions such as no mechanic would entertain for a moment . But , unfortunately , in the field of education the same idea in regard to mechanics does not prevail . The " end-gaining " principle holds sway , and in the sphere of psycho-physical activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it had clone so , the psychological expert in tests would have demanded that a child should be in a satisfactory state of co-ordination and adjustment before he would consent to make tests as to the child 's potentialities . He would then be dealing with a psycho-physical organism functioning satisfactorily , and tests made with these conditions present could probably he of some assistance to those concerned with the child 's growth and development and future career . Where the imperfectly co-ordinated child is concerned , its first need is to be readjusted and co-ordinated on a plane of conscious control , until the standard of functioning in psychophysical use of the organism is adecplate . The organism will then function as near to the maxuuuni as is possible , and the potentialities for improved functioning will continue as the child gradually develops to that standard of conscious guidance and control in psycho-physical use which makes for the conditions essential to the fullest development of latent potentialities . We have all heard instances advanced of wonderful feats being performed by people in an emotional state , of " faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cures " are  | in that uncontrolled and harmful psycho-physical state which is akin to conditions associated with drunkenness , and which at times approximates to mild insanity . For instance , the writer was acquainted with a man who never accomplished anything worth mentioning in his particular sphere of life until he was half crazed with alcohol . He also knows of a carriage painter who is unable to put in the straight lines satisfactorily unless he is well under the influence of alcohol . We can all point to instances of men and women who have performed remarkable acts whilst in an uncontrolled emotional state , in which they have been a danger to themselves and to those around them . Men are sent into battle in a half-drunken condition in order that their " controls " may be temporarily released , and for centuries bands of musicians have been employed in warfare to induce this emotional condition of lowered control . " Muddling through by instinct " is unintelligent enough , but deliberately to induce in human beings by artificial means ( such as the processes involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revivalism , etc. ) a condition of lowered control , where intelligence and reasoning are superseded by uncontrolled emotions , is a procedure which may be described as an insult to even a very lowly evolved intelligence . All concerned reach the borderland of insanity through the use of such means for the accomplishment of their aims , and the psycho-physical experiences involved have only to be repeated sufficiently to bring madness in their train . In all these instances the " end-gaining " principle is in operation , and the people subjected to these unnatural and harmful experiences are more or less influenced by them in after life , for the uncontrolled forces which run riot on these occasions are rarely mastered again , and recur more or less in other spheres of activity , frequently developing into dangerous manifestations , culminating often in tragedy . Small wonder that after the experience of 1914 ? 18 and 1939 ? 45 we are confronted with dangerous uncontrolled forces in human activity which , before the Wars , were manifested by only a small minority ! When the individual is dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause him to indulge in dangerous activities , leading him temporarily to experiences which are well within the psycho-physical state which we call " insanity . " The repetition of such experiences is the beginning of the  | formation of what we call a habit , in this case the habit of unbalanced psycho-physical activity , and unfortunately , as we all know , it does not take long to establish a bad habit . ' Socalled " mental " tricks are more common than purely " physical " tricks , and we are well aware that , when indulged in , they soon become a habit , and that the indulgence of one bad habit tends to the development of others , with a rapid increase in the degree of indulgence . In this matter of had habits , and the lack of control which they connote , we must recognize the fact that the human creature can not be expected to exercise control in the different spheres of his activity in civilization unless he is in possession of reliable sensory appreciation and of a satisfactory use of the psycho-physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found to be imperfectly co-ordinated , and their sensory appreciation to be unreliable , and no form of discipline or other outside influence can secure that satisfactory standard of psycho-physical functioning without which the individual can not command a satisfactory standard of control within or without the organism . Where the human being manifests this lack of control , he needs to be re-educated on a general basis so that reliable sensory appreciation may be restored , together with a satisfactory employment of the psycho-physical mechanisms . The processes of this form of re-education demand that the " meanswhereby " to any " end " must he reasoned out , not on a specific but on a general basis , and with the continued use of these processes of reasoning , uncontrolled impulses and " emotional gusts " will gradually cease to dominate , and will ultimately be dominated . The organism will not then be called upon to satisfy those unhealthy cravings which we find associated with unreliable and delusive sensory appreciation ( debauched kinwsthesia ) . The fact is , the principle of reasoning out on a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , once established , are very hard to break . A curious feature of this habit is that , in certain cases , though you may remove the cause for worry , and the subject may admit that the cause has been removed , the removal of the cause does not remove the " mental " state which the subject declared was the cause of the worry . The fact is , the person has developed the worry habit , a state in which he manufactures the stimulus to worry .  | the means whereby we shall command our " ends " simply implies a common-sense procedure . Common sense is a very familiar phrase and we all have our particular conception of what it means . We know many people who will point out that individual opinion can differ as much in regard to the meaning of common sense , as in regard to religious , political , social , and educational matters . We will therefore put our point of view in regard to common sense by giving an instance in which we consider the human creature does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is suffering from digestive and liver disorders , and knows that this has been caused by his indulgence in alcohol , or by excessive eating , and still continues to indulge in either of these habits , despite the depression and suffering which result , and despite the assurance of his medical adviser that moderation will put him on the road to good health once more , can not be said to act in accordance with common sense . My reader may say that the man can not refrain from taking alcohol or from over-eating , and it may be advantageous to consider this man 's inability to act in accordance with the dictates of common sense . In the first place , it is clear that he had recognized the fact that he was ill . The fact that he had consulted his medical adviser is proof that the stimulus ( or stimuli ) in this connexion had reached his consciousness , and no doubt he was quite ready to take the medicine or carry out the form of treatment prescribed , provided that these did not interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , of course , the desired return to health could not be secured by such an unreasoning procedure . The habit is always the impeding factor , and in this case the medicine and the treatment were of little importance unless the bad habit of over-indulgence in alcohol , or of excessive feeding , could be eradicated . This leads us to the consideration of the psycho-physical activities within the organism of which habit , so called , is a manifestation . In the case of a person who is blessed with a satisfactory standard of psycho-physical co-ordination , moderation will be the rule and excess the exception to that rule . With the person who is badly co-ordinated the reverse will be the case , in a more or less degree , in one or more spheres , for the habit of excess will gradually become more firmly estab-  | lished with too frequent repetition of the indulgence of the debauched sensory desires connected , in the case given , with eating and drinking , thus making indulgence the rule and not the exception . In the continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol habit , where the subject of our illustration is concerned . That we speak of the cultivation of this habit presupposes a time in the history of the man when he did not make a habit of taking alcohol in such quantities as would cause liver and other internal disorders . The facts concerned with his reasons , however , for beginning to take alcohol to excess at some particular time of his life would not help us very much , even if we could be certain of them . The important point for us to remember is that his sensory appreciation was unreliable and perverted , and his psychophysical organism in an unsatisfactory state of co-ordination , so that he gradually became dominated by that sensory debauchery which results from excessive alcoholic and other indulgence , and by the depressing and enervating conditions which follow . These latter conditions are among the most potent of the stimuli which make for the repetition of the excesses at more and more frequent intervals , this repetition counteracting again for a time the depressing and enervating conditions brought about by the renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the meat it feeds on , " so that the degree of sensory debauchery increases rapidly until the functioning of the organism becomes utterly demoralized . It is almost certain that in the early stages of his alcoholic experiences the subject was unaware of his lack of satisfactory co-ordination and sensory appreciation . As a matter of fact , it is unlikely that he had ever given consideration to his psycho-physical condition . He had simply taken alcohol occasionally , as he had taken many other things in the way of food and drink , never for a moment meaning that it should become a habit , or even suspecting that he lacked the ability either to continue taking it only occasionally , or to discontinue taking it altogether if he so wished . This reveals the degree to which egotism may be subconsciously developed in the human creature , until it becomes a potent factor in influencing the processes associated with subconscious and unreasoned  | conclusions , such as the one arrived at by the subject of our illustration in regard to his ability to continue to drink occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to search out the correct premisses from which to make his deductions , and if his effort had been attended with success , he would have discovered the unsatisfactory standard of his general functioning , and this would have brought a realization that he must , by some means , make certain that his standard of psycho-physical co-ordination and sensory appreciation was satisfactory , before he allowed himself to entertain even mildly egotistical conclusions regarding his ability to fight his bad habits . If such an analysis of the psycho-physical factors involved had been made , he must have been led to the conclusion that in the matter of the breaking of habit , the standard of sensory appreciation is the allimportant factor . His increasing desire for alcohol probably came very gradually , as also the corresponding decline in his standard of co-ordination and sensory appreciation . Thus the gratification experienced in satisfying the already abnormal desire would soon dominate psycho-physical processes which otherwise might have been exercised in the field of reasoning and common sense , and he might then have been led to a consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol habit . In all such experiences there comes a time at last when the person concerned is forced to recognize the harmful effects of such a habit , and then very often makes an effort to fight the desire and to eradicate the habit . But too frequently it happens that the effort is a feeble one or that it is made along impossible lines . Some well-meaning friend , for instance , may urge the man to use what is called " will-power " to fight and control his desire , but the desire is a sensory desire , and the processes called " will power " have in this case long since been dominated by the debauched sensory appreciation associated with this desire , and therefore his hope of salvation lies in the restoration of his sensory appreciation to that normal condition which we do not find associated with abnormal and unhealthy desire . In Man 's Supreme Inheritance we have referred to that degenerate state of the organism when the human creature will desire a form of sensory satisfaction through actual pain . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by suffering , often intense suffering , but even this does not act as a deterrent . We must therefore realize the enormous influence of perverted sensory desire on the human creature , and recognize that satisfactory development in the control of his psycho-physical processes is impossible without that reliable sensory appreciation which goes hand in hand with normal sensory desires . One point more . Fundamental desires and needs must be satisfied ; if they are not , serious results must follow sooner or later , and the fact that the attempt to satisfy desires and needs leads many individuals to indulge in abuse and excess does not affect this conclusion . Abuse and excess are always associated with abnormality , and abnormality is due to abnormal conditions in the psycho-physical functioning of the organism , and this applies in the matter of abuse and excess in eating , as well as in drinking and in connexion with any other needs and desires . Abuse or excess is an attempt to satisfy a need or desire which , originally normal , has become abnormal , and as long as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny a man the " means-whereby " to his excesses and abuses . Our energies should instead he applied to attempts to eradicate the abnormal conditions responsible for the excess and abuse , and so to restore the normal psycho-physical functioning of the organism and the reliable sensory appreciation which ensures the maintenance of normality in our desires and needs .  | THE lack of a satisfactory condition of psycho-physical equilibrium in all human activities is one of the most striking manifestations of imperfect functioning of the organism . The present faulty subconscious use of the psycho-physical mechanism , in our educational and other spheres , makes for the gradual increase of this condition of defective equilibrium . It would seem that this fact is generally taken for granted , seeing that we expect defective equilibrium at a certain age , just as we expect the development of a flabby and protruding abdomen . This is surely the end of our contention that practice makes perfect ; it also seems evident from this that there must be something wrong with the practice in the act of walking . The fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controlling orders which command the satisfactory co-ordination and adjustment of the psychophysical mechanism in the act of walking . Hence when one or more defects become present in the functioning of these mechanisms , even though the persons concerned may be aware of their cause or causes , they are incapable of establishing once more that standard of reliable sensory appreciation which would enable them to eradicate these defects . This needs a process of re-education on a general basis , which will restore satisfactory functioning throughout the organism , and so ensure a continued raising of the standard of psycho-physical equilibrium right on through life . In what follows I shall endeavour to show that , with almost every attempt to correct some supposed or real psychophysical imperfection , new defects are developed which tend to lower the standard of psycho-physical equilibrium . In this connexion it is an interesting but very unfortunate fact that this unsatisfactory condition develops in the subject hand in hand with the desire to hurry unduly , this being a subconscious endeavour to compensate for the growing lack of equilibrium and lack of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most pronounced . The subject becomes  | conscious , first , of a weakness or difficulty which affects his general equilibrium in walking , and , without making any attempt to discover the cause or causes of this newly recognized weakness or difficulty , proceeds , as he would put it , to try to " walk properly " ? i.e. , to walk without the slight unsteadiness of which he is conscious . But the fact that this weakness or difficulty has developed is proof that the subject 's guiding sensations and general psycho-physical co-ordinations of the organism are defective . It is therefore obvious that any subconsciously directed efforts on his part to " walk properly " ? i.e. , more steadily ? will be carried out according to these same defective guiding sensations and imperfectly coordinated mechanisms , and can not therefore succeed . It must be remembered that during all these " trial-anderror " experiences the fear reflexes are being unduly excited by the fear of falling , and by the general unreliability and uncertainty of the psycho-physical processes which are employed during such subconsciously directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall find that most harmful psychophysical conditions will be developed , which soon manifest themselves in other spheres of psycho-physical functioning , and very often culminate at last in some serious crisis . It is easy to trace the development of this lack of equilibrium in what is usually considered the " purely physical " sphere . Let us take by way of illustration the case of a boy who , in the ordinary way , would he classed as a good walker . We will assume that he has been injured at the age of , say , thirteen by being thrown from a horse or by a fall downstairs , or has met with some other accident which has necessitated his being treated by a doctor and being confined to his bed for some time . It is obvious that . his injury and the cessation of his ordinary activities will produce in the patient a more or less weakened condition generally , and also definite specific difficulties in connexion with the injured parts of the organism . The result is that at the psychological moment when the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeding factors will uialest themselves which he will immediately proceed to overcome by " trying to walk properly " as he understands it . His attempt to walk " properly " must necessarily be on t lie subconscious plan of " trialand-error , " for it is almost certain that he has never known  | how he walked , never had the least idea of the guiding orders concerned with the co-ordinations essential to the act of walking and to the development of satisfactory equilibrium.l It will be necessary here to analyse the psycho-physical processes involved in his effort , for success in such efforts demands quite a high standard of co-ordinated functioning of the organism . Experience has proved to us that this standard of functioning is not at the command of a person who has been through the experiences connected with such an injury , and with the subsequent treatment and gradual recovery to the point when what we call the convalescent stage has been reached . Real success is practically impossible , and for the reasons which follow . These attempts to walk would be made at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole organism , of a comparative loss of control , of an interference with the psycho-physical equilibrium , of a lack of confidence , together with a whole series of hopes and fears in regard to what he will or will not be able to do , associated , again , with fears which have their origin in the pain which results from his incorrect subconscious attempts to use parts that have been injured . This whole combination of psycho-physical conditions constitutes a set of experiences which are new as compared with those present at the time of the accident . Each subconscious attempt to walk awakens consciousness of shortcomings , of strange and often alarming sensations , and tends to increase the real difficulties ? viz. , those concerned with that correct use of the psycho-physical organism in general upon which " walking properly " depends . It will thus be clear that the attempt to walk properly by subconscious guidance would merely be an attempt to revert to the habit or habits established in the act of walking before footnote 1 My reader will probably think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " walk properly " after an injury , and who is now walking about to HIS OWN satisfaction . My point is , that the subject is not capable of judging whether his use of his psycho-physical mechanisms in walking is satisfactory or not . It is quite certain that anyone with an expert knowledge in this connexion could point to certain harmful defects in the subject 's use of himself which are the combined result of the injury , the varied experiences in treatment and recovery , and the attempts " to walk , " all of which are indicative of comparative weakness , a sense of interference with equilibrium and a general loss of control .  | the accident . This way of walking was instinctive , and a particular instinctive process is the result of certain psycho ' physical conditions operating , as we say , by instinct . Change those conditions quickly and you interfere with the reliability of the working of the particular instinct . This illustration furnishes us with a splendid practical instance of a definite need calling for new experiences in psycho-physical use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so produces an immediate response involving the processes concerned with subconscious guidance and control which are habitual , but which depend for efficiency upon a given standard of co-ordinated functioning of the organism . Unfortunately , this standard has been lowered by his experiences associated with the accident , and the psycho-physical machinery does not work as satisfactorily as before ; in fact , in the majority of such cases it works very unsatisfactorily . The subject is able to compare the result of his present efforts with those he made before his injury . They compare very badly , and he is conscious of the fact . This merely causes him to " try harder , " as he would put it , " to walk properly , " and , on a subconscious basis , he has no alternative but to continue the unintelligent method of " trial-and-error . " We will now outline the experiences which the procedure based on the principles of re-education on a conscious general basis would have ensured in the foregoing case . In the first place , we should not allow the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given , by expert manipulation , correct experiences in the general use of the psycho-physical mechanisms , and had become well acquainted with the correct guiding and controlling orders which would assist in the securing of the means whereby he should use the mechanisms in any attempt to walk properly . The recognition of weakness or difficulty would be the signal for an examination of the psycho-physical mechanisms involved in the use of the organism as a whole , which in turn would enable us to note the defects and peculiarities in the use of these mechanisms in the specific art of walking . The technique we advocate would demand in practice that the subject should cease to try to improve his walking . We would therefore endeavour to convince him by demonstration that his efforts to improve his walking by " muddling through by  | instinct " are not only futile but quite absurd . By the same process ( demonstration ) he would be shown that , as soon as he receives the stimulus to walk , he must begin his remedial work by employing his inhibitory powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction associated with his conception of " walking . " In this connexion it is explained to him that it is the use of the incorrect , subconscious guiding orders to the mechanisms concerned with the act of walking , associated with unreliable sensory appreciation , which has caused the mechanisms to be used imperfectly , resulting in the weakness and difficulties with which we are contending . When the subject is more or less familiar with these inhibitory experiences , we go on to give him a knowledge of the new and correct directive and guiding orders which , with the aid of manipulation , are to bring about the satisfactory use of the mechanisms in a sitting , prone , or other position . These experiences must be repeated until the new and reliable sensory appreciation becomes established , by which time there will have taken place an actual change in the use of the psychophysical mechanisms of the organism in general , making for a satisfactory condition of co-ordination and adjustment . When the required improvement in the general co-ordinations and adjustments has been secured , the processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation , and a corresponding improvement in equilibrium in walking will be the result . The reader must understand that the details involved in such processes ( differing as these do in each case ) can not be set forth here , and that , moreover , from the very first lessons the teacher 's aim would be to cause the pupil to be conscious of what he should or should NOT do , and to give such help to the pupil as would enable him to begin at once to apply the principles involved , not only to his attempts at walking , but more or less to all the acts of his daily life . In other words , the pupil is not taught to perform certain new exercises or to assume new postures for a given time each day , whilst continuing to use his faulty mechanisms and unreliable guiding sensations in his old way during/his other activities , but he is shown HOW he may at once check , more or less , the faulty use of these mechanisms in the general activities of his daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the " physical " sphere will be found , in every case , to go hand in  | hand with a corresponding lack of equilibrium in so-called " mental " spheres . And in any consideration of " mental " and " physical " phenomena it must be remembered that in our present stage of evolution on the subconscious plane , the response to any stimulus or stimuli is at least seventy-five per cent subconscious response ( chiefly feeling ) as against twenty-five per cent any other response , this estimate of the ratio of subconscious response being probably too low . When these facts are fully realized by all those who are interested in education and in the conduct of life generally , there may be some chance of the realization of those commendable ideals for the uplifting of mankind cherished by leaders in the social , religious , and political spheres .
