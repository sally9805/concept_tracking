THE GOLDEN SNAIL-Victor McClure-Bobbs-Merrill ( $2.00 ) . <P> Percival Pemblebury , Englishman , artist and go-getter , with assets of a single halfpenny sets out to pay a debt of 4 which he owes to a little Soho restaurant . By a most un-English display of energy , by taking a cold bath every morning , by the author 's generous provision of any number of fortunate coincidences , Artist Pemblebury pays his debt . More than that : he makes supping on the delectable dishes of the Golden Snail the dernier cri in society , makes himself a famous painter , and discovers the most wonderful girl in the world . These ingredients make a real if not an expert entertainment , for Mr. Pemblebury 's adventures are a tale told with the lightest touch of a rather heavy hand .
