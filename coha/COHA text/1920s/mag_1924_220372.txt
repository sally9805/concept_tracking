Weary of the inaccurate photographic representation his father 's countenance had received in the newspapers , the son of a U. S. Senator for a Western State sent TIME what he felt to be an adequate picture of his sire . He requested that TIME use this picture if and when it became necessary for the Senator to appear before the public eye . <P> Not every one is so far-sighted as this Senator 's son . Nor if they were would they be by any means sure of having settled , once for all , what manner of face the public shall behold upon them . Not only do cameras , light and other physical circumstances vary . Journalistic ethics is a complex study , and editors , jealous of their " rights , " guard their freedom to publish whatever picture of an individual best answers their paper 's immediate purpose . <P> In a recent editorial , Editor and Publisher reported a decision of the Berlin Chamber Court , that a newspaper has no right to print a person 's picture contrary to his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , but no rule nas been set up . . . . The news picture is the best possible description of a person or an event in the news . . . tells the story at a glance . . . . People who are unfortunate in personal appearance often object to picture publicity , and their wishes are respected . Pictures of deformed persons , or persons shown in distressing circumstances rarely appear , except when such publication is believed to be a genuine service . . . as in the case of criminals . " <P> Here , of course , is latitude . The case of Gaston B. Means and the Daily News ( Manhattan gum-chewers ' sheetlet ) is in point ( TIME , Mar. 24 ) . Had Mr. Means , testifying before the Senate " Oil Scandal " probers , refused to pose for the News photographer , had he hidden his face as many do , the News editors could have performed what they " believed to be a genuine service " by captioning : ' ' Means cowers . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captioned : " Means scornfully facing camera . " <P> More recently , in Manhattan , a " piebald " comedian , involved in a girl-beating scandal , smashed the camera of a Daily News photographer who had lain in wait for him at a cabaret door . <P> During the Democratic National Convention in Manhattan , the New York Bulletin , noisily behind Alfred E. Smith for the nomination , published a none-too-complimentary portrait of the other leading contender , captioned in boldest type : " Look at This Face ! " <P> There was nothing libelous about this . Cameras are impersonal things , and though the negative of Mr. McAdoo 's portrait might have been retouched , it did not appear that such was the case . The Bulletin was , ostensibly , merely calling attention to Mr. McAdoo 's physiognomy as photographed , not cartooned . <P> Cartoonists pillory their victims more cruelly , and at a greater risk of libel , than the most unscrupulous of picture editors . Last November , TIME reproduced a damning pen sketch of W. E. D. Stokes , Manhattan realtor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of Mr. Stokes ' divorce suit .
