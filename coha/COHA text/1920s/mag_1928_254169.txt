On the Hudson . The way experts figured it out , either Columbia or California had to win . But when , at Poughkeepsie , a gun went off and seven crews splashed in a racing start , it was Cornell that jumped out in front . Down the river , wide and grey , covered with launches , canoes , yachts , ferryboats , the boats moved from Krums Elbow toward the bridge that rose , a web of iron , in the mist . At the mile and a half , Cornell had more than a length on the others . At two and a half miles , Cornell was rowed out and Columbia was leading California by a few feet . In the last third of a mile , crew races are decided and in that stretch California and Columbia fenced with each other . They went under the bridge and out of sight . When they came out , California was leading by a quarter of a length . Slowly the space became almost a length and suddenly the sirens of the observation boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 seconds a record that had stood for 27 years. * <P> On the Thames . Harvard had the heaviest crew in 15 years . It was so heavy that the shell sat low in the water , so heavy , Bostonian , assured it was that young men with crimson feathers in their hats went through the observation trains at New London looking for bets and getting them . At 7 o'clock on a cloudy evening below Gales Ferry the two boats went away . Harvard was in front for the first 50 yards and never after that . Past the flags that marked the first mile , past the cluster of brick buildings at the submarine base , Yale moved steadily , powerfully , on a river turned into a theatre . Movie men cranking on the stone piers of the bridge photographed the coxswain throwing up his hands to show his crew that they had crossed the line . Ten lengths behind , the heavy Harvard crew , too tired to sprint , lumbered up to the bridge , collapsed . Said Yale Coach Leader : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal to do with the crew trailing so far astern . I noticed the varsity boat in practice seemed to drag and believe the craft was a handicap of four or five boat lengths in tonight 's race . " <P> <P> * In 1901 , Cornell , under the old master " Pop " Courtney , set the mark of 18:53 1/5 sec.
