txt After a hearing before Interstate Commerce Commissioner Henry C. Hall , at which representatives of the Port of New York Authority had repeated their objections To the proposed consolidation of the Central Railroad of New Jersey with the New York Central , A. H. Smith , President of the latter railroad , issued a statement last night , declaring that the proposed consolidation had been suggested because it would be for the benefit of New York and preserve its primacy as a port . Mr. Smith recalled that the Port Authority had made no objection to the proposal to consolidate the Central Rail . road of New Jersey with the Baltimore &; Ohio and the Philadelphia &; Reading , IgKshe j:Ae. sa , id , would have tended to ** the ports of Baltimore and Philadelphia . He declared that the growth of traffic in up-State New York had been so great that it was only a question of time when an additional through trunk line from New York City to the West would he necessary and1 that the proposed route was the only one not already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " At the hearing . Just concluded in this city by the Interstate Commerce Commission on the subject of the railway consolidations , Mr. Julius Henry Cohen , counsel for the Port Authority , and the engineering staff , have made a violent attack upon the suggestion ' of the New York Central with respect to the consolidation of it with the Central Railroad of New Jersey . I desire to call the attention of the public to some incidents connected with this attitude of the Port Authority . C. of N. J. Grouped with B. &; 0 . " On August 2 , 1921 , neariat two years ago , the Interstate Commerce Commission issued its tentative consolidation order , accompanied by a voluminous report from Professor William Z. Ripley of Harvard University , who had been employed by the commission to make a nation-wide study of the . subject . In this tentative order the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Philadelphia &; Reading were assigned in their entirety with the Baltimore &; Ohio to System No. 3 , which the commission called the Baltimore &; Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years been obvious that in this system , if perfected under the order of the commission , the Baltimore &; Ohio would be the predominant factor . It has also been obvious to all students of transportation that under the system of port differentials a railroad composed of the Bali timore &; Ohio , Philadelphia A Reading and Central Railroad of New Jersey could not afford to haul any export traffic to the Port of New- York through the Port of Baltimore . which could pos1 sibly be delivered at the Port of Balti , 1 more , since the addition to the Baltimore rate for the New York delivery is far less than the actual out-of-pocket coat of transportation for the 190 additional miles which the traffic must be hauled . " lt has always been obvious that Sytstem 3 , ? composed of the Baltimore &; Ohio , Philadelphia &; Reading and 1 Central Railroad of New Jersey , would ' at all times have an inducement to prefer , first , the Port of Baltimore , and , second , the Port of Philadelphia , as against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time that this proposal of the Interstate Commerce Commission had been before the public the Pert Authority of New York did not see fit to oppose the suggestion of this consolidation . Even now , at the present hearings , the Port Authority has introduced no evidence in opposition to the Baltimore &; Ohio plan . New ' York Central Proposal Assailed / ? " But when the New York Central , ! realizing this situation and appreciating i that System 3 was not , in its judgi meat , as promotive of the interests of the Port of New York as other proposals which could be made , ventured to suggest a consolidation of the New York - Central and the Central Railroad of New Jersey with a suitable part ( not all , as has Leen assumed ) of the terminal facilities of the Central Railroad of New Jersey . this proposal was , as I have said . violently attacked . " Now , whatever may be said of the merits or demerits of this proposal , upon which I am perfectly willing to invite discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : tow York railroad primarily interested in the Port of New York , and it can not possibly 131 open to any objections which do not apply with equal or greater force to the proposal of the Baltimore &; Ohio consolidation . ? ? I therefore venture to say that the counsel and staff of the Port Authority have during the past two years either been overlooking a very important matter , or on the other hand , if that is not so . then it must be assumed that the matter of these proposals with respect to the Baltimore &; Ohio System or the proposal made by the New York Central are really matters about which it is not necessary for the Port Authority to concern itself . The latter appears to me to be the correct view to take of the matter . " The New York Central now has , in addition to its main line , a line of railroad extending from Ashtabula , Ohio . to Newberry Junction , Pennsylvania . over which a large traffic is being handled under disadvantageous conditions . The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line of railroad with a branch of the Philadelphia &; Reading and the main line of the Central Railroad of New Jersey , with the allocation of a portion of the terminal facilities of the Central Railroad of New Jersey . The object of this suggestion is to make possible the development of an alternative route which would relieve the very heavy traffic lines of the New York Central cast of Buffalo and would facilitate the movement of through traffic ? freight , passenger , mail and express ? between the New York Port Terminal District and western points . " The territory between Buffalo and - Albany is practically a continuous ! line of towns and cities where business is rapidly increasing , where land values are rising and important street interferences , and other obstacles to expansion of railway facilities aaist which materially limit possible future railway development . " I have no doubt that within the next few years it will become perfectly apparent to everybody that with the vast growth and expansion of traffic of the State of New York it will be absolutely necessary that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York to western points will have to be secured , and the proposal which we have made , in my opinion , furnishes the best and perhaps the only opportunity for the establishment of such a route . In a communication to Governor Miller I predicted two years ago that within ten years , and perhaps nearer five than ten . it would be a question whether commutation users of the railroads as well as through passengers of the railroads could move into or out of the City of New York as and when they desired . The number of passes through the Allegheny Mountains is limited . All of them are occupied , and this proposed route is perhaps the only one that is not now utilized almost to its maximum capacity . " Our proposal is primarily a suggestion with respect tO increasing the facilities for the handling of through traffic upon which , after all , the port of New York must depend for its prosperity . It was not and is not now thought that this proposal conflicts in any way with any plans which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission in cooperation with the railroads for the development and more efficient operation of the terminal facilities of the port district . " It can make no difference in the final working out of the Port Authority 's plans whether the Central Railroad of New Jersey is owned by the Baltimore &; Ohio . as proposed by the commission , by the Philadelphia &; Reading , as proposed by the Philadelphia interests , by the New York Central . as proposed by us , or is independently owned . Whatever the Port Authority is able to direct in the exercise of its lawful power with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the lawful exercise of its jurisdicition s can as well be done under one form of ownership as another . " The examination of John E. Ramsey . chief statistician of the Port Authority , was continued at the hearing . He was cross-examined by Clyde Brown of counsel for the New York Central . Mr. Brown at one time was asked by Mr. Cohen , counsel for the Port Authority , whether he was testifying as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the Interstate Commerce Commission information which it should have . Mr. Cohen characterized the New York Central 's proposal as potentially dangerous to the prosperity of the City of New York .
