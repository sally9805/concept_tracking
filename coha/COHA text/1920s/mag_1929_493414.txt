So , having talked to you United States like Roosevelt 's very polite but very insistent Dutch uncle , I can only add that if these views were held by me alone they would be worth just that ; but un ? fortunately there is good reason to believe that theyare held by a very large majority of my country ? men who were born here ? who number 78 per per ? cent of our people ? and by practically all out British-born immigrants . NO ONE knows just how they started , these stories of miraculous cures at the grave of an unknown priest in the Holy Cross Cem ? etery at Malden . But , since the first newspaper pub ? licity , there has been an almost continual stream of the faithful along the gravel path that leads to the " shrine , " thousands have thrown themselves pros ? trate upon the grave , rubbed themselves with its cov ? ering loam , anointed themselves with holy water and left behind offerings of silver and gold . Crip ? pled and diseased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rain , day and night , tens of thousands of them have come to join the endless file beneath the leafless trees and past the semi-Gothic chapel where the prayers are said . Father Patrick Power has been dead for sixty years . While he lived he was little known ? an ob ? scure priest who never had a parish of his own . Thirty years after his death , so the story goes , the grass on his grave remained green when all around it was yellow and dying . Candles placed upon his grave kept burning when candles placed on other graves flickered and went out . The grave took on a special significance and once or twice cures were reported to have happened there . But the rank and file of the faithful knew nothing about it , and only those who heard about it in a casual way went there to do homage . Three weeks ago a tabloid newspaper resurrected the story of the grave 's strange , uncanny power ; it told of cures of the af ? flicted reported there ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until such a wave of re ? ligious hysteria as has never been known before in Massachusetts has brought fully eight hundred thousand people in the past three weeks into the cemetery to fall on their knees and kiss the obscure grave of the unknown priest . Twice has Cardinal William O'Connell visited the grave , and the report is current that the ma ? chinery of the Church has been started toward mak ? ing the Malden grave a shrine on a par with St. Anne de Beaupre and with Lourdes . But , whether or not this is so , surely no modern city has ever seen in this century such an overwhelming outpour ? ing of maimed and crippled , diseased and idiot , seeking to regain their health from the supernatural . Darkness had fallen when I boarded the street car in the dismal elevated terminal at Everett . There was no need to ask the way . One followedthe crowd . Irish , Italians , French Canucks , Ameri ? cans , white , black ? a motley mixture of races with Irish predominating ? were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the out ? skirts of Malden where the graveyard is . On my car an ancient crone , a crippled girl , an idiot boy with his plodding Irish father and care-worn mother , a young couple , well dressed and well fed , stood out from the mediocrity of the others . None of them smiled , and on the faces of all these hopefuls who were going to offer prayers for themselves , and for others , perhaps , who could not go themselves , there was stamped a dumb , appealing , saint-like look ; faith that the scales and scabs would fall off their bodies , that withered limbs would strengthen and be straight , that eyes used to darkness would see again. , that minds would assume intelligence and that health would come to them all . Silent as cattle they sat there , and no one minded his neighbor . The car jerked its way along , through the brighter lights of Everett Square , out of the dark thoroughfare . None got off ; it was as if it had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stopped , and one knew one was at last at Holy Cross . As far as one could see , on either side of the street , cars were parked . Hundreds of others were looking for a space . Policemen , im ? bued with a suspicious courtesy , guided the faithful across the street . By the iron gate that bars the way of automobiles ? except those which arrive in quick succession bearing the maimed and the para ? lyzed ? police herd the growing crowd into two lines . Two single files , that go up the hill , wind through the graves , and reach at the end the spot where Father Power lies . Strong men guide ancient women who hobble painfully along . Young toughs mingle with the crowds and try to look less hard than usual . A mother carries a baby , its lifeless legs dangling like a doll 's legs from beneath its little skirts . A toil-bent laborer staggers a bit ; a little girl leads a woman who can not see her way ; two boys push a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gibbering idiot is carefully led along by his har ? assed but faithful mother ; one man , his face all sores like the face of Lazarus , slumps down into the collar of his coat . The ground is drying from an afternoon of rain and the wind is chill . A moon sheds light palely on the gravelled walk , shines in the puddles by the roadside . The lights of a car come up the hill ? another cripple on a stretcher , brought out into the night to be healed by faith where the hands of science have failed . Two thin lines going up the hill . Hardly any talk from anyone ; not a laugh anywhere ; scarcely a smile , except from a mother bearing her infant whose two eyes look inward at each other ; but in the faces of them all that look of dumb faith in something they can not explain , but which they be ? lieve as strongly as it is possible for humans to be ? lieve . The line never breaks , and it never ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the dawn comes it will be moving there , just as it is now . I fall in with the rest , and , inch by inch , creep closer to the resting place of Father Patrick Power . In front of me is a woman . She , like myself , is cold , but she stands there as patiently as centuries ago women stood to watch the passing of the Christ . In front of her is her husband . They are Italians , and his face is wet with tears . His big brown eyes are pleading , his lips move in prayer . For in his arms is the child of their union , and if the faith of these two can make her whole again ? well , then there are miracles . For her eyes sec not , her legs feel not , her mouth hangs open and never utters a sound . Nor can she hear the plodding , shuffling feet , nor the murmuring of prayers as the slow line moves along . I follow these two , fascinated . Hope fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave is reached . Two policemen , patient as Job , are exhorting the crowd . " Just touch the shrine . The chapel is open for prayer . Be quick and let the cripples have a chance . " It is a singsong , repeated from morn till night . With gentle hands they lead the father and the mother and the unhuman child to a place . Cross ? ing themselves the parents kneel . The father holds the baby over the shrine . He places a candle in her senseless hands ; it falls out ; he picks it up . He holds it there . With his other hand he scoops up the dank earth of the grave . He rubs it on the withered legs , the sightless eyes , the dumb mouth . He crosses himself again and from a bottle pours holy water on the thin dress of his bambino . Tears streak down his olive cheeks and his lips are moving in continuous prayer . The child , whose tam o ' shan ? ter keeps falling off for the mother to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bab ? ble . Five minutes they stay there . Even the police are moved , and do not hurry them . Once more the father scoops up the earth and rubs the members of this luckless child . He puts her on her feet , his face now alight with wonder , with hope , with faith . His bambino tumbles in a heap at his feet and does not move . It is like a slap in the face to the father . He gathers her up , crying ; the mother 's weeping can be heard . They move off ? to the chapel . To pray . The line moves on . Twenty people at a time can kneel around the grave where vigil lights in little red tumblers flicker in the chill wind . The grave , whence the marker has been removed since the crowds began coming , is covered with coins and bills which have been dropped there by the moving mob . For a few seconds the faithful kneel , cross themselves , say a prayer . Then they are urged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cripples have the right of way . Some of them fling themselves down in ludicrous , pitiful positions . They babble their prayers and rub their sores with dirt that is damp and sticky . Some carry away hand ? fuls of it and every now and then a laborer brings more in a shovel to sprinkle over the shrine . Gifts are left there , wrapped in paper . Some light tapers there and blow them out . The center of the grave is a mass of wax from the vigil lights . A man in a wheel chair is brought up . He is lifted out . He has n't walked for twelve years . The crowd closes in . He says his prayers and rubs his legs , from which the trousers have been removed , with dirt . He works it in around the heavy braces . He is there ten minutes . Then he is lifted to his wheel chair again . Away from the grave two friends laboriously remove the braces and with an effort lift him to his feet . He smiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and catch him as he falls heavily to the ground . A young man in ' derby hat and tight fitting overcoat says , " You must have faith . Others have walked and you can . Go to the chapel and pray and almighty God will make you walk . " The man is crying , so is every ? one around him . He is wheeled off to the chapel on the bill . " God , but my legs hurt , " he whimpers , and he tries to choke back the tears . I go to the chapel . The father with his bambino has just reached the altar rail . He lights a taper , he prays , he counts his beads . He rubs the afflicted baby ? as hundreds of others have done ? against the statue of the Christ upon the Cross . His face is hopeful again and , his prayers finished , he moves off ? to visit the shrine and go through it all once more . The chapel is crowded and the air is rank with body-smells and burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigil lights . Firemen in uniform keep the crowd lined up . Here one may pray as long as one desires . The crowd which has gone up to the grave comes here and prays and prays . The cripples , the diseased , the deaf and the dumb , they come or are brought . Some are borne down the aisle on stretchers , some carried like drunken men between supporting comrades . There are more women , but there are hundreds of men . Babes in arms are plentiful ; children , middle-aged , ancients ? from every walk of life . Some just curious , but all silent and imbued with a religious hysteria that makes them all akin . The only music in the chapel is the clink of coins being cast at the altar rail . Day and night this keeps up . For three weeks now the crowds have been growing greater and greater . The stories in the newspapers of cures have been increasing daily . In the eight hours I wandered about I saw no cripple suddenly walk , no dumb person speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in the chapel the pile of braces and crutches , canes and spectacles grows larger all the time . The Herald has run a full-page feature story of a cure , the first that not only has taken place , but has lasted beyond the hysteria at the graveside . And while the Church has not yet spoken , except to defend shrines in general , it has not condemned . The cemetery , presided over by the brother of Cardinal O'Connell , stays open twenty-four hours a day and pilgrims to the extent of fifty thousand in one single day come flocking to the grave . At last I left . It would be wrong to say one is not moved at this graveyard teeming with those who believe , with those who have some secret assurance that cures which the doctors can not effect can be brought about by the rubbing in of the dank dirtfrom a grave . I went ' down the hill . The two lines were longer now , and the faithful stood closer to gether . Every so often the iron gates opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed by . I stand to take one last glimpse of this sight unprecedented in New England religious his . tory . To myself I say , " The faith that passeth under . standing ? " Outside a raucous newsboy screams , " Get your picture of Father Power ! Only two cents ! Get your picture ? " I look at the hot-dog stands that have grown up like mushrooms . I watch the hundreds of motor cars , the thousands of people on foot I think of the first story in the tabloid newspaper two weeks ago . I pass on . I have seen the shrine . WE ARE told that these United States now expend on schools and colleges more money than does all the rest of the world . There is a far larger proportion of our youth and adults constantly attending schools in this country than in any other country in the world . On the other hand , many critics , and frequently very com ? petent ones , express grave disappointment with the results of our elaborate and varied systems of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dismayed . " The cure for the ills of our schools is more schools ? schools for the very young and schools for the full-grown , " they say , in effect . In a variety of ways large proportions of Amer ? icans have always been excessively in a hurry . Often we have become so enamored of means that we have cherished them as ends . Are we tending now to exhibit these failings in connection with certain kinds of education ? The present writer believes that such is the case conspicuously with some partly ' developed , and some still inceptive , types of schools for young children . These are his major contentions : Only small pro ? portions of children from four to six years of age are so circumstanced that educational agencies sup ? plemental to their homes are really needed for them . Schools or other similar agencies should be provided for children from two to four years of age only when these are being reared under very exceptional or abnormal family conditions . And wherever household surroundings are fairly whole ? some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tage to children of superior intellectual heredity to withhold them almost altogether from school atten ? dance until nine or even ten years of age . To the foregoing hypotheses should be added these others : Even the most progressive kindergar ? tens are in their effects over-stimulating agencies for children from suburban and village environments . Nursery schools , even when conducted in accordance with the best educational ideals now available , pro ? vide excessively mechanical and regimented sur ? roundings for the wholesome growth of infants . The tax imposed upon the nervous organization of a bright , sensitive girl of eight or nine years of age by 180 days ' attendance , per year , on the highly routine procedures of even an excellent primary school constitutes a needlessly harmful preparation for physical and other strains , later to be encoun ? tered in our speeded-up civilization . Between the educational philosophy implicit in the positions suggested above , and that of the thousands of men and women who are now enthusiastically promoting kindergartens , nursery schools and " child-centered " primary schools everywhere in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a kind of psychological chasm . But the writer doubts if such is the case . He thinks that the two philosophies of education have much the same-ends in view . But in his estimation the one tends so greatly to overvalue purposive enrichments and stimulations of various forms of child growth as constantly to run the risk of surrounding the very plastic child with the equivalents of green-house conditions . The other attaches much importance to
