It has been the diversion of certain modernist critics to write about music in terms of color , painting in the idiom of sound . They have pleasantly conjectured how Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony would taste if the listener 's auditory nerves were transferred to his lips ; what sort of noise a banana would make did the observer devour it with his ears . Last week Harry Grindell-Matthews , British inventor of the " death-ray " ( TIME , June 2 &; 9 , 1924 , SCIENCE ) , demonstrated certain devices with which he had turned theoretical flippancies of the dilettanti into mechanical realism . It is of course an impossibility to rearrange the human nervous system so that one kind of sense impression is substituted for another , but it is quite within the scope of science to turn light into music , sound into color . His instrument , called the " luminaphone , " releases light from a series of searchlights to strike through a pattern of holes on revolving disks . Each hole is the equivalent of a note of music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tune , passes through the holes to strike selenium plates , setting up vibrations which are " amplified " as on a radio . When Inventor Grindell-Matthews placed his hand over one of the lights , a note was deadened ; when all the lights were covered , all sounds ceased . The instrument has a tone like that of a little pipe-organ.
