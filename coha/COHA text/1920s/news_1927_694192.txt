Sacco Weeps After Seeing Son . Sacco is convinced that he will be electrocuted in Charlestown State Prison a few minutes after midnight next Monday . He bade a pathetic farewell to his 14-year-old son Dante today . He tried to crowd every bit of his hope and aspiration for the boy into an hour 's talk , but broke down and finally promised to write the boy a letter . At the end of the interview he looked into the boy 's blue eyes for what he felt was the last time and clasped him to his breast . The boy seemed scared and responded to his father 's kisses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embrace . Sacco 's haunted eyes followed the tall blondhaired lad and his frail mother as Michael A.

Vanzetti walked up and down tilt . narrow confines of the adjoining cell , muttering to himself and occasionally calling words of cheer to his friend , whom he could not see but whose weeping he heard . Vanzetti , according to his attorneys , seems to have lost every bit of resiliency his nature possessed . He no longer jokes in an ironic way and his only grasp on reality seems to be bound up with the visit of his sister , Luigia. who is due in New York on the Aquitania tomorrow .

Dante Sacco. who was 7 years old when his father was arrested , went to the State prison with his mother and Mr. Musmanno . The boy had been in the country with friends and had not seen his father for some time . " My . what a giant you are ! " exclaimed Sacco as he saw his son " What a fine boy ! " Ha held him off at arm 's I .. gth admiringly . Vanzetti , Mrs. Sacco and Musmanno were touched uy the greeting . Dante told of an unhappy experience he had on the train which carried him to Boston . Two men in the seat ahead of him were conversing about the case and one said , " They 're both radicals , they show " have been electrocuted long ago . " Sacco was deeply pained by the recital of the incident . " You should have told him that it was very improper to talk of electrocuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " We are al- ways faced with such sentiments . They want to electrocute us for our political principles and they do n't want to find out who committed the crime . " Tells Boy Not to Worry . Sacco placed his arm around the boy 's shoulders and told him not to worry . His thoughts wandered to the home in Stoughton where Dante was brought up . " Was n't that a wonderful place ? " he said . " Did n't we have a fine garden there ? " He was unable to speak for a moment . When he regained control of himself he began giving the boy what he said was his final message . " My giant , " he said , addressing the lad who is considerably taller than his parents , " I want you to always work for humanity . Forget gold and riches . They mean nothing .

" Mr. Mu.smanno fetched some paper . Sacco made a supreme effort , but the words would not come . " Come tomorrow and I will have you write it for me , " he suggested to Musmanno . " That 's right Nick , " said Vanzetti approvingly . A little later the visitors left and the condemned men went back to their cells . Points Covered by the Court . The decision of the Supreme Judicial Court will be on two sets of exceptions . The first one will be on the contention of defense counsel that Judge Sanderson should have issued a writ of error as requested . The petition was based on the alleged prejudice of Judge Thayer . The ruling on the other exceptions will be based on the appeal from Judge Thayer 's decisions refusing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the event of an adverse decision on any or all points , Mr. Hill is expected to carry the case to the Federal courts and seek a writ of certioari , possibly from United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes . The supplementary defense brief , filed this morning . was at once sent to the Judges who were working on the case . In answer to the contention of the Attorney General that the issuance of a writ of error in a capital case was within the sound discretion of a single Justice , Mr. Hill alleged that the reason for the practice followed in the cases cited by the Attorney General was that , in the days in which those cases came down , capital eases were tried on all questions of law and fact before the full bench , so the question whether those questions of law and fact could be raised again was discretionary , and obviously the reason for that practice did not obtain today . As to that part of the Attorney General 's brief , in which he said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence before him or to find as a fact upon the evidence that there was no prejudice or bias affecting the validity of the judgment , counsel for the defense argued that the Attorney General seemed to disregard the very clear distinction between cases where a Judge had a personal bias or prejudice against the defendants before him , as individuals or as members of a class , and cases in which the Judge had simply formed opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendants before him . Question of State of Mind . " In the cases at bar , the only question is , was the Judge disqualified by his prejudiced state of mind toward persons holding the political and economic opinions attributed to these defendants ? " said Mr. Hill . Mr. Hill declared that , in a writ of error , the only proper procedure was for a single Justice , after hearing the evidence , to report the alleged errors of law to the full Court for decision . The respondent contended tha single Justice could disbelieve the affidavits and other evidence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hill also maintained that the substance of the affidavits and offers of proof taken together tended to show a prejudice against the petitioners as members of a class , as distinguished from a mere belief In their guilt . He declared that the Attorney General 's brief apparently argued that Judge 7 , ' . hayer 's prejudicial bias , even if shown to exist , was not material , unless communicated to the jury . That this was not the law , said Mr. Hill , appeared not only from the arguments and authorities contained in the petitioner 's former belief , but was also made clear by the analogy in the cases where a Judge bad been held disqualified by interest . He said it had never been considered whether or not the fact of such interest , or any words or action arising therefrom , had been communicated to the jury or had been in any way involved tral.in anything which took place at the i The sole question discussed in these cases , " added Mr. Hill in his brief , " is , ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained today of indigestion when he was visited by Dr. Joseph I. , the prison physician . The doctor told Sacco he did not have to take all the food placed before him , and recommended that he eat lightly for a few days . Check on Aliens Buying Pistols . Captain Thomas E. Bligh of the State police today asked the chiefs of police of the State to obtain a list of persons who have purchased pistols from mail-order houses and requested that they check up and ascertain what the owners were doing with the weapons . The police have been investigating the shipment of pistols to aliens in and near Boston . The possession of weapons by an alien is not allowed in this State , and the statutes prescribe that an applicant for a revolver permit must have his photograph on the application . Those who left Boston to meet Vanzetti 's sister when the Aquitania docks in New York are Mrs. Rose Sacco , Mrs. Jessica Henderson , a society woman who has been interested in the case , and Aldino Felicani , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeiros , condemned to die at the same time as Sacco and Vsnzetti , called at Governor I. ulle ? s office and requested that a psychiatrist br designated to determine whether his client is of sound mind . He was informed that the request has already been placed before Attorney General Reading . He left several documents at the State House signed by hospital of-1 ficials who held Madeiros to be mentally deficient and feeble-minded . Madeiros , he said , was sent to the hospital by the probation officer for observation . Federal Inquiry Urged at Meeting . A meeting on behalf of Sacco and Vanzetti was held tonight in the Scenic Auditorium . About 400 men and women attended . The Defense Committee was informed by the police that inflammatory remarks would bring immediate action to close the meeting . The speakers were Francis Fisher Kane , former United States Attorney for the East- ' , ern District of Pennsylvania ; Gardner Jackson and Ma 's Donovan of the Defense Committee , Alfred Baker Lewis of t 3 Socialist Party , Paul U. Kellogg , editor of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin .. meeting that arrangements for a general strike in Boston would be perfected tomorrow . Mr. Kane said he had lust come from South America , and spoke of the interest expressed in the fate of the two radicals by South Americans , who believed the men were convicted because they were anarchists . " Anarchists do not commit payroll robberies any more than hold-up men join anarchist societies and indulge in political agitation , " he said . " I have had experience as a prosecuting officer for the United States Government and I am confident that this statement can not be challenged . " I believe the Department of Justice did render substantial aid in the prosecution and conviction of Sacco and Vanzetti , although they were tried in the courts of Massachusetts . ? ? ? " I believe that if proper representation of all the facts is made to President Coolidge and his Attorney General the files , which were refused to Mr. Thompson , can be made available for examination by a commission to be appointed by the President . We shall then be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not done , the world will rightly or wrongly think that something has been withheld by the Federal Government that ought to have been made public . " At the close of the meeting the Defense Committee issued circulars an-nouncing : " A call has been sent around the entire world for a ' World General Strike ' next Monday , Aug. 22 , in case all legal means have failed up to that time to save our innocent brothers from the electric chair . We hope that as many representatives of labor and fraternal organizations as possible will respond to this call , "
