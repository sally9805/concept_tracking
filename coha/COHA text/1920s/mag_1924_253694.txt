Into the Chambre des Dputs was introduced an amnesty bill , designed to pardon all those persons sentenced to imprisonment or exile for political and military crimes during the War . <P> It was natural that the bill should create resentment among the Right parties and arouse enthusiasm among the parties of the Left , for the former were the persecutors and the latter the persecuted . <P> When the bill was introduced , abuse was flung across the Chambre by Left and Right Dputs . " Assassins ! " cried the Left . " Cowards ! " yelled the Communists . " Traitors ! " roared the Right . <P> Then , also quite naturally , reference was made to France 's outstanding " traitors " : Louis Malvy , exiled for dfaitisme , Joseph Caillaux , convicted for " endangering France 's alliances " ( TIME , June 2 ) . Everyone began to shout at once , a not uncommon occurrence in the Chambre . Then , high above the mighty tumult , a shrill voice from the Right was heard enunciating the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy during the War ; alleged mistress of Louis Malvy ) . Instantly Louis , whose term of exile was recently completed and who now sits in the Chambre as a Communist Dput , rose to his feet , arms akimbo , fixing the Right with a great , black look . Deputy Saint Just , a general during the War , then went through the motions of shooting Louis with a rifle . <P> The battle of bad words and scowls became on the moment a raging war of fists . Roars went up from the Left , as they charged from their benches upon the Right Dputs . Yells of defiance were hurled by the Right upon the advancing Left . The collision shook the Chambre . Fists shot out to eyes , noses and ears . Yells of hate and screams of pain deafened the onlookers . In one corner was ex-Minister of War Andr Maginot , defending his person against the assaults of the enemy . Wallops were given , wallops were taken . M. Maginot proved himself a true warrior , fighting in torn clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound of torn linen , followed by a big bump ; le marquis de Ludre had been picked up by his collar , which had ungratefully given way with unfortunate results to the dignity and beauty of M. le marquis . <P> At this moment ex-Premier Paul Painlev , President of the Chambre , put on his hat , thereby signifying that the session was suspended . Later in the same day , le Gnral Saint Just was censored by a vote of the Chambre . <P> On the morrow , " debate " of the amnesty bill was continued . This time , a riot broke out in the Left benches . Socialist accused Communist of having " sold France . " For inexplicable reasons the Communists objected to the accusation and , in the twinkling of an eye , the members of the two Parties were either yelling their heads off or doing their best to knock one another 's off . <P> From the august Presidential seat , M. Painlev gazed down upon the seething of arms and legs ; then he put on his hat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its third attempt was successful in getting the Amnesty Bill passed by the Chambre.
