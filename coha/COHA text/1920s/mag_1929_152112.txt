Although there are insufficient flyers in the U. S. to man the planes produced , and although this insufficiency has begun to thwart sales , the Department of Commerce has all along fought scamp training schools . Obvious reason : poorly trained pilots endanger life and property , in the air , on the ground . Last week , Assistant Secretary William Patterson MacCracken approved a set of regulations stiffening the requirements for Government licenses , which now stand as follows : For Private License . On the ground , 5 hrs. study of air commerce regulations , 10 hrs. of aviation engine study , 10 hrs. of airplane study ( rigging , maintenance , repair ) . In the air , 10 hrs. dual instruction , 8 hrs. solo flying . For Limited Commercial License . On the ground , 15 hrs. study of engines , 15 hrs. of planes , 15 hrs. aerial navigation and meteorology . In the air , 50 hrs. flying time , of which 15 to 25 hrs. may be with instruction . For Transport License . On the ground , 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hrs. of meteorology , 10 hrs. of aircraft instruments and radio , 15 hrs. of aerial navigation . In the air , 200 hrs. flying time of which 35 to 50 hrs. may be with instructor . Curtiss Flying Service 's tuition fees may be taken as a key for such costs : for private license ( 25-hr , course ) , $600 ; for limited commercial license 50-hr course ) , $1,200 ; for transport license , $4,500.
