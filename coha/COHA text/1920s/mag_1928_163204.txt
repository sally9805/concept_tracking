By a simple motion of his right hand , President Coolidge called forth a flood of headlines in the press of the Mississippi Basin . Hundreds of citizens of New <P> Orleans rushed into their City Hall to make merry with expansive Mayor Arthur J. O'Keefe . The school children of New Orleans were instructed to contribute a penny each to buy a silver scroll of thanks for President Coolidge . Mayor O'Keefe called for thanksgiving services in all the churches . The Flood Control bill was law at last . <P> In the Louisiana legislature , rejoicing was not so wholehearted . Members from districts where Federal spillways and floodways will force dwellers to move out , defeated a resolution of thanks to the U. S. Congress . .. After the excitement had passed , citizens considered what actual Flood Control work would go ahead forthwith , and what the U. S. had done already . <P> After the flood ( April-May , 1927 ) , the U. S. Army engineers , who were caught in the middle of a four-year levee-improvement program , directed their energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two borrowed millions , to plugging crevasses , replacing revetments , * dredging out silt-choked channels . Today the Mississippi 's levee system is as sound as before the flood , the Army reports . <P> Before the new flood-prevention works can be begun , two more legal moves are necessary : 1 ) To $10,000,000 which the War Department has on hand , Congress must add $15,000,000 , to make up a first instalment of $25,000,000 on the $325,000,000 authorized for the whole program . The $15,000,000 will doubtless be inserted in the Second Deficiency Bill when that measure reaches the Senate this week or next . 2 ) The new three-man U. S. Flood Control Commission ( see below ) must study conflicting plans for the work and report to the President , who will pass on the final plan . The conflicts centre chiefly on the size and cost of floodways on the Boeuf River in Arkansas and Louisiana and the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana ; and on raising present levees a third foot higher . <P> Parts of the work upon which the plans do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the amounts of money that may be spent this year , are as follows : <P> 1 ) On an $8,200,000 spillway at Bonnet Carre , La. - $2,200,000 . To buy one-third of the flowage rights for same-$1,000,000 . <P> 2 ) Raising main-stream levees two feet and widening them from eight feet thick to twelve-$7,700,000 ( total authorization is $139,000,000 ) . <P> 3 ) Bank revetment-$8,000,000 ( total authorization is $80,000,000 ) . <P> 4 ) Dredging , regulating , surveying , emergency fund-$3,000,000 authorized for this year . <P> The conflicting plans of Flood Control , were drawn by the Mississippi River Commission ( an interstate body ) and the U. S. Army engineers , respectively . The chiefs of these two bodies were put on the new U. S. Flood Control Commission . For the third member , President Coolidge sought a civilian of unquestioned neutrality . He found and named him in Carleton W. Sturtevant , aged 64 , a native of Ohio , trained in Missouri , now living in the Bronx , N. Y. A lifelong dredger of rivers , Engineer Sturtevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Red
