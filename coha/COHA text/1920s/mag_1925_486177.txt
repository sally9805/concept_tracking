A GAIN has Senator Borah scored heavily . The plan recently announced by the Administration providing for the return of the sequestrated alien property and the payment of American claims is the direct result of the movement , initiated by Senator Borah and his supporters , for the disposition of one of the most deplorable legacies of the war . Secretary Mellon 's belated acceptance of the doctrine he now announces that " As a matter of broad national policy it is believed the United States should recognize the property rights of private individuals even though we were at war with their country , and not use this private property of nationals to pay claims against their nation , " is a tribute to the soundness of view and judgment of those who , like The Nation , have given expression ever since 1918 to this self-evident truth . It will be recalled that the most solemn promises were made in 1917 that the sequestrated property would be returned at the end of the war . The overwhelming victory , however , impaired the national morality and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Administration simply changed its mind . The Knox-Porter resolution contained a provision to the effect that we might " retain " the sequestrated property until Germany made " suitable provision for the satisfaction of " the claims of American citizens . The present Administration plan provides for the return of the property in kind amounting to some $150,000 , - 000 ; for the $150,000,000 of seized cash the owners are required " voluntarily " to accept $50,000,000 in bonds and $100,000,000 in cash . The owners of the ships seized in American harbors at the outbreak of war and of radios and patents used by the United States are to receive " fair and reasonable compensation , " not to exceed $100,000,000 in bonds , an ambiguity presently to be discussed . The claims of American citizens against Germany , estimated , including interest to 1926 , at $180,000,000 , will be paid by $80,000,000 in cash and $100,000,000 in bonds . To make up the $80,000,000 , $31,000,000 of undistributed interest , accumulated on alien property funds down to March 4 , 1923 , will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the owners must " voluntarily " agree to take bonds . The $250,000,000 worth of bonds provided for in the plan , and distributed as mentioned above , are to be issued by a trustee or trust company ? and to run for twenty-five years at 5 per cent interest , guaranteed by the United States . Principal and interest are to be payable in marks or dollars , at the option of the United States . They are to be served in first instance by the receipts coming to the United States from the Dawes Plan , under the head both of Rhine army costs and claims , as allocated under the Paris agreement of January , 1925 . For the Rhine army costs priority payments are to be made to the United States amounting to $13,000,000 per year , of which one year 's instalment has already been paid . Under the head of claims we are to receive 21/4 per cent of the German payments , not exceeding $10,000,000 per year , with no priority . The crux of the solution lies in the acquiescence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of American citizens . This was proper for two reasons : first , because those costs would have had to be borne by the United States in any event , and secondly , because the naivete of the Wilson and Harding administrations permitted the Allies to embezzle these funds , about $250,000,000 , after Germany had paid the amount to the Reparation Commission for our account . When Washington woke up to the facts and demanded our quota , Poincare calmly informed the Department of State that the money had been spent and that we were privileged to ask Germany for it a second time . We lamely took the advice ; hence the Wadsworth agreement of 1923 , providing for the reimbursement of the United States from future German payments , which , in turn , gave way to the Paris agreement of 1925 under the Dawes Plan . For the claims proper , the Allies at Paris in 1925 generously let us have 21/4 per cent of the German payments , which it was known was quite insufficient . Again the ineptitude of the Administration brought about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last hoped to force us into a policy of confiscation , and none more than they will regret that we have manifested a partial respect for the principle of immunity of private property , the gross violation of which by those nations is likely to cost them heavily in the future . The effort to escape the charge of confiscation by alleging that Germany is obligated to compensate its expropriated nationals only adds the immorality of hypocrisy to the offense of theft . It was , therefore , only proper that the United States Government , which was responsible for the short-changing received at the hands of the Allies , should itself bear the risks of the Dawes Plan and should not penalize for its own shortcomings the owners of the sequestrated property or , indeed , the American claimants against Germany . Hence the provision for guaranteed bonds to be served out of the Dawes Plan payments . The American claims of $180,000,000 include $2,500,000 for Lusitania victims , about $15,000,000 for requisitions , about $25,000,000 for private debts and estate claims based practically on the depreciation of the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mellon plan of settlement warrants certain comments . The $31,000,000 of undistributed interest belong not only to Germans but to American citizens and others whose property was seized and later returned , yet who were victims of the unjust rule that the Government does not pay interest on its obligations unless the law especially so provides . While it would be extremely difficult to allocate the sum , it would probably not be impossible . Again , it is extraordinary that provision should be made for " fair and reasonable compensation " to German shipowners , owners of radio stations and patents expropriated by the Government , yet that the liability should be limited to a specific total sum , $100,000,000 . It is known that these assets were worth immeasurably more ; $100,000,000 is therefore neither " fair " nor " reasonable . " If the United States is liable , it is liable for the real value of the expropriated property and not for an arbitrary , fictitious value set in advance by the taker alone . Again , it is understood that as a condition of receiving so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waive all claims for the devastation wrought upon it by the overzealous and destructive policies of A. Mitchell Palmer and Francis P. Garvan , Alien Property Custodians . This demand is unworthy of the United States and amounts to a partial confiscation . Senator Borah should not let it pass . But on the whole the plan of settlement is to be welcomed , although it contains defects which should be corrected in Congress . It may cost the United States little . Whatever it costs it will be a cheap price to pay for rescuing us from a horrible mistake of policy and for restoring in some measure the national tradition and international law . Rum , Radicalism , and Rebellion D ISPATCHES from Ohio report a dark brew of rum and radicalism at the State University . The students are being corrupted with liquor at their fraternity dances and with communism in the classroom . So , at least , the Governor of the State has learned from a report made by Assistant Prohibition Commissioner Probst after a raid in which he discovered a quart of whiskey and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a member of the English Department . Doubtless this agent of law and virtue found what he says he found . Doubtless if he looks further he will find more . Doubtless if an honest census were taken , even among college professors , the proportion of 100 per cent law-upholders would be modest . We are only mildly interested in the evidence of Mr. Horton 's success as a home brewer and distiller . What interests us is this alleged union of rum and radicalism . Mr. Horton , says Assistant Commissioner Probst , " is of the parlor socialist type and has written for communistic papers . " He even forfeited his citizenship during the war and became a citizen of . France . " The professor and his wife do not have a perspective that will make them good American citizens . The professor himself is of the dangerous type that is wrecking Europe . " Well , of course , Mr. Horton did assist more or less in the wrecking of Europe , and he did lose his citizenship . He went to France a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joined the Lafayette Escadrille , and fought in the war  --  necessarily as a citizen of France . But after the war was over he retired from the wrecking business , and when he was invited to fly over the villages of the Riff with a little group of American bombers he declined ; his regrets were expressed in language both picturesque and forcible in an article in The Nation for October 7 ( doubtless the " communistic " paper referred to by Mr. Probst ) . But Mr. Horton is not only a home brewer and a parlor pink . He is , says Mr. Probst , " an esthete as well , " and this , in the Assistant Commissioner 's bright lexicon , is pretty nearly the same thing . Mr. Probst exposes some examples of Mr. Horton 's poetry as evidence against him . He reports that when he raided the Horton home he was entertained with verses by this " dangerous " character which he quotes for the enlightenment of the Governor : Sniff ! sniff ! There 's a wolf at the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffing about And glaring so fiercely we dare not go out . What can we give him to drive him away , With bills and the wolf and the devil to pay ? Sniff ! sniff ! The wolf 's at the door . It 's the boy with the bill from the grocery store . Nor is Mr. Probst content with this damaging evidence against Mr. Horton . He goes further : It seems that the idea of being a violator of the Constitution of our country had not dawned upon him . Laws were made for the coarse and common and not for him . Like a humming bird coming to the rose for a sip of nectar , he descended from his intellectual realm to the moonshine still for a sip of rum and became entangled in the meshes of the law . And so Mr. Horton , Bolshevik , scofflaw , humming bird  --  and incidentally a gifted teacher  --  has been suspended from the faculty of Ohio State University , and the Governor is instituting a probe of lawless practices in clubs and professors ' houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed by the keen sensibilities of the prohibition enforcers of Ohio who not only detect forbidden aromas in cellars of private homes , but also the traces of radical ideas in private minds . And we wonder , unjustly perhaps , whether that little still would ever have been discovered in Mr. Horton 's house if he had not been known to write for " communistic journals " and to question the propriety of bombing small nations . Mr. Coolidge Beguiles the Farmer P RESIDENT COOLIDGE is stronger on economy than in economics . When he talks " tariff , " its splendors so dazzle him that consistency and logic are obscured and statistics take an Einstein curve instead of a straight line . In his annual message to Congress the tariff is the one thing about which nothing is said , presumably for the reason that he stands pat on that perfect instrument , the Fordney tariff , and because he had discussed the topic of agriculture and the relation of the tariff to farmers in his address before the American Farm Bureau Federation at Chicago on the Monday preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and optimistic picture of modern American agriculture in contrast with the agriculture of the past and in other countries . It is largely justified , though such a fact as the larger yield of wheat per acre in the closer cultivation of European countries detracts somewhat from our self-satisfaction . He then repeated , with straightforward candor , his ' opposition to nostrums for the cure of present ills through governmental intervention , and announced his worthy program for promoting cooperative marketing and other independent methods of making the most of our farming facilities . In blind contradiction to the principles of non-interference which he thus enunciated , he then proceeded to prove to the assembled farmers that the tariff is an unmitigated blessing for them and that it is not they but the industrial and city population that pays the tariff bills . As they listened to the President there must have been a puzzled look on the faces of those members ' of the American Farm Bureau Federation who had read in its Weekly News Letter of January 11 , 1923 , the report of its Department of Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff . By an ingenious , if not ingenuous , argument , which it is difficult to follow , the President reached the remarkable conclusion that our farmers are taxed by the tariff in net result not more than 1 1/3 per cent of their expenditures . The Farm Bureau experts figure somewhat differently . To the full extent of the duties the gain to agriculture would be $124,800,000 , of which sugar accounts for $45,800,000 , wool $37,500,000 , tobacco $10,000,000 , and wheat and all other cereals together but $11,000,000 . Thus any possible gain by tariff-heightened prices affects , as in other industries , special States or classes only : Louisiana and the beet-sugar interests , Ohio and Texas and the rangers in the mountain States who seek the use of our national forests for grazing , and certain New England and Southern States growing tobacco , while the whole body of the people as consumers , by the same reckoning , are mulcted $391,700,000 and the farmers as consumers $94,900,000 , for the benefit of the special agricultural classes named  --  these figures referring to farm products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dutiable imports increases prices thereon $1,715 , - 000,000 , of which the farmers pay $426,000,000 ? figures which contrast rather startlingly with the President 's . The economic confusion in Mr. Coolidge 's argument comes from the too usual ignoring of " the forgotten man , " the farmer as consumer of all products , while the " protection " benefits , so far as there are such , are gained only by special classes , whether among farmers or the general community . It has been a leading argument in favor of the tariff that the wage-earners are the chief beneficiaries , but the President incidentally asserted that the industrial and city population bear the burden of tariff duties . He declared also that the labor and service which the farmers buy are untaxed , ignoring the fact that those who serve pay taxes indirectly in the cost of living . That all is not happy in the field of " protection " may be illustrated by some detailed facts . The textile industries , with the highest protective duties , are in so bad a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages of any American industry , appeals for still higher duties , while the Carded Woolen Manufacturers Association makes complaint that the specific duties on wool , reaching 191 per cent ad valorem on the cheaper wools , are ruinous to the business , and the president of the American Federation of Labor serves notice that if the decreases of wages , which have produced so many strikes , are not ended , the A. F. of L. will ask for a reduction of the duties on woolens . The fact is that the " pyramiding " of duties from those on wool to those on woolens has made clothing , blankets , and the like , which the farmer and the rest of us must buy , so high in price that we are wearing our old things and ? giving the woolen mills orders for only 60-70 per cent of their capacity , whereas they claim they must increase their output by 15 to 20 per cent to give a fair return . And every housewife , in the farmhouse as well as the city home , who uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ware which favors the Mellon aluminum trust , officially declared to be a lawbreaker . Finally , the President enumerated the articles on the free list for the special benefit of the farmer , including farm machinery , in which we excel the world , and gasoline , which we sell to the world , so that a duty would be as delusive as the duty on wheat and other farm products , the chief use of which is to fool the farmer politically . The Menace of Education O UT in Hawaii there is a man who understands the menace of education . His name is John Hind and , retiring as president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters ' Association , he discussed the labor problem , the tariff , soil conditions , taxation , and education . People , he said , were getting too much education , and it was a mistake to let teachers instead of business men plan the courses of study . We quote from the text of his address , as reprinted in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin : Why blindly continue he asks a ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxpayers ' expense long after they have mastered more than sufficient learning for all ordinary purposes , simply to enlighten them on subjects of questionable value . . . . The present elaborate and idealistic school system .. . will in the end , I fear , produce a generation of impractical men and women who , believing . . . manual labor is beneath them , will bring about a condition of stunted or retarded development under which it may be found impossible to raise but a fraction of the amount of taxes which we are today called upon to pay . . . . The solution , as I see it , is that the taxpayer be relieved of further responsibility after the pupil has mastered the sixth grade , or possibly the eighth grade in a modified form . To effect the necessary change , Mr. Hind feels , will require the cooperation of " some of our practical conservative business men " where hitherto we have trusted to mere educators who " by their training and devotion to learning have become unduly idealistic and hence extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of a business matter . " This is an excrescence of Coolidge-economy philosophy which we may expect to see break out elsewhere than in the cane-fields of the mid-Pacific . Mr. Hind is concerned with two things  --  low taxes and cheap labor , wherein he resembles many of the props of the republic on the mainland , and his logic is far better than his grammar . The present American system of giving every child as much schooling as he will swallow is costly ; and it produces young men and women who do not care to work , either on sugar plantations or in steel mills , for twelve hours a day . Elsewhere in his address Mr. Hind praises the Hawaiian bureau of labor for its success in importing , during a recent strike , large numbers of Filipino laborers whose standard of living was still lower than that prevailing in the gardens of Eden ( as the tourist literature describes them ) about Mauna Loa . Whatever its other faults , American education can not be accused of fostering a soporific contentment with plain living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Ford car , and a radio set , and he expects his education to enable him to earn them . Mr. Hind will have to pay more than a dollar a day for sugar workers if he is to hire public-school graduates ; and if our present immigration policy continues there will soon be none but public-school graduates to hire . Education  --  even pretty poor and formalistic education ? undoubtedly does produce , as Mr. Hind says , " visionary highbrows " who are not content to work as their fathers worked . It creates discontent . If the half-baked schoolboys of China had known either more or less they would never have awakened a sleeping continent . In Pittsburgh , Oahu , and Shanghai a little knowledge is still a dangerous thing . Fortunately .
