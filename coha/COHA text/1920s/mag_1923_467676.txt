IT was not I who found the rare flower . 1 The old gods who rule the Albanian mountains are capricious still , as they were in the days when Zee ? whom the Greeks called Zeus ? first launched his thunderbolts . " For whom is intended , and who will get , are two persons , " the mountain men say . The Chafa Shalit , in rain and sun , had answered my questions with a granite voice that spoke of war and pride and honor . The small flower that blooms there is known to me only from the tale I heard in the Caf ? Fra The Cafe Frasheri looks out through white arcades at the sun-drenched street and painted mosque of Tirana . Dusk and coolness are in the low room , where tables stand on sunken flagstones , and the solitary waiter sits smoking a cigarette in a long holder of amber and silver filagree . Time , in his leisurely progress through the dreaming town , stops in the Cafe Frasheri . Eternity reigns there , with immortal murmur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaves in the plane trees . There is a mirror on the whitewashed wall , and across its surface pass such shadows as the Lady of Shalott wove into tapestry ? shadows of tall men in black-braided white woolen garments and scarlet sashes , moving without sound in moccasins of goat'sskin ; shadows of tiny donkeys laden with brooms of lavendar flowers and pine ; shadows of women spinning wool on the twirling spindle ; all bright in the hot white street beneath the green plane trees , but cool in the pool of the mirror . Two of us sat in the Cafe Frasheri , incongruous figures in peat-scented tweed with blouses and hats from therue de la Paix , and the coffee grew cold in its miniature cups while Annette Marquis told of her days in the Scutari mountains . The mountaineers said there had never been such a spring since a hundred hundred years before the Romans came . The waterfalls were frozen , and the rapids of the Lumi Shala boiled black through a crust of ice . There had always been snow on the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the village of Thethis men tunneled through snow from house to house , and the children were crying with hunger . There were five of us , and we were guests ; the last sheep was killed for us , and the chiefs smiled , with hands on their hearts , when they passed us the dishes . But there was not enough bread for the village , and our silver kronen were not food . I said we must go . They tried to keep us , but when I insisted , they said that we might get over the frozen snow in the Chafa Shalit and down to the Scutari plain . Four chiefs went with us ; you know it , is their custom to escort guests to the edge of the tribal lands . We went in the dark of the morning , with torches to light the way . At ten o'clock the sun came over the eastern mountains , and the white mountains shone and sparkled . I could hardly go on , for wanting to look at the colors and sparkle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of me that was not an ache . But the chiefs would not let me stop . So we climbed , till all my muscles screamed with pain , but when I protested , still they urged me upward . Their faces were grim under their turbans , and for the first time I was afraid of them , I did not know why . But I could not let myself be afraid , so I stopped and said that we should stay where we were until I was rested . " No , " the interpreter said , " we will go on without resting . We have come too far to get back and the sun is melting the snow . " - I was saying that , nevertheless , I must rest , when he made a gesture so savage that astonishment killed the words . The chiefs were looking upward , listening , and I heard a soft increasing sound like wind in pines . Then the interpreter seized my wrist and said , " Run ! " And we ran . Twice the crust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went down into a softness like feathers , down to my armpits . They all pulled me out , somehow , and I saw them shouting while they did it . I could not hear them , for the whole air was rushing past us . When we stopped , the trail we had been climbing was a wide ravine deep cut in the snow , and there was a clean gash through the pine forest below us . The great pines , whose tops had been sparkling above the snow , had been cut off at their roots and carried away . The Albanians knelt where they stood , and crossed themselves and thanked God . That was the beginning . If I do not tell you more of what I felt , it is because I can not ; there are no words . I did not know clearly at the time what I was feeling , I know only that I am a different person since that day . We went on , climbing . We could not get back to the trail , but followed along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two peaks of the Chafa were pure and white against the sky above us , and we knew that if we could reach the niche between them we could rest . But it was not straight climbing up one mountainside . We went over the shoulders of many mountains and across many snow-filled hollows . The sun grew warmer , and all the peaks were shedding their weight of snow . Every few minutes we stopped to listen , and when we heard that sound like wind , we ran . We ran from nine avalanches before I forgot to count them . And the running was dangerous , because beneath the crackling crust there were depths of snow , and in our terror of the avalanches we did not know whether we were above ten feet of it or five hundred . Even the Albanians lost all clear memory of the hidden gorges and cliffs beneath us . Always when we ran I fell through the crust , and always they all stopped until I was pulled out and running again . We went on , with the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . We walked a little distance apart , except that one man was always beside mc , and there was no sound except the snapping of the snow crust and a low praying . The chiefs prayed without a pause , asking God to save me . That low murmuring never stopped while we climbed . The hundred miles of white peaks and blue hollows below us were still , with a silence that filled earth and sky more dreadfully than any voice , and the roar of an avalanche drowning the prayers was like a contemptuous condescending ? the silence speaking at last to the ears of such midgets as we . Imagine what it was to us to see on the whiteness before our eyes the blue shadow of another human being . He was waiting for us , and when we stopped in a carefully scattered group he gave us polite greeting , " Long may you live ! " He crossed himself as he said it . He was perhaps forty years old , and looked as strong as weather-seasoned oak , The thrift and pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pattern of bright flowers , that lined his new opultgi , and in the clean beautifully braided white trousers , the combed fringe of the black jacket . The rifle on his back shone with polishing . Friendly laughter and contentment had left their marks around his hazel eyes and on sunbrowned cheeks , but the eyes were serious then , and the lips tense . " I am Gjlosh Marku , a man of the village of Boga in the tribe of Pultit , " he told us , when the greeting of the trails was said . " It was telephoned to us across the mountains that the chiefs of Thethis were bringing us a guest , an American , : onyx on her way to Scutari . We replied to him who telephoned , but his voice did not come back to us . ? So / have come to say to you , all guests are welcome in the village of Boga , and an American zonya is thrice welcome . Our village is hers if she honors us by coming . But the Serbs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chafa Shalit . They hold the road to Scutari , and let no one pass . The Tirana . government will not let us fight them . The village of Boga will be happy if the American zonya will stay with us as long as she will . But the trails are dangerous to-day , so I have come to say that if she must go to Scutari , the way through the Chafa Shalit will not take her there . " I thanked him , with my hand on my heart , but what were thanks to give a man who was risking his life to warn me of danger ? I felt ungrateful when I said that I could pass the Serbs . He had not understood that the power of my tribe would take me safely where no Mikagjini man could go . We should go on , I said , and was startled by the groan that escaped me when my muscles moved again . Gjlosh Marku went before us to show us the way , which indeed was marked by his footprints and the flounderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again and again I fell . Numbness was coming upon me , and I felt , when the feather softness buried me and I must lie motionless until they dragged me to safety by an arm , that it would be good if they would leave me in peace . Any fiction reader knows that is a desire which must be fought heroically , and I remembered this . But reality is not like fiction , though we try so hard to make it so . I did not go on because of any will of my own , but because the Albanians expected me to do it . You must realize that we had been climbing and running for twelve hours . The sun was reaching the Chafa Shalit , and the two peaks seemed as far from us as ever . The windy sound of another avalanche came down to us , and again I ran , and again I fell and was dragged out . When I tried to stand I could n't ; I told them to run on and leave me . The interpreter took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " I 'm sorry , but we must kill you . We ca n't carry you , and the avalanche might not kill you quickly . If you ca n't run , we must shoot you and ourselves . " His voice was quite gentle and sad . The others slung their rifles off their shoulders , and I heard Gjlosh Marku saying , " my wife . " The roar of the avalanche was quite close , and their voices , still praying , were lost in it . You see , I had forgotten their Law of Lee , and that all ten of them must die with me . I got up . But before I could try to run , Gjlosh Marku held my wrist and was pulling me in the other direction . Some obstacle had changed the course of the snow , and when the spray and roar of it had passed , the place where I had fallen was on the edge of the chasm it left . You do not know how you take for granted the friendliness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment the universe seemed to be playing with us like a cat with a mouse . Even the Albanians were silenced , looking at their old god , the sun , which had betrayed us and now was leaving us . And in a mood of strange mirth I said to the interpreter , " After this , do n't mind me . If you 're going to do any shooting , please begin with yourselves . " It was enraging to be so weak . Anger took me on for awhile , and then Gjlosh Marku pulled me upward by one wrist . The interpreter walked behind me , saying , " One more step , just one . Good ! Now , just one more . Only one step . " He said that , urgently , over and over , while the sun sank behind Chafa Shalit and its shadow came down across us . And over and over , through the haze in which I heard that urging and struggled to obey it , I heard another thingGjlosh Marku , in his prayer , repeating . my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Chafa Shalit the sun shone on us again , and it was like another morning to see the peaks and mounds of shining snow and the glittering forests running down to a glimmer of Lake Scutari , fifty miles away . We fell in the snow , and / seemed to have slept for a long time when the interpreter shook me awake . My Albanians and the chiefs of Thethis were kneeling , with bowed heads , crossing themselves , but Gjlosh Marku was on his feet , telephoning . He swayed and staggered , but he held his thumbs firmly against his ears , and that unearthly call of the mountain people went through the frosty air like the highest note of a violin . He did not rest until an answer came up from the white valley , and then he sat down without firing his rifle . " Telephoning to his wife , " I surmised . We had long ago abandoned all the packs , but a little cornbread had been carried in the sashes , and we sat there eating it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . " Wait ! I know you will say that this was impossible . I know all you will say : that the Albanians of the mountain tribes are betrothed in their cradles , that husband and wife do not meet until they are married , that their whole idea of marriage is rooted in the idea of the family and the tribe , that they have no faintest conception of love . All your books with their long words tell you that they can not have that idea . Love is a new thing in the world , a part of western civilization , a pure thing from the cold north brought by the barbarians who killed the worship of Aphrodite and of Venus . Those hidden Albanian tribes , who have held their mountains and their old laws since " a hundred hundred years before the Romans came , " can know nothing about love . They have no word in their language for it . All their words for emotions are concerned with war and honor . And wise men say we can have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you see , I met Gjlosh Marku . It was dark when we came to his house . The night was cold , and the snow once more as hard as iee . From the Chafa Shalit to the edge of the pines it was a smooth gigantic slope , and we did not walk . We lay on the snow at the edge of it , and our bodies went down like sleds ? a roar of wind in our ears and a rush of dizzy stars and the heaven of no effort , till terror made us try to stop with a foot dug into the snow . Then a whirling and crackling , and lying still till breath came back and we crawled out on unbroken surface again . An hour of this falling ? little specks of us , shed from the indifferent mountain like raindrops on a window pane , until the sharp tops of the pines came through the snow to meet us , and Mark Gjloshi , the son of Gjlosh Mark-u , was waiting for us with a torch . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn up to give you welcome , the shock and flash of rifles firing in the dark , the torchlight on proud hard faces and silver chains , and " Long may you live ! Long may you live ! Glory to the trails that brought you ! " It was good to get into the warm dusk where the fire smoldered on the earthen floor and the goats munched their dried leaves with a tinkling of hells . It was quite a pretentious house . There was a notched log leading up to a little wickerwork room that hung on the stone wall like a bird 's nest , and there was a wooden canopy over the fire , velvety with soot , and a hanging basket of ironwork to hold blazing splinters of pitch pine . The floor was neatly swept , and waiting in the ashes of the fire was the coffee pot , like a deep , long-handled spoon , with covered glasses filled with coffee and sugar , and a wooden jar of water , and the little handleless cup . Of course , you hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted them , they fade into the darkness beyond the firelight and are only bright eyes watching you , and a twinkle of marriage belts . I lay down on the warm ground beside the fire without a thought of the wife of Gjlosh Marku , until he said , even before he set the coffee pot in the-coals , " Where is my wife ? " His son answered him . He was a , handsome boy , about seventeen years old , taller than his father , and blue eyed . He had hung his rifle on the wall with the others , and was cutting splinters for the lamp . All the chiefs were lounging around the fire in that circle you know so well ? bodies Iean as panthers , in white wool and black wool , colored sashes , and silver-hilted knives , keen eyes and long slender hands rolling cigarettes . It all binned and went out , and they had to wake me for the ceremony of coffee drinking . Gjlosh Marko needed that cup more than I , and some of my men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , 1 must drink first . " Tu ujet jeta ! Per to mire ! " The thick hot sweetness of the coffee had roused me when there was a noise at the bolted door , and Gjlosh Markit 's wife came in . She came straight into the firelight , a vigorous woman bringing a scent of pine and snow . She was not beautiful , and had never been ptetty . Her face was as browned as leather , but every wrinkle in it was pleasant to see , and her blue eyes were wise and merry . Two neat braids of graying hair hung over her breast to the wide marriage belt ; she had gathered up her skirt of black-andwhite wool , and under the short petticoat her legs were sturdy in flowered stockings and worn apangi . Gjlosh Marku got up at once , and took from the gathered-up skirt a new-horn lamb that she had been carrying . " A ti iodhe ? " he said . " Are you tired ? " Gjlosh Marku does not know any word for love or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two when they met by that fire , both come alive from the snow and the dark . Theysimply looked at each other , and she said that she was not tired . Then she went to bring the mother sheep into the house , and Gjlosh Marku went on making coffee . He helped her later with cooking the supper ; there is nothing unusual in that , of course . But there was a difference in their manner of doing it ; they worked together not like two workmen , or even like two friends , but as though they were One person . He always knew where she was , without turning his head to look into the darkness , and things were handed from one to the other as from the right hand to the left . " They do love each other , " the interpreter said . " I have often heard of them ; they arc famous in the mountains for this strange thing . And it is strange to see . I have not seen anything like it , not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is common , in America . But to us it is very strange . " Gjlosh Marku himself spoke frankly of it . After we had drunk the coffee and rakejia , after the low table with its chunks of hot cornbread and its central dish of eggs and goat's-milk cheese had been passed from group to group , and we had washed our hands again and lighted the cigarettes of golden tobacco , he proudly directed our attention to her , where she sat in the firelight , embroidering new trousers for him . " Look now at my wife , " he said . " There is no woman like her in the mountains , or even in Scutari . Two thousand kronen she cost me , and I have never spent better money . I would pay for her to-day four thousand kronen and my goats and my sheep ? all that I have . Is she not a beautiful woman ? " We could not truthfully say that she was , but fortunately the question was rhetorical . " She is as clever as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now twenty-four years that I have lived with my woman , and all that I have I owe to her . She knows the ways of sheep and goats , she makes old garments into new ones , she is never idle . She thinks , also . Her counsel is always good . " /t is the good husband who makes the good wife , " she remarked , pausing to hold off the embroidery and look at it . " But how can a man know what he will find when he opens the door to look at his bride ? " Gjlosh Marku replied . " She may be ugly , she may be old , she may be of a nature that will make him all his life like a man walking with a hole in his opangi . I tell you that I thought many things before I opened that door twenty-four years ago , to look for the first time on the wife who had been brought to my house . But glory to my parents ! they had chosen well for me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been together in war and in peace , and never have I ceased to bless my parents . " You will understand that I was exhausted , and that in the warmth of the fire it was torturing to keep myself awake , as courtesy required that I do . All the black coffee and cigarettes could barely hold my eyes open , and any part in the conversation was impossible . When next I saw my hosts clearly , the wife of Gjlosh Marku had laid aside her work and was talking steadily , in a low quiet voice , to the interpreter . " She says that in all the twenty-four years they have had only one sorrow , but it is the heaviest of all sorrows to bear . Durgat Pasha took their oldest son . " Everywhere in the Albanian mountains , of course , one comes upon these traces of Durgat Pasha 's passing . The songs of his attempt , with thirty thousand Turkish soldiers , to crush Albania 's revolt against the Sultan , the stories of the things he did , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me what it is to the Albanians ? something combining the childish terror of darkness with fables of Timurlane . " But that was eleven years ago . " " Yes . Her son was twelve years old . Durgat Pasha took him to be a soldier in the Turkish army , and whether he was killed or whether he is still . a prisoner in Turkey , they do not . know . No word has ever come back . " Gjlosh Marku and his wife were looking at each other , not in sorrow , but in consultation . A decision passed between them . She beckoned toward the dark corner where the Iamb was sleeping beside its mother , and one of the women stirred and came forward into the firelight . She was not a woman , but a beautiful girl , perhaps fifteen years old , Serious , with downcast lids making black crescents of lashes in the creamy oval of her face , she stood until the woman 's hand gave her permission to sit . She wore the white kerchief on her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmarried girl ; the ends of her braided black hair coiled in her lap , under her folded hands . She was as still as a nesting bird when danger is near , and as acutely intent , through her stillness , on something outside herself . The little sound of a silver chain straightening its links gave my attention the same direction as hers . Mark Gjloshi had moved , with no other sound than that , back from the circle of firelight , and his blue eyes were filled with her . The interpreter turned to me . " She says , this is the girl to whom her lost son was betrothed . She comes from the tribe of Hoti , and they have sheltered her in this house since her people were killed when the Serbs took Hoti and Gruda . She is a good girl , strong of body and spirit ; she is also a good spinner and weaver and a good Catholic . She is of marriageable age , and if it had not been for the wars , she would now be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that son were dead , she would of course he married to this other son , since the marriage was arranged between the families . This other boy was five years old , but not betrothed , when Durgat Pasha came , and they have not betrothed him to anyone , because they feared that Durgat Pasha killed his brother . But they have had no news ; no one has seen him , living or dead . He may perhaps be in Turkey ; he may perhaps come back . They do not dare marry the girl to the boy here , until they are sure that he will not come back . For of course , if he should be alive , he would then have to kill his brother . That is the Law of Lee ; that the girl belongs to the man to whom her parents betroth her , and if another man takes her , he must he killed . " But news may never come . And the girl is of marriageable age , and so is their son . They should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ask you what should they do ? " Gjlosh Marku and his wife waited for my words . The chiefs who lounged by the fire watched me with bright expectant eyes . Mark Gjloshi was again in the firelight , imperturbably rolling a cigarette in his firm long fingers , and the girl 's eyelids fluttered . A more inadequate Solomon never confronted a problem . " The boy who is gone had never seen her ? " " No ; she was with her own tribe then . He was only twelve years old when Durgat Pasha took him , and he would not have seen her until he was fourteen , and married to her . But that does not matter ; she was his by the Law of Lee , which must he obeyed . But it . is also the Law of Lee that if he dies and leaves a brother who is not betrothed , then she must marry the brother . And it is the Law of Lec that if he is living , and any other man marries her , then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desperately I rubbed my eyes , and accepted an offered cigarette . The silence continued while I smoked it . " Tell them that I am not learned in the Law of Lee , " I said . " My tribe has other laws . But as I understand it , when a cause for blood feud rises within a tribe , that is a matter for the chiefs of that tribe to arrange , if possible , so that no blood will be shed . Now it seems to me that if this oldest son comes home after eleven years in Turkey , he will not come for his wife . He has been ofmarriageable age for nine years , and if his mind were set upon his wife , he could surely have escaped from Turkey during that time . So , if he comes , the chiefs of Pultit should be able to arrange the matter with him . How much was he to pay for his wife ? " " Two thousand kronens . " " Then this son would pay two thousand kronens if he married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her family . But her family is all killed now . " " But she is not killed , so she is the family . Two thousand kronen should be paid to her when she is married . " " Po , po ! " Gjlosh Marku agreed . " That much would be spent for her clothes and for the new household . " " Then I would say : If the girl is willing to give up the two thousand kronen , let them be married , and save the two thousand kronen for a few years more . If the brother comes back , let that sum be paid to him to settle the blood feud . And now , " I said , " politeness or no politeness , I am going to sleep . " There were some exclamations of astonishment and approval ? " Glory to your lips ! " the chiefs said to we , hearing my translated wisdom ? but I was stretched out on the floor , falling into unconsciousness . Sonic time between that hour and dawn , half awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching my cheek ; the girl from the tribe of Hoti was tucking another blanket over me . That is all . I have told you how I slept all the next day , while my men went back over the Chafa Shalit to find and bring my packs , and how we got to Scutari through the Serbian lines . I do not know what was decided about the marriage in the family of Gjlosh Marku . But you may read all you like in your hooks that tell how love came into civilized life with the barbarians who destroyed the worship of Aphrodite and Venus . I know how love came into the life of the barbarians , before their language had a word for it .
