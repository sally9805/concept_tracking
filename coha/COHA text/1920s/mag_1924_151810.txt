" Poetry making , " said a foreign correspondent of a Manhattan journal , " like other crafts , is unionized under the Soviet rgime . " <P> To commemorate the 40th anniversary of Poet Sologub 's activities , the Poet 's Union met in Moscow and held an " Evening with the Poets . " <P> Many " schools " were represented-symbolists , acmeists , futurists , centrifugalists , imaginists , Moscow Parnassians , poets proletarian , poets peasant , neoromantic , non - classic , constructive , aimless poets , nichevoki poets , poets aloof , high-brow and low-brow and poets independent . <P> The " Evening " started by a white-haired , grey-bearded professor giving a dissertation on Sologub . Then up jumped a poet symbolist ; told how much better he was than Sologub , recited one , two , three , four of his poems ; started to recite the fifth , but the audience had had enough . Shrieks shrill and roars raucous rent the atmosphere-the poet sadly sat down . <P> Seventy poets followed the Symbolist in rotation . Whenever one attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this way it was possible to end the meeting in a single " Evening . "
