txt // of mere accident it could be expected that the several elements would at times combine and at other times crop out separately , one can be reasonably sure of the real identity and common origin of the complex trait . When a trait is simple , it is more difficult to be positive that the apparent resemblance amounts to identity . Such doubt applies for instance to isolated magical practices . A custom found among separate nations , such as sprinkling water to produce rain , may be the result of an importation of the idea from one people to another . Or again it may represent nothing more than a specific application of the assumed principle that an act similar to a desired effect will produce that effect . This magical belief is so broad , and so ramifying in its exemplifications , as to become almost impossible to use as a criterion . The essential basis of magic may conceivably have been developed at a single culture center in the far distant past and have been disseminated thence over the whole world . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , magic beliefs may really be rooted instinctively in the human mind and grow thence over and over again with inevitability . There seems no present way of determining which interpretation is correct . 93 . FLOOD LEGENDS This situation applies to many widely spread concepts in folk-lore . Flood myths of some sort , for instance , are told by probably the majority of human nations . In the early days of the science , this wide distribution of flood myths was held to prove the actuality of a flood , or to be evidence of the descent of all mankind from a single nation which had once really experienced it . Such explanations are too obviously naive to require refutation to-day . Yet it is difficult to interpret the wide prevalence of flood myths , either as spontaneous growth from out the human mind , or as diffusion from a single devising of the idea . Much of the difficulty is caused by the fact that one can not be sure that the various flood myths are identical . Some peoples have the flood come after the earth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human race . Other nations begin their cosmology with a flood . For them , water // was in existence before there was an earth , and the problem for the gods or creative animals was to make the world . This , according to some American Indian versions , they finally accomplished by having one of their number dive to the bottom and bring up a few grains of sand which were then expanded to constitute terra firma . The first type of story is evidently a true " flood " myth ; the second might better be described as a concept of " primeval water . " The difficulty is enhanced by the fact that the two types are sometimes found amalgamated in a single mythology . Thus the Hebrew account begins with the primeval waters but subsequent to the formation of the earth t Ile deluge covers it . So , according to some American tribes , the flood came after the earth , but the waters remained until after the diving . It is clear that flood stories are more shifting than the Magic Flight episode . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has gradually come to differentiate greatly . But again , several distinct concepts ? primeval water , flood , the diving animals , the ark ? may have been evolved in different parts of the world , each developing in its own way , and traveling so far , in some cases , as to meet and blend with ot hers . This last interpretation is favored by some of the facts of distribution : the prevalence of the diving concept in America , // for instance , and the absence of flood myths from much of Africa . There is a vast amount of folk-lore recorded , and much of it has lent itself admirably to the working out of its historical origins , so far as limited regions are concerned . Folk-lorists are often axle to prove that one tale originated in India and was carried into medieval Europe , or that another was probably first devised on the coast of British Columbia and then disseminated across the Rocky mountains to the interior tribes of Indians . When it comes to intercontinental and world-wide distribution , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood myths become stronger and stronger . While the most interesting mythical ideas are those which are world-wide , it is in these that uncertainty between origin by diffusion or parallelism is greatest . The Magic Flight therefore constitutes a grateful exception . It opens the door to a hope that more assiduous analysis and comparison may lead to the accurate determination of the source and history of other common and fundamental myths . 94 . TIm DOUBLE-BEADED EAGLE An unexpected story of wandering attaches to the figure or symbol of the double-headed eagle . Like many other elements of civilization , this goes back to an Egyptian beginning . One of the great gods of Egypt was the sun . The hawk and vulture were also divine animals . A combination was made showing the disk of the sun with a long narrow wing on each side . Or the bird itself was depicted with outstretched wings but its body consisting of the sun disk . These were striking figures of considerable aesthetic and imaginative appeal . From Egypt the design was carried in the second millenium B.C. to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A second head was added , perhaps to complete the symmetry of the figure . Just as a wing and a foot went out from each side of the body or disk , so now there was a head facing each way . This doubleheaded bird symbol was carved on cliffs in Asia Minor . Here the piftures remained , no doubt wondered at but uncopied , for two thousand years . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries // after Christ , the Turkish princes , feeling the symbol to be a fit emblem of sovereignty , began stamping it on their coins . The later Crusaders brought these coins , or the idea of the pattern , hack with them to Europe , where the mediaeval art of heraldry was flourishing . The double-headed eagle was a welcome addition to the lions and griffins with which artists were emblazoning the coats of arms of the feudal nobility . The meaning of sovereignty remaining attached to the figure , the device before long became indicative of the imperial idea . This is the origin of its use as a symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years ago Charles V was king of Spain and Austria and Holy Roman emperor of Germany . It was in his reign that Cortez and Pizarro conquered Mexico and Peru . ' 1'hus the symbol of the double-headed eagle was carried into the New World and the Indians became conversant with it . Even some of the wilder tribes learned the figure , although they were perhaps more impressed with it as a decorative motive than as an emblem . At any rate , they introduced it into their textiles and embroideries . The Huichol in the remote mountains of Mexico , who use the design thus , seem to believe that their ancestors had always been conversant with the figure . But such a belief of course proves no more than did the ignorance of European heraldists of the fact that their double-headed eagle came to them from Asia Minor and ultimately from Egypt . No pre-Columbian representation of the two-headed eagle is known from Mexico . The conclusion can therefore hardly be escaped that this apparently indigenous textile pattern of the modern I luichol is also to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence they have never heard . 95 . THE ZODIAC The foregoing example should not establish the impression that the main source of all culture is to be sought in Egypt . Many other ancient and modern countries have made their contribution . It is to the Chinese , for instance , that we owe silk , porcelain , and gun powder . The ancient Sumerians and Babylonians , on the lower course of the Tigris and Euphrates , moved // toward definite cultural progress about as early as the Egyptians , and have perhaps contributed as many elements to the civilization of to-day . One of these is the zodiac . This is the concept of dividing the path of the sun , moon , and planets around the heavens into twelve equal parts , each named after a constellation . The series runs : ram , bull , twins , crab , lion , virgin , scales , scorpion , archer , goat , water-carrier , fishes . Constellations , indeed , had begun to be named at a very early time , as is clear from the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these twelve constellations as a measure of the movement of the heavenly bodies seems to have made its first appearance among the Chaldean Babylonians about a thousand years before Christ . From them the Persians , and then the Greeks , learned the zodiac ; and with its introduction to the Roman Empire it became part of the fund of knowledge common to the whole of western civilization . It does not appear to have been accepted by the Egyptians until Roman imperial times . Knowledge of the zodiac also spread eastward to India . It seems to have been carried as far as China by Buddhist missionaries , but failed to be seriously adopted in that country until its reintroduction by Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century . The Chinese long before had invented a series of twelve signs which has sometimes been called a zodiac , and gradually trans. mated it to the adjacent natives of Japan , Korea , Mongolia , Turkistan , and Tibet . This seems to be of independent origin from the western or Babylonian zodiac . It appears to have been devised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and finally to the heavens . Its path through the sky is the reverse of the western zodiac ; and its signs are specifically different : rat , ox , tiger , hare , dragon , serpent , horse , sheep , monkey , hen , dog , and pig . At most , therefore , it would seem that there might have penetrated to China from the west the idea of dividing time or space into twelve units and assigning to each of these the name of an animal . The working out and utilization of the idea were native Chinese . Already in ancient times the pictures of the twelve constellations ' of the western zodiac began to be abbreviated and reduced to symbols . These gradually become more and more // conventional , although evidences of their origin are still visible . The sign of the ram , for instance , as we employ it in almanacs , shows the downward curling horns of this animal ; that for the ox , his rising horns ; for the archer , his arrow , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwent some travels of their own which carried them to unexpected places . The Negroes of the west coast of Africa make gold finger rings ornamented with the twelve zodiacal symbols in their proper sequence . They seem ignorant of the meaning , in fact do not possess sufficient astronomical knowledge to be able to understand the use of the signs . It also remains uncertain whether they learned the set of symbols from European navigators or from the Arabs that have penetrated the northern half of Africa . Nevertheless it is the true zodiac which they portray , even though only as a decorative pattern . There has been some assertion that the zodiac was known to the more advanced Middle American Indians between Arizona and Peru , but the claim has also been denied . There does appear to have been at least one series of animal signs used by the Mayas of Yucatan in an astronomical connection . It is not known that this series served the true zodiacal function of noting the positions of the heavenly bodies . Further , the Maya series consists of thirteen instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblances to the Old World zodiac . There is only one that is the same as in the Old World zodiac : the scorpion . The relationship of the Maya and Old World series is therefore unproved , and probably fictitious . The ease however possesses theoretical interest in that it illustrates the criteria of the determination of culture relationships . The Mexican zodiac would unquestionably be interpreted as a derivative from the Asiatic one , even though its symbols de . parted somewhat from those of the latter , provided that the similar symbols came in the same order . The Asiatic ram might well be replaced by a Mexican deer , the lion by a wildcat , and the virgin by a maize goddess . And if the deer , the wildcat , and the maize goddess came in first , fifth , and sixth place , it would be almost compulsory to look upon them as superficially altered equivalents of the Old World ram , lion , and virgin . It is conceivable enough that similar individual symbols might independ- // ently come into use in remote parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of symbols should be put into the same arbitrary sequence independently . As a mere matter of mathematical probability there would be no more than an infinitesimal chance of such a complex coincidence . If therefore the sequential identity of the American series and the Old World zodiac should ever be proved , l it would be necessary to believe that this culture element was somehow carried into the Middle American regions from Asia , either across northern America or across the Pacific . Identity of sequence failing , there might still remain an instance of partial convergence . It is within the range of possibility that the Mayas , who were painstaking astronomers and calculators , and who like ourselves named the stars and constellations after animals , arranged a series of these as a mnemonic or figurative aid in their calendrical reckoning . This , however , would be a case of only incomplete parallelism . The general concept would in that event have been developed independently , its specific working out remaining distinctive . On accurate analysis of culture phenomena , this sort of result proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a basic or psychological similarity , but concrete details are markedly different . On the other hand if a differentiation from a common source has taken place , so that true historical connection exists , some specific identity of detail almost always remains as evidence . It therefore follows that if only it is possible to get the facts fully enough , there is no theoretical reason why ultimately all cultural phenomena that are still hovering doubtfully between the parallelistic and the diffusionary interpretations should not be positively explainable one way or the other . This of course is not an assertion that such proof has been brought . In fact there are far more traits of civilization whose history remains to be elucidated than have yet been solved . But the attainments already achieved , and an understanding of the principles by which they have been made , // encourage hope for an indefinite increase of knowledge regarding the origin and growth of the whole of human culture . 96 . MEASURES Another increment of civilization due to the Babylonians is a series of metric standardizations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sixty degrees , of the day into twenty-four ( originally twelve ) hours , of the hour into sixty minutes , of the foot into twelve inches , and the pound ? as it survives in our troy weight ? into twelve ounces . It is apparent that the system involved in these measures is based on the number twelve and its multiple sixty . The weights current in the ancient Near East also increased by sixties . On these weights were based the ancient money values . The Greek mina , Hebrew maneh , approximately a pound , comprised sixty shekels ( or a hundred Athenian drachmas ) , and sixty minas made a talent . A talent of silver and one of gold possessed different values , but the weight was the same . This system the Greeks derived from Asia Minor and Phoenicia . Their borrowing of the names , as well as the close correspondence of the actual weight of the units , evidences their origin in Babylonia or adjacent Arama a . The duodecimal method of reckoning was carried west , became deeply ingrained during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages to modern times . It would be going too far to say that every division of units of measure into twelve parts can be traced directly to Babylonia . Now and then new standards were arbitrarily fixed and new names given them . But even when this occurred , the old habit of reckoning by twelves for which the Babylonians were responsible , was likely to reassert itself in competition with the decimal system . Modern coinage systems have become prevailingly decimal , but it is only a short time ago that in south Germany GO kreuzer still made a gulden ; and the twelve pence of the English shilling obviously suggest themselves . Certain of these metric units became fixed more than two thousand years ago and have descended to us by an unbroken tradition . The Babylonian degrees , minutes , and seconds , for // instance , became an integral part of the ancient astronomy , were taken up by the Greeks , incorporated by them in their development of the system of astronomy known as the Ptolemaic , and thus became a part of Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few centuries ago , beginning with the introduction of the Copernican point of view , astronomy launched forward into a new period of progress , the old system of reckoning was so deeply rooted that it was continued without protest . Had the first truly scientific beginnings of astronomy taken place as late as those of chemistry , it is extremely doubtful whether we should now be reckoning 360 degrees in the circumference of the circle . The decimal system would almost certainly have been applied . The last few examples may give the impression that cultural diffusion takes place largely in regard to names and numbers . They may arouse the suspicion that the intrinsic elements of inventions and accomplishments are less readily spread . This is not the case . In fact it has happened time and again in the history of civilization that the substance of an art or a knowledge has passed from one people to another , while an entirely new designation for the acquisition has been coined by the receiving people . The English names of the seven days of the week ( ? 125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been laid here on names and numbers , it is not because they are more inclined to diffusion , or most important , but because their diffusion is more easily traced . They often provide an infallible index of historical connection when a deficiency of historical records would make it difficult , perhaps impossible , to prove that the common possession of the thing itself went back to a single source . If historical records are silent , as they are only too often , on the origin of a device among a people , the occurrence of the same device at an earlier time among another people may strongly suggest that it was transmitted from these . But the indication is far from constituting a proof because of the theoretical possibility that the later nation might have made the invention independently . It is chiefly when the device is complex and the relation of its parts identical that the probability of diffusion approaches surety . If however not only the thing but its name also are shared by distinct nations , doubt is re- // moved . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time in a thousand in using the same name for the same idea independently of each other . The play of accident is thus precluded in such cases and a connection by transmission is established . In fact the name is the better touchstone . An invention may be borrowed and be given a home-made name . But a foreign name would scarcely be adopted without the object being also accepted . 97 . DIVINATION One other Babylonian invention may be cited on account of its curious history . This is the pseudo-science of predicting the outcome of events by examination of the liver of animals sacrificed to the gods . A system of such divination , known as hepatoscopy , was worked out by the Babylonian priests perhaps by 2,000 B.C. Their rules are known from the discovery of ancient clay models of the liver with its several lobes , each part being inscribed with its significance according as it might bear such and such appearance . In some way which is not yet wholly understood , this system was carried , like the true arch , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions which brought the Etruscans into Italy from Asia , the gap is however lessened . The Etruscans , who were evidently addicted to priestly magic , carried on this liver divination alongside another method , that of haruspicy or foretelling from the flight or actions of birds . Both systems were learned from them by the Romans , according to Roman tradition itself . With the spread of Christianity , hepatoscopy and haruspicy died out in the west . But meanwhile they had been carried in the opposite direction from their Babylonian source of origin , and became established in eastern Asia and finally , in somewhat modified form , among remote uncivilized peoples . The pagan priests of Borneo and the Philippines even to-day are foretelling the future by observing the flight of birds and examining the gall bladder ? an organ intimately associated with the liver ? of sacrificial animals . If these primitive Malaysian peoples had always remained uninfluenced by higher cultures , their divinatory customs might be imputed to independent invention . They // live , however , at no great distance from the Asiatic mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural influences from China , Arabia , and especially India . Four centuries ago , to cite only a few specific instances , the Philippine chieftains went under the title of rajah , the Hindu word for king . In the southern Philippine islands there are " sultans " to-day . In all parts of the Philippines as well as Borneo , even among the rude tribes of the interior mountains , Chinese jars imported centuries ago are treasured as precious heirlooms . With these streams of higher culture flowing into the Malaysian islands , the only reasonable conclusion is that the arts of liver and bird divination were also imported . In fact , it seems probable that the broader custom of sacrificing animals to the gods and spirits , a custom to which the pagan Malaysians still adhere , is a part of the same wave of influence from the Orient which has so deeply stamped the Homeric poems and the Old Testament . Although theoretically it is not surprising that hepatoscopy and haruspicy still flourish among some backward and marginally situated peoples , yet , in the concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an institution which was active in Babylonia three or four thousand years ago should still maintain an unbroken life in Borneo . Evidently the diffusion principle reaches far and long . Another method of foretelling , which has spread equally far , although its flow has been mainly from the east westward , is scapulimancy , divination from the cracks that develop in scorched shoulder blades . This seems to have originated in ancient China with the heating of tortoise shells ; had spread by the third century after Christ to Japan , where deer shoulder blades were employed ; and is found to-day among the Koryak and Chukchi of northeasternmost Siberia , who utilize the same bones from seals and reindeer respectively . Elsewhere domestic animals , above all the sheep , furnish the proper shoulder blade . All the central Asiatic nations as far south as the Tibetans and Lolos are addicted to the custom , which had official status with the Mongol rulers in the thirteenth century , but must have been older , since it was in vogue among the Byzantine Greeks two hundred years earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flourished in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen- // furies and still lingers among belated rural populations ; to Morocco and perhaps other parts of north Africa ; and in Asia to South Arabia , Afghanistan , and westernmost India . Scapulimancy was not known to the ancient Babylonians , Egyptians , Hebrews , Greeks , Etruscans , and Romans ; it seems not to have penetrated far into India and not at all into the countries and islands to the east of India , which are sheepless regions ; and it did not obtain a foothold in North America , where sheep and of her tame animals were also not kept . It appears therefore that the custom , after a period of somewhat wavering formation in eastern Asia , crystallized into an association with the domesticated sheep , forming a true culture " complex , " and was then diffused almost as far as this animal . 98 . TOBACCO The speed with which inventions sometimes diffuse over large areas is in marked contrast to the slowness with which they travel on other occasions . The art or habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indigenous . From this middle region the custom spread , like agriculture , pottery , and weaving , in both directions over most of north and south America . Originally , it would seem , a tobacco leaf was either rolled on itself to form a rude cigar , or was stuffed , cigarette fashion , into a reed or piece of cane . Columbus found the West Indians puffing at cigars . In the Southwestern United States , the natives smoked from hollow reeds . Farther into the United States , both to the east and west , the reed had become a manufactured tube of wood or stone or pottery . This tubular pipe , something like a magnified cigarette holder , has the bowl enlarged at one end to receive the tobacco . It has to be held more or less vertically . This form has survived to the present day among the California Indians . As the tubular pipe spread into the central and eastern United States , it was elaborated . The bowl was made to rise from the top of the pipe , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the pipe had now no longer to be pointed skyward to be smoked . Here then was a pipe with a definite bowl ; but its derivation from the straight tubular pipe is shown by the fact that the bowl was // most frequently set not at the end of the stem , as we " automatically " think a pipe should be , but near its middle . The bowl evidently represented a secondary addition which there seemed no more reason to place at the end than in the middle of the pipe ; and the latter happened to become the fashion . All this evolution took place at least a thousand years ago , probably much longer . Elaborate stone pipes have been discovered in the earthworks left by the Mound Builders of the Ohio Valley , a people whose very existence had been forgotten when the whites first came . Californian stone pipes occur well down toward the bottom of shell mounds estimated to have required three or four thousand years to accumulate . Here and there this slow diffusion suffered checks . In the Andean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a plant whose leaf was chewed . The effect of the contained alkaloid is to prevent fatigue and hunger . Of the two , coca triumphed over tobacco , possibly because its action is more drug-like . In North America , on the other hand , tribes that had not adopted maize and bean agriculture , sometimes tilled tobacco patches . With them , tobacco cultivation had outstripped the spread of so important an institution as food agriculture . In the extreme parts of North America , climatic factors checked the growth of tobacco , either wild or cultivated . Where the supply was scarce , it was either diluted with pulverized tree bark , as by many tribes of the central United States , or it was eaten , as by a number of groups on the Pacific coast . To these latter , tobacco seemed too precious to set fire to and lightly puff away . They mixed it with lime from burnt shells and swallowed it . Taken in this form , a small quantity produces a powerful effect . In the farthest north of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The development of intertribal trade was too slender and intermittent for anything but valuables , let alone an article of daily consumption , to be transported over long distances . The result was that the Eskimo , when first discovered , knew nothing of tobacco or pipes . The use of tobacco was quickly carried to the Old World by the Spaniards , and before long all Europe was smoking . Throughout that continent , irrespective of language , the plant is known by modifications of the Spanish name tabaco , which in // turn seems based on a native American name for cigar . By the Spaniards and Portuguese , and later also by the Arabs , the habit of smoking was carried to various points on the shores of Africa , Asia , and the East Indies . Thence it spread inland . Native African tribes , and others in New Guinea , who had never seen a white man , have been found not only growing and smoking tobacco , but firmly believing that their ancestors from time immemorial had done so . This is a characteristic illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral tradition . In northeastern Siberia , where the Russians introduced tobacco , a special form of pipe came into use . It has a narrow bowl flaring at the top . Seen from above , this bowl looks like a disk with a rather small hole in the center . In profile it is almost like a capital T. It is set on the end of the pipe-stem . This stem may be straight or flattened and curved . This form of pipe , along with tobacco as a trade article , crossed Behring Strait and was taken up by the Alaska Eskimo . That this pipe is not of Eskimo origin is shown by its close resemblance to the Chukchi pipe of Siberia . The fact that it is impossible for the Eskimo to grow tobacco corroborates the late introduction , as does the Alaska Eskimo name : tawak . In short , smoking reached the Eskimo only after having made the round of the globe . Originating in Middle America , the custom spread very anciently to its farthest native limits without being able to penetrate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , the custom started on a fresh career of travel and rolled rapidly eastward about the globe until it reentered America in the hitherto non-smoking region of Alaska . A second invasion of America by a non-American form of pipe occurred in the eastern United States . The old pipe of this region , as already stated , had its bowl set well back from the end of the stem . The whole object thus had nearly the shape of an inverted capital T , whereas the European pipe might be compared to an L laid on its back . After the English settlers had become established on the Atlantic coast , a tomahawk pipe was introduced by them for trade purposes . This was a metal hatchet with the butt of the blade hollowed out into a bowl which connected with a bore running through the handle . One // end of the blade served to chop , the other to smoke . The hatchet handle was also the pipe stem . The combination implement could be used as a weapon in war and as a symbol of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the Indian . The heads of these iron tomahawk pipes were made in England for the Indian trade . They became so popular that those natives who were out of reach of established traders , or who were too poor to buy the metal hatchet-pipes , began to imitate them in the stone which their forefathers had used . In the Missouri valley , a generation ago , among tribes like the Sioux and the Blackfeet , imitation tomahawk pipes , which would never have withstood usage as hatchets , were being made of red catlinite together with the standard , native , inverted-T pipes . One of the two coexisting forms represented a form indigenous to the region since a thousand years or more , the other an innovation developed in Europe as the result of the discovery of America and then reintroduced among the aborigines . Diffusion sometimes follows unexpectedly winding routes . 99 . MIGRATIONS It may seem strange that with all the reference to diffusion in the foregoing pages , there has been so little mention of migration . The reason is that migrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture spread . They form the crass instances of the process , easily conceived by a simple mind . That a custom travels as a people travels with it , is something that a child can understand . The danger is in stopping thought there and invoking a national migration for every important culture diffusion , whereas it is plain that most culture changes have occurred through subtler and more gradual operations . The Mongols overran vast areas of Asia and Europe without seriously modifying the civilization of those tracts . The accretions that most influenced them , such as writing and Buddhism , came to them by the quieter and more pervasive process of peaceful penetration , in which but few individuals were active . We are all aware that printing and the steam engine , the doctrine of evolution and the habit of riming verses , have spread through western civilization without conquests or migrations , // and that each year 's fashions flow out from Paris in the same way . When however it is a question of something remote , like the origin of Chinese civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the early forms of Chinese culture bear certain resemblances to the early culture of Mesopotamia , and we are sure to have some one producing a theory that marches the Chinese out of the west with their culture packed away in little bundles on their backs . That is far more picturesque , of course , more appealing to the emotions , than to conceive of a slow , gradual transfusion stretching over a thousand years . In proportion as the known facts are few , imagination soars unchecked . It is not because migrations of large bodies of men are rare or wholly negligible in their influence on civilization that they have been touched so lightly here , but because we all tend , through the romantic and sensationalistic streak in us , to think more largely in terms of them than the sober truth warrants . It is in culture-history as in geology : the occasional eruptions , quakings , and other cataclysms stir the mind , but the work of change is mainly accomplished by quieter processes , going on unceasingly , and often almost imperceptible until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations. ? 101 .

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS The principle of truly independent or convergent invention is more difficult to establish by positive examples than imitative diffusion . It has often been assumed as operative , more rarely proved ; and even in the latter eases has perhaps never been found to lead to complete identity . In fact , the first observation to be made is that resemblance must not be too close if independent development is to be the explanation . A complex device used in two or more parts of the world suggests a connection between them in very proportion to its complexity . A combination of two or even three elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or ten parts serving an identical purpose in an identical manner must necessarily appeal as impossible of having been hit upon more than once . One thinks almost under compulsion , in such a case , of historical connection , of a transference of the idea or machine from one people to the other . If the resemblance includes any inessential or arbitrary parts , such as an ornament , a proportion that so far as utility is concerned might be considerably varied but is not , a randomly chosen number , or a name , the possibility of independent development is wholly ruled out . Such extrinsic features would not recur together once in a million times . Their association forces a presumption of common origin , even though it be difficult to account for the historical connection involved . The significance of names in this situation has already been commented on . 216 // There is nothing arbitrary about this limitation on the parallelistic principle . We all apply similar checks in practical life . If in a court of law several witnesses testify to the same facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or diminishing an item , if they follow the identical order of events , if even details such as the precise minute of an occurrence are stated without variation , judge and jury will infallibly suspect that the several testimonies go back to a single source of inspiration . Eyewitnesses will differ . They have seen from different angles ; have followed events with attention that varied according to their participation and their previous habits and training ; have reacted with individually colored emotion . So with nations . Their customs , interests , faculties are never wholly alike . Their independent inventions and innovations , always springing out of a distinctive soil , therefore necessarily take on a distinctive aspect even when they embody the same idea . In the degree that the form as well as the substance of culture traits coincide , does the probability of independent evolution diminish in favor of some sort of connection . 101 . CULTURAL CONTEXT The presence or absence of other connections is also a factor of greatest importance In other words , no fact relating to human civilization may be judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are known connections , either in space or in time , between two nations , the likelihood of their having separately evolved a common trait is much less than as between two peoples in different continents or separated by thousands of years . It is not known precisely how knowledge of the true arch and of liver divination were carried from ancient western Asia to the Etruscans of Italy . Yet the fact that Babylonia and Etruria shared two such specific culture traits as these , greatly increases the probability for each one having been borrowed from the Asiatic by the European people . When the consideration is added that the ancients had traditions ( f the Etruscans having come to Italy out of Asia Minor , the likelihood of diffusion is strengthened to the point of practical certainty . // Connection in space is a particularly cogent argument in favor of diffusion , because of its powerful presumption of accompanying communication . When several hundred Indian tribes without a break in their ranks between Quebec and Argentina cultivate maize , it would be absurd to dream of each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure , it is logically conceivable that maize agriculture was independently developed by two or three of the most advanced tribes of the hundreds and then became diffused until the two or three areas of dispersion met and coalesced into one greater area . Yet the principle that economy of explanation is the best would militate even against this interpretation as compared with diffusion from a single center , unless there were definite indications in favor of the multiple origin explanation . Such indications might be radically distinct types of the plant or of agricultural implements in several parts of the maize area . So , when the tribes on the Alaskan and Siberian sides of Behring Sea relate similar Raven legends , the geographical proximity is so close that it would be pedantic to let the fact that two continents are involved stand in the way of an explanation by diffusion . Even where the distribution of a trait penetrates much farther into both America and Asia , as is true of the composite bow ( ? 210 ) , the continuity of area leaves little doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is reinforced by other traits showing the same intercontinental distribution : the Magic Flight story , for instance . It is only when the areas are discrete as well as remote , when other similarities between them are few or absent , when their cultural backgrounds are radically dissimilar , as in the case of the couvade , that parallelism begins to knock at the door of interpretation with serious hope of admittance . 102 . UNIVERSAL ELEMENTS When a culture trait is very ancient and of practically worldwide occurrence , it becomes difficult to estimate between diffusion and independent invention . The fire-drill , flint chipping , the bow and arrow , the doctrine of animism or belief in souls // and spirits , sympathetic magic , are in this class . The very universality of these elements tends to obliterate tangible evidence as to their histories . A generation or two ago it was generally taken for granted that such devices and beliefs as these sprang more or less spontaneously out of the human mind as soon as man had traversed a certain short distance of the evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , anthropological opinion is more cautious about such assumptions . It is perhaps spontaneous enough for people in the habit of using tools to try to fashion them from stone if other materials be lacking , and easy for a nation accustomed to projectile weapons to invent the bow without ever having learned of it . But this is far from proving what a people without these habits might do . Intelligent as an ape is , and gifted with manual dexterity , it rarely enters his mind to throw a stone as a missile and never to split it into a knife or weapon . For all we know , it may have cost our ancestors untold mental energy to bring themselves to the point of fashioning their first stone implements ; so much , indeed , that it is possible all of them did without until one more gifted or fortunate group made the difficult invention which was then imitated by the others . It is temptingly but fatally easy to project our habits of mind into primitive man ? much easier to imagine ourselves in his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was . Animal psychologists have learned not to anthropomorphize , that is , endow the lower animals with specifically human mind processes . Anthropologists have learned to guard against the similar pitfall of interpreting low cultures by the standards of our own , of assuming that because a thing seems " natural " to us it must have seemed natural and therefore have been done by any savage . It is clear that what did not happen was for every tribe or race to originate for itself its fire-making , flint-chipping , bows , animism , and magic . It is conceivable that each of these culture products traces back to a single source in human history . There are authorities who have held this very opinion ; some expressedly , others by implication . It is not necessary to go so far ; in fact , wiser not to , because none of these matters is yet susceptible of real proof . But it does seem profitable to recognize the possibility of the truth of such views , and that the drift of accu- // mulating knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has too often been neglected is that diffusion and imitation undisputedly do take place in culture on a vast scale . So far as independent developments occur , be that rarely or frequently , they are therefore sure to be more or less intertwined with disseminations . Even one particular device may be partly borrowed and partly modified or further developed by original effort . Still more intimate must be the combination of native and diffused elements in the whole culture of any people . To wage an abstract battle as between two opposite principles is sterile , when their manifestations are admittedly frequent for one and at least certain for the other . It is clearly more profitable to examine the associations and relations of diffusion and convergence , the conditions under which they supplement each other . Besides parallels springing up wholly independently , there are two ways in which their relations to diffusion may be conceived . An original single growth or wave of diffusion may differentiate into local or temporal modifications , which even after separation continue to develop along parallel lines or reconverge . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction may become merged in , or assimilated by , a subsequent diffusion. 103 . SECONDARY PARALLELISM IN THE INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGES Parallel growth secondary to a former unity and differentiation is illustrated by the Indo-European languages . All the known ancient forms of this speech family , Sanskrit , Avestan , Greek , Latin , Gothic , were highly inflecting and compounding . Their tendency was synthetic ( ? 51 , 57 ) . Grammatical ideas such as voice , tense , number , case , were expressed by elements affixed to the word stem and incapable of a separate existence . For they will have loved Latin says ama-v-eri-nt . The - v-  has the force of have , the - eri-  of will , - nt of they ; but none of these parts can be used alone , as their equivalents in English can be , or as in French ils auront aime . The two latter languages are analytical . They break an idea // into parts which they express by separate words that change form but little . They retain only fragments of conjugations and declensions . Sanskrit had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , the subjective-objective and the possessive , and French only one , or rather no case-form at all . This development toward a more analytical form is not only traceable in several non-Indo-European speech families , such as Chinese and Malayo-Polynesian ( ? 61 ) , but has gone on in all the branches of Indo-European . It is visible in the growth of English from Anglo-Saxon ; of French , Spanish , and Italian from Latin ; of modern from ancient Persian ; of Hindi and Bengali from Sanskrit . True , some of these have been in contact , like the Germanic and Latin languages , and might therefore be imagined to have set one another an example , although there is little evidence that languages seriously influence each other 's forms . But many of the Indo-European idioms have not been in contact at all for thousands of years . The Germanic and the Indo-Iranic branches , for instance , must have separated at least four thousand years ago . For the greater part of this period , accordingly , the related but no longer communicating languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take only one instance , have independently driven toward the same goal of more and more analytical structure . It may well be that the hidden germ of this impulse lay implanted in the common Indo-European mother-tongue at the time of its differentiation five or more thousand years ago . But the movement of its daughters has certainly been an astoundingly parallel one . 104 . TEXTILE PATTERNS AND PROCESSES An analogous situation is provided by the similarity of diamond shaped patterns woven in twilled baskets in parts of North and South America , Asia and the East Indies , and Africa . This looks like parallelism and is parallelism . But it is clearly a secondary result of the twilling process , as this , in turn , flour- // ishes most vigorously where woody monocotyledenous plants ? cane , bamboo , palms ? are available to furnish hard , durable , flat , pliable splints . The technique of the weave is such that if materials of two colors are used , the characteristic patterns evolve themselves almost of necessity . The twilling process may have been invented independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been devised only once in the world 's history . It is too simple and too ancient a technique for modern knowledge to choose between the alternatives with positiveness . Brazilian and East Indian patterns are much more likely to have been each developed on the spot , as derivatives from the more fundamental and possibly transmitted twilling process . The coiling technique for making baskets looks from its distribution in Africa and about the Mediterranean , in northeast Asia and northwest America , in the southern extremity of South America , in Malaysia and Australia , as if it had originated independently several times , and there is partial confirmation in the fact that different varieties of coiling are typical of most of the areas . If however further knowledge should connect the now separate areas of coiling , the art would then have to be regarded as probably due to diffusion from a single invention . In that ease , however , special varieties , such as half-hitch coiling in Tierra del Fuego and Tasmania , and single-rod coiling in the East Indies and California , would remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the generic process . A blending of diffusion and parallelism is apparent also in other textile processes . The fundamentals , as embodied in simple woven basketry , mats , and wiers , were probably carried into America by the first immigrants . Weaving from suspended warps and in an incomplete loom frame may possibly have been similarly transmitted by diffusion or have been developed locally . Thread spinning , however , the complete loom , and the heddle were clearly devised in the middle region of America independently of their invention in the Old World , as is evident from their absence in the connecting areas of North America and Siberia ( ? 187 , 188 ) . But the treadle shed , the next step in the Eastern hemisphere , was never invented in the Western , so that at this point the parallelism ends . // Again , diffusion and convergence both enter into the history of what is known as resist dyeing , that is , the covering of portions of textile patterns before immersion into the dye . Batik , when wax is used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another method is " to tie little bunches of cloth with a cord either soaked in clay or wax or spun from fiber which has no affinity for the colors and then dip the tied web into the pot . " In the Old World , tie dyeing is of Asiatic , probably of Indian origin , and was in use by the seventh century , perhaps earlier . The Mohammedan conquests carried the art to Malaysia on the one hand , to western Africa and Spain on the other , whence it was transmitted to the Indians of Guatemala after their subjugation by the Spaniards ? like the doubleheaded eagle . The Peruvians , however , had long before hit upon the same art , as attested by textile remains in pre-Columbian graves . Here then , we have a wide and long enduring diffusion of the general resist dyeing process , and a locally limited instance of independent parallelism for one phase of it . 105 . PRIMARY PARALLELISM : THE BEGINNINGS OF WRITING Primary parallelism can be established fairly frequently , but usually only with reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of their original separateness . An illustration is furnished by the history of writing , as sketched in the introductory paragraphs of the chapter on the Alphabet ( ? 130-133 ) . Many nations have entered the simple stage of pictography . Only a few are known to have gone on to the stage of rebus or transitional writing ? mixed pictograms or ideograms and phonograms . Of these , certainly two and . possibly as many as four , five , or six devised their own rebus Systems : the Egyptians , Sumerians , Chinese , Hittites , Cretans , mud Mayas , in four continents . But here the parallel ceases . The content of the systems , the signs themselves and their sound values , are wholly different . The similarity applies only to the principle of reading pictures or symbols for their pic'tirelc ss homonyms . The concrete application of this method has twilling in common in the several parallel cases . Finally , corn- // plete phonetic writing was invented but once , all alphabets , however diverse , being historical descendants of the primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous diffusion ( ? 134-149 ) . It is worth noting , however , that the first or pictographic stage of writing is by no means a thing that flows instinctively from all men . There are peoples , like some of the Indians of Brazil and California , deficient in the ability or habit , according as one may wish to term it , of expressing themselves in linear representations . They do not draw rude outlines to depict objects . Asked to do so , they profess inability , though set an example , or make a pathetically crude attempt . Their failure or refusal does not argue inherent lack of faculty , since the children of the same races , when put to school , draw figures with interest and often with success . The attitude of the adults is rather that of a person who had never heard even a snatch of music of any kind or seen an instrument , being taken to a concert and then asked to compose a simple little song . He would look upon this task as transcendently beyond his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pictureless ones . Consequently picture-writing is not the spontaneous product which we , who as children are reared in an environment of pictures , might imagine it to be . If pictography were due to a primary parallelism , to a spontaneous outflow of the human mind , its absences would be in need of explanation . If , on the other hand , it is the result of a single diffusing development , this must have an antiquity of more than fifteen thousand years , as attested by the Old Stone Age paintings , and the failure of certain peoples to be affected is also in need of explanation . Another case of parallelism is the recurring tendency to write syllabically instead of alphabetically . The Hindu inclination in this direction is discussed below ( ? 146 ) . That the phonetic symbols of rebus systems should be largely syllabic is small wonder , for they are pictures of things named with whole words . But the Hindu script was derived from a Semitic letter alphabet , and its essentially syllabic nature thus represents a reversion . The Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to express grammatical elements , // proper names , and the like in their speech , denoted a syllable by each character . A third as many consonant and vowel signs would have answered the same purpose . When Sequoya the Cherokee devised an alphabet for his people in order to equate them with the whites , he incorporated the forms of a number of the English letters , but the values of all his signs were syllabic . The same holds of the West African Vei writing invented in the nineteenth century by a native . IIe had had enough mission schooling to be stimulated by the idea of writing , but " instinctively " fell back on syllable signs even though this necessitated two hundred different characters . There is an evident psychological reason for the uniformity of these endeavors : we image words , in fact produce them , in syllables , not in sounds . Any one , in slow speech , tends to syllabify , whereas few wholly illiterate people can be induced without patient training to utter the separate consonants and vowels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner . This case of parallelism rests , therefore , on a psychological fact of apperception . But it was the " accidents " of culture , not innate psychology , that determined the particular symbols , and their values , chosen by the Hindus , Japanese , Cherokee , and Vei , with the result that in these symbols there is no specific similarity . 106 . TIME RECKONING Still another case of primary parallelism is provided by the Maya-Aztec system of time denotation by coupling two series of symbols in an overlapping system of permutations , as described below ( ? 197 ) . This is as if we denoted the successive days of the year 1 January , 2 February , 3 March , and so on , until , having come to 12 December we went on 13 January , 14 February , and so once more around until 31 July was reached , when the next days would be 1 August and 2 September instead of February 1 and 2 . Cumbersome and strange as this system appears , an exact parallel to it in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four hours of the day with the seven planets in a 168-hour cycle which gave the order and names to the days of the // week ( ? 124 ) . A third case occurs in China where ten " celestial stems " and twelve " terrestrial branches " were permutated to form a sixty year chronological cycle . ' All three of these devices are based on the same mathematical principle and serve the same end of time reckoning . But their content and result is different . The Greeks combined 24 with 7 , the Chinese 12 with 10 , the Mayas 13 with 20 and 260 with 365 ; and the periods treated ranged from hours to years . These cases of primary parallelism allow the inference that there are certain inherent tendencies of the human mind in certain directions , such as operation in rebus reading , syllabic writing , reckoning by least common multiples . Here , then , is a seeming approach for a definite psychological interpretation of the history of civilization . Yet the results of such a method of attack must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances is indeed uniform enough to permit the conclusion that it springs from a uniform impulse or bent of the mind . But all the particular , concrete content of these cultural manifestations is as diverse as their historical origins are separate ; which means that psychology may explain what is phychological in the cases , but that a larger cultural constituent remains over before which the generically valid principles of psychology are ineffective as explanations . As in the case of the influence of physical environment it might be said that psychological factors provide the limiting conditions of cultural phenomena . 107 . SCALE AND PITCH OF PAN 'S PIPES A startling parallelism has been demonstrated between the Pan 's pipes of the Solomon islands in Melanesia and those of the northwest Brazilian Indians . The odd pipes differ , each from the next , by the interval of a fourth . The even pipes give notes half-way in pitch between the adjacent odd ones , and thus form another " circle of fourths . " But the similarity does not end here . The absolute pitch of the examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vibration rates in successive pipes are 557 and 560.5 ; 651 and 651 ; 759 and 749 ; .. // 880 and 879 ! This is so close a coincidence as to seem at first sight beyond the bounds of accidental convergence . The data have in fact been offered , and in some quarters accepted , as evidence of a historical connection between the western Pacific and South America . Yet the connection would have had to be ancient , since no memory of it remains nor is it supported by resemblances in race , speech , nor anything obvious in culture . The instruments are perishable . Primitive people , working by rule of thumb , would be unable to produce an instrument of given absolute pitch except by matching it against another , and perhaps not then . Moreover , it is not known that absolute pitch is of the least concern to them . It is therefore incredible that this correspondence rests on any ancient diffusion : there must be an error in the record somewhere , or the one accident in a million has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale or intervals however remains , and may be a true case of parallelism . Only , as usual , it boils down to a rather simple matter . The circles- of fourths evidently originate in the practice , in both regions , of overblowing the pipes . This produces over-tones ; of which the second , the " third partial tone , " is the fifth above the octave of the fundamental , so that successive notes in either the odd or even series of pipes , would , on the octave being disallowed , differ by fourths . The basis of the resemblance , then , is a physical law of sound . The cultural similarity shrinks to the facts of pipes in series , the use overblown tones , and the intercalating odd-even series . Even e resemblances are striking , and more specific than many ted cases of parallelism . In fact , were they supported by ugh resemblances in other aspects of culture , they would go to compel belief in actual connections between Melanesia hid Brazil . 108 . BRONZE A striking ease of independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is copper alloyed with five to twenty cent of tin . The metals form a compound with properties ' , rent from those of the two constituents . Tin is a soft metal , bronze is harder than copper , and therefore superior for // tools . Also , it melts at a lower temperature and expands in solidifying from the molten condition , and thus is better material for castings . In the eastern hemisphere bronze was discovered early and used widely . For nearly two thousand years it was the metal par excellence of the more advanced nations . A Bronze Age , beginning about 4,000 B.C. , more or less simultaneously with the first phonetic writing , is recognized as one of the great divisions of cultural time ( ? 66 , 225 ) . In the western hemisphere bronze was apparently invented later than in the eastern and spread less extensively . It was discovered in or near the Bolivian highland , which is rich in tin ( ? 196 ) . From there its use diffused to the Peruvian highland , then to the coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by maritime contacts , to Mexico , where local deposits of tin were probably made use of after their value was realized . Theoretically , it might be queried whether knowledge of bronze had possibly been carried to the Andes from the eastern hemisphere by some now forgotten migration or culture transmission . Against such a supposition there stands out first of all the isolated and restricted distribution of the South American bronze art . It is ten thousand miles by land from the metalworking nations of Asia to the middle Andes . A people or culture wave that had traveled so far could not but have left traces of its course by the way . The utilitarian superiority of bronze over stone tools is so great that no people that had once learned the art would be likely to give it up . Even if here and there a group of tribes had retrograded , it can not be imagined that all the nations between China and Peru could have slipped back so decisively . Certainly peoples like the Mayas and Chibchas , expert metallurgists , would never have abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its course and washed on a South American shore might be invoked . But the original South American bronze culture occupies an inland mountain area . Further , while Asiatic ships have repeatedly been wrecked on the Pacific coast of North America and probably at times also on that of South America , there is everything to indicate that the civilizational effects of such accidents were // practically nil . The highest cultures of Mexico and South America were evolved in interior mountain valleys or plateaus . Not one of the great accomplishments of the American race ? architecture , sculpture , mathematics , metallurgy ? shows any specific localization on the shore of the Pacific . Further , it is hard to understand how the arrival of a handful of helpless strangers could initiate an enduring culture growth . It is easy enough for us , looking backward through the vista of history , to fancy the lonely Indians standing on the shore to welcome the strangers from the west , and then going with docility to school to learn their superior accomplishments . Actually , however , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations are instinctively imbued with a feeling of superiority . They look down upon the foreigner . Even where they admit his skill in this matter or that , they envy rather than admire him . Thus , there is historic record of Oriental and European vessels being wrecked on the Pacific coast of North America , during the last century and a half , among tribes that were still almost wholly aboriginal . In no case did the natives make any attempt to absorb the higher culture of the strangers . Generally these were enslaved or killed , their property rifled ; sometimes the wreck was set on fire . The greed for immediate gain of the treasures in sight proved stronger than any dim impulses toward self-improvement by learning . As one conservative author has put it , occasional visits of Asiatics or Pacific islanders to the shores of America would be , from the point of view of the growth of the vast mass of culture In that continent , " mere incidents . " From the review given below , in Chapter XIII , it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first primitive start , ere internal ; and the case seems as clear for metal working for any phase . 109 . ZERO One of the milestones of civilization is the number symbol Pro . This renders possible the unambiguous designation of ambers of any size with a small stock of figures . It is the zero at enables the symbol 1 to have the varying values of one , ten , // hundred , or thousand . In our arithmetical notation , the symbol itself and its position both count : 1,234 and 4,321 have different values although they contain the identical symbols . Such a system is impossible without a sign for nothingness : 123 and 1,023 would be indistinguishable . Our zero , along with the other nine digits , appears to be an invention of the Hindus approximately twelve or fifteen hundred years ago . We call the notation " Arabic " because it was transmitted from India to Europe by the Arabs . FIG. 28 . Maya symbols for zero : a , monumental ; b , c , cursive . ( From Bowditch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods are open for the representation of higher numerical values . More and more signs can be added for the high values . This was done by the Greeks and Romans . MV means 1,005 , and only that . This is simple enough ; but 1,888 requires so cumbersome a denotation as MDCCCLXXXVIII ? thirteen figures of six different kinds . A simple system of multiplying numbers expressed like this one is impossible . The unwieldiness is due to the fact that the Romans , not having hit upon the device of representing nothingness , employed the separate signs I , X , C , M for the quantities which we represent by the single symbol 1 with from no to three zeroes added . The other method is that followed by the Chinese . Besides signs corresponding to our digits from 1 to 9 , they developed symbols corresponding to " ten times . " " hundred times , " and // so on . This was much as if we should use the asterisk , * , to denote tens , the dagger , f , for hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could then represent 1,888 by 1 1I 8 t 8 * 8 , and 1. , 005 by 1115 , without any risk of being misunderstood . But the writing of the numbers would in most cases require more figures , and mathematical operations would be more awkward . The only nation besides the Hindus to invent a zero sign and the representation of number values by positions of the basic symbols , were the Mayas of Yucatan . Some forms of their zero are shown in Figure 28 . This Maya development constitutes an indubitable parallel with the Hindu one . So far as the involved logical principle is concerned , the two inventions are identical . But again the concrete expressions of the principle are dissimilar . The Maya zero does not in the least have the form of our or the Hindus ' zero . Also , the Maya notation was vigesimal where ours is decimal . They worked with twenty fundamental digits instead of ten . Their " 100 " therefore stood for 400 , their " 1,000 " for 8,000 . ' Accordingly , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value was not 1,234 but 8,864 . Obviously there can be no question of a common origin for such a system and ours . They share an idea or a method , nothing more . As a matter of fact , these two notational systems , like all others , were preceded by numeral word counts . Our decimal word count is based on operations with the fingers , that of the Maya on operations with the fingers and toes . Twenty became their first higher unit because twenty finished a person . I t is interesting that of the two inventions of zero , the Maya one was the earlier . The arithmetical and calendrical system of which it formed part was developed and in use by the time of the birth of Christ . It may be older ; it certainly required time to develop . The Hindus may have possessed the prototypes of our numerals as early as the second century after Christ , but as yet without the zero , which was added during the sixth or according to some authorities not until the ninth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced that the ancient Americans derived their religion , zodiac , art , or writing from Asia . If the zero was their own product , why not the remainder of their progress also ? The // only recourse left the naive migrationist would be to turn the tables and explain Egyptian and Babylonian civilization as due to a Maya invasion from Yucatan. 110 . ExOGAMIC INSTITUTIONS In many parts of the world nations live under institutions by which they are divided into hereditary social units that are exogamous to one another . That is , all persons born in a unit must take spouses born in some other unit , fellow members of one 's unit being regarded as kinsmen . The units are generally described as clans , gentes , or sibs ; or , where there are only two , as moieties . In many cases the sibs or moieties are totemic ; named after , or in some way associated with , an animal , plant , or other distinctive object that serves as a badge or symbol of the group . Often the association finds expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is born into his social unit , can not change it , and can belong to one only , it follows that descent is unilateral . It is impossible for a man to be a member of both his father 's and his mother 's sib or totem ; custom has established everywhere a rigid choice between them . Some tribes follow descent from the mother or matrilinear reckoning , others are patrilinear.l Institutions of this type have a wide and irregular distribution . They are frequent in Australia , New Guinea , and Melanesia ; found in parts of the East Indies and southeastern Asia ; quite rare or stunted in the remainder of Asia and Polynesia ; fairly common in Africa , though they occur in scattered areas ; characteristic again of a large part of North America , but confined to a few districts of South America . At a rough guess , it might be said that about as many savage peoples , the world // over , possess totemic-exogamous clans or moieties as lack them . The patchiness on the map of exogamic institutions argues against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission emanating from a single source . Had such a diffusion occurred , it should have left its marks among the numerous intervening tribes that are sibless . Further , both in the eastern and FIG. 29 . Distribution of types of exogamic institutions in Australia : 3M , two classes , matrilinear ; 4M , four classes , matrilinear ; 4P , four classes , patrilinear ; 8P , eight classes , patrilinear ; black areas , no classes , patrilinear exogamic totems ; X , totems independent of classes ; ' , totems replace sub-classes ; Z , no organization ; 7 , uninhabited or unknown . ( After Thomas and Graebner. ) western hemispheres , the most primitive and backward tribes are , with fair regularity , sibless and non-totemic . If therefore a hypothetical totem-sib movement had encircled the planet , it could not have been at an extremely ancient date , else the primitive tribes would have been affected by it ; and since records go back five thousand years in parts of the Mediterranean area , the // movement , if relatively late , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . It is therefore probable that totem-sib institutions did not all emanate from one origin , but developed independently several times . The question then becomes , how often , and where ? The evidence for America has been reviewed in another connection ( ? 185 ) . It can be summarized in the statement that at least two of the three sib areas 1 of North America , and probably the two principal ones of South America , seem to have resulted from a single culture growth which perhaps centered at one time , although subsequently superseded , in the middle sector of the double continent . This movement may have had first a patrilinear and then a matrilinear phase , though at no great interval of time . The third North American area may have got its patrilinear sib institutions from the same source but probably developed its matrilinear ones locally as a subsequent growth . If so , this would be an instance of convergence on the same continent ? a rather rare phenomenon . For Australia , New Guinea , and Melanesia , the geographical proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole area . Patrilinear and matrilinear descent are both found in Australia as well as Melanesia . This fact has been interpreted as the result of an earlier patrilineal and a later matrilineal phase of diffusion . It is interesting that this conclusion parallels the tentative one independently arrived at for America , although in both hemispheres further analysis and distributional study must precede a positive verdict . In the principal other sib area , Africa , the reckoning is so prevailingly patrilineal , that the few cases of matrilineate can scarcely be looked upon as anything but secondary local modifications . As to whether the totemism and exogamy of Africa can be genetically connected with those of Australia-Melanesia , it is difficult to decide . The more conservative attitude would be to regard them as separate growths , although so many cultural similarities have been noted between western Africa and the area that stretches from Indo-China to Melanesia , as to // have raised suspicions of an actual connection ( ? 270 ) . Yet even if these indications were to be confirmed , thus sweeping most or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the distinctness of this from the parallel development of the New World would remain . It is significant that in the three successive continents of America , Oceania , and Africa the patrilinear and matrilinear phases of the sib type of society exist side by side , and that the same duality even holds for each of the separate areas in America . That is , the Northwest American sib area includes matrilinear as well as patrilinear tribes ; the Southwest area includes both ; and so on . A similar tendency toward geographical association is found in other phases of social structure : the clan and moiety , and again totemism and exogamy . The clan or multiple form of sib organization is logically distinct from the moiety or dual form . Under the plural system , a person , being of clan A , may marry at will into clans B , C , D , E , F. Three of his four grandparents would normally be ' of other clans than his own , but of which they were members , would vary in each individual case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A would have his maternal uncles of clan B ; the next , of clan C ; a third , perhaps of clan F ; according to the choices which their fathers had made of wives . Under the dual system , however , a member of moiety A may just as well be regarded as having a wife of moiety B prescribed or predestined for him as being forbidden an A wife . Two of his grandparents , say his father 's father and his mother 's mother , are inevitably of his own moiety , the two others of the opposite one . Every possible kinsman ? his maternal uncle , his cross cousin , his father-in-law , his wife 's brother-in-law , his daughter 's son ? has his moiety affiliation foreordained . Where descent is paternal , for instance , everybody knows that his future mother-in-law must be of his own moiety . Evidently the effect of this dual system on the relations between kinsfolk , on social usages , on the individual 's attitude of mind toward other individuals , should normally tend to be profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On theoretical grounds it might seem likely that the dual and multiple schemes // had nothing to do with each other , that they sprang from distinct psychological impulses . Yet such a belief would be ungrounded , as the facts of distribution promptly make clear . In every multiple sib area of any moment , moieties also occur , and vice versa . In the California-Southwest region , for instance , tribes like the Miwok are divided into moieties only , the Mohave and Hopi into clans only , the Tewa and Cahuilla into moieties subdivided into clans . So in the Eastern , the Plains , and the Northwest areas of North America , clan tribes and moiety tribes live side by side ; whereas as soon as these regions are left behind , there are vast districts ? much of Mexico , Texas , the Great Basin and Plateau , northern Canada and the Arctic coast ? whose inhabitants get along without either clans or moieties . So again in Melanesia and in Australia ( Fig. 29 ) , the two types of organization exist side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are void of both . Only Africa shows some development of multiple clan institutions but no moieties . In short , as soon as areas of some size are considered , they prove in the main to be of two kinds . Either they contain both clan tribes and moiety tribes , or they contain neither . That is , the clan institution and the moiety institution are correlated or associated in geography , as patrilinear and matrilinear descent are correlated , which indicates a community of origin for them . A similar relation exists between exogamic units , be they moieties or clans , and totemism . The first constitutes a scheme of society , a method of organization ; the second , a system of symbolism . Sibs are social facts , totems a naming device with magico-religious implications . There is no positive reason why they should be associated . They are not always associated . There are American tribes like the Navaho and Gros Ventre that live under unilateral and exogamic institutions without totems . Placenames or nicknames distinguish the groups . In Australia , the Arunta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the two are dissociated ; a person takes his group by descent , his totem wholly irrespective of this according to place of birth or conception . In Africa there are no less than six tribes or series of tribes in which exogamy and totemism are thus dissociated ; a person takes his totem from his // father , his exogamic unit from his mother , so that the two ordinarily do not coincide for parent and child . Exogamy and totemism , then , are theoretically separate factors . Yet since they are distinct , it is remarkable that in probably seven or eight tenths of all cases they coincide , and that in each of the continents or areas containing them they are found associated . If exogamy and totemism had grown out of separate roots , one could expect at least one considerable area somewhere in which one of them appeared without the other . But there is no such area . Wherever social exogamy appears among a larger group of nations , social totemism also crops out ; and vice versa . It must then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple and dual sibs , all show a strong tendency toward association with one another . In other words , their correlation is positive and strong . Even where they seem mutually exclusive in their very nature , like matrilinear and patrilinear reckoning , ways have been found by unconscious human ingenuity to make them coexist among one people , as when one reckoning is attached to the exogamy , the other to the totemism ; and still more often they occur among adjacent tribes . 111 . PARALLELS AND PSYCHOLOGY Such associations as these are common enough in the history of civilization . A number are touched upon elsewhere in this volume under the name of culture trait associations or complexes ( ? 97 , 149 ) . But usually such a complex or nexus consists of culture elements that have no necessary connection : Christianity and trousers , for instance . It is accident that first throws them together ; association ties them one to the other ; once the cluster is established by usage , its coherence tends to persist . But there is something arbitrary about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred Amerienn tribes that grow maize should also grow beans and squashes and nothing else ; but they do limit themselves to the three . The distinctive feature of the sib-complex is that it has an almost reasonable quality . Its elements , however separate or even op- // posite logically , do have a certain psychological affinity to one another . Also , the arbitrary maize-beans-squash complex and other complexes are generally not duplicated . But the intricate and psychologically founded totemism-exogamy-descent complex looks as if it might have been triplicated or quadruplicated . This parallelism , if the facts prove to substantiate it , is parallelism raised to a higher power than any yet considered . Heretofore the discussion has been of the parallelism of single culture traits . Here it is a case of parallelism of a complex of culture traits . Such complex convergence might suggest something peculiar to or inherent in the human mind , leading it , once it is stimulated to commence the development of one of the factors of the complex , to follow with the production of the other factors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be followed by town life , if it could be demonstrated , though this seems doubtful ; of settled living to be accompanied by migration legends ; of religions with personal founders to become propagandizing and international but in time to die out among the nations in which they were originated . In regard to all such cases it may be said first of all that an exhaustive analysis is necessary to ascertain whether the seeming association or correlation is borne out by the facts . Second ; the possibility of diffusion must be eliminated . If Melanesian and African totem-exogamy are both products of one culture growth , they can not be counted as two examples of the same association . If they should ultimately both prove to be linked with the American system by a wave of migration or culture contact , as has indeed been maintained in two separate hypotheses recently advanced , parallelism is of course disproved altogether . But such views are as yet undemonstrated and seem extreme ; and if , after continued search of the evidence , two or more such associations or complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growths , it is // evident that they will be something in the nature of cultural manifestations of psychological forces . In short , we should then he beginning to grasp specific psychological determinants for the phenomena or events of civilization . But as yet such a causal explanation of the data of anthropology by the mechanism of psychology has not been achieved . 112 . LIMITATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLE From the evidences reviewed in this and the last chapter , the conclusion is confirmed which social philosophers had long since reached , that imitation is the normal process by which men live , and that invention is rare , a thing which societies and individuals oppose with more resistance than they are ever aware of , and which probably occurs only as the result of the pressure of special circumstances , although these are as yet little understood . Not only are a hundred instances of diffusion historically traceable for every one of parallelism , but the latter is regularly limited in scope . Something tends to make us see phenomena more parallel than they actually are . They merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties of objects or nature , they bear resemblance at one point only ? and differ at all other points . Yet they tend to impress us , in Sonic mysterious way , as almost identical . The history of civilzation has no more produced two like cultures , or two separately developed identical culture traits , than has the evolution of organic life ever duplicated a species by convergently modify- two distinct forms . A whale may look fishlike , he is a animal . The Hindu and the Maya zero are logically the same ; tually they have in common nothing but their abstract value : fir shapes , their place in their systems , are different . The oat , frequent process of culture history therefore is one of tration or diffusion in time and space , corresponding roughly to re ( iitary transmission in the field of organic life . Inventions be thought of as similar to organic mutations , those " sponneotrs " variations that from time to time arise and establish themselves . The particular causes of both inventions and mutans remain as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same direction as another previously // arisen one . But , since they spring from different antecedents , such convergences never attain identity . They remain on the level of analogous resemblance . Substantial identity , a part for part correspondence , is invariably a sign of common origin , in cultural as well as organic history . CHAPTER X THE ARCH AND THE WEEK In exemplification of the principles discussed in the last two chapters , the next two are given over to a more detailed consideration of several typical ramifying growths whose history happens to be known with satisfactory fullness . These are the arch , the week , and the alphabet . 113 . HOUSE BUILDING AND ARCHITECTURE The history of human building makes a first impression of an endless tangle . Every people rears some sort of habitations , cad however rude these are , structural principles are involved . Obviously , too , geography and climate are bound to have at least a delimiting influence . The Eskimo of the Arctic can not build houses of wood ; the inhabitants of a coral reef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish , develop a style in brick . In structures not used as dwellings , their purpose necessarily affects their form . A temple is likely to be made on a different plan from a court of law . Temples themselves may Vary according to the motives and rituals of the religions which they serve . Bewilderment begins to abate as soon as one ceases trying to contemplate all buildings reared by human hands . Obviously a dwelling erected by a small family group for the utilitarian purpose of shelter is likely to be more subject to immediate 241 // adaptations to climate than a large communal structure serving some purpose such as the service of a deity . If consideration be restricted still further , to religious or public buildings set up with the idea of permanence , another class of causes making for variability begins to be eliminated . A structure intended as an enduring monument is reared with consideration to the impression that it will create in the minds of future generations . Its emotional potentialities , be these evoked by its mere size , by the esthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two , come into the forefront . Such permanent buildings being in stone or brick , techniques which flourish in wood or other temporary materials are eliminated . Finally , a monumental structure is possible only at the hands of a community of some size . An unstable group of nomads , a thinly scattered agricultural population , can not assemble in sufficient numbers even for periods each year , to carry out the long-continued labors that are necessary . The aggregation of numbers of men in one spot is always accompanied by specialization in advancement of the arts . Consequently the very fact that a structure is monumental involves the probability that its builders are able to rise above the limitations of mere necessity , and can in some degree execute products of their imagination . 114 . THE PROBLEM OF SPANNING If now our attention be confined to large buildings of the more massive and permanent sort , it becomes clear that one of the chief problems which all their constructors have had to grapple with , is that of roofing large spaces and spanning wide openings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall reared to a great height , without much other than quantitative difficulties being encountered . A four hundred foot pyramid does not differ in principle from the waist-high one that a child might pile up . The problems which it involves are essentially the economic and political ones of providing and controlling the needed multitudes of workers . Architecture as such is in abeyance and the engineering problems involved are mainly those of transporting and raising large blocks of stone . Much the same holds of walls . The Incas , for instance , reared // masonry of astounding massiveness and exactness without ever seriously attempting to solve architectural problems . Once , however , a structure is planned to cover a wide space , it becomes architecturally ambitious . The roof of a large dwelling can be made easily of poles and thatch by such collaborators as a family might muster . But to span a clear space of some size in stone requires more than numbers of workers . The accomplishment also yields definite sense of achievement which is strong in proportion as the extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mass of the structure is large and the clear space is small , but the Satisfying effect is correspondingly decreased . A vault whose walls are thicker than its interior is wide , produces as chief impression an effect of massiveness . One feels the solidity of the structure , the amount of labor that has gone into it ; but One is left without the sense of a worth-while difficulty having been self-imposed and mastered . Sooner or later , therefore , after men began to hold themselves available for co-operative nterprises in numbers , adventurous minds must have been red with a desire to grapple with problems of esthetic conStruction , and to leave behind them monuments of triumphant Solution . The story of these voluntary and imaginative endeavors is the history of monumental art . Two principal methods have been followed in the solution of the problem of covering large free spaces . The first is the thod of the column and the lintel ; the second that of the arch vault . The column and lintel do not differ fundamentally rn the idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are vertical support and horizontal beam . In e arch , however , this simple scheme is departed from , and the ering elements take on a curved or sloping form . The apently free float of the span is stimulatingly impressive , espely when executed in a heavy and thoroughly rigid material . beam is subject to bending stress . Timber makes a good material because of its strength against breakage by bending . Stone is unreliable or outrightly weak against a bending stress , besides adding to the stress by its own weight . There are therefore inherent limitations on the space that can be covered by horizontal stone beam . // 115 . THE COLUMN AND BEAM Most early architecture developed the column . Even so superb an architecture as that of the Greeks never rose above it . The aesthetic value of the Parthenon lies in the balance and feeling with which a fundamentally simple plan has been elaborated , not in the daring way in which an inherently ambitious problem has been met . On account of its essential simplicity , columnar architecture grew up among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , there can be distinguished an early stage of building in wood , when the column was the trunk of a tree , and a later stage in which the post was replaced by a monolith , or by superimposed drums of stone . This change appears to have taken place somewhat independently in Egypt and in Greece , and wholly so in Mexico . It has been thought that Greek architecture was derived from Egypt , but there was probably little more than a transmission of stimulus , since Greek temples were wooden pillared several thousand years after the Egyptians were rearing huge stone columns . Furthermore , if the Greeks had borrowed their column outright from Egypt , they would probably have copied it slavishly at the outset . Yet their early capitals are without the lotus flower head in which the Egyptian column terminated . Here , then , and still more in Mexico , there was parallel development . The failure of the Greeks to pass beyond column and lintel architecture may seem strange for a people that showed so unusual an artistic faculty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most departments of civilization . The cause appears to lie not in any internal arrest of their artistic evolution , but in the conditions that prevailed in another field of their culture : their political particularity . The Greek state remained a city . All attempts to establish larger political aggregates , whether on the basis of confederation or conquest , failed miserably and speedily . The Greek was ingrainedly addicted to an outlook that was not merely provincial but literally municipal . The result was that really large cooperative enterprises were beyond him . Paved roads , aqueducts , sewers , and works of a like character were scarcely attempted on any scale // of magnitude . With the rather small numbers of individuals which at best the Greeks assembled in one spot , such works were not necessary , and undertaken in mere ambition , they would have encountered public antagonism . Consequently Greek public buildings were , by the standards of many other nations , mediocre in size of ground plan , low in height , without endeavor to impress by sweep of clear space . This fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the culture of any people ; it illustrates also the importance of knowing the whole of a civilization before trying to provide an explanation for any one of its manifestations. 116 . THE CORBELLED ARCH The arch brings in an inherently new principle of architecture . It is a device for carrying construction over an empty apace without horizontal beams . But it may take two principal forms : the corbelled or " false " arch , and the " true " arch . Both are arches in form , but the blocks that form the curvature of one are not self-supporting ; in the other they are . The corbelled arch achieves its span through a successive projection of the stones or bricks that abut on each side of the open space . The stone at the end of the second course of masonry extends part of its length beyond the end stone of the first course . At the opposite side , the second course hangs similarly out above the first . In the third course , the end blocks again project beyond those of the second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or two staircases turned upside down . The higher the masonry rises , the more do the clear space narrow and the two lines of hanging steps approach until they meet and the arch is complete . What keeps the projecting Stones from toppling into the clear space ? Nothing , obviously , but such weight as is put on their inner or embedded ends . Suppose a stone projects a third of its length beyond the one below , so that its center of gravity is still above the lower stone . It will then lie as placed . Suppose still another stone again projects a third of its length beyond the second . Its center of gravity now falling outside the lowest block , it will topple both pelf and the second one . Only if other blocks are inserted // behind will their counterweight hold up the projecting blocks . Obviously , there will be more such counterweights needed the higher the side of the arch rises . In general , the area of wall needed as counterweight is at least as great as the area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontally ? hanging over five feet from each side ? there must be five feet or more of masonry built up on each side of the clear space . A corbelled arch forming a relatively small doorway in the face of a wall presents no difficulty , but a corbelled arch that stands free is impossible . The same principle holds for the vault , which is a threedimensional extension of the virtually two-dimensional arch . The hollow or half-barrel of the corbelled vault has to be flanked by a volume of building material exceeding its own content . This need eliminates corbelling as a possible method of rearing structures that rise free and with lightness . Hence the clumsy massiveness of , for instance , Maya architecture , which , so far as it employs the vault , often contains more building material than spanned space . Another difficulty , beyond that of counterweighting , which besets the user of the corbelled arch , is that the projecting stones of each course are subjected to the same bending strain as a beam . The weight above strives to snap them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently devised and have also diffused . They were employed in gigantic Bronze age tombs at Mycene in Greece ? the so-called treasure house of Atreus , ? in Portugal , and in Ireland ( Fig. 41 ) . These developments seem historically connected . On the other hand the Mayas of Yucatan also built corbelled arches , which must constitute a separate invention . This parallel development differs from that of the true arch , which seems everywhere to be derived from a single original source . 117 . THE TRUE ARCH The true arch differs from the corbelled in needing no counterweight . The blocks that form the under surface or soffit of its span are self-sustaining . The true arch thus yields an esthetic satisfaction which can be attained in no other way , // especially when it soars in magnitude . The fundamental principle of the true arch is the integration of its elements . Such an arch is nothing until completed ; but from that moment its constituents fuse their strength . Each block has a shape which is predetermined by the design of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even self-supporting , until all the others have been fitted with it . Hence the figure of speech as well as the reality of the keystone : the last block slipped into place , locking itself and all the others . The features of the blocks or " vouseoirs " which makes possible this integration , is the taper of their sides . Each is a gently sloping piece of wedge instead of a rectangular block . When bricks replace dressed stone , the Mortar takes the place of this shaping , being thinner toward the inner face of the vault and thicker toward the interior of the Construction . A true arch in process of erection would instantly collapse if not held up . It can be built only over a scaffold or " centering. " nee however the keystone has wedged its parts together , it not my stands by itself but will support an enormous weight . The niter the pressure from above , the more tightly are the blocks reed together . Instability in a true arch is not due to the nding stress coming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal roofing . The blocks are subjected to crushing pressure , which stone and brick are specially pled to withstand . The weakness of the arch is that it turns vertical into horizontal thrust . With more weight piled on top , sidewise thrust , the inclination to spread apart , becomes ter , and must be resisted by buttressing . This is what the Hindus mean when they say that " the arch never sleeps . " 118 . BABYLONIAN AND ETRUSCAN BEGINNINGS While the exact circumstances attending the invention of the true arch are not clear , the earliest specimens preserved are from the ancient brick-building peoples of Babylonia , especially at Nippur about 3,000 B.C. Thence the principle of the arch was carried to adjacent Assyria . Both these Mesopotamian peoples employed the arch chiefly on a small scale in roofing doors and in tunnels . It remained humble and utilitarian in their hands ; // its architectural possibilities were scarcely conceived . They continued to rear their monumental structures mainly with an eye to quantity : high and thick walls , ramps , towers ascending vertically or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are next found in Italy , among a prosperous city-dwelling people , the Etruscans , some seven or more centuries before Christ . All through the civilization of this nation runs a trait of successful but never really distinctive accomplishment . The Etruscans were receptive to new ideas and applied them with energy , usually only to degenerate them in the end . Whether they discovered the arch for themselves or whether knowledge of it was carried to Italy from Asia is not wholly clear , since history knows little about the Etruscans , and archmology , though yielding numerous remains , leaves the problem of their origin dark . The Etruscans , or Tyrrhenians as the Greeks knew them , were however active traders , and a number of features in their civilization , such as liver divination ( ? 97 ) , as well as ancient tradition , connect them with Asia . It is therefore probable that the principle of arch construction was transmitted to them from its earlier Babylonian source . The Etruscans also failed to carry the use of the arch far into monumental architecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than as a conspicuous feature of public buildings. , 119 . THE ROMAN ARCH AND DOME From the Etruscans their neighbors , the Romans , learned the arch . They too adopted it at first for utilitarian purposes . The great sewer of Rome , for instance , the Cloaca Maxima , is an arched vault of brick . Gradually , however , as the Romans grew in numbers and wealth and acquired a taste for public under , takings , they transferred the construction to stone and intro , duced it into their buildings . By the time their polity changed from the republican to the imperial form , the arch was the most characteristic feature of their architecture . The Greeks had built porticos of columns ; the Romans erected frontages of rows of arches . The exterior of their circus , the Coliseum , is a series of stories of arches . Much of the mass of the structure also rests upon arches , thus making possible the building of the huge edi41. // flee with a minimum of material . On the practical side , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The skill which evolved it eliminates a large percentage of brute labor . Earlier peoples would have felt it necessary to fill the space between the interior tiers of seats and the outer wall of the Coliseum . Once the fever of architecture had infected them , the Romans went beyond the simple arch and vault . They invented the dome . As the simplest arch , such as a doorway or window , a perforation in a wall , is essentially two dimensional , and a vault is the projecting of this plane area into the three dimensions of a half cylinder , so the dome can be conceived as the extension of the arch into another three-dimensional form , the half sphere . Their relations are those of a hoop , a barrel , and a hollow ball . Imagine a vault revolved on a central vertical ivot , and it will describe the surface of a dome . Two intersecting arches can be served by a single keystone . Theoretically , more and more arches can be introduced to intersect at the same point , until they form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dome did actually take place by this method of compounding arches , which however serves to illustrate the logical relation of the two structures . The Roman engineers put domes on their Pantheon , the tomb of Hadrian , and other buildings . In the centuries in which the Mediterranean countries were Romanized , the dome and the arch the vault and the row of arches set on pillars , became familiar to all the inhabitants of the civilized western world . After Roman power crumbled , the architectural traditions survived . Even when there was decadence of execution and little momunmental construction , the principles once gained were never lost . 120 . MEDLEVAL CATHEDRALS With the emergence from the Dark to the Middle Ages , architecture revived with an application to churches instead of temples , circuses , and baths . In southern Europe adherence to the old Roman model remained close , and the style is known as Romanesque . In northern Europe the Roman principles found wolves on newer soil , tradition bound less rigorously , and the style underwent more modification . The arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were elongated at the expense of horizontal ones , which in the lower and less brilliant sun of the north are less effective in catching light and shade and giving plastic effect than on the Mediterranean . The dominant effect became one of aspiration toward height . This is the so-called Gothic architecture , developed from the twelfth century on , most notably in northern France , with much originality also in England , and undergoing provincial modification in the various north European countries . In fact , the style was finally carried back into Italy , to compete there with the Romanesque order , as in the famous cathedral of Milan . As an artistic design a Gothic cathedral is as different from an imperial Roman building as the latter from a Greek temple . Yet it represents nothing but a surface modification of Roman methods . Its essential engineering problems had been solved more than a thousand years earlier . The effect of a hemispherical arch associated with low round columns , and of a high pointed one soaring from tall clusters of buttresses , is as diverse as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan or invention are concerned , there is no decisive distinction between the two orders . 121 . THE ARABS : INDIA : MODERN ARCHITECTURE In the east , Roman architectural tradition was sustained without rupture and even carried forward in the Byzantine empire . The great church of St. Sophia at Constantinople is a sixth century example of a splendid dome set on four great arches and intersecting with smaller domes at its corners . From the Byzantine Greeks ? or Romans as they long continued to call themselves ? and perhaps from the neighboring Sassanian Persians , the principle of arch and dome came to the Arabs when these underwent their sudden expansion after the death of Mohammed . In nearly all the countries overrun by the Arabs , Mesopotamia , Syria , Egypt , North Africa , Sicily , and Spain , they encountered innumerable old public buildings or ruins . It was not long before they were emulating these . During the centuries superficial fashion does not stand still in architecture any more than in dress . The trousers of 1850 would seem out of place if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
