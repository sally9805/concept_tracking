 | ONCE the Empire State of the South in wealth and culture as well as in the number of her square miles , Georgia awoke a few years ago to discover her prestige departing . 1 ter pine forests were rapidly vanishing ; failure to rotate her crops had caused much of her rich tobacco lands to " burn out " ; the devastating and irresistible bollweevil army , marching eastward from Texas , threatened an even greater financial debacle than the army which marched from Lookout Mountain to the sea in 1864 ; a neighboring State had come suddenly to the fore in education , in improved highways , and in industrial development . A NATION IN ITSELF IN SIZE AND RESOURCES In common with many other Georgians living outside the State , the writer 's pride had been seared by these facts ; so that , after an absence of more than twenty years , he undertook , with much misgiving , a tour of the Commonwealth to see what of good and encouragement could be found within her borders . Viewed from a distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's advertised deficiencies . In physical resources and favored geographical location , no State in the Union occupies a more advantageous position . The last of the thirteen original Colonies to be settled , Georgia , with an area of more than 59,000 square miles , is the largest State east of the Mississippi . In this particular she is truly a nation in herself , exceeding in size the Republic of Austria , or of Czechoslovakia , Greece , or Portugal , any one of the six Central American republics , or any of the three island republics of the Caribbean . She is larger than England and Wales , or Belgium , the Netherlands , and Denmark combined . Her situation on the Atlantic seaboard and her diversity of elevation are such that of the nine distinctive climate belts to be found in the United States proper , eight are encountered within her bounds ,  | with the result that she grows as great a variety of agricultural products as any State in the Union . In this day , when " back to the farm " has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgians have remained close to the soil , three-fourths of the entire population being classified as rural , according to the last national census . Reviewing these facts , the question came to mind , Has Georgia , like the wicked and slothful servant of the parable , hidden her talent in the earth ? I went to see . A MARBLE MINE TO LAST EIGHTEEN CENTURIES My sight-seeing pilgrimage began at Tate , a hamlet nestling among those , to the motorist , notorious red clay hills , some 40 miles due south of the point where Tennessee , North Carolina , and Georgia meet . It is difficult to find Tate on any save a detailed map , * yet from it has gone forth building material for some of the noblest structures of Ameri c a ? the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington , the State capitols of Rhode Island , Minnesota , Kentucky , and Arkansas , the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland , the New York Stock Exchange , and the Royal Bank of Canada . Tate is the center of the great Georgia marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and a half miles long and a half mile wide , and , as the seam of stone comes to the very surface , Indians were digging marble here for their corn-grinding mortars long before the arrival of the white man . The marble strata extend to a depth never yet determined , and although  | 800,000 cubic feet are quarried annually , the second largest output of any marble quarry in the United States , it has been estimated by a Federal expert that this amount could be doubled and there would still be marble to take from this valley eighteen hundred years hence ! A perennial stream flows through the valley , providing the necessary water for the marble works , and , as snow seldom falls this section , the quarries are in operation every week day in the year . When the marble pits reach a depth of 200 feet , the drillers transfer their machinery to another plot of ground , scrape off a few inches of soil , and begin anew . The old pits are abandoned at this point , not because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but merely because it 's a long climb for the workmen down and up the ladders ( see illustration , page 286 ) . At the time of my visit , a cube of marble estimated as weighing 76 tons , one of the largest blocks ever quarried in America , lay in the bottom of one pit ready to he partially shaped before shipment to Chicago for the Buckingham . Memorial Fountain . HIGHWAYS SURFACED WITH MARBLE Aside from the lovely color tones of its three varieties ? pink , white , and silver gray ? the characteristics of Georgia marble which commend it so highly to architects are its nonabsorptive quality and its uniformity of texture . It was the latter feature which caused its selection for the colossal statue of Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial at Washington . Situated on a knoll commanding an incomparable view of the fabulous valley stands the magnificent mansion , now nearing completion , of the owner of this and other near-by quarries . Although it is a structure suggestive of the opulence of the Caesars , it is built of pink marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material at hand . In fact , in this part of Pickens County the very highways are surfaced with crushed marble and the chimneys of the one-room cabins of the hill-folk are built of marble slabs . THE STATE IS AWAKENING TO HER HIGHWAY DEFICIENCIES A two hours ' motor trip from Tate brings the tourist to Atlanta , when the well-graded but unmetaled clay roads are dry ; the time may stretch into eternity in rainy weather , when they become as slick as glass . Although the wealthiest counties of the State ? such as Fulton , Clarke , Ware Bibb . Chatham , and Glynn ? have their own excellent paved highways , there is no dodging Georgia 's deficiency with respect to many of her roads . A brighter day is promised , however . The goodroads movement is being discussed with enthusiasm on every hand and the State 's ambitious program includes the paving of a system of roads from county seat to county seat , which , if consummated , will give a north-to-south and east-to-west highway for every county . Our trip was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city which is the State 's most effective advertisement , if one excepts the Georgia peach and the Georgia watermelon . The largest city of the South Atlantic States , Atlanta has always prided herself upon her ultraprogressive spirit , a spirit which more leisurely communities of the State , with somewhat scornful and tenacious sectionalism , characterize as " Yankee . " She glories in the imputation and becomes more and more " yankeefied , " setting herself the task of proving that because an individual lives south of the Mason and Dixon Line he does not necessarily think and act in ante bellum fashion . There is a tradition that when the first railway was projected through this part of the State the wealthy citizens of the sedate town of Decatur refused to allow the noisy common carrier to locate its tracks or its station nearer than five miles of their community 's confines . Thus the crossroads of Marthasville was established . To-day , Marthasville ( Atlanta ) is one of the great railway and banking centers of the United States , and Decatur , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environs of that despised village of 75 years ago . Atlanta owes many of the towns of Georgia a debt which she will never be able to pay . For a quarter of a century  | she has arrogated to herself the best youth of the Commonwealth . Go into any community and inquire about its most promising young men of five , ten , fifteen , or twenty years ago , and in the majority of cases the answer will be , " Oh , he moved to Atlanta a while back ; he thought greater opportunities awaited him there . " Nowadays , however , that situation is changing . A score of towns with progressive boards of trade , ' like Albany , Americus , Valdosta , Waycross , Brunswick , Rome , La Grange , and Columbus , are presenting opportunities that warrant the boys just out of college in staying at home and developing the regions close at hand . One can not talk with Atlantans or tour the city 's busy , twisting streets without acquiring the superlative habit . The visitor is enthusiastically bombarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States " ( or is it in America , or in the world ? ) , " the largest roofing plant in the South , " " the most colossal monument of all time , " " the largest colony of millionaires per capita in the country , " " the biggest mail-order concern in the South , with a prospective business of $30,000,000 a year , " and so on . But a city may have the greatest shoebutton factory on the hemisphere or soap plant in Christendom and still not be a place of which to boast . Atlanta has something besides sheer bigness of enterprises and multiplicity of millionaires ' estates in which she may properly take pride . Her citizens have an incomparable community spirit , which has won and will continue to win many civic and State victories . Tremendously energetic and aggressive , a bit contemptuous of her more slowmoving sister cities , Atlanta is , withal , a credit to Georgia and to the New South . HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY Or INTEREST Atlanta 's week of Metropolitan Grand Opera is an evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . This annual event has outgrown the highest expectations of its initiators , and to-day the spring visit of the New York organ-  | ization attracts its tens of thousands , not merely from all parts of Georgia , but from the entire South . The Atlanta spirit sometimes presents an entirely different aspect . For example , a year ago the major power company of the State faced a critical situation , following three successive dry summers in north Georgia , a region which ordinarily has the highest average rainfall east of the Mississippi River . The company 's hydroelectric plants , which in normal times furnish most of the power for factories representing a capital investment of nearly half a billion dollars , found their output of kilowatts alarmingly curtailed . Now , public-service corporations are the spellbinding politician 's chief stock in trade , his " octopi preying upon the body politic , " and the parent companies of Georgia 's consolidated power concern were the targets for continuous attack fifteen years ago . But when last year 's emergency arose the company called in conference the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and suggested a partial solution of the difficulty ? a staggering of working hours , some factories to work at night , others to run by day . Cooperation was immediately pledged and the situation saved . To-day , because power seller and power buyer have gone through a period of sacrifice and mutual helpfulness , a better spirit actuates the entire relations between public-service corporation and public . And , best of all , with public support , a further consolidation of interests has been effected within recent months , whereby the water-power resources of northwest Alabama and north Georgia have been pooled . The hydroelectric systems of the two States are now linked up , so that during the past summer many of the factories of north Georgia were operating on power supplied by Alabama water , while the Georgia streams were being diverted to reservoirs , thus creating a reserve , so that no succession of dry summers ever again can cause a power famine such as that of 1925 . The development of water power has  | been one of the most potent factors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or ten years , for while Georgia came to a full realization of the potential value of her white-coal resources considerably later than North Carolina , her hydroelectric development is now on a par with that of the Tarheel State , each utilizing in the neighborhood of 500,000 horsepower , with 2,000,000 as the ultimate goal* ( see illustration , page 26o ) . CLAYS TO RESTORE WEALTH DESTROYED BY BOLL WEEVIL Atlanta is justly proud of her educational institutions , chief among which is the Georgia School of Technology , commodiously housed in a large group of well-equipped buildings . It has an enrollment of more than 2,000 students , and its graduates have contributed materially toward the industrial development of the South during the last two decades . In discussing the recently established School of Ceramics at " Tech , " the president of this progressively administered institution confided that at the annual meeting of the American Ceramic Society , held in Atlanta a few months ago , a number of the technical experts of the organization expressed the belief that within ten years this new department will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the State 's kaolin deposits , see text . page 291 ) more than the boll weevil has taken away . Atlanta is also the seat of Emory University , of Oglethorpe University , and of Agnes Scott ( in Decatur ) , a girls ' college of high scholastic reputation .  | The city is a center for negro education , among the most important colleges being Atlanta , Clark , and Morris Brown Universities , Spelman Seminary , and Morehouse College . These institutions are making a commendable fight against the illiteracy handicap under which almost one-third of the colored race in the State labors . EDUCATIONAL FORCES WOEFULLY UNDERPAID The subject of education naturally takes the investigator to Athens , seat of the State University and a charming old place of stately colonial homes , embowered in oak groves and rose gardens ( see pages 264 and 283 ) . It is a source of chagrin to those who are proud of Georgia to recall that no State in the Union began its educational career with higher promise and none has fallen so far short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a State university , and Wesleyan , founded at Macon in 1836 , was a world pioneer among women 's colleges : yet to-day the Commonwealth ranks at the very bottom of the list of States in her per capita expenditures for educational purposes , and only six States in the Union have a higher percentage of illiteracy . The higher institutions of learning are especially handicapped by lack of funds both for equipment and for salaries . It has been offered in extenuation that Georgia has to bear more than 11 per cent- of the entire Nation 's " white man 's burden " for education of the colored race . Negroes comprise more than two-fifths o the State 's population , but pay less than one-twentieth of her taxes . The proponents of a more liberal educational policy maintain that this unfortunate condition presents a challenge to the State to rise to the occasion as a matter of self-interest as well as of justice to her sons and daughters . A more hopeful situation is to be found  | in the rural school system . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the State , at a cost of more than two million dollars . In Decatur County , for example , a progressive young county school superintendent , a graduate of the State niversity , has in four ears practically blot : d from the landscape the one-teacher , oneroom schoolhouses . In their places have risen well-lighted , well-ventilated consolidated schools with competent teaching staffs . Children throughout each consolidated district are collected by motor busses in the morning and returned to their homes in the afternoon , but the circuit traversed in certain communities is so great that some of the pupils are forced to spend four hours a day in automobiles , a condition which can only be remedied by legislative awakening . In many of the prosperous towns and cities of the State the grammar and high schools are on a par with the best in America . AUGUSTA 'S CHERISHED HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS It is a pleasant automobile journey of too miles from Athens , by way of Washington and Thomson , to Augusta , at the head of navigation on the Savannah and the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North and East chiefly as a health resort and for its splendid golf links , but Georgians cherish its historical associations . James Oglethorpe , the philanthropist who settled the colony of Georgia , founded the city nearly 200 years ago , naming it for the then Princess of Wales . It was from Charleston , South Carolina , to Hamburg , across the river from Augusta , that the first American-built locomotive , the Best Friend , was operated 96 years ago , and here lived William Longstreet , who received a steamboat patent from his State in 1788 , but was not able to operate his invention successfully until twenty years later , a year after Robert Fulton 's Clermont was navigating the Hudson . Both Augusta and Savannahians  | claim that it was on a farm in the environs of their respective cities that Eli Whitney , a Massachusetts school teacher , devised and set up the first cotton gin , a machine which truly revolutionized the cotton industry of the world . In 1792 , the year of the invention , the United States exported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 30 , 1926 , the South exported more than one-half of its crop of sixteen million bales ! Fifteen miles from Augusta is Silver Bluff , where Hernando De Soto camped in 1540 , and Spanish chroniclers tell us that it was with difficulty that he induced his followers to continue their wanderings , which lei to the discovery of the Mississippi , because they wished to remain and found here a settlement in the " pleasantest place " on American shores . Augusta lies in the great kaolin belt , 20 to 50 miles wide , which extends for more than 200 miles across the State to Columbus . It is by developing the best means of utilizing this kaolin that the students in the School of Ceramics at the Georgia School of Technology are expected to make their notable contribution to the wealth of this section ( see text , page 291 ) . Already the clays are being mined extensively , but unsystematically and uneconomically . They constitute a new " crop " for the farmer who as yet uses little selective judgment in grading his cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN OUR MINERAL , HISTORY In addition to her kaolin beds and her marble and granite deposits , Georgia 's hills and mountains contain a diversity of wealth in clays and minerals , which provide fascinating subjects of study for the metallurgist . Geological experts who have analyzed her resources assert that " of the 52 known commercial minerals , more than 40 are to be found within the bounds of the State . " A majority of these are present , of course , only in such quantities and in such chemical combinations as to be of interest solely to the laboratory student . On the other hand , many interesting chapters in the mineralogical history of the United States have been written by Georgia . The first bauxite mined in America came from this State , 34 years ago , and while Arkansas has since assumed leadership in the output of this valuable ore from which aluminum is obtained , Georgia holds second place , her bauxite being used chiefly in the manufacture of artificial abrasives , the production of alum , aluminum sulphate , and other chemicals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of all the ocher produced in the United States comes from Georgia deposits . The ore is used extensively as a pigment in paints and as a filler in linoleum . The State was also for years the country 's chief source of supply for asbestos . The latter has ceased to be of economic importance , however , since the rich Canadian and South African deposits have been developed . Georgia 's gold mines have produced nearly $18,000,000 worth of the yellow metal ; but their days of productivity seem to be over also , although Dahlonega , in bumpkin County , still hopes for a revival of the industry . IN THE HEART OIL THE PEACH COUNTRY beaving Augusta 's broad thoroughfares ( see page 261 ) , we go by motor to Macon , the former 's rival for third place among the cities of the Commonwealth . Situated at the geographical heart of the State , Macon is the great market center for the fruit industry . Here the peach and watermelon growers maintain their cooperative organizations , and here one learns that it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the orchard owners of Fort Valley , Marshallville , and other communities that have enjoyed 26 consecutive peach crops - a record for the United States . My visit to Georgia was timed to cointide with the annual Peach Blossom Festival at Fort Valley , a colorful , magnificently staged historical pageant which was inaugurated five years ago and which now attracts thousands to this progressive little town in the heart of the peach belt . A few hours after the 1926 pageant there came a killing frost ! Two nights later I was in Bainbridge , 125 miles to the south , when the owner of one of the largest crate factories of that section was called to the telephone . Upon returning  | to the group of business men , he announced with elation that the freeze had caused a damage of 40 per cent to the each crop . " This means prosperity for middle Georgia , " he exclaimed . " A 10,000-carload crop should prove tremendously profitable to the growers , but another limper crop like that of 1924 would have meant ruin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eastern markets were glutted , and many a shipment to New York , Boston , and Philadelphia did not pay for its freight and refrigeration . The time is coming when this condition will be remedied and the growers will long for the maximum amount of fruit which their trees can bear . The solution lies in the development of a canning industry to utilize the unmarketed fruit . There is also an almost inexhaustible demand for peaches that ripen too quickly to be crated and shipped , if they are preserved and shredded for use in the familiar soda fountain " sundae " so dear to the American palate . Because of the crisis brought about by the bumper crop of 14,000 cars two summers ago , the " Georgia Belles , " the last variety of peaches to ripen , were not even gathered from the trees , but were allowed to rot in the orchards . ECONOMIC SLAVERY TO COTTON HAS LONG PERSISTED In emphasizing the necessity for Georgia to develop methods of utilizing her surplus peaches . the publisher of Macon 's morning newspaper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared that slavery in the State still exists ? an economic slavery through long dependence upon one crop , cotton . For more than Too years the Georgia farmer , the Georgia merchant , and the Georgia banker have thought and acted in terms of cotton . The whole financial structure of the State has been built around this crop . A man with a cotton field knows how to plant it , how to raise the crop , how to finance himself during the growing season , how to market his " hag , " and how to get the money on it from his warehouse receipt . The banker likewise knows the cotton routine . But when it came to other crops an entirely new machinery had to he developed , and that machinery in most communities is too new to rim without " squeaking . " Lacking familiar facilities , many farmers of limited means and narrow experience have tried other crops , but they revert again and again to the time-tried cotton , with the result that , in spite of the fact that Georgia should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned , she annually imports approximately $175,000,000 worth of foodstuffs . For example , she buys hay in Wyoming and pays Ito per cent of its cost in freight charges , whereas her own rich hayfields along the banks of the Chattahoochee , in Seminole and Early Counties , as well as much of her other productive river bottom lands , lie fallow ! The Macon editor took me around the corner from his newspaper office and pointed to a grocer 's window in which appeared two baskets of eggs bearing these labels : " Western eggs , 4O doz. , " and " Eggs , 30 ? + doz . " " Some day , that grocer will learn to wipe off those home-produced eggs , making them presentable . and he will then revise those signs . to read Fresh Georgia eggs , 400 doz. ; Western eggs , 300 doz . ' I am trying to hasten that clay through the medium of my paper . " Though the fleecy fetters of King Cotton still gall the ankles of the Georgia farmer , there is no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State there is a new industrial plant to be inspected . GEORGIA BRICK AND GEORGIA PAPER At Gordon , a few m , es out of Macon , one of the most modern brick plants in America is utilizing the kaolin deposits previously mentioned ( see page 270 ) . The plant , which has been in operation for just a year , is designed in units , the first of which is now producing its so , 000 white bricks a day . The kaolin , sand and feldspar are mixed in mammoth containers and pressed out in a rectangular ribbon , which is borne along by a belt . A revolving wheel with wires for spokes slices it into bricks , as cakes of laundry soap are cut in a soap factory . At the same time each brick is pierced by three holes an inch in diameter , thus reducing its  | weight from 15 to 20 per cent and facilitating the drying process without decreasing its strength . The soft bricks are now sent to a drier where a pound of water per brick is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the plant being utilized . The bricks are next loaded on small cars , eight tons to the car , and are sent on their creeping journey of 72 hours through the kilns where they are subjected to oil-produced heat that begins at 200 degrees , gradually rises to 2,200 , then as gradually drops back to 200 . In the same little town there is a mill which has a daily output of 6o tons of kraft paper , a tough , tear-resisting product used largely for wrapping packages exposed to rough handling , magazine wrappers , etc . The wood-pulp supply from secondgrowth pine timber is apparently inexhaustible in this section of the State , for natural reforestation takes place in from lo to 15 years , permitting a cut of one to two cords to the acre perpetually . My next stop was Savannah , second city of the State . It was here that James Edward Oglethorpe , in 1733 , established the first settlement of the new colony named for his sovereign , George II . AT THE SCENE oP GEORGIA 'S FIRST SETTLEMENT There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English colonies in America . The British Government was anxious to have a buffer state between the Carolina-Virginia settlements to the north and the hostile Spaniards in Florida , and a " shock absorber " for possible encroachments of the French from Louisiana . General Oglethorpe , on the other hand , was chiefly interested in affording a place of rehabilitation for thousands of his worthy but impoverished fellow countrymen and a retreat for the unfortunates of other lands who were being persecuted for their religious convictions . The early settlers included not only Englishmen , but Scottish Highlanders ,  | German Lutherans ( Salzburgers ) , Portuguese Jews , Swiss , and Piedmontese . How many woes might have been spared the State if the founders ' original edict against the introduction If slavery and the importation of rum had been obeyed ! THE HOME PORT OF TIHE FIRST TRANSATLANTIC LINER Like Augusta , Savannah is steeped in tradition , and historical association is the visitor 's companion wherever he goes . Here he finds two monuments , the cornerstones of which were laid by Lafayette , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other that gallant Polish friend of liberty , Count Casimir Pulaski , who lost his life at the siege of the city in 1779 . Hard by is a third monument , to William Jasper , the hero whose daring exploit in replacing the fallen colors of the Revolutionary forces at Fort Moultrie in the face of a galling fire has thrilled every American schoolboy . Jasper fell at Savannah with Pulaski in the siege of ' 79 . It was from this flourishing seaport , 107 years ago , that the Savannah made the first successful transatlantic voyage in the history of steamship navigation , the passage to Liverpool requiring 25 days . Three venerable structures in the heart of the Forest City , so named because of the massive , moss-festooned live oaks which line its streets , attract the attention of the historically minded ? the Savannah Theater , one of the oldest playhouses in America , in which practically all the stage stars in the more than a century of its existence have appeared ; Christ Church ( see page 2i3 ) , on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Methodism , was once a rector and where he is supposed to have established a Sunday school ( still in existence ) some 50 years before Robert Raikes started his " first Sunday school in the world " at Gloucester , England ; and the third a mellow old house , now the home of a venerable Savannah jurist , in which General Sherman established his headquarters after he had completed his " march to the sea " ( see page 293 ) . HOW OUR SUGAR IS REPINED While Savannah derives much of its delightful atmosphere from such associations , there is another side to the city which is equally arresting . It is the world 's greatest naval stores market and its miles of waterfront accommodate shipping from all parts of the globe , especially vessels which come for cargoes of cotton , turpentine , and rosin . There is also a manufacturing side to this , the oldest city in the State . One of the most interesting of its industrial establishments is a sugar refinery , the only plant of its kind between New Orleans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area covering 13 States . The raw sugar comes in shiploads direct from the cane mills of Cuba* to the docks of the refinery , where each 325-pound bag is tested for its sucrose , or sweetness , content by three inspectorsone who represents the United States Government and determines the amount of duty to be paid , another the sugar planter in Cuba , and a third the refinery . The cargo comes sacked in burlap , and to the amazement of the stranger , there are no " Use no hooks " signs . Jagged holes are snagged in almost every bag as it is lifted from the hold of the vessel and the long , augurlike instruments of the testers make other punctures . But the unrefined brown sugar is damp and little of it spills . That which does seep out is not lost but is swept up and shoveled into the hopper with all the rest , coming out eventually entirely cleansed and almost as nearly chemically pure as any article in man 's dietary .  | While a modern sugar refinery , including its storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled 30 to 40 feet high , is a mammoth affair , the actual process of refining is effected on comparatively simple principles . The raw sugar is first freed of surplus moisture in centrifugal cylinders , then it is reduced to a syrup which is filtered through big tanks , each containing 30 tons or more of bone black which removes the yellowish color . Formerly dried ox blood was used as the filtering substance . The liquid is next boiled in semivacuum Containers to prevent scorching . When crystals begin to form in the rich syrup , the thinner syrups are drawn off for further treatment . Sometimes a syrup may be sent through the crystallizing process as many as 90 times , in order to extract every available crystal . The sugar is washed , then dried in hotair blowers and is ready to be automatically weighed and poured into containers ? in cartons , in 2- , 5- , 10- , 25- , 50- , and too-pound sacks and in barrels , at the rate of 2,000,000 pounds a day . From the time the raw sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer it has not come in contact with the hands of any one of the 400 employees of this plant ( see illustration above ) . As an interesting sidelight upon the efficiency with which such a refinery is organized , it is learned that the cost of labor in refining the 2-pound carton or the 5-pound bag of sugar which you buy from your grocer was less than the cost of the pasteboard box or the muslin bag itself and its outer wrapper ! WHERE BAMBOO GROWS MORE THAN A FOOT A DAY Twelve miles out of Savannah , on the superb highway which is soon to be completed through Chatham , Bryan , Liberty , McIntosh and Glynn Counties to Brunswick , Georgia 's second seaport , one passes a unique experiment station operated by the Department of Agriculture . Here a bamboo propagating farm , which started from a single shoot 35 years ago , is flourishing ( see illustration , page 281 ) . Many thousands of plants have been shipped from this station since 1920 ,  | and within two years it is expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia south and west to California . The most startling peculiarity about the bamboo is that the cane or culm attains its full size and height in a single season of six or seven weeks ' growth ? in May and June . Some of the canes reach a height of 5o or 6o feet , with a diameter of several inches , and the station has a record growth of 1772 inches in one day ! The United States annually imports large quantities of split bamboo and bamboo poles for flower stakes , bean poles , and fishing rods . The Government is maintaining the Georgia station in the belief that our domestic requirements can be supplied by bamboo groves planted in our Southern States , and a careful study of various economic species of bamboo is now being made to determine adaptability to soils and climate . Preliminary experiments indicate that it is possible to grow as fine bamboo in the United States as is commonly grown in the Orient . SPANISH MISSIONS IN GEORGIA LONG BEFORE ENGLISH SETTLED IN AMERICA This whole Georgia coast from Savannah to Brunswick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe of semitropical islands off the mainland , was once debatable land . lying between the Spanish settlements in Florida and the English settlements in Virginia and the Carolinas . Long before the English gained a foothold in the New World , however , the Jesuits and the Franciscans had established numerous missions in this region , then called Guale . Spanish chronicles recently brought to light show that a year before the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown the bishop of Cuba made a pastoral visit to four Georgia missions to confirm 1070 neophytes . When Oglethorpe won the Battle of Bloody Marsh on St. Simon Island , opposite Brunswick , in the summer of 1742 it proved to be the decisive conflict of a struggle that had lasted nearly a century and a half , and it determined the destiny of Georgia as an English colony . The ruins of Frederica , Oglethorpe 's fort and base of operations , still stand on St. Simon and a few yards away are the moss-covered trees which are identified as the Wesley oaks , beneath which John preached and Charles sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow worker , Whitefield , played major roles in the early history of Georgia , although Charles remained in the colony only six months and John only two years . The  | latter 's experiences in Savannah and Frederica were to affect his whole career and life 's work . The broad , palmbordered boulevard which runs across Bloody Marsh to-day and connects St. Simon with Brunswick on the mainland has given this island , with its contiguous Long Island , a wonderful impetus as a summer resort , while back from the ocean front truck gardeners are performing prodigies with lettuce , cucumbers , tomatoes , and beans as well as with poultry . Across Brunswick 's harbor entrance from St. Simon lies Jekvl Island , forerunner of M i a m i and Palm Beach . A group of multimillionaires , attracted by the salubrious climate and the opportunities for the creation of a superb hunting and fishing preserve , bought the island 40 years ago and established the Jekyl Island Club , consisting of a group of luxurious rustic winter homes . BRUNSWICK COMES INTO HER OWN Brunswick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important city in Georgia . She has had her railroad and steamship disappointments , she has had her severe postwar deflation , and she has often received only the " left-otrers " from the Congressional Rivers and Harbors " pork barrel " bills . But a small group of her citizens has maintained a dauntless optimism in the face of every setback , and the tide seems to have turned at last . With an excellent system of paved roads throughout Glynn County and with a rapidly developing truck-farming industry , especially on St. Simon , her present prosperity is basically sound . Industrially the city has a variety of interests , including a $7,000,000 oil refining plant , a fishing fleet of 200 vessels , many of which are employed in supplying a big shrimp-canning factory ; creosoting works and a marine railway , but her unique manufacturing establishment is a steam distillation turpentine plant , the largest of its kind in the world , extracting turpentine and rosin from stumps ( see page 299 ) . A CHAMPION WHITE LEGHORN OF ' GLYNN COUNTY " Liza Jane , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a record of 312 eggs in one year . She is quite a personage in her sphere and receives post cards from poultry raisers of many States . The annual value of Georgia 's poultry products has increased from $5,000,000 ten years ago to $30,000,000 to-day .  | The story goes that after the Armistice one of the big munitions plants was seeking a field for investment and its attention was accidentally attracted to a concern in Brunswick which had been using a considerable quantity of blasting powder . Investigation resulted in acquisition and subsequent enlargement of the steam distillation turpentine plant , which blasts its raw material out of fields and cut-over timberland , a brain flash that developed an economic return of thousands a year . A MAMMOTH STUMP FACTORY Stumps are hauled into Brunswick from distances ranging between 40 and 120 miles , at the rate of 600 tons a day . In some parts of Georgia farmers are paying from $15 to $20 an acre to have their fields cleared , but in Glynn and neighboring counties the canny landowner exacts a price for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashion in which Tom Sawyer charged his young friends for the privilege of whitewashing . his Aunt Polly 's fence . The stumps are blown out of the ground with powder , which is inserted in a hole bored deep into the roots by pneumatic augurs . Only those stumps which have been dead for eight or ten years are used , but the Georgia supply of these , so far as this one plant is concerned , is said to be inexhaustible . Gigantic " hogs " crush and grind the stumps to match-stick size , and the wood is then dumped into great tanks holding from 17 to 18 tons of splinters , called a  | charge . For 20 hours the charge is cooked with steam at 400 degrees . The turpentine vaporizes and is condensed in a separate container . The chips are then washed with boiling gasoline , which absorbs the rosin . The gasoline is next cooked out , leaving the rosin . So carefully has the machinery of condensation been developed that less than a fourth of one per cent of the gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent explosion , the chips are used as the plant 's fuel . A ton of stumps will produce seven gallons of turpentine and an average of four-fifths of a barrel of rosin . A third product derived from this process is pine oil , used extensively in medicine and in the reduction of copper ore . GEORGIA IS ONCE MORE THE LEADING , NAVAL STORES STATE Having watched this plant in operation , I was anxious to renew my acquaintance with the old-fashioned way of producing the finer grades of turpentine and rosin from the gum . About the beginning of the century many of the Georgia turpentine operators abandoned their stills and moved on to Alabama , Mississippi , and Louisiana , declaring that practically all of Georgia 's available turpentine timber had been worked . But when I revisited Decatur County I found that men who two decades ago had declined to " pull up stakes " and join the exodus toward the west were still operating , and in many cases on the same timberlands . PRODUCING TURPENTINE FROM RAW GUM Improved methods , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire hazard , have not only enabled these operators to continue in business , but there is every prospect that by pursuing their present policies , turpentining in this section will prove a permanent industry . For the last three years Georgia has again led the Union in the production of naval stores .  | Let us go into the woods and follow the production of turpentine and rosin from the tree to the barrel . A woods rider , or superintendent , selects his " stand " of timber , which includes trees of from 20 to 30 years of age , preferably the latter , and with a crew of 15 men , works from January to March installing a small galvanized iron cup with side gutters at the base of each tree ( see page 302 ) . Early in April the men start their rounds , scarring each tree just above the cup . The instrument used is a " hack " and the scarring , or " chipping , " requires but two strokes to make a wide V incision in the bark . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chipper makes two new incisions in the bark , each higher than that of the previous week , until by the end of October there is a white blaze on the side of the tree 10 to 12 inches wide and 24 inches high . Succeeding seasons may extend the blaze to a height of six or eight feet . A hacker can chip from 8,000 to 12,000 " boxes " a week , 10,000 , known as a " crop , " being a fair average , and for this labor he receives $1.50 per thousand . Every fourth week another crew makes the rounds , gathering the raw gum from the cups . These gatherers , or dippers , are paid on the same scale as the chippers . Ten barrels of the raw gum , constituting a " charge , " are emptied into a copper still , in which it is cooked for two , hours , at the end of which time about two barrels of spirits of turpentine have been distilled and four barrels of rosin remain in the bottom of the copper pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gushes out into immense sieves , over the coarse wire of which cotton batting has been spread . Through this the rosin strains into troughs and while still viscous is ladled into barrels by means of long-handled buckets . The used batting , which is impregnated with rosin , is sold to lampblack factories as a by-product . Locally it is extensively used for kindling , as it makes a highly concentrated , readily inflammable fuel , emitting a heavy black smoke . Thirty years ago all pine trees were " boxed " with a deep wedge cut into the base of the tree to catch the gum . This R GIA SIXTY YEARS AFTER 31 ) 1 practice not only made the work of the dippers more difficult , but it increased the fire hazard tremendously and , finally , in many instances the wedge materially weakened the smaller trees , so that windstorms destroyed vast areas . It was a professor of chemistry at the University of Georgia who invented a cup method of turpentining , thus saving millions of dollars for the industry . Turpentining does not affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the old , haphazard days the forests were seriously damaged by the careless methods of the operator who often destroyed a stand of timber by working trees which were too young and too small to undergo boxing . The number of years during which a tree can be worked for turpentine depends largely upon its size when first chipped . Its life after it has been intelligently turpentined is not appreciably shortened . TRANSPLANTING OF NURSERY PINE TREES IS IMPRACTICAL In reforestation it is impracticable to plant " nursery " pine trees , for the reason that the roots of even the youngest seedlings run too deep to he transplanted economically . The landowners therefore rely upon natural processes or else plant the pine mast ( seed ) . " The Lord probably foresaw that we were n't going to have sense enough to take care of the pine forests which He gave us , " remarked one veteran turpentine man , " so He devised the pine mast , a seed with a sail attached to it , enabling it to fly far and wide in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as few as 5o trees to the acre can be worked with profit , but one farsighted lumber company is seeding 400 to the acre as most economical for operation . Many operators burn over their turpentine lands in January and February , to kill the snakes and destroy the undergrowth , which might prove serious in case of a fire in dry September or October . This practice is frowned upon by Government forestry experts , however ; wide fire lanes are deemed a far more effective means of prevention . All the world is interested in the conservation of the South 's pine timber , for  | turpentine is an essential ingredient in paints , varnishes , and in the pharmacopoeia , while rosin is used in paints , in soap-making , shipbuilding , in the manufacture of high-grade paper , and in all soldering operations . THE OKEPENOKEE SWAMP A REGION OF POTENTIAL , WEALTH The turpentine operators are not only managing to maintain their production in southwest Georgia , but are finding it practicable to move back into counties which were worked 20 or 25 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( probably the finest variety of turpentine timber ) reproduces with extraordinary rapidity in the vicinity of the Okefenokee Swamp . An annual growth of three feet in height for young pines is not unusual . The Okefenokee , incidentally , is one of the most picturesque regions of the 304 THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE  | entire South . Its 800 square miles in the southeastern corner of the State ( see map supplement ) comprise one of Nature 's zoological and botanical gardens . A REGION OF ROMANCE , WHERE THE SUWANNEE RIVER RISES On the islands which dot its cypresstinted waters is a wealth of flowers canopied by forests of gum , bay , pine , and cypress , while in the grassy savannas and on the banks of placid streams the amphibious alligator is sought by the sportsman , who also finds bear , deer and a vast variety of fishes in abundance . The Okefenokee conjures to mind many incidents of romance and adventure .

The St. Marys River takes its rise in the swamp , flowing eastward into the Atlantic and forming part of the boundary between Georgia and Florida . Here , too , are the headwaters of the stream flowing into the Gulf , which furnished  | the inspiration for Stephen Foster 's immortal " Suwannee River . " We return to the southwest corner of the State for a hurried visit to the fuller 's earth mines and the tobacco lands of Decatur County . As we motor southward from Bainbridge , the county seat , toward the AttapuIgus clay beds , the well-graded highway runs between extensive groves of pecans , reminding us that Albany , in the neighboring county of Dougherty , is the center of one of the most prosperous nut-raising regions of America . In fact , the pecan industry has grown to such proportions that Albany each year has its pecan pageant comparable to Fort Valley 's peach blossom festival ( see page 271 ) . Two-thirds of America 's cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEVERISH PROSPECTOR DAYS Attapulgus , situated almost on the Florida line , a few years ago became the center of a " rush " which , on a small scale , recalled the days of ' 49 in California . Everybody was prospecting and the woods were full of mysterious strangers eagerly acquiring subsoil rights . Soon land prices soared to unbelievable figures and farms which had never produced crops worth as much as $5o to the acre were bringing hundreds and even thousands of dollars . All because it had been discovered that a stratum of some of the finest fuller 's earth in the world underlay this district and every oil-refining company in the country wanted its share . Finally , one firm agreed to supply all the refineries at a reasonable price . The bottom dropped gut of the clay boom , but the fuller 's earth industry had come to stay . The Attapulgus plant mines the fuller 's earth and prepares from 250 to 275 carloads of 25 tons each per month , to be used as a filter for lubricating oils . Each refining company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others pulverized or of shalelike quality . The number of steam shovels and trains of cars engaged in removing the topsoil , or overburden , which in some places extends to a depth of 45 feet , suggests that another Panama Canal is being dug . The clay is found in a stratum about six feet deep and comes from the mine damp ( see page 306 ) . It has first to be dried in enormous revolving cylinders heated by oil flames injected under great pressure . The clay adheres to the sides , becomes incandescent , and thus converts the interior of the cylinders into the semblance of caves hung with lovely glowing stalactites . DECATUR COUNTY PRODUCT AIDS EVERY AMERICAN MOTORIST After being dried the earth is conveyed by belts to great bins and from this point the process of grinding , sifting , bolting , and sacking is almost identical with the operation of a flour mill . The output is shipped all over the country , from California to Illinois , Texas , and Indiana , and abroad to Berlin . Forty per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one plant , which means that of every five quarts of oil you put into your automobile engine , two of those quarts have been filtered through Decatur County clay . At the refineries a filter cloth is placed at the bottom of a capacious metal container into which several tons of fuller 's earth are clumped . Oil is admitted under pressure and it drains through the earth . which removes both dirt and carbon , imparting a lighter color to the liquid . After the first filtration , the fuller 's earth is washed with gasoline and steamed , then taken out and cooled , and is ready to be used again for a cheaper grade of oil . The process is repeated four or five times until it is necessary to treat the earth with acid to remove the dirt and carbon with which it has become impregnated . Finally , it goes to the dump heap , its invaluable service to mankind little known or considered . The only " use " ever found for this dump earth was conceived by a man who asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large Eastern refinery . His activities finally excited the curiosity of the refining company . Was a valuable by-product being overlooked ? Investigation revealed the fact that the enterprising individual was sacking the worthless black earth and selling it as fertilizer . The fraud authorities are stil ' on his trail .  | A few miles from Attapulgus are the msterdam tobacco plantations , with their big battery of modern packing houses . both shade and bright-leaf tobacco are rown in this section , but a cankerous conition has of recent years seriously curfled the shade crop . The Department f Agriculture is now engaged in trying o solve the mystery of the disease . Shade tobacco is grown in fields which are covered with cheesecloth or narrow slats stretched over high frames , thus converting the acres into veritable hothouses on a mammoth scale . HOW THE TOBACCO 1S PLANTED Shade planting begins early in April . One man pushes before him through the fields a wheel set with teeth to space the ! ants To or 12 inches apart . A woman follows in his tracks and drops a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see page 308 ) at each mark . A ird person armed with a smooth stake ye or six inches long and an inch and a If in diameter , with one hand punches holes at the points indicated and with the other hand drops a plant in each hole . A fourth man with bucket and dipper completes the procession , filling each hole with water . There is no drawing of earth around the plant or tamping down of roots , as this would bruise the plant ; e water alone is relied upon to bring the earth around it . Shade tobacco grows with extreme rapidity , maturing in from 5o to 6o days , by which time it has reached a height of from 7 to no feet ( see page 309 ) , and is pressing against the top of the shade cloth . But before it has reached this stage it has been attacked by a host of implacable insect enemies , the hornworm , the bud worm , and the wireworm being the most deadly . The hornworm is usually combatted with Paris green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are painfully affected by the poison , in spite of the fact that the precaution is taken to blow the powder back over the shoulder while advancing through the field . Children are employed almost exclusively in waging the early battle with the bud worm , for the reason that the poison , a mixture of arsenate of lead and corn meal , has to be applied directly into the bud , and it has been found that when the plant is young adults will not stoop low enough to administer this coup dc grace . Unlike the Paris green brigade , the youthful poisoners suffer no ill effects from their labors . The bud worm poison , in order to prove effective , must be applied at least three times a week . The magnitude of this operation on a plantation of 5O0 acres is appalling , for there are some 10,000 plants to the acre , necessitating a total of 15,000.000 pinches of poison placed exactly in the buds each week during the early stages of growth . Formerly the negro men and women were permitted to sing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons , near " quitting time , " visitors could occasionally hear marvelous spirituals sung with amazing fervor by natural leaders and supported by a great chorus . But to-day the packing houses are places of silence as busy fingers sort , smoothe , grade , measure , and tie the dried leaves into bales of 175 pounds each , every leaf in a bale supposedly being of the same shape , size , color , and texture . These graders are tobacco artists , and they require north lights in their " studios . " Nothing is done by artificial illumination . ANTIQUE-HUNTING , THE GREATEST OP CROSS-COUNTRY SPORTS This is the section of Georgia where the antique flourishes . For half a century this game has enjoyed the protection which comes from indifference to its worth , but an open season has been declared of late and the woods are full of pothunters . A very definite technique has been developed for this sport in south Georgia , for conditions are entirely different from those which obtain in Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Virginia , where nothing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chance . " Back in the eighties and early nineties the craze for " golden oak " and similar products of the Grand Rapids manufacturers reached this section , with the result that priceless old furniture was discarded ? thrown into barns or given to negroes living on large estates and plantations . Hence the following technique : A hunter  | motors leisurely through the country , his roving eyes seeking houses of ante bellum or colonial design or perhaps an avenue of trees leading to a forlorn hill where a gaunt chimney tells the tale of fire or decay . These mansions , or remains of them , indicate that the quarry is in hiding in the vicinity . Having located the manor house , so to speak , the " snooping " proceeds in all the humble neighboring cabins . Nine times out of ten the objects of the search ? spool beds , walnut and mahogany dressing tables , rare old glass , and luster ware ? are to he found tucked away in dark and dingy corners , always in sad disrepair and usually obtainable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more comfortable chair than the dilapidated affair which Marse Henry rejected from the Big House years ago . A PROFITABLE BAG We rose at daybreak for the antique hunt which had been arranged for my edification . It was a stimulating ride through bright-leaf tobacco fields , cornfields , occasional stands of pine timber . cotton fields , pecan groves , and truck gardens ? a rich and fertile land stretching all the way from Bainbridge to Cuthbert . The latter , with the possible exception of Athens , boasts as many white-columned colonial homes as any place of its size in the South . We found our quarry and bagged a ginger jar , a quaint old rocker , a set of old-fashioned cruets , and a pair of ancient brass firedogs . A PROPHETIC LETTER FOUND IN AN ANTIQUE DESK As we were leaving the tumble-down storeroom in the rear of the ancient porticoed white house , with its central hall wide enough to suggest a section of Pennsylvania Avenue , I spied among the heterogeneous debris an old walnut lap desk with silver monogram plate and escutcheon. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " Yes , if you want it ; there are four or five of them around the house . " Motoring home that afternoon , I opened soy new possession . A great mass of papers fell to the floor of the car ? letters , all except one , received by a young Georgia student at the University of Virginia in 1856 and 1857 . The exception bore the date " Philadelphia , October 30 , 1865 , " and was addressed to the former student . Both the writer and the recipient are long since dead ; there can be no offense in reproducing a few paragraphs written in admonition and encouragement to a despairing son of the Old South by one of his comrades who found himself in the North at the end of the war : In order to develop the resources of your country you need a new working population , for the usefulness of the former is forever lost . You must let bygones be bygones and turn over a new leaf . Encourage immigration and home industry . Let the mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your midst and pay you for the lumber that is now rotting in your forests . He will descend further into your mountains and bring forth the iron and coal that are lying there useless and will make use of your water power and establish large factories where now little gristmills are . The more I compare the South with the rest of the world the more I am convinced that our old institution slavery was the greatest drawback to it , and that with its abolishment a new era has begun for  | us and that in our apparent destruction we will yet find our salvation and ultimate independence . Had ours been more of a manufacturing country , we would have had more soldiers to put in the field ; there would have been no lack of rations and clothing in the army ; all material of war would have been more abundant ; the Tennesseean and North Georgian could not have said " rich man 's war and poor man 's fighting , " for the poor miners of North Georgia would have been as much interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of southwest Georgia . They would not have deserted by the company . Almost every manufactured article we had to purchase from the Yankees , though we did so not with the most kindest feeling , yet in this very grudge we paid them a high compliment , for by our employment of their enterprise and their ingenuity we acknowledged their superiority over us in these respects . Need we continue to do so : No , let us make their energy and industry our own and then their " Isms " will have to stay at home and only govern New England . The work of our political reconstruction is the least item to be achieved . A thorough reorganization of all old systems is what the South needs , and the sooner we take hold of the issue as it is before us the better it will be .  | For your personal success I have no fear ; I know you to be industrious and enterprising , but what such boys as and- and many others will do who think labor to be a disgrace , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young ladies laughed at me because I carried a glue pot across the yard . Those young ladies will have to change their opinions ere they can expect to get along under the new order of things , or labor is bound to be respected . I had completed my march through Georgia 6o years after the events which brought forth that prophecy and admonition . It seems to me , in the light of what I have seen , that Georgians are utilizing with both industry and vision their State 's resources of incomparable wealth and infinite diversity . " Empire State of the South " is no longer merely a high-sounding phrase , but is becoming once more an actuality.
