Although earth and rock are much harder substances than water , the depths of the earth have been much easier for man to reach than the depths of the water . For , although a solid is harder to penetrate initially than a fluid , once penetrated , there is a hole which offers no subsequent resistance , whereas a fluid always exerts a pressure , increasing with depth . So it happens that , although man has been down in the earth for many thousands of feet , no diver had ever until recently been down more than about 30 fathoms ( 180 ft. ) below the surface of the sea . <P> But there was a Captain Benjamin Leavitt , who was not content that this paltry 30 fathoms should be set as a lower limit to his activities . In 1922 he bought a ship , the Blakely , from the Shipping Board . He fitted her out for diving and salvaging , and laid in an equipment of patent diving suits of manganese bronze ( which resists salt water corrosion ) , with flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with portable air equipment , carrying a four-hour supply of oxygen and a telephone . <P> During the winter of 1923 a visit was made to the west coast of Chile . There , two miles off Pichidangui , was located the wreck of the British schooner Cape Horn , which went down in 1869 with a cargo of copper , lying in 53 fathoms ( 318 ft. ) of water . Captain Leavitt declares that in some of his searches he went down to 60 fathoms ( 360 ft . ) . When the wreck was discovered , a difficulty came up . At 53 fathoms it was almost pitch dark ; there was not enough light to work by . <P> So a return was made to the U. S. and special lights were , procured , incandescent vacuum lamps , with glass capable of resisting ten times ; normal air pressure , made by the Westinghouse Lamp Co . With these , the expedition set out in the Blakely just a year ago . Work was begun in March . Last week , messages were received telling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Horn . <P> The success of this feat suggests that it may be possible to salvage between $4,000,000 and $6,000,000 in gold and valuables that sank with the Lusitania . The Lusitania , sunk by a German submarine in 1915 , lies in 42 fathoms of water off the southern coast of Ireland . It opens up vistas of salvaging sunken Spanish argosies with their almost legendary treasures . <P> Even if the success of the present expedition has doubled the former range of practical diving from 30 to 60 fathoms , the fact remains that divers have barely scratched the epidermis on Father Neptune 's back , with its average depth of 2 miles .
