Island , at the western end of Hudson Straits . Nottingham Island lies off the northeastern end of Hudson Bay . just inside the straits , which appears to be somewhat off a direct line course from Cochrane to Greenland . The Greater Rockford 's wireless set is operated on a wave length of 33.8 meters , and the call letters are KHAH .

A forced landing anywhere in the 1,100 miles between Cochrane and Davis Straits would be a serious matter . Included in their equipment were rifles , fishing tackle and traps against just such an emergency as a forced landing . For an emergency night landing they carried a good supply of flares as well as powerful flashlights . Plane Unlikely to Be Sightei .

Canada Arranges to Keep in Touch . OTTAWA , Ontario , Aug. 18 ( By Canadian Press ) . ?

Greenland , should take from 16 to 18 hours . The plane is almost an exact replica of the Pride of Detroit which William S. Brock and Edward F. Schlee flew from Newfoundland across the Atlantic and then over Europe and Asia to Japan last year . It has a wing spread of slightly more than forty-six feet , a top speed of more than 120 miles an hour and a cruising speed of between ninety and one hundred miles an hour . Pilots Bert Hassel and Parker Cramer averaged more than one hundred miles an hour in their 800-mile sump from Rockford to Cochrane . The Greenland jump is 1,600 miles , and it is probable that on this longer flight the pilots , both veterans of long experience in the air first as army fliers and since the war as commercial pilots , are flying a little more slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving their engine by running it at a moderate cruising speed . Landing Fields Scarce . From Cochrane to Davis Straits the fliers are likely to see little in the OFF ON 1,600-MILE FLIGHT TO GREENLAND .
