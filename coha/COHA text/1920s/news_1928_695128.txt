txt With the nomination . of Herbert Hoover a foregone conclusion , the tense air of expectancy that usually pervades a convention on the verge of naming its candidates naturally was missing as the delegates and visitors flocked into the convention hall for the night session at which the party standardbearer for the coming national campaign was to be selected . The crowd was slow in assembling , too . The hour fixed for the evening session at which the real convention history was to be made was 7 o'clock . When the band in the gallery half an hour earlier began to tune up its instruments preparatory to bursting forth in music the convention hall was virtually empty . From that time on , however , there was an unbroken flow of humanity through the aisles . A very large proportion of the crowd that flocked into the galleries and other spaces set aside for visitors were Kansas City people who had been waiting for the nominating stage ul the convention to " take in " what to them is the biggest show the town has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for President in this very hall . Prepare Hoover Demonstration . Long before the hall began to fill , workers for Hoover were on hand distributing American flags to the // Speeches for Candidates Occupy the Night Session . // qwq delegates and horns and rise makers to give color as well i volume and variety to the joyful : monstration to be staged when . in le course of the - nominating I leeches the name of the prospective winner would be projected . - As the crowd , wa , s assembling the air in the convention hall was hot and sultry . Men and women visitors alike were seeking relief behind swiftly moving fans bearing the likeness of Hoover . In the press section many of the newspaper correspondents , stripped of coats and vests , were already settling down to the work of a busy night . Orange-colored poppies , the Hoover pre-convention emblem , were much in evidence on the coat lapels of arriving delegates and visitors . The orange poppy appears to be especially favored by women at the convention . Promptly at 7 o'clock Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , stepped to the front of the rostrum and gently tapped the desk in front of him three times with his gavel . The band was playing at the time and paid no atten tion to the injunction carrying warning to the assembly to get ready for work . Senator Moses showed a little leniency and let the crowd remain at its ease for a little longer . In the meantime the band had struck up a new tone . The voice of Moses calling the night session to order was lost in melody . In the meantime many of the delegates were trying out rattles and other noise-making devices after the fashion of little boys and little girls presented with new toys . The Connecticut delegation just before the convention convened received a message from President Coolidge through Everett Saunders , Secretary to the President , asking the Connecticut delegates not to vote for the nomination of President Coolidge as they had intended . The report that such a message had been received was confirmed by Senator Hiram Bingham of Connecticut , who said the Connecticut delegates would vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour when the gavel of Chairman Moses became insistent . At first the convention greeted the gavel tattoo by tooting tiny horns at Chairman Moses and making a noise with the rattles that almost drowned out his voice . Senator Moses announced that the vote of South Carolina on the minority farm relief plank had been recorded erroneously as eleven " no " when it should have been recorded eleven " yes . " He asked the consent of the conveniton to make the correction in the record . Calls for Nomination . After some preliminary announcement , Chairman Moses cried out : " The business will be the nomination of candidates for President . The convention cheered a little and then more when Chairman Moses said seconding speeches would be limited to five minutes . " The roll will now be called , " Mr. Moses announced . Alabama , first on the roster of States , yielded to California , the home State of Herbert Hoover . " The Chair recognizes Mr. John L. , a delegate from that State , " Mr. Moses cried out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blame it on California , but blame it on me , " said Mr. in launching his eulogy of Mr. Hoover . " My heart is in California , but I have lost my voice in Kansas City . " The convention laughed quite a lot and women in the audience beamed on the sponsor for Hoover . His nominating speech was unusual in one respect . He hurled the name of the candidate to the convention in his first three sentences , and immediately the convention responded with deafening acclaim . While there was supposed to be some 300 votes in the convention for other delegates , the mention of Hoover 's name brought practically the entire convention to their feet cheering in a frantic volume of sound that kept the hall in an uproar . Chairman Moses was banging his gavel in a half-hearted fashion , but that seemed merely to be a signal for the convention to keep right on doing what it had been doing since the name of the candidate first floated out on the convention air . The noise and the enthusiasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates . The galleries seemed strangely silent - and passive . The demonstration in the New York delegation was led by Ogden L. Mills , Under-Secretary of the Treasury , and Lieut . Col. Theodore Roosevelt . Each was operating a rattle , swung to and fro effectively above his head to produce the maximum noise . They were cheering all the time . Parade of States Started . After thirteen minutes of cheering , which started at 7:12 , the Texas and Louisiana delegations started the parade of standards of States through the hall . These were followed Ly Ohio , New Hampshire , Washington , Georgia , Alabama , California , Utah , Rhode Island , Maine , Tennessee , Colorado , Virginia , Nevada , Idaho , Arkansas , New York . Pennsylvania and all the other States which have a majority of Hoover delegates . The Utah delegation held aloft an elephant about six feet long and four feet high with a cloth bearing the inscription , " Princess Utah From the Banner Mining State . " At 7:24 a large picture of Hoover was held aloft on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The volume of cheering was so great that the band could beheard Drily faintly . For the most part the delegations from the farm States , with Lowden , Curtis , Watson and Goff delegates , kept their seats and took no part in the cheering . The Utah elephant had a hard time as its bearers tried to march through the crowded aisles . Its bearers stumbled several times but managed to keep their feet . William H. Crocker , National Committeeman from California , appeared s.t the side of the Hoover picture . At 7:30 Mr. tried to get the crowd to stop cheering so that he might resume his nominating speech . Senator Moses pounded with his gavel in an effort to restore order . the tumult died down slowly . There was a gradual cessation of noise . There were sporadic attempts to revive the demonstration . One of the last delegates to take his seat was one bearing the Lone Star banger of Texas . The galleries at this time were a little more than two-thirds filled . Resumes Hee Speech . At 7:27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was virtually one continuous uproar , Mr. resumed his nominating speech . " Will the members of the convention please resume their seats ? " shouted after the demonstration had spent itself and a semblance of order had been resumed . " You have said all you need to say , " shouted one of the New Hampshire delegates . Up in the gallery there was a stir and some one shouted a reminder that nominating speeches were to be limited to half an.hour each . Mr. got a little applause when he told the convention that the man it nominated would be the next President of the United States . The little make-believe baby elephant after its stormy progress through the aisles of the convention hall now stood at rest and looked very wise directly under the rostrum . A little red electric bulb formed the tip of its tiny trunk . Mr. 's eulogy of the candidate flowed on in even , unhurried progress to its ' finish . He is not a magnetic . orator and made no attempt to make an emotional appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services to the nation and to humanity and of his high attainments . The convention sat silent . most of the time and gave very close attention , ' seemingly . Convention Becomes Restive . By the time Mr. had reached the part Mr. Hoover bore in Mississippi flood relief work , the convention had become restive . There was a hum of undertones and much of what the sneaker said undoubtedly was lost to the crowd . As he reached the end of his speech , praising Hoover as a man " whose record had been one of surpassing usefulness , " as a man with high qualities as a statesman and an executive and as a " wholesome human being , " the convention again responder : , rizing and starting a demonstration which in earnestness and volume , if not in duration , rivaled that following the first mention of his name . Shouts for Hoover followed the end of Mr. 's nominating speech . Many of the delegates called for Hoover 's nomination by acclamation . The majority of the delegates again rose to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its banner , - a large purple and gold affair lettered with " California for Hoover . " The second demonstration was an almost repetition of the first , lacking somewhat in the spontaneity which marked the first . Some of the marchers throng the hall threw up bunches of California flowers . Connecticut , Indiana , Illinois , West Virginia , Delaware , Iowa , Wisconsin , Minnesota , North Dakota and - South Dakota , the Philippines and Alaska refused to join in the demonstration . Theodore Roosevelt carried the New York banner , beating the State standard in one hand and a rattle in the other . In the Pennsylvania delegation Secretary Mellon declined to- carry the State standard , which was carried by Eric Fisher Wood of Pittsburgh . ' Secretary Mellon did not march , wishing to avoid the jam on account of his age . He did wave the California flag as that delegation passed the seats of the Pennsylvanians . Wisconsin Men Join Parade . Some of the delegates from Wisconsin finally broke into the parade , the State standard being carried by one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration the band ? Curtis Is Next Presented . Former Representative J. N. Tincher went to the stand to place Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas in nomination . There was a real demonstration for Senator Curtis when Other delegates took up the refrain , which was punctuated by Senator Moses taking up the rhythm with his gavel . " The Secretary will call the roll of the States , " Senator Moses shouted , about twenty minutes after the demonstration started . Resumption of the rall call was delayed further by another song by the Hoover quartet . led by an accordion player . The California delegates then broke into song wtih " California , Here I Come , n Lowden Withdraws His Name . After the convention had frolicked for about twenty minutes it finally came back to a realization that nominating a candidate for President of the United States is not all fun , but serious business . Arizona , reached on the roll call , yielded to Illinois . Otis Glenn , candidate for United States Senator in that State , was recognized by the chair and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-Governor Frank 0 . Lowden in nomination , but to convey a message to the convention withdrawing his name . Mr. Glenn said that he had come before the convention to make ? a statement . which he then proceeded to read . It follows. : " I have been requested by Governor Lowden cheersto express to the gentlemen and gentlewomen of this convention his esteem . and to communicate to you this message : " ' I have stated publicly that I have not sought the nomination unless the Republican , Party were prepared to meet fully and fairly the agricultural problem . " ' I. have insisted . upon no particular remedy but- have stated at all times that if there were a better method than the so-called equalization fee I would gladly accept it . " ' I have urged , however , that it was the duty of the Republican Party to find some way that agriculture could be rescued from the ruin that threatens it . That in my judgment this convention , in the platform that - has been adopted , has failed to ' do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from before the convention . Though I cease to be a candidate , my interest in the cause is in no way abated . " ' FRANK 0 . LOWDEN . ' " There was , cheering when the announcement had been made and Mr. Glenn retired from the rostrum . Wood Presents Watson 's Name . The rollcall of States continued . When Indiana was reached . Representative Will R. Wood came forward to place Senator James E. Watz son in nomination . He received applause when he told the convention that the candidate from Indiana ' had not withdrawn , but that he was about to present the name of a candidate who was a Republican and had never wavered in his Republicanism . This sly dig at . Hoover seemed to meet with appreciation from the crowd in the galleries and the Hoosier delegates as . well as the delegates from some States not yet on the Hoover band-wagon . The crowd responded with a joyful yell . The next sign of life from the convention was long in coming . In fact , the convention did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tell about the virtues of a candidate who had no chanceof getting the nomination . There " was a stir and hum of conversation in the hall that brought Chairman Moses - forward with his handy gavel to-restore quiet . It was the work ? of seconds , however , for the audience to lapse into its old habit of seeking entertainment that the orator was not able to extend , through animated conversation that The delegates for the most part sat silent and some of them suspected that the heartiness of the demonstration might be propaganda to boom Senator Curtis for the nomination for Vice President , which was expected to be determined after consultation with Secretary Hoover over the long-distance telephone soon after the adjournment of the session . The Kansas delegates all were on their feet with their State standard held aloft . In the galleries many were shouting as Senator Moses tried vainly to get ? order to permit Mr. Tincher to proceed with his speech . The crowd , ' led by the band , again sang " The Gang 's All Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his gavel . A number of the delegates produced colored rubber balloons and began to bat them from one to another about the hall . Many of those present seemed glad of a breathing spell and many left their seats and walked around the hall . The Curtis demonstration was kept going by the Kansas delegates and the visitors to the convention , most of the latter presumably being residents . After nearly fifteen minutes ' of shouting , whistling and the swinging of rattles it looked as if the Curtis forces were out to beat the Hoover demonstration of twenty-five minutes . The Kansas delegates then started a parade . It was followed by the delegation from Oklahoma , which carried along its standard . There are only twenty-three Kansas delegates and twenty Oklahoma delegates , with the same number of alternates , but the Curtis marchers numbered more than that , some of the visitors apparently coming on the floor and joining the parade . After twenty minutes Senator Moses again tried to get the convention to resume business and beat rapidly with his gavel without effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his place at the front of the platform and shook his head at his Kansas colleagues in indication that the demonstration had gone far enough . Senator Moses shouted something that was inaudible in the hall because of the noise and then indicated in pantomine that he wished quiet so that Mr. Tincher could proceed . Mr. Tincher , a stout man with gray hair , of good platform appearance , stood patiently , but the shouting kept up . Ovation Lasts 24 Minutes . The Curtis demonstration interrupted the proceedings of the convention for twenty-four minutes , just one minute short of the time of the first Hoover demonstration . It lacked , however , the volume or spontaneity of the Hoover outbursts and seemed artificial by comparison . Mr. Tincher has a powerful voice and a vigorous manner , and he loosed both on a convention which was not at all in a receptive mood when it came to speech making for a futile candidacy . He started out by pointing out that Curtis , unlike Lowden , was a man who stood squarely on the contract the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " The Republican Party , " he said , " is rather lucky in never having to apologize for any of its declaratione of principle and party faith . It would be his program , if ? elected , to continue the program of the present Administration for the promotion of our enduring prosperity , and that is the program enunciated from this rostrum today in , the promulgation of the platform . " Outburst as Tincher Closes . The springing of tin ! name of Senator Curtis at the very tail end of Mr. Tincher 's speech gave rise to a very genuine outburst of cheering and applause on the part of the crowd . Lots ' of it came from - the galleries and the ' rest from MidWestern delegations .. ? ? The Kansas banner began to wiggle and seemed a little restive . while the band was playing to the dull booming of a tom-tom as a background of its music . It was an Indian melody in tribute to a candidate whose grandmother . was an Indian . After the Curtis demonstration had spent itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galleries , that Chairman Moses came to the front and reminded the occupants that they were where they were on sufferance and that if they would not permit the convention to get through with its work without too much delay there . were ways in which they could be attended to . " There are police r resenn " Senator Moses said with a truly menacing accent that he knows so well how to use when he.thiniss the occasion calls for it . A few derisive yells were shot into the air by some of the gallery guests , but in the main the convention took the warning of its Chairman to heart and desisted from noise-making . The roll-call of States was continued . Minnesota yielded to West Virginia . Goff Placed in Nomination . Senator Guy D. Goff was placed in nomination by A. A. Lilly of that State . " West Virginia desires to place - before . he convention her most illustrious son , illustrious in peace , illustrious in war , il '  --  ? trious in patriotic and party service . " Mr. Lilly told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican Party in West Virginia . He described him as a veteran of the World War , the son of a veteran of the Civil War , who also was a United States Senator . man . " We should name a man who is used to carrying the flag of the Republican - Party , " - Mr .. Lilly said . ' With its banner in the hands - of this intrepid leader , our party can know no defeat . We have the assurance that if he ' is selected he will make a great President . ? Our candidate is a simon ? pure Republican , four-square to . any wind that blows double-breasted . ' If nominated and elected , the Union- Jack of Great Britain will have no political significance . We offer a God-fearing , Christian gentlebecome so stifling-that many persons in the audience - had fainted and required the attendance of nurses to escort or carry them from the hall . Among those overcome was Representative Theodore E. Burton of Ohio , foremost sponsor of Hoover in Ohio . Mr. Burton recovered after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Mild applause only greeted the mention of Norris 's name .. It spent itself in less than a minute , without assistance of the  --  Chairman 's gavel . Ohioan Offers Coolidge . Representative Ralph E. Cole of Ohio was recognized when ' ' e Buckeye State was reached by Secretary Lafayette B. Gleason , who was calling the roll . " I became a candidate for delegate to the Republican National Convention to present the name of Frank B. Willis of Ohio , " said Mr. Cole . " In the midst of the campaign he was taken from us . " Mr. Cole 's second choice was Frank 0 . Lowden . " My first choice having been taken from me and my second choice having withdrawn voluntarily , " Mr. Cole continued , " I wish now to choose my third choice for President , really my first choice and the first choice of America ? since the beginning of the campaign . " A shout of " Coolidge " interrupted Mr. Wood . " I think that person must have the power to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate voted the Republican ticket in 1918 , " Mr. Cole continued , referring to the year in which Mr. Hoover seconded the appeal of President Wilson for the election of a Democratic Congress . The name of President Coolidge was received with cheers and applause of only brief duration . The convention was beginning to show signs of fatigue . Secretary Gleason reached the end of his roll-call of States without any further nominators stepping forward . Seconding Speeches Begin . in the gallery struck up the Pirates ' Chorus from Gilbert and Sullivan 's " Pirates of Penzance " and soon most of the assemblage were singing in unison , " Hail , Hail , the Gang 's All Here . " Connecticut , Indiana , Illinois , West Virginia , Kansas , Iowa , Minnesota , Oklahoma , the Dakotas and South Carolina stuck it out despite the urgings of the Hoover supporters and did not join in the parade . Several other miniature elephants , smaller than that from Utah , were held aloft and the marchers threw California poppies into the press seats . The California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover emblem during the campaign . A Hoover quartet with megaphones appeared in front of the speakers stand and sang several selections . But no one heard what they were singing , the tumult was so great . After fifteen minutes . Senator Moses tried to restore order , but it was difficult to quiet the crowd , which has had no other opportunity to cut loose during the convention . The demonstration flared up again . The California delegation began to chant : Who , who , who , oho , Hoover . Who , who , who , mho , Hoover . Warner R. Austin of Vermont , who was the first to come forward for a five-minute seconding speech for Hcover , mentioned the name of President Coolidge without evoking a ripple of applause . Mrs. Christine Bradley South of Kentucky , introduced as the daughter of a Republican Governor and United States Senator , was the first woman to step into the limelight while nominations were in - progress . She said the women of America would come to the polls and vote for Hoover as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired to cheer . Dr. John R. Hawkins , District of Columbia , a negro , made another seconding speech for Hoover . ExGovernor Samuel R. of Nebraska , followed him . This was the end of the Hoover eulogy . Next came Kansas to the front with one of her alternates , Mrs. H. J. Bornwell , who seconded the nomination of Senator Curtis . Another seconder of Curtis 's nomination was A. Scott Thompson of Miami , Okla Charles J. Schuck , a West Virginia delegate , seconded the nomination of Senator Goff . Proceeds to Balloting . ' Former Governor Blaine of Wisconsin seconded the nomination of Senator Norris of Nebraska . That ended the series of seconding speeches and at 10:45 o'clock the convention proceeded to balloting . A mighty cheer arose when Chairman George K. Morris of the Repub lican State Committee of New York cast the ninety votes of his State for Hoover . Then the votes from North Carolina gave Hoover the nomination . When the vote was announced at 11:20 o'clock-by Secretary Gleason motions were made by speakers . from States that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimous . The motion was put to : the convention , which by viva voce vote carried it , but with a robust volume of negatives . Chairman Moses , after Hoover had been declared the nominee , read a telegram to Mr. Hoover signed by himself ' in Which he congratulated the nominee and told him that the convention would appreciate a message from him before it finally adjourned . At 11:25 o'clock the convention adjourned until noon tomorrow .
