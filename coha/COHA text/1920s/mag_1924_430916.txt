 | ACCORDING h all authorities on etiquette , there are times when introductions are necessary . This is such an occasion . I wish to make the acquaintance of the million or more mothers of wage-earning girls who read Goon HOUSEKEEPING . I want to know you , because you form one of the most powerful social groups in America today . You may not appreciate your importance , but behind your round of simple tasks lies a power which is immeasurable . On you , more than on any other group of mothers , rests the responsibility for the future of the American family , its morale , its homes , without which our nation must perish . By comparison , the task of the mothers whose daughters remain at home engaged in the usual domestic and social pursuits is light . Such girls present no economic or social problem . They are following normal biological and social instincts which end in mating and mothering , in the career that is the healthiest and best for the individual woman and for society . But you mothers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desirable employees , contented workers , and at the same time you must keep alive in them those domestic instincts and tastes , those feminine interests , which will make for success in wifehood and motherhood when the temporary job in the office , store , or factory is replaced by the permanent job of marriage . And this statement is true whether your daughter earns $12 a week in the basement of a department store , receives $1200 a month for painting magazine covers , or swings $12,000 contracts in interior decorating . The normal girl is not satisfied with a business career . Neither is she satisfied with marriage unless she is properly prepared for her ultimate profession and sees it as a career . And you are the only person who can prepare her for this dual career . Now you understand why I am so anxious to know you ! - As is customary with formal introductions , I must next present my credentials , or the reasons why the Editor of Goon HOUSEKEEPING is permitting me to write to you so frankly . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-maker thirty-seven years , and a wage-earner for thirty . When my children were small , I did all my housework , from laundry to freezing ice-cream for their birthday parties . From time to time , as my income increased , I put my household goods into storage and tried boarding or hotel life , but we were never satisfied with that sort of life . Now that the children are married , I still cling to my home , because it affords certain opportunities for self-expression which no woman can find in business . An unusually generous check from an editor , or a warm and friendly letter from a reader brings me a thrill and always will , but I fairly tingled with triumph at ten o'clock the other night , when I surveyed sixteen glasses of jelly , ruddy and clear , that I had made after business hours . My hand had not lost its cunning ! All of this should give you a pretty good idea of the woman who wants to meet and talk to you , heart-to-heart , mother-fashion , about your daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been working among them , hiring and firing them , studying their reactions to business contacts , and gradually coming to realize what you mothers , and only you , can do for them . In any form of wage-earning , from  | type-writing to bond-selling , from feeding a loom to painting a picture , your daughter passes through two stages . The first may be summed up in the word " adventure " ; the second stage falls under one of two heads , absorption or resignation . During the first period your daughter will probably enjoy contact with the business and find it stimulating . If she is a potential genius in her line , every step in her progress will satisfy and delight her . But if she is the average normal girl , consiously or subconsciously she knows that shee is merely marking time in business . Eventually she will meet the right man and marry . If vou doubt this statement , you need only listen in " when a group of girls gather in the rest room of a department store or office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , or meet in trolleys and trains at the end of the day 's work . Young men talk politics or business deals or discuss market conditions , but the girls talk most eagerly about the latest engagement or marriage announcement in their set , the newest baby born to a former colleague . Just the other day , I waited patiently at the notion counter of a Fifth Avenue store while the salesgirls petted and cooed over a precious baby , brought for their inspection by the mother who had once sold pins , binding , and thimbles among them . Each in turn held the baby , while eager , gentle fingers fluffed up bows on cape , bonnet , and slippers . For them the waitingcustomer simply did not exist , and I realized that the situation was due not to the heedlessness of youth , nor indifference to their firm and its customer , but to biological instincts which , fortunately for America , mere wage-earning can not extinguish . Now , let us move on to the second stage , which is marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment or bitterness . This stage is usually reached in the early thirties . When the wageearner has been brilliantly successful , when she has become owner and head of her business , or has attained eminence in her profession or in one of the arts , she is still engrossed by her chosen work , but such women are exceptional . At thirty the average woman begins to feel the monotony if not the drudgery of wage-earning . If she has not realized the big ambition she once cherished , she now yields to discouragement . If wage-earning has nevet meant more to her than financial independence , the pretty things she wanted to wear , the pleasures , the vacations , which a payenvelope supplies , she sees exactly the same sort of life stretching ahead of her without the glamour of adventure . She first wonders why she never married , then wishes that she had . And this is not success . Naturally you want your daughter to be successful and respected as a wage-earner . You would not knowingly do anything to interfere with that success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exactions of wifehood , motherhood , and homemaking , you would not deny her the joy they bring . Your problem , concretely expressed , is this : " How can I keep alive in my daughter the domestic and mothering instinct , without diverting her mind from the work for which she is being paid ? " If your daughter is to earn the salary paid her and to be honest with her employers and herself , her work must come first during working hours . It would be manifestly unfair for you to inject into her business life the  | thought that winning a husband is more important than doing her work , whatever that may be , or to discourage her efforts to earn promotion , because you know that eventually she will leave business to marry . For her present and future happiness you must encourage her to concentrate on the tasks in hand . because those tasks are developing characteristics invaluable in the wife and the home-maker ? a sense of responsibility , powers of concentration , punctuality , and efficiency . It is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she must become hard , cold , calculating , and unsympathetic ; that she can think of nothing but her work ; that she must be " mannish , " and must not perform any domestic tasks . To deal specifically with the problem , consider the dual life of the married man . He enjoys , and is absorbed by , his work during business hours and is interested in his home after business hours . Watch him wield the lawn-mower , the garden hose . See how he builds trellises for roses and racks for tomatoes . He may not have betrayed these domestic instincts before marriage , but they came to the surface when he became head of a family . Men and Home Work I heard a bride telling her mother-in-law how successfully Jim had painted the walls of their guest room . Jim 's mother stared at him in amazement and exclaimed : " Well , marriage has wrought a miracle . I never could get you to mend a lock or put hooks in a closet . The spring painting cost me a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted a whole room over a week-end ! " Though it ended with a little laugh , the comment voiced a sense of injury and brought a flush to the cheek of the bridegroom , who replied : " Well , you see , mother , that was your house , and this is mine . A fellow feels responsible for his own home and tries to economize . " Business had not unfitted this young man for supporting and improving a home . It need not disqualify your daughter for making a home , but during her business career the front of her brain must be filled with the job she is doing , while at the back of her brain the normal instincts of the wife and the home-maker are slumbering . They will flower with marriage , if you nourish them with light home tasks and domestic interests . " But , " you exclaim , " this will require ingenuity , tact , and time on my part . I have already given many years to training and educating my daughter . I think I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " Material service need not be rendered when our daughters are physicially and financially able to do for themselves , but our spiritual responsibility remains to the end of life itself . That is what sets motherhood in a class apart from all other human relations . It is not good for you to wait on your daughter hand and foot , to mend her stockings and make her bed and pick up her clothes after she rushes off to the office , but it will be a sad day for both of you when she no longer turns to you for sympathy and advice . Business is probably working changes in your daughter which will interest you greatly , and which may have a beneficial effect on your home life . She must report for her work regularly and promptly . During her school days , if you needed her help for a day or so and she was not an ambitious student , she stayed home , and you adjusted the matter by writing a note to her teacher . If you wanted her to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not an early riser , you supplied a written excuse for her tardiness . In either case she could make up the lost time and the recitations that she had missed . @#  | In business your explanations will not count with an employer , and rarely can she make up lost time . This demand for regularity and punctuality is strengthening her character . If you will encourage her to respect the hours and regulations laid down by her employers , you will be increasing her efficiency in business , and you will find her more ready to live up to the hours and the system which you establish in your home . In business your daughter must exercise selfcontrol . Right or wrong , the orders of her employers , or her chief , must be obeyed and his opinions respected . If she deliberately disobeys orders , or is impertinent , sulky , or hysterical , she will probably lose her position . She may be right and her superior may be wrong , but if she wants to remain in his employ , she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy to her complaints about her work or her employer , but if you will discourage rebellion and counsel self-control , you will be helping your daughter to acquire the poise which is invaluable in both business and the home . Here is another fine way to connect your daughter 's business experience with your home life ? and hers . Successful commercial and industrial ventures are run on system . Very few of us mothers were trained to keep house systematically . Some of us worked out our domestic salvation through hitter experience and attained system before " efficiency " became a national slogan . Happily , our daughters in business are gaining respect for system before they marry . Why not invite your daughter to cooperate with you in managing your home as her firm runs its business ? Why not induce her to help you apply business methods to home manage-ment ? Results will be twofold . You will profit tomorrow , next week , next month , in your home , and she will profit in years to come when she becomes wife and manager in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her job , she is learning the importance of doing things in an orderly manner . Her pay envelope is teaching her the inelasticity of the dollar . The talk which she hears constantly about overhead , profit and loss , is giving her ideas which she can use in devising a household budget . Ask Your Daughter to Help Ask her to help you work out a budget for your family income . Consult her about spending the money set aside for clothes , for refurnishing the house , for charities , education , and amusement . When she feels that her business experience is counting in the house . hold management , she will pull with you and not against you . And when she has planned how the family income is to be spent , she will be interested in saving it . She will want to cut down the overhead . She will want to help you make some of the things she has been buying ready-made . She will be getting in your home the training which will prove invaluable when she makes her own home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her earning capacity . Her thoughts and tasks in the home simply carry forward the methods followed in her working hours . Under your guidance your daughter 's working hours will also represent something bigger than financial independence , mere wage-earning . Her job will become a training school for happy marriage and home life , because every day she receives practical instruction in masculine psychology . First , she sees men stripped of illusion and romance . No man is a hero to his private secretary or his co-worker . Therefore she will enter marriage unblinded by false sentimentality and illusions , and she may have the wonderful experience of finding a man more desirable , more companionable , more considerate as a husband than as an employer or fellowworker . Second , she is learning that time is money . @#  | When she marries , she will appreciate that every hour she keeps her husband away from business unnecessarily is waste . Business teaches her that her time belongs to her employers , her customers , her clients . When she marries , she will understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third , wage-earning is teaching her the tremendous value of those leisure hours . She knows what a Saturday afternoon , a Sunday morning , a holiday spent in the open means to the man who is shut up all week in a plant , store , or office . So she will spend these hours with him outdoors , even though this involves hiking , learning to play golf or tennis , steering a boat , or even knowing how to drive nails and solder all the leaks , tasks which so many women save up for the husband 's first leisure hours . Finally she is learning that unless a woman is in business with her husband , or thoroughly conversant with all the ins and outs of his business , she had better not interfere with it . She will listen to his confidences and encourage him , but she will never dictate , and , more important , never interfere with his business friendships . Are You Making Home Attractive If your daughter is to profit by the experience thus gained through working among men , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage ? womanliness , efficiency and joy in home-making , charm as a hostess . So it falls to your lot to make domestic tasks attractive to her and to give her a definite niche in your home life which she can fill after business hours . This is not so simple as applying her newly acquired business experience to the management of your household , but you will accomplish it more easily if you will start with the firm conviction that you still exert a strong influence over your daughter 's viewpoint on moral and social questions . We mothers hear so much about the independence of the modern daughter , her scorn of traditions , conventions , and parental authority , that perhaps we become hyper-sensitive and withhold cooperation and advice which are still wanted . At the beginning of this article I said that I know your daughters . Here are three little incidents which prove my statement ? and your influence . Not long ago , in the rest room of the offices where I work , I heard a group of young stenographers and filing clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After much exchange of opinion , a girl rose abruptly , jammed a little cloth cap down on her bobbed locks , and exclaimed : " Oh , what 's the use of our trying to settle this ? I 'll ask my mother tonight . " " And so will I , " said another girl , twisting a bright scarf around her slim throat . As the group dissolved , I felt quite sure that half a dozen mothers would be consulted that night . No one thought of consulting the head of her department , you see , because the question involved was social or moral , not professional . Another day I came upon a clerical worker of eighteen or nineteen reading the latest developments of a nationally exploited divorce case . I paused to glance at the sensational illustrations and then at the reader 's face . " What do you think of the case ? " I asked . She started , as from a day-dream . " Oh , I do n't know . Maybe she did some of the things her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No girl should marry a man old enough to be her father . A girl does n't know what to do , these days . Now , my mother tells me not to marry a poor man and spend the rest of my life in a kitchen , but I guess it 's better to be in a kitchen than in a divorce court . " She had been just thinking aloud , this bobbed-haired , silk-stockinged young clerk , but she had given me a close-up of her mother and her home life .  | It is unfair to implant in a girl 's mind the thought that a business career offers happy escape from monotonous domestic tasks , that marriage spells drudgery in the kitchen and nothing more . A woman whose peculiarities annoy her co-workers said to me recently : " Yes , I know I am a crank , but I am not altogether to blame . I have been cheated out of the biggest things of life . When I went into this business , my mother urged me never to marry . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nagging without any real results . I know it was hard for her in those days when father 's income was small and all the children were growing up . But now that father is making more money , and there are no children to feed , clothe , and educate , mother has nearly everything she wants , and somehow she and father have readjusted their lives . They are slipping into old age smoothly and congenially . She has had her troubles , but she has had something that I am never going to have , because she married at twenty ? and at forty-three I have n't a ghost of a chance to marry at all . She meant well , but she did n't play fair . " So much for the influence you still exert over your daughter 's social relations and her attitude toward marriage and home-making . Now for its practical application ; and again we turn to the after-business habits of her father and brother for inspiration . If they are normal and healthy men , they are not too tired for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father makes garden , tinkers about the house , throws quoits or bowls . Brother washes the family car , rides his motorcycle , goes for a hike , plays tennis , or works late on his radio apparatus . If your wage-earning daughter is normally healthy , she , too , will enjoy some different form of activity , and this should be something besides dancing and the movies . If she is too tired for any form of physical exertion , she needs medical attention . My own experience as wage-earner and employer has taught me that the worker 's body is usually to blame when the job proves too heavy . Public sentiment and legislation have improved working conditions and shortened working hours . Unless your daughter 's job is an exceptional one , it is easier than yours , less exacting on muscles and nervous system . If it is monotonous , then all the more reason why she needs some activity to relax her muscles and divert her mind . Reading Aloud If such things are made attractive to her , your daughter may enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking younger brothers and sisters or family guests to the movies , even sewing fresh frills in her office dress or making dainty lingerie while some one reads aloud . I can almost see your lip curl at the phrase , " while some one reads aloud . " You think that in this age of jazz , radio , and movies it is not done . But you are wrong Wise mothers keep up the delightful practise , which always reminds us of " Little Women " and the March family seaming sheets ! Right here in New York , life is highly stimulated by the opportunities for culture and amusement which draw us out of our homes in the evenings . We have too many lectures , concerts , operas , visiting celebrities . A few of us hard-working women decided that we were seeing too little of our own homes . We began to meet once a week , with sewing and a new book , taking turns at reading aloud . It has been delightful . It has spread from one group of our acquaintances to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private libraries prove that all over this great city families and groups of congenial friends are doing the same thing ? reading and sewing together at night . What is good for a New York business woman is good for a woman wage-earner anywhere . And anything which welds home ties is good for the individual and the nation . @#  | The officials of a community church , famous for its work among wage-earning girls , had listened to the program devised by the energetic and efficient chairman of the Girls ' Club . It included a movie night , an athletic night , anight for classes in millinery , dressmaking , and manicuring ; a get-together dinner night ; an " inspiration night , " with talks by successful men and women . There really seemed no open hour in which any girl connected with the congregation could fall into any evil companionship , yet a white-haired man actually dared to criticize the program . He suggested a " home night , " which each girl should be urged to spend with her parents and family ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at-home night " for daughters ? High rents and congested living quarters drive more daughters away from home evenings than restlessness and mere love of pleasure , and it is hard for today 's home-maker to realize that she can plan satisfying evenings for her wage-earning daughters , but it can be done , and largely by appealing to the girl 's social instinct . Suggest that your daughter give a small tea on her next half-holiday or on Sunday after- noon . Then let her plan the refreshments , buy the few flowers needed , help to cut and spread sandwiches . Or , if you prefer , let her bring ? a friend home for dinner occasionally , and make this a gala event , to which she will contribute suggestions , flowers , or favors . If she is fond of dancing , and indulges this taste away from home at a club or restaurant , suggest that she invite half a dozen friends to leave the dance early and come home for refreshments . This sort of thing appeals to her family pride and develops her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea to your own friends , a party for the younger children , consult your wage-earning daughter about refreshments and favors . She sees the new things in the shops . She enjoys being consulted . Do all you can to interest her in what the younger members of your family are doing , their school entertainments and dances . She will not consider the children a nuisance when they defer to her and make her feel that out of her business experience she can help them . I admit your original contention that all this means thought , ingenuity , and work for you , but not the half of what you would do , if your daughter remained at home , to follow a social campaign which leads directly to marriage . You would give teas and dinners and dances for her . You would fret about her frocks and entertain her suitors . And what returns you will draw in renewed companionship with your wage-earning daughter ! No one will ever hear you complain that business or a career has come between you and your daughter , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , when your daughter slips easily , naturally , from business life into a home life of her own , from wage-earning to wifehood and motherhood , her success will bring you the big thrill of your life , for you will know that you have helped her to get one hundred percent out of her job and out of life itself . i Wait for Me ( Continued from page 71 ) when , once in a while , a few days passed without word from him , she excused him quickly . Of course , he 's awfully busy . " When people smiled at her knowingly and said , " Pretty hard on you , Ermy , to have your young man go off again , " she smiled in return ; but when they added , " I suppose he 'll be coming home ore of these days and taking you back with him , " her smile grew a bit forced , and she looked away .

" But I 'm not engaged , " she said quickly . " You 're not ! " Silence fell over the room . Her mother and father both stared at her . " You see , " she hastened to explain , " we 're both pretty young , and we could n't get married for a long while ? and we do n't want to tie each other down . It seemed best ? " Her voice died away as she looked at her mother 's stricken face , " But ? but ? " she rallied quickly , " everything 's just the same . Tom 's coming back .

Erminie had expected to be busy that summer . hemming and marking the contents of her hope chest . Now there was nothing for her to do except help her mother around the house , play a little tennis with the girls , and walk down-town on errands . Erminie had never thought of having an occupation of her own , of going away and earning her living . Her future had been cut out for her for years : she was going to marry Tom .
