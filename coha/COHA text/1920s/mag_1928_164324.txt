A good deal of legend died last week with Frank Bartlette Willis . The red flares , whose fumes he inhaled fatally during his last triumphal political parade , belonged no more wholly to an old Ohio era than did he . <P> It was as a truly favorite son that he and his motorcade , preceded by militia and Boy Scouts , blared down the main street of Delaware , his home town . The entire populace had turned out , regardless of party . Other towns in Ohio , " Mother of Presidents , " had taught little Delaware how to act now that one of its own was recognizable as a candidate for the candidacy . Handsome , big-voiced Frank Willis was the man who placed President Harding in nomination . <P> When he reached the platform in Gray Chapel , on the Campus of Ohio Wesleyan University , all Delaware was massed in the seats . Marching clubs were milling about . The " President-making " Republican Glee Club of Columbus sang the late Mrs. Harding 's favorite song , " The End of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recognizing the start of a cerebral hemorrhage , muttered to his wife that he needed air . He walked across the platform , staggered through the door , fell into the arms of his secretary , Charles A. Jones . <P> A moment later , Mr. Jones whispered : " He 's gone away from us . " A political epoch had gone , too . <P> When Frank Bartlette Willis was a young school teacher , college student and professor of history and economics at Ohio Northern University ( Ada , Ohio ) , the great political names in Ohio were McKinley , Hanna , Foraker , Hay . President Garfield 's sons were still on the scene . John Sherman , Secretary of the Treasury , Senator , Secretary of State , did not die until 1900 . Ohio politics was a vivid mixture of business ( two parts ) , religion ( two parts ) and state pride ( one part ) . The twin veins of politics and religion in Mark Hanna appeared as twin veins of business and religion in Ohio 's great industrialists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Gambles and Procters of Cincinnati . A purer vein of religious sentiment was springing forth in a southern county as the Anti-Saloon League . The industrial vein was becoming purer , too , as Ohio grew and diversified with rolling mills at Youngstown , rubber at Akron , motor cars ( Packard ) at Warren , ore and paint at Cleveland , liquor at Cincinnati . More numerous and politically potent than all were Ohio 's farmers . State pride in " home grown " products was the bond used by the politicians to tie the whole State together . <P> Frank Bartlette Willis , farmer 's son , was " home grown " even more consciously and thoroughly than his outstanding contemporaries , Warren G. Harding and James M. Cox . He did not live to outgrow Ohio , like a William Howard Taft or a Theodore Elijah Burton . He would have resented the suggestion that he could ever outgrow Ohio . He died as he could only have wished to die , of red fire and political excitement , just after shaking the hand and naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Governor and Senator he had been . Anti-Saloon League champion and lion of small-town Ohioans , he remained . President he was not destined to be but he died at the peak of his endeavor in that direction . Ohio wept him . The Senate mourned him . The country noticed that he was gone .
