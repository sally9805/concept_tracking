U. S. Coast Guard Cutter C-209 , patrolling the U. S. shore of Lake Erie for rumrunners last week , sighted a trim yacht . Blam ! went the C-209 's one-pounder . Blam ! Blam ! <P> Five " spouts near the yacht 's bow and stern showed how close the shells had flown . Good work . The yacht was heaving to . Acting Commander S. P. Johnson bade his men cease firing . The C-209 bore fleetly down on her suspect . <P> But something akin to dismay must have filled Commander Johnson 's official bosom when he discerned that the yacht was flying the ensign of the Buffalo Yacht Club ; that it had ladies aboard ; that its male passengers , vociferously innocent , were irate . Dismay must have become consternation foi Commander Johnson when the yacht 's owner told the U. S. press how the C-209 had given no warning , offered no apology . Worst of all , the outraged owner was Frank G. Raichle of Buffalo , law partner of Col. William J. ( " Wild Bill " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General . <P> Bad enough to have stirred up the citizens of western New York with another " mistaken " Coast Guard shooting , after the recent blinding of Jacob D. Hanson of Niagara Falls ( TIME , May 21 ) . Worse to have shot so close to officialdom . Yachtsman Raichle , who may well have been returning from a legal visit to Wet Canada , foreboded a hard time for the C-209 in his ejaculation : " It 's worse than warfare ! "
