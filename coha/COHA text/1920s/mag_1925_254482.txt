U. S. President Calvin Coolidge 's award in the Tacna-Arica dispute between Chile and Peru ( TIME , Mar. 16 ) was read with great rejoicing in the former country and with passive indignation in the latter . <P> In Chile , President Coolidge 's decision was expected to strengthen the hand of the returning President , Arturo Allessandri- granted an obligatory vacation by a Military Junto last summer ( TIME , Sept. 22 ) - by snapping a weapon in the hands of his enemies , who had freely criticized him for submitting the Tacna-Arica award to Washington . <P> In Peru , President Agusto Leguia expressed himself to Washington as pleased with the award ; both Houses of the Peruvian Congress passed favorable resolutions toward it , promised the President their support in fulfilling the terms of the decision . As Peru is generally held to have lost forever the two Provinces of Tacna and Arica by virtue of the fact that a plebiscite is sure to go against her , the official attitude of the President and Congress was possibly nothing more than diplomacy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Peruvians were hotly incensed at the award , and were about to become violent .
