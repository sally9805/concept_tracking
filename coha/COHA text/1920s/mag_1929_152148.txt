While the British Parliament opened and argued , His Majesty the King-Emperor returned in triumph to London . Still wan and droop-shouldered , King George motored from Windsor to sooty Albert Hall , opposite Kensington Gardens . There state landaus and a squadron of gleaming , clanking life guards awaited him . Smiling happily , with a white tea rose on the lapel of his impeccable morning coat , he entered the first carriage with Queen Mary , regal as ever in a gold colored coat and fur-trimmed hat . Through Hyde Park , down Piccadilly the procession trotted , past cheering crowds . <P> From a balcony of the Duke of York 's home in Piccadilly little Princess Elizabeth climbed the railing excitedly waiting for the parade . Unfeeling grown-ups pulled her down , made her change her dress . In a clean pink frock and uncomfortable gloves she reappeared on the balcony , just in time . <P> Tearing off her gloves to clap louder , she saw the horse guards and the King 's carriage just turning the corner . <P> " Gran'pa ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Look ! You clap too !

King George was promised the summer at Sandringham , his favorite summer home . <P> The King-Emperor is one of the six or seven finest wing shots in England . To console him for the loss of the Scotch shooting , the Sandringham gamekeeper announccd that Sandringham coverts are unusually well-stocked this year . Last week Lord Stamfordham , the King 's private secretary , ordered a pair of guns a few ounces lighter than those His Majesty used before his illness , from Purdey , famed gunsmith . <P> Royal physicians pondered last week a suitable place for King George to spend the winter .

" <P> The royal physicians inquired for a suitable winter residence in South Africa where the summer sun shines all winter ; where Queen Mary 's brother , Earl of Athlone is Governor-General ; where guinea hens , bustards await the royal gun . <P> The most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang , Archbishop of Canterbury , in gold embroidered cape , croisier in hand , stood before the altar of Westminster Abbey . Heavy drums of the guards brigade rolled thunderously . Cried the Archbishop : <P> " God save the King ! " <P> " God save this realm ! " <P> " God give us thankful hearts ! " <P> Followed a fanfare of trumpets . These military sounds in the House of God prefaced a great thanksgiving service for the King 's recovery .
