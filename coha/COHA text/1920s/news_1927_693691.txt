txt Who Discovered America ? In a recent issue you have published a letter from Senor Francisco Sinol , wino writes from New London , Conn. , complaining of the injustice done to that dear Spain by Sailing to distinguish between Basques and Basques : to wit , between Basques on the Spanish side and Basques on ' tother ' side of the Pyrenees . Now this may at first blush appear to be a grievous fault : but whether a Basque basks on the north or on the south side of that interesting string of mountains does not seem to be a paramount issue to an average Yank . Why split hairs about the Basque pilots of Columbus ? Neither Columbus nor the Basques deserve credit or consideration as discoverers of America . It is nothing short of silly to debate the academic question whether the laurels of discovery should be assigned to Columbus . or whether they should be bestowed upon " the unknown Basque , " In face of the luminous historic fact that the young Icelander Leif Ericsson was the first white man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . and to establish a colony of which the monuments are visibly before us this day .
