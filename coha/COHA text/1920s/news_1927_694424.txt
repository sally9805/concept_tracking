txt The organizers of the annual exhibitions of art at Pittsburgh have suffered criticism if not gladly at least with extreme patience . The conservatives have found them too adventurous , the progressives have found them too r.actionary . This year they had a jury of award bent upon recognizing the " new " movement in art before it totters into its slippered age . In choosing HENRI IsIATISSE as the recipient of the first prize the jury may have had all the double intentions and motives that have been attributed to them . What they actually have done , however , is to put themselves on record as recognizing the importance in his profession of an artist who , for thirty years or more , has changefully yet consistently pursued the path of exploration , digging into the future instead of into the past , and who thus , at the age of fiftyeight , offers the one best testimony that this new school of which he is an old leader has staying quality  --  the survival and increased significance of his own work . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ditch successfully crossed , and for MATISSE Pittsburgh was the last ditch . What it was for the artist is not the root of the matter for others . There is a huge public that but for the news element in this occasion would be cheerfully unaware of MATISSE and Pittsburgh and the prize . They are concerned with such exhibitions only to the degree of their sharing in the opportunities for liberal education offered by America to all the members of her heterogeneous family . They are only indirectly concerned with the decision of an art gallery , known for its caution , to substitute education for teaching , to gille its visitors the chance to judge for ! ' themselves and thus strengthen their power of discrimination . The importance of this decision lies chiefly in its contribution to America 's attitude toward . her future : whether she shall erect - for herself an ivory tower of isolation and exclusiveness , or Welcome all intelligent effort in the arts as in the sciences to solve new problems and increase the mental equipment of the race . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century who have sought and found new modes of expression , if they have kept their direction long enough to prove their steering power , should be of benefit to America in her attempt to solve her own new and terrific problem : that of amalgamating in one nation all the races of the world and producing a civilization to which knowledge of everything in the world must contribute . Her culture may be founded in the best that has been done and thought in the past , but it must extend to the best of all that is being done and thought today , making out of this fluid material a standard formed by innumerable discriminations . Therefore let the public look at pictures , old style and new . This suggestion might seem superfluous were it not for our tendency to look instead at our own state of mind . JAN GORDON tells the story of a frame-maker who was given a ticket to an exhibition . After his return he was asked how he liked it . " Shoddy stuff , shoddy stuff , " he said mournfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters , " his interlocutor exclaimed . " Oh , the pictures ! " he said . " I did n't look at the pictures , I was talking about the frames . "
