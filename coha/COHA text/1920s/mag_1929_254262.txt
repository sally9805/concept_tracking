The White Mountain Express stopped one day last week at Northampton , Mass. , to take aboard a sandy-haired man carrying a small black bag marked C. C. He took a seat in the Pullman drawing room , leaving the door open . School girls raced through the car , peeked in at him , giggled . He shut the door . <P> His train arrived at the Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan at 7.45 p.m . People cheered . He lifted a brown fedora hat in response . He went to room 1423 ( a $25-per-day suite ) in the Hotel Commodore , adjoining the station . There , barricaded against the world , Calvin Coolidge attended to private business . <P> To his room went Editor Ray Long of William Randolph Hearst 's Cosmopolitan ; Joseph Anthony of the Cosmopolitan Book Co. ; Arthur S. Draper , an editor of the New York Herald Tribune . Reporters were held at arm 's length by a hotel detective . Good Friend Frank Waterman Stearns was present as a smiling but non-communicative buffer . One man . seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter to the Coolidge suite a silver salt shaker but no explanation . Mr. Coolidge was puzzled . <P> After 40 hours , Mr. Coolidge left his hotel suite , descended to the station . Walking on the platform to his noon train , he confided : " Well ... I just came down ... to see a few publishers and a few friends . I have been trying to get back to private life and you fellows newsgatherers will have to help me . " <P> Chimed in Friend Stearns : " Mr. Coolidge is trying hard to be a private citizen . "
