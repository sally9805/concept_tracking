After seven sweltering days of conference in Indianapolis , the Policy Committee of the United Mine Workers of America last week voted to accept what was called " Labor 's greatest defeat in years . " The question was , and had been for some time , whether to relinquish to district vote the authority long exercised by the United Mine Workers ' national officers over wage-agreements in the bituminous coal fields . <P> The wage-agreement upon which the district leaders , especially those from Illinois , who called the Policy Committee 's meeting , wanted local autonomy , was the bitterly disputed scale established four years ago at Jacksonville , Fla. - $7.50 per day or $1.08 per ton ( for tonnage workers ) . <P> Long before the time-limit of the Jacksonville agreement was reached , operators began " welshing , " to meet non-union competition . On April 1 , 1927 , when the agreement expired , began the general bituminous strike , a strike that is not settled yet . Through successive months of hope , doggedness , anger , misery , squalor , International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take " no backward step " from their demands for continuance of Jacksonville rates . Many an operator went bankrupt . Many a head was broken in fights between union pickets and company " scabs " or police . The strong companies remanned their mines with non-union men . <P> It was to save the local unions in the one State where they had not suffered inroads that the Illinois men agitated for local option on the Jacksonville agreement , and got it . WThether or not the action came too late to help locals in other States , whether International President Lewis had carried his doggedness irretrievably far , remained to be seen . The first overture for local readjustment , by Ohio 's union miners to Ohio 's operators , was flatly rebuffed last week . President S. H. Robbins of the Ohio Coal Operators Association said : " . . . not interested . . . will have no further dealings with the United Mine Workers of America . " <P> In Pittsburgh , potent operators commented : <P> " We are through with the United Mine Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners ' union that may come into being . . . . "
