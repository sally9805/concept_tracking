Red Rust demonstrates that whereas few outsiders know what is happening in Russia , the Russians themselves are beginning to find out . A Soviet satire by V. Kirchon and A. Ouspensky , its hero is a great-nosed fellow called Terekhine who uses his prestige as a revolutionary soldier to bully his comrades and preempt their women . When Nina , whose " bourgeois " yearnings for wifehood and maternity have not been stifled by propaganda , tells Terekhine she is pregnant , he curses . When he has persuaded her to have an abortion and she still pesters him , he murders her . <P> The play ends with Terekhine 's crime discovered and his punishment in the offing . He obviously represents the gamut of hypocritical , cruel , supremely selfish obstacles to the Soviet ideal . At one point he rehearses a speech about hunger with his mouth full of bread and beer . But even as Terekhine is apprehended , so the authors seem to imply that the Soviet cause will ultimately be purified . Full of good talk and temperamental skirmishes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first production of the Theatre Guild Studio , experimental offshoot of the Theatre Guild employing its younger members . Herbert J. Biberman , onetime Guild stage manager and product of Professor George Pierce Baker 's Yale School of Drama , directed the play and appears to great advantage as the sardonic , vicious Terekhine . <P> Michael and Mary . A. A. Milne is an inveterate romancer and everything he writes he invests with storybook sweetnesses which delight some people , make others feel bilious . The intrusion of severe ethical concerns into Mr. Milne 's pink and downy world would be as incongruous as the speculations of Kant in the mouth of a Fauntleroy . Yet that is what occurs in his newest play . <P> Michael meets Mary in the British Museum . She has been deserted by a bounder of a husband , is destitute , and consequently profits greatly by the loans which Michael persuades her to accept . Striving toward greater respectability than the law allows them , the two are married , thus laying themselves open to prosecution for bigamy . Of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael , who is by this time a prosperous novelist , the scoundrel 's insolence leads to a scuffle and he falls dead of a heart attack . Still seeking the highest moral good , Michael and Mary decide to conceal the truth of the incident from the courts for their son 's sake . A decade later , when Michael explains the whole history to the boy and informs him that he is a bastard , the boy offers not the slightest objection . <P> The play reminds you how absorbing ethical problems may be , even when they arise among such pastel make-believes as Mr. Milne 's characters . And though his answers are questionable , Mr. Milne knows how to dramatize his questions . The moral excitements are excellently stirred by Henry Hull and Edith Barrett , while Harry Beresford 's vignette of a London bobby is beyond praise .
