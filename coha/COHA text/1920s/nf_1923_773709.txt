txt // of our knowledge both of mind and body , and the nature of volition and human individuality . It is impossible to consider the problem of the Unity of the Universe , without taking into account the natures of space , causality , ' pur-pose , time , evolution , human individuality . Since , in phi-losophy , one big problem always leads us into others , the justification of such a division as that proposed above is that it affords the plan for an orderly conspectus and treatment of the whole field . The following treatment aims only at a discussion of the central problems in an elementary fashion . Therefore , I shall not spread it out rigidly upon the lines of the above division . I shall aim rather to discuss the central problems and theories , in the order of their emergence into prominence in the history of modern thought , and with regard to the way in which they lead into one another . The attentive reader will note that , broadly , the treatment does correspond to the order out-lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de-velopment of modern philosophy . The great seventeenth century systems on the continent of Europe were primarily cosmologies , Locke and Hume emphasized psychological , ethical , and political problems , with Kant the emphasis , in continental philosophy , shifted to psychology , theory of knowledge and ethics . Kant 's successors , Fichte and Hegel , attempted psychological , ethical and social cosmologies . They sought to read the meaning of the universe in terms of a broadly and profoundly conceived philosophy of human nature . CHAPTER XV DUALISM This theory assumes that there are two distinct substances . In the human individual they interact . This is the common sense view . It is based on what appear to be glaring distinctions . When we will , a mental process , we determine a bodily movement . In tight places we frequently discover that we can do things with our bodies that we never thought we could do , for example , in situations of fright , and in athletic contests , et cetera . Conversely , bodily conditions influence mental processes . When , however , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that they are sharply contrasted . While body is a divisible mass , extended in space , mind is an indivisible unity , having no mass or extensity . Again , body seems at all times to be determined from without , while mind is a self-determining , self-directing principle . Mind has interests and seeks to realize values . It is purposive and develops new interests and values , and continually devises new means to realize its values . The dualistic theory thus seems to be based on obvious facts and contrasts in respect to the relation of mind and body . The Cartesian dualist says that the body apart from mind is mechanical , a system of juxtaposed points moving in space . The living organism is a machine . If there were in it no mind , it would still exhibit the same motions which it now manifests . Heat , as agitation of particles , is the cause of motions of the heart . Fine particles of blood pass to the brain . Thus , the heart gives rise to fine ethereal 201 // flames forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels which conduct the animal spirits . Animals are pure automata , since they have no souls . Except far the influence of thought , men are likewise automata Such was Descartes ' view . Thus , extreme Dualism affirms the substantial reality of two sharply contrasted kinds of being , which may interact at specific points , to wit in human organisms . These beings or substances or entities are MATTER OR BODY , which MIND OR SPIRIT , which is Extended in space , is Un.extended , Consists of juxtaposed A Unity whose various asparts , pects are Hence is Divisible , Liseparable features of Ponderable , and the Moves through the impact , One , Indivisible , pressure , and pull of other Imponderable , and bits of matter or by virtue Self-active pulsation of of its own weight . Thinking itself . // It is necessary to distinguish clearly between Naive and Sophisticated Dualism . Common sense or Naive Dualism holds that body or matter is just what we perceive to exist in the external world , by the means of our senses . Likewise Mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think and will . But a little reflection suffices to show that what we perceive depends in part : ( 1 ) On the momentary condition , as well as on the permanent structure , of our sense organs ; ( 2 ) on the images and concepts which embody the results of social and racial experience , handed down to us through tradition , and which are to some extent supplemented by the previous findings of our individual experience , reflection , and memory ; and ( 3 ) on the fact that our perceptions are also influenced by our spatial positions and our emotional prejudices and desires . Thus sophistication begins , and , with it , the process of drawing into the mind or subject what naive belief puts in the object . The first step in this process of sophistication is exemplified in ancient Atomism and in the Dualism of Descartes and Locke . I. CARTESIAN AND LOCKEIAN DUALISM Descartes and Locke are in substantial agreement as to the respective natures and relations of bodies and minds . Bodies are made up of minute particles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Descartes , for anything which occupies space must be indefinitely divisible . But they are mass particles . These differ in shape , size , and rate and figure of motion . Magnitude , extension , figure , and motion are clear and distinct ideas of matter , and , therefore , true ( Descartes , fifth Meditation ) . Gross bodies , perceived through our senses , consist of configurations of mass particles . For Descartes , space is the same as material substance , and thought is the same as mental sub204 THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY stance . Locke holds that solidity also is. a property of bodies in themselves . Thus , for him , the qualities which mass particles ( the term he uses is " corpuscles " ) , the constituents of bodies , possess in themselves are size , shape , mass , and movement . Because of the grossness of our senses , we do not perceive the mass particles , but there is a rough correspondence between the spatial qualities that we perceive in bodies and the primary qualities of real bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how of interaction Descartes vacillates . The view which he seems to favor most is that the animal , spirits , a purely mechanical process generated in the heart , is carried to the brain and , in the pineal gland , influences and is influenced by the mind ; and thus , in turn , enables the mind to control physiological movements . Locke simply accepts interaction as a patent though an inexplicable fact . He says that it is possible , though not probable , that a certain system of matter might think . It is improbable , since thought seems to be more than the effect of the mechanical interaction of particles juxtaposed in space . But , on the whole , he believes in two different substances which interact . But we do not know the natures of substances ; we assume them as " the unknown support of known qualities . " Material substance is the unknown support of the primary qualities of empirical bodies ; mental substance is the unknown support of thought arid volition . With respect to matter , Locke approaches very closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them being that Kant makes space a mental form of perception , whereas Locke makes it a physical reality . With respect to the ultimate natures of substances , both are agnostics . Both say that while we can not help believing in substances , we do not know what these are in themselves . We have genuine empirical knowledge only of their appearances to the mind . Locke holds // that we do not know how one body can act on another body any better than we know how mind and body can act on one another . We must simply accept the inexplicable facts in both cases . II . KANTIAN OR AGNOSTIC DITALISM Kant , the main features of whose philosophy are best considered in another connection , is significant here , because his dualism is a halfway house on the road to Idealism or Spiritualism . Cartesianism puts the secondary qualities of bodies , such as sounds , colors , tastes , and odors , in the subject , and leaves space and time as objectively or physically real determination of bodies ; thus laying itself open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistency . Kant puts space and time in the subject , and leaves only an unknown something , an X , as the objective ground of sensation . Space and Time are in the mind ; the mind is not in space and time ; thus we escape the difficulty of attempting to conceive how the mind can act on or be acted upon by spatial objects . We do not and can not know the nature of the objective ground of our sense experiences . But we do know that the whole order of bodies , as these exist for common sense and science , is phenomenal reality , ' not ultimate reality . The difficulty with Kant 's doctrine is that he fails to explain by what right , on his premises , we assume at all that experience has an objective ground . In order to do so , we must apply the concept of causality beyond the limits of experience ; that is , we ask for a cause of our sensations , and , according to Kant , causality , like our other mental forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Idealist , is more logical than Kant at this point . He argues that , since all sense qualities depend on a mind , and since I can not explain my own sense perce THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY tions as created by my own mind , while , at the same time , I know that I am a true cause of changes in the world , therefore my sense perceptions must be produced in my mind by the activity of some other mind . Thus the process , begun in Cartesianism , of taking the sense qualities into the mind or subject , ends in Berkeley in the whole world being regarded as a society of interacting or intercommunicating subjects or selves . III . CRITICISM OF DUALISM What are some of the objections to this theory ? First of all , it is inconceivable and inexplicable how an unextended principle can act upon an extended principle ; because of this it is said that the relation can not be explained . To this objection , however , the dualist may reply that many inconceivable things are facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be guided by facts rather than by considerations of inconceivability . The second objection to dualism is this : That if mind acts on body , then the principle of the " conservation of energy " is violated . This principle is the statement that , in all changes or transformations of energy in the physical series , there is a mathematical equivalence . So touch energy of one kind produces so much energy of another kind . Throughout the series there is a constancy , there is a strict quantitative equivalence , thus precluding either the creation or destruction of energy . Now , in the interaction of the dualist , there is energy injected into the physical series by the action of the mind on the body , and this injection means the destruction of the principle of the conservation of energy . To this objection the dualist may reply : The amount of energy injected into the physical series by mind is too small to be detected by our most refined instruments . The objector would object again to this reply by saying , // that , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the conservation of energy . A still further dualistic reply might be something like that which Lotze indicated , namely , the passage from the one series to the other is on the whole balanced , and there is thus no loss or gain . This also is very plausible , but it entangles the dualist in a further difficulty and one of such a character that , if the dualist adheres to it , he ceases to be a dualist . If energy can thus be interchanged , then energy is the common denominator of both series , and mind and matter are only forms of a common principle . The dualist has still a third answer , which is to the effect that the mind directs the body but uses no energy in so doing . The advocate of this view might point , for example , to an engineer directing a great engine by a small lever , or , to such an incident as President Wilson pressing a button at Washington , thus setting in motion all the machinery in a large exhibit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pressed the button ? so this answer also is invalid . Still a fourth reply might be given by the dualist . He may argue that the principle of the conservation of energy is a working hypothesis for the physicist , when dealing with strains and tensions , and with the mathematical relations of mass particles . He finds that the principle works , but his point of view , says the dualist , is abstract , and from a total point of view there is no reason for assuming that the physical series is a closed one . The standpoint of physics is partial or abstract , that of philosophy total or concrete . When we take the whole of experience into account , it is seen to be too complex for one to be justified in saying that the principle of the conservation of energy is absolutely valid . This principle when considered in connection with the second law of thermodynamics ( the entropy of a physical pystem tends to increase ) breaks down as an ultimate // principle for interpreting experience . In actual physical changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available heat energy . In the doing of work , energy is passing from available to unavailable forms , from unequal to equal temperatures . Energy generated by a waterfall may be harnessed and made to drive wheels or other types of machines . But a large proportion of the energy of the waterfall is dissipated in the form of heat . If the sum total of energy in the universe is constant , and if the doing of work always involves the passage of energy from available to unavailable forms , then either the universe is finite in duration , or there is a creative source of energy which compensates for the passage of available into unavailable forms . If we do not assume this , then we must assume that the universe is running down , that is , is tending to equilibrium , and that the time is coming when there will be nothing doing . If the universe has existed through infinite time , then it must have run down long ago . Infinite energy , in amount , is not a sum total ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has no meaning ; a universe consisting of a definite quantity of energy , however great , would be finite . A universe which had no beginning is not finite and it can have no ending . Thus we are led to the view that the universe can not be a perpetual motion machine containing a definite quantum of energy . The second law of thermodynamics , when thought out. , requires us to assume , if the universe is endless in duration , a Creative Source of Energy . The discussion of the above point brings us directly to another problem , namely , what do we mean by matter ? Common sense dualism holds the view that matter is what we perceive . When the dualist believes in interaction , he means to say that an unextended entity is seated somewhere in the brain and directs it . Descartes got himself into inextricable difficulties in trying to square the theory that // the human body is a pure machine with the recognition of the soul or mind as an original source of volition and thinking . The scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , and the difference is seen in the fact that the man in the street is a naive realist as regards the problem of our knowledge of reality . He believes that the real , external world is just what we perceive , and exists , just as we perceive it , independently of our perceptions . The idealist points out that what we perceive does not exist independently of our perceiving it . The world of experience is , he shows , a world of sense qualities . It is a congeries of sense qualities having temporal and spatial relations . Now sense qualities are just things perceived by minds . The idealist asks this question of the naive realist . If sense qualities , which are all that you perceive , are independent of the mind , how do they exist when no mind perceives them ? Is there color when no one is looking ? Is there sound when no one is listening ? Sometime ago I read a book entitled , Light , Visible and Invisible . Such a title is really tantamount to the expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is nonsense . If the naive realist says that he thinks the perceived sense qualities are independent of mind , what is the nature of these qualities when not perceived ? If I were to bring before a class a band of colors , without a doubt the girls would recognize the differences between them better than the boys . Were there a number of musical instruments played here now , many of you would recognize distinctions which others would not hear at all . We do not all agree either as to the number of sense qualities perceivable , for example , in the case of colors or music ; nor as to the relations of space , time , and intensity in sense qualities . Sense qualities are variable functions depending on variations in the senses , mental and physical habits , interests , et cetera . That which exists // apart from our perceiving is nothing but the abstract possibility of further perceiving . Then what exists in the moment of perception is not matter , but experience . The physical world is just this possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we mean by the physical world , the idealist argues , is something that can be perceived , if there be someone to perceive it , and can be perceived by all percipients . Now , we do not all agree as to its qualities and relations , but we attempt to overcome this subjective perceptive standpoint by means of quantitative ratios which serve as tests of commonness or social perceptibility , and it is this that is the basis of our belief in the external world . The latter is the realm of common or social percepts and perceivables . Now the question arises what is matter in itself , or as it is apart from perception and experience ? The scientific dualist , who believes in an independent matter , says to the idealist , you must admit that something independently real is the cause of what we perceive . To perceive there must be an objective cause or ground of our perception . We do distinguish , says the dualist , between perceptions and images , between realities and illusions . Were I to say to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this room , you would immediately think I am experiencing illusions . The victim of delirium tremens sees snakes crawling about him , but we can neither see them nor touch them . We do not have the same images and perceptions that he has . His visual images are incoherent with tactual percepts and with all our percepts . Thus we say he is in an abnormal condition , whereas we are normal . Illusion is thus a test of the distinction between appearance and reality . We say that that which resists our wills , our purposes and intents , is reality , but objects which do not resist or modify our wills , we say are illusions . We say that the thing which we can not // resist is real . The meaning of this is that we call that real wherein the qualities of our sense organs are con-firmed by the experiences of the other senses and , more especially , by the experiences of other selves . The scientific dualist , who differs radically from the scientific materialist , says that what really exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having no secondary qualities . He conceives a world of no color , no taste , no smell , no temperature , no sound . It is this world that really and independently exists . It is a world of mass particles moving in space and time . But , impressed by the fact that mind or thought and volition do seem to be real causal factors at some points in the physical process , and unable to conceive , either how mind can be produced , by the motion of mass particles , or how mind and body can interact , the scientific dualist is content to affirm the facts , and to admit that he does not understand the how or particular go of the interaction . He is unwilling to let the passion for intellectual unification ride roughshod over facts and obliterate what seem to him fundamental distinctions and relations . CHAPTER XVI MATERIALISM I. THE SCIENTIFIC NOTION OF ' MATERIAL SUBSTANCE The scientific dualist , naive dualist , materialist , and idealist , all agree with the man in the street in that they unanimously admit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they assert , there is something outside our own minds . A disagreement emerges , however , as to what this something really is and , consequently , as to how that external something is known , how it acts upon , and is acted upon by the human mind . The lecture desk before me is as I perceive it , urges the man in the street . Its existence is independent of me . We know , however , that the desk as I perceive it is in some fashion a function of many variables , to wit : sense organs , nerve currents , my position , my interests , my attention , my previous experience and ideas . An African savage could not perceive this desk before me just as I perceive it . It would not mean " desk " to him . What we perceive is largely determined by our already achieved mental structure and outlook . In view of this , what is the factor that is independent of my perceiving ? Many say that this object before me is a mere appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its appearances . The scientific dualist maintains , as against the materialist , that there are two kinds of being , mind and matter . The materialist says that there is only one kind of being , and that is matter . The attitude 212 // of the materialist is indicated by the old adage : What is mind ? Answer : It is no matter . What is matter ? Answer : Never mind . The advocate of material substance admits that the qualities which we perceive in the external world are in part dependent on our organism . Ile admits that colors and other secondary qualities are phenomena . They are the joint resultants of external substance and of our percipient organism . What then is the nature of this independent substance or matter ? In many of the older forms of the substance theory , it consists of mass particles in motion . It is an aggregate of minute bodies having mass , density , and varying in size , and perhaps in shape . In terms of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a percipient organism for which they exist . Body in itself consists of these minute particles in motion . In perceiving primary qualities , we have a copy of being as it is . Molecules in motion is thus the make-up of matter . Recently this Lockian notion has been greatly modified and we now have a more dynamic conception . In place of mass particles in motion , we now have the view that mass particles are but nodal points of energy . Matter therefore is the result of the action , on our sense organs , of centers of electrical charges . In the highly elastic , frictionless , imponderable ether are centers of strain , and these strain centers are the electrons . Our sense organs and brain are themselves constellations of electrons . This newer theory makes matter to consist of nonmatter in motion . There are , however , many difficulties involved in this notion of the enormously strong ether , as well as in the assumption of an independent substance different in kind from what we perceive and yet assumed to be the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory are in part identical with Berkeley 's . The first difficulty is as to how the advocate of an independent material substance is justified in his conception that , while secondary qualities have no correlates in matter itself , the primary qualities do represent properties that are inherent in matter . Locke and Descartes are in agreement on this point . The secondary qualities , they both say , are produced in us by the action of particles that actually possess the primary qualities . This is an assumption , and is for many purposes highly convenient . But this assumption is not thoroughly logical . Why not ? No one ever perceived primary qualities without secondary qualities , neither did anyone ever perceive secondary qualities unaccompanied by primary qualities . There is no such thing as one set of these qualities without the other . The disjunction seems forced upon us that either all the qualities are in the percipient organism or all are in the object . ' The advocate of material substance says that primary qualities are in the object , for the reason that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities do vary and therefore are in me . But primary qualities are perceived by us just as are the secondary , and the primary qualities do vary , although less markedly than the secondary . Either none of these qualities testify to independent substance or all of them do . The Lockian distinction is illogical . The advocate of material substance is not yet silenced . He will say , " I admit that , // but there must be something external which exists , some cause independent of our will and imagination . What is it ? " The advocate of an independent substance insists that there is something independent of the mind . Let us look at the most serious difficulty involved in this assumption of a material substance . Naively , we all assume and believe in an independent substance . We be-lieve in it until we reflect a moment on the difficulties that are involved . But most of us after reflecting , forth-with go back on our reflection and still believe in an inde-pendent material substance . We are like the man spoken of by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass : for he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was . " We assume that the world as we perceive it , is a part of an independent reality . But the variability of our perceptions ceaselessly operates against this assumption . Two men in the same field do not see identically the same field . Two men before a great mountain do not perceive identically the same mountain . We are told that what really exists is a material sub-stance , but on analysis this material substance is not the common world of our experience ; it is a substitute for it . It is something which by hypothesis can never be directly experienced . What then is the relation of this world of supposed substance to our common world ? Here we get no cogent answer . John Locke says that our knowledge is a sort of poor copy of the external world . The huge assump-tion made here Locke never was fully conscious of . IIow do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a copy of an original . How do we know that our knowledge is a copy ? If , by hypothesis , we never could know the independent material substance , then how could we ever tell that our knowledge is a copy of the material sub-stance ? This is the greatest difficulty with this standpoint . // By what transcendental sense could these men perceive the original ' ? Two further difficulties remain : ( 1 ) How can mass particles , or mass points , produce in us the sensations of color , sound , touch , taste , smell , heat ? This difficulty is , perhaps , no more serious than the converse one as to how the mind can influence physical things . ( 2 ) The substrate or real external cause of visual sensation is wave motion in the ether , we are told ; of sound , undulations of air particles ; of touch , mechanical contact ; of taste and smell , chemical changes ; of heat , the rapid agitation of molecules . If , then , there be one real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common ground of all these changes , which are specific causes of specific sensations . We have ethereal theories of the physical substrate of color , electricity , and magnetism ; but none that are plausible as a physical basis for smells , tastes , and sounds . We have electronic theories of electricity and radioactivity , and an attempt at electronic theories of gravitation and inertia ; but no well-worked out theory which makes it clear how all kinds of physical stimuli can be regarded as modifications of one substrate or substance . The reduction of the various types of quality in nature , as we perceive nature , to one consistent type of spatial thing-in-motion , is far from having been attained . Perhaps , it is better to admit that nature is not so simple and homogeneous as the doctrine of one and only one kind of ultimate material substance would imply ; that nature has several qualitatively different kinds of thing , and that mind is a true and organic constituent of nature seems a reasonable conclusion . Locke admits that we know nothing as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or motion of parts , produce in us secondary qualities , such as a yellow color , a sweet taste , a sharp sound ; further , that we do not know whether any mere material // substance exists , or how it can interact with an immaterial substance . He thinks we do know that our simple ideas agree with things , since these ideas arise in us independently of our minds . But Locke admits that all that " this sensitive knowledge of particular existence " amounts to is that there is something corresponding to the idea ; for example , something which produces in us the perception of a fire . ( Cf. Locke , Essay , Book IV . ) The " somethings " or " objects themselves " are but powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities . This is done " by single imperceptible solid bodies coming from objects to the ideas . " Our ideas of primary qualities resemble the objects ; our ideas of secondary qualities do not . Hume reduces our knowledge of the external world to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition of impressions seemingly similar and contiguous , buttressed by the mind 's inveterate propensity to feign connections and existences . ( Cf. Hume , Treatise of Human Nature , 13k . I , Pts. 3 and 4 ) . The Matter about which physicists theorize is a hypothetical something , a construction , a theory . Descartes saw clearly this difficulty , but he never succeeded in making much out of it . He was doubtful as to whether there is any external world at all . He says that it is possible that all of our perceptions are illusions . To guarantee the validity of our perceptions , he called in the veracity of God . If God exists , Ile is veracious ? He wo n't deceive us and therefore there must be an external world . II . MATERIALISM The scientific dualist , who assumes the existence of a matter different from the experienced world , has thus far not given us a clear and consistent conception as to what this matter is , nor can he give a plausible explanation of how it acts on mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have sense qualities and mind interdependent . Materialism holds that matter only really exists and // that mind is but an epiphenomenon , a by-product of matter . Like a tramp " bumming " his way on a train , it is not a real factor in the process of experience . The materialist argues that matter is the only reality . The causes of all the complex qualities of experience , both in the physical and the mental realms , of all thought , feeling and volition as well as of all physical and vital processes , are complex and microscopic movements of mass particles in space . This view is expressed by the saying that brain secretes thought as liver does bile and the expression " der Mensch ist was er isst " ; " man is what he eats . " The arguments given by the materialist are these : 1 . He adduces obvious evidences of the dependence of consciousness on physical condition such as : If the supply of blood to the brain stops , unconsciousness ensues ; when in great fatigue , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce unconsciousness ; drugs and diseases have various effects in the way of heightening and lowering consciousness ; mental disorders follow on lesions of the brain ; old age comes from a running down of the bodily machine , and this is accompanied by a decline in mental power . Finally , the cessation of bodily functions results in the extinction of thought . 2 . The materialist reinforces his first argument by pointing to the development of consciousness in the biological series . He regards consciousness as a function which is dependent on the degree of development of the nervous system . There seems to be a one-one correspondence or co-relation between the vividness and apparent efficiency of consciousness and the organization or complexity of the nervous system . Man has the most complicated brain of all animals . The more organized the nervous system , the more organization of brain structure , the higher the degree of consciousness and intelligence . Mind , therefore , is simply a function of the nervous system , says the mate-MATERIALISM rialist . Consciousness is not an entity or an agent , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us examine these arguments . Both imply that consciousness is the effect of purely physical causes . What do we mean by saying that one set of conditions is cause of another set ? In the sciences , by cause is meant an invariable and unconditional sequence ; what always follows is the effect and what always precedes is the cause . This is the scientific notion of cause , save where the more rigid notion of quantitative equivalence is used . In so far as cause is identified with the idea of quantitative equivalence , the causal idea loses its significance in application to the relation of brain and consciousness . Materialism would be established scientifically , if the processes of mind , such as perceiving , imagining , analyzing , synthesizing , generalizing , forming universals , selecting , inventing , feeling , valuing , and willing , could be measured and equated , in terms of energy units , with other forms of energy . This can not be done . Mind is in active power , and yet it can not be identified as one form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a wholly unique kind of energy . In measuring the equivalence of forms of physical energy , the physicist can find no place into which mind , the measurer and director , will fit . From the standpoint of mechanics , mind seems to be a troublesome interloper in the physical series . It will not submit to be formulized in terms of foot-pounds , ergs , or dynes . Futhermore , from the viewpoint that cause is invariable sequence , the materialist 's argument is one-sided . It is true we do observe mind changes following upon bodily processes , but the converse is equally true , and it is on this converse that the strength of dualism and interaction reposes . In his first argument the materialist ignores one side altogether . his second argument is much more important . There is a correlation between the degree of the organization of // the nervous system and the degree of consciousness and intelligence . We can not , with our present technic , carry this out in a detailed way , but we must admit that the functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a nervous system . Minds do not work without nervous systems , but we must not forget that , though the nervous system may be a causal condition , it need not be the total explanation of the operation of mind . The functioning of the nervous system may be an invariable condition of the function of consciousness in the present empirical environment , but we can not explain mind entirely in terms of this one causal condition . On the materialist 's hypothesis , mind is useless , it does not really do anything , it is an otiose by-product , it is wholly passive . In the organism , bile does something physiologically , and we can analyze it . But thought escapes all analysis by physical means . The analogy between thought and glandular secretions is worthless and misleading . The power of the mind to influence the body is just as well attested a fact as the converse . All our purposeful activities depend for their efficacy on this power . In critical situations , under the influence of strong emotion , conviction , faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , the mind makes the body do unexpected and otherwise impossible things . The influence of faith , autosuggestion , heterosuggestion , and hypnotism , which is just an extreme instance of suggestion , in increasing and directing the bodily energies , in producing anesthesia and actual bodily changes , and in healing effects , are cases in point here . That the set or attitude of mind , however generated , has a decided influence on the bodily condition and action can not be gainsaid by an open-minded person . As a matter of fact , animals with the greatest degree of consciousness are those which dominate creation . " Beware // when a thinker is let loose on this planet , " said Emerson . Pictures , poems , tools , states , religion ? these are the produets of thought . It is not in accordance with plain facts to say that conscious intelligence does not do anything . Consciousness is efficacious both for good and for evil . In the recent World War , we have seen clearly this bifocal type of mental efficacy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy as his last resort , and he assumes that this supports his theory . As we have stated above , this is only a working hypothesis and we do not take this as our sole guiding principle . But even if we do take the materialistic viewpoint , we yet have something outside the range of measurement . If we take the principle of the conservation of physical energy as the absolute truth , we can see no reason why there should be such a thing as mind appearing in the series of organic forms . Either mind is an efficient agent , and in that case the conservation of energy is not an absolute principle , or mind is without any efficacy and in that case the mass particles moving in space do not seem to behave in accordance with nature 's principle of parsimony , since they generate a superfluous and useless illusion , that is , conscious intelligence . On reflection it is clear that the materialist is unable to explain how mind can be a product of matter . Furthermore , it will be evident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . The matter the scientist deals with is a conceptual construction , a product of the scientific imagination and not anything that anyone can ever experience . But how remote is this conception from that of the ordinary man ? The ordinary man means by matter the organized qualities that we perceive . These , we have seen , in part depend upon our perceiving . What we experience are grouped sense qualities . Our world of experience is , therefore , a realm in which the // percipient organism and the object mutually imply one another , and the world beyond what we perceive is only the real possibility of further experience . In short , matter , in the scientific sense , is a moving configuration of mass particles in space ; or , in terms of the latest theory , a system of electrically charged positions in space . It has none of the qualities which we perceive in the actual physical world , the realm of sense experience . It has not the colors , shapes , sizes , motions , sounds , odors , tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute to physical objects . It is devoid of all " secondary " qualities and all " primary " qualities too , except , in exceedingly comminuted form , position , inertia , attraction , and relation in space . Even more strikingly is it devoid of the " tertiary " or aestlictic qualities of beauty , grandeur , picturesqueness , sublimity , majesty , or homely friendliness . Scientifically conceived matter is not the nature or physical world , which man , through his whole being , acts on , is acted on by , struggles and communes with , in part knows and masters and , in part , is mastered by . It is inconceivable that such a ghostly fabric , woven by the mathematical imagination however deftly , and however useful it be as a web on which to stretch physical calculations , should be the ultimate and sole reality of which mind is but the shadow occasionally thrown hither and yon on the evershifting web ? Mind , with its power to select , generalize , abstract , remember , invent , devise , imagine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its physical environment , to build up a new environment of social institutions and values , and to create a spiritual world of justice , integrity , love , beauty , and fellowship . To say that mind is the by-product of mass particles is to assume that the whole superphysical realm of human and cultural life and values , including the " Nature " of our common human experience , is the blindly produced , inexplicable , and super- // fluous effect of impacts and tensions in a realm of ghostly entities which is itself the offspring of the constructive imagination of the physicist . Surely this is making the cart draw the horse with a vengeance . CHAPTER XVII THE PHILOSOPHY OF KANT The philosophy of Kant is an exceedingly difficult one to outline in short space . Nevertheless , it has proven so provocative of further speculation , and is still so stimulating , that its main ideas should be considered by everyone interested in philosophy . Indeed , it is not possible to understand fully the later developments in philosophy without reference to Kant . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant theories in the hope of thereby sending the reader to Kant 's own works , ' and to more extensive discussions thereon . Kant 's philosophy defies classification . In his theory of knowledge he is a rationalist , and a priorist , and yet he holds that possible experience sets the bounds of knowledge . He rejects the subjective idealism of Berkeley , and he prepares the ground for and sows the seeds of objective idealism . He is an agnostic , with reference to a scientific , demonstrable knowledge of the existence of God , freedom , and immortality , but he justifies a rational faith in these three supreme interests of man . He holds that man is absolutely limited to a knowledge of phenomena or appearances , and yet he maintains that man unavoidably and justifiably assumes the reality of a noumenal or spiritual order . For Kant , man and . all his deeds are , empirically , // mere links in the iron web of physical necessity , whereas , morally regarded , man is a free self-determining rational spirit . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of our consciousness of our infinite moral vocations , we must believe that God exists as the Righteous Governor of the Universe and that the true self is immortal . From the loins of Kant 's philosophy sprang directly the moral idealism of Fichte , indirectly the logical idealism of Hegel , the voluntarism of Sehopenhauer , the agnostic phenomenalism of Hamilton and Spencer . Through the study of Kant the spirit of speculative philosophy has been quickened once more , after an epoch of positivism , skepticism , and materialism , in Germany , France , England , and America . To Kant the idealism of Green , the Cairds , Bradley , Bosanquet , and Royce owes much . Even pragmatism may be regarded as , in part , an effect of the Kantian philosophy . The sensationalistic or " idea-istic " phenomenalism of Mach and Pearson is like the Kantian theory of knowledge , with the activity of the Ego left out . The same remark would hold true , with some qualification , of William James ' later philosophy of pure experience . Kant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , priori philosophy of Wolff , which constructed , by a priori definitions and deductions , the theory of everything under the sun ( for example , of architecture ) , and who had been awakened from his dogmatic slumber by the skepticism of Hume , finds philosophy or metaphysics to be in a deadlock . It oscillates , he tells us , between extreme dogmatism and complete skepticism . Dogmatism assumes , offhand , the competency of the abstract reason to prove everything by a rationalistic procedure and deductive methods . This procedure leads , owing to the constant breakdown of these proofs and the ensuing conflict of reason with itself , to complete skepticism . But skepticism is equally one-sided , since there is undoubted knowledge , // that is , mathematics and physical science . In order that philosophy may set out upon the path of progress , Kant proposes what he calls a revolution , namely a critical inquiry into the presuppositions or foundation of knowledge as contained in the self ? Before we can determine whether it is possible to have a knowledge of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality ? we must first inquire ? under what conditions alone , scientific knowledge is logically possible . And we must not set out in our inquiry from complete skepticism , since skepticism would prevent our taking a single step forward and , therefore , is self-contradictory . By criticism , then , Kant means an analytic inquiry into the fundamental conditions of knowledge . Now , says Kant , in pure mathematics and physics we have not only knowledge , but knowledge a priori , that is , not derived from sense experience . If we can find what are the rational or nonempirieal factors of knowledge , and determine in what situation these factors are operative in the production of valid knowledge , we shall have solved the critical problem . We . can then determine absolutely the conditions of the knowable , and make a sharp separation between all possible objects of knowledge and the legitimate objects of faith.A - In his Critique of Pure Reason , Kant 's conclusion is that there are nonempirical factors in science , but that these factors have no valid sphere of application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , since we can have no perception of God , of an act of freedom , or of an indivisible self , belief in the latter is based on faith . N , On the other hand , he concludes , in his MetaTHE // physics of Ethics , that the implications of our moral consciousness not only entitle us , but require us , to postulate or assume the reality of God , freedom , and immortality . We will now consider , summarily , Kant 's procedure in these regards . Kant finds that there are always two factors in. genuine knowledge ? the raw materials , which are sense experiences , and the synthetic , organizing , or ordering , activity of the mind . The content , stuff , or material of knowled , re is sensation . But sensation is in itself a chaotic manifold . It is devoid of form , that is , of arrangement and orderly sequence . The latter are supplied by the mind . The mind has a native or inborn structure , which functions in the forms of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving sense impressions , belong natively the forms of space and time . Space and time are native to the mind , since we can not conceive how the recognition of outness , side-by-sideness , or succession , would arise out of experiences in which they were not already present . Space and time can not be obtained by generalization from particular sense perceptions , without presupposing them to be already there . Moreover , in arithmetic we have universal and necessary judgments or propositions , which involve the consciousness of time ; and , in geometry , we have similar judgments which imply the consciousness of space . Now , from sense perception alone , we can never arrive at a truly universal judgment ; a judgment based on perception alone can only take the form " So far as I have observed " or " So far as has been observed . " The fact that , in mathematics and mechanics , we arrive deductively at whole systems of necessary and universal propositions can only be accounted for by supposing that space and time are forms of perception native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making judgments , that is , of forming the concepts and laws that // constitute order and sequence , belong the native forms of judgment ? the universal ways in which the mind synthesizes or orders the contents of sense perception . These forms are the categories , that is , the fundamental and universal forms of thinking objects and their relations . Through the use of these categories , the mind builds up the material of sense perception into a systematized or orderly whole of intelligible experience ; that is , it builds up science and , in so doing , builds up nature , as the latter exists for common sense and for science . The categories 3 of Kant correspond to the classification of judgment forms in the traditional logic . They are as f ollows : 1 . Quantity 2 . Quality Unity Reality Plurality Negation Totality Limitation 3 . Relation 4 . Modality Inherence and Subsist- Possibilityence , or Substance Impossibility Causality and Depend- Existence-ence Nonexistence Community , or Reci- Necessityprocity of Causal In- Contingency fluence In order to illustrate Kant 's argument and theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the categories : ( 1 ) Unity . The mind unites various sensations , for example , color , form , weight , size , odor , taste into the unity or // identity of an orange . ( 2 ) Plurality . The mind , in order to count a bag of oranges , must repeat , say twelve times , its identification of unity and add or synthesize each one to the previously recognized number , as it goes along . ( 3 ) Substance . The mind can recognize change only by reference to something permanent . Without consciousness of permanence there is no consciousness of change , and vice versa . Were we not conscious of the identity of our experiencing and thinking self , through changing experiences , we could never be conscious of change . Could we not recognize change in our experiences , we could never become conscious of permanence or identity . So when we think of any object , for example , a table or a mountain , we can say its appearance changes , only if we recognize an identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old boyhood home , we can say , " It is not changed much , " only if we recognize that we and other things have changed , while remaining recognizably the same . ( 4 ) Causality . A causal relation is one of necessary and irreversible sequence . A is the cause of B means that it is necessary that A should first occur if there is to be an occurrence of B. But from sense experience alone we could never derive the idea of necessary and irreversible sequence . Now , the use or application of all the categories means always synthesis , organization , or unification , in some fashion , of the chaotic manifold of sense experience . Knowledge involves both analysis and synthesis ; but there can be nothing recognized as individual , concrete , and persisting , for analysis , unless in experience there has already been synthesis ? the putting together of sensations . We must first see things together before we can take thent apart , and we can not see things together unless we put them together . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting sensations together . The mind must do that . Now the basic condition of all synthesis is the activity of a syn230 THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY thesizer , that can know itself as one and continuous in the successive steps of synthesizing activity . Thus , the prime condition of science is the activity of the pure or transcendental Ego , the synthetic activity of the nonempirical self . By calling this ego " transcendental " Kant means that it transcends sense experience . It can not be experienced , but it is the logical condition of there being an articulate and intelligible experience . All the categories are forms of the pure self 's synthetic activity . The " I think " must be presupposed as accompanying all judgment and conception . Suppose , says Kant , I draw a line . In order to recognize it as one continuous line , I must synthesize or put together the succession of muscular sensations of drawing the line and the visual sensations of seeing the line as drawn . This presupposes that I , the thinker , continue to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on drawing , beyond what I can see as one segment of the line . I must put together my consciousness of what I am now doing or experiencing with what I did or experienced a moment ago . Suppose I leave the room and , coming back to-morrow , say " there is the line I drew yesterday . " This statement presupposes my memory or consciousness of my continuous identity in the meantime . Thus , in experiencing anything intelligible , seeing a single thing in a single relation , enlarging the scope of my seeing and relating , remembering and recognizing , there is presupposed always the permanently identical synthetic activity of the pure ego . But the ego itself can never be experienced . What I experience of myself is always of a changing self . But I could not ever know myself as a changing self , much less know anything else , if there were not functioning in me the pure unchanging and universal ego of synthetic thinking . ' " There could be no such unity of consciousness were the 11 // mind not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which it unites various phenomena in one knowledge . The original and necessary consciousness of the identity of oneself is at the same time the consciousness of a necessary unity in the synthesis of all phenomena according to conception . " Combination is a spontaneous act of conscious-ness , and , as such , it is the especial characteristic of under-standing as distinguished from sense . " " " This act we call by the general name of synthesis to draw attention to the fact that we can be conscious of nothing as cornbined in the object which we have not ourselves previously com-bined " ? " the resolution or analysis , which seems to be its opposite , in point of fact always presupposes it . " 7 " It is only because I am capable of combining in one conscious-ness the various determinations presented to me , that I can become aware that in every one of them the consciousness is the same . " 8 And the human understanding prescribes or puts into sense experience the laws of nature . Nature is objective , // in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dependent for their knowledge on the same senses and the same principles of thinking . Nature is not your individual dream or mine . But nature , or the world of space-time-causality , and all the sense qualities , is subjec-tive or phenomenal , in the sense that there enters into its making the universal forms and activities of the human mind . Nature does not exist apart from mind . Of what exists apart from mind we can have no knowledge . " Just as phenomena have no existence at all , apart from a subject that has senses , so there exist no laws in phe-nomena apart from a subject that has understanding . Things in themselves would of course have laws of their own , even if they did not come within the knowledge of the subject through his understanding . But phenomena are merely the manner in which things appear in conscious-ness , and give no knowledge of what things may be in them-selves . As more appearances they are subject to no law of connection but that which is imposed by the connective faculty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensuous perception , and imagination is dependent upon understanding for the unity of its intellectual synthesis , and upon sensibility for the complexity of appre-hension . But nothing can come under observation without synthesis of apprehension , and this empirical synthesis is dependent upon the transcendental synthesis , and therefore upon the categories . . . . In the categories , therefore , nature as a system of necessary laws has its ground and origin .... To learn what are the special laws of nature , we must go to experience ; but it is none the less true that only the a priori laws imposed by understanding tell us what is necessary for any experience whatever , and what is . capable of being known as object of experience . " 9 // Thus , for Kant , science , and nature as the object of science , are constituted by the interaction of the pure Ego with the materials of sense perception . Where there is no sense experience , there can be no knowledge . " Thinking without percepts is empty . " But sense experience means nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The categories have no application beyond the limits of possible sense experience . What lies beyond ? We know not . There must be Something , the unknown ground of our sense experience , but what it is like , or bow it produces sensation in us , we can not know . We know only appearances , phenomena . Things-in-themselves are forever hidden from our gaze . Between the nature of things as they are in themselves and our knowledge there is always interposed the forms of our perceptions and thinking ? space , time , and the categories . But Kant thinks that , though we can have no positive knowledge of the nature of things in themselves , we have negative knowledge . Since space and time are human forms of perception , things-in-themselves need not be subject to the laws of empirical causality and substantiality . There may , in the world of nournena , or ultimate reality , be a self-existent , eternal being , a causeless freedom and immortal souls . Kant , starting from the results of his analysis of knowledge , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the categories human forms of synthetic thinking , and that these imply in man an active principle of intellectual synthesis , proceeds to the seemingly gratuitous assumption that space , time , and the categories do not apply to things as they are in themselves . Why did he not recognize that the real world must have something corresponding to spatial and temporal order and to causal relations ? In fact lie is inconsistent , for he does apply unity , plurality , totality , and substance or self-existent being to his own thought about Noumena or Things-in-Themselves . He even unconsciously // : applies causality , for he assumes that things-in-themselves cause our sense experiences . The answer to these questions lies in Kant 's Dialectic . IIe finds there that the attempt , on the part of Reason , to reach ultimate or total conceptions leads to contradictory conclusions . Attempt to conceive the universe as a totality in space and time , and as a total system or community of casual relations , says Kant , and you run into the following inescapable conflicts of reason with itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cogency , that the world must be infinite spatially and that it must be finite spatially ; ( 2 ) that it must be eternal and that it must have had a beginning ; ( 3 ) that there must be and there can not be free causality ; ( 4 ) that there must be and that there can not be a selfexisting being . Now , if space , time , and causality have no application to the nonmental realities or things-in-themselves , then these contradictions are resolved . If the ultimate reality be spaceless and timeless the above contradictions are abolished . There may be freedom , creative beginnings , and a self-existent being , in the nontemporal and nonspatial realm of reality . It is clear that Kant thought he was , once for all , achieving the liberation of faith from the thraldom of skepticism , by rightly limiting the application of the forms of thinking to the field of sense experience . From the theoretical standpoint the noumenal world , the realm of things-in-themselves , is but the concept of a limit to man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific knowledge . The reason demands totality or completeness , but scientific thinking can not attain to any positive concepts of totality . We must think the ideas of God or a self-existent being , of freedom and immortality , but we can not know them as objects either of science or meta physics . They are necessary regulative ideas . In other words , they are ideals , toward which our knowledge may // seek indefinitely to approximate , but forever and forever they elude the grasp of science . " It may seem from this that the result of our critical investigation is purely negative , and merely warns us not to venture with speculative reason beyond the limits of experience . And no doubt this is its first use ; but a positive result is obtained when it is seen that the principles with which speculative reason ventures beyond its proper limits , in reality do not extend the province of reason , but inevitably narrow it . For , in seeking to go altogether beyond its true limits , the limits of sensibility , those principles threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us suppose that the necessary distinction which our criticism shows to exist between things as objects of experience and the same things as they are in themselves , had not been made . Then the principle of causality , and with it the mechanical conception of nature as determined by it , would apply to all things in general as efficient causes . IIence I could not , without palpable contradiction , say of the same being , for instance the human soul , that its will is free , and yet is subject to the necessity of nature , that is , is not free . But , if our criticism is sound and the object may be taken in two distinct senses , on the one hand as a phenomenon , and on the other hand as a thing-in-itself , there is no contradiction in. supposing that the very same will , in its visible acts as a phenomenon is not free , but necessarily subject to the law of nature , while yet , as belonging to a thing-in-itself , it is not subject to that law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to think freedom without contradiction , not to understand . it .... From the critical point of view , therefore , the doctrine of morality and the doctrine of nature may each be true in its own sphere , which could never have been shown had not criticism previously established our unavoidable ignorance of things in themselves , and limited all that // we can know to mere phenomena . I have , therefore , found it necessary to deny knowledge of God , freedom , and immorality , in order to find place for faith . " 10 The postulates of the practical reason , that is , the demands of a faith which has its origin in the moral will , carry us across the gulf impassable by theoretical reason . The Ideas of God , Freedom , and Immortality , which ever transcend the reach of science , become immanent for the practical or moral consciousness , on the guidance of which depends man 's fulfillment of his moral vocation . The commands of duty are absolute , unqualified . The voice within us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou shalt not do thus and so ! " and " Thou shalt do thus and so ! " The Right is the Good-in-itself . There is nothing Good-iii-itself except the Good Will , and the Good Will is the will of a rational self-determining personality which , in knowing and willing the Good , knows and wills into action its own true nature . In the last analysis , only moral personalities are absolutely the subjects and objects of moral volition and valuation . But , if thou oughtest unqualifiedly , then thou eanst , Du sollst denn du kanst . So nigh is grandeur to our dust , So near is God to man , When Duty whispers low , Thou must , The youth replies , I can . The absolutely binding character of the moral imperative involves moral freedom or the power to obey the imperative . Hence we have a practical consciousness of freedom . Through the sense of duty we know that we must be free ; through freedom we are able to obey the commands of duty , and thus to fulfil the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our moral vocation is an endless task . We must live eternally , since , if to strive ceaselessly after moral perfection be our true calling , the beginning that we make here on earth opens to our spiritual eye dim and distant vistas of the pathway which prolongs itself ahead into a future life in which we approach ever more nearly towards perfection . Thus immortality is the second postulate of the moral life . And , if this moral vocation of man be not a mocking ; delu-sion , if it be a realisable ideal , then the whole or nature must be subservient to the moral order . Virtue and hippi-ness , which by no means coincide here and now , innst , in the long run , coincide . Righteousness must triumph and rule in the cosmos . And , since only a will is righteous and good , the third and crowning postulate of the moral life is that God exists as the righteous will who governs /he universal order . Thus the highest objects of reason 's quest which , from the theoretical standpoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral life , the objects and abiding place of a reasonable faith . In our scientific knowledge we are strictly limited to the space-time world of sensuous phenomena , with its end-less and iron-bound causal sequences . In this world our bodies and our empirical selves are but ephemeral f rag-ments , whose origin , career , and decease are as inevitable as the course of a mote or a planet . We find , in the phe-nomenal realm , no freedom , no God , and no self , except the logically presupposed self of the pure universal thinker , the principle of intellectual synthesis . But this whole phenomenal order is incomplete and dependent . Through moral insight we are led to see that it is but the appearance of the noumenal or spiritual order , in which , for moral faith , God , freedom , and immortal souls are the supreme and abiding realities . But , we ask , what is the relation of faith to science ? // What is the positive relation of the phenomenal or spacetime world to the spaceless and timeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the relation of my empirical and ever changing selfhood to my spiritual or free selfhood ? What is the relation between that timeless act of freedom , by which a moral will begins a series in time , and the temporal phenomenal causal order which has neither first nor last term ? ? How can I be both creatively free and temporally determined ? Empirically , my every volition , as well as my every bodily movement , is caused by antecedents . When , then , and how , can I , by an act of free obedience to duty , break through this iron sequence ? What is the relation of God to nature ? How can the world of time be the appearance of a timeless world ? And is not the appeal to moral consciousness , as the key to the interpretation of the noumenon or thing-initself , an appeal to experience ? Does not Kant himself depart from his narrow limitation of experience to what comes through the avenues of the outer senses , when he tries to analyze and to interpret the philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral experiences of the individual , and the moral history of the race , truly valid bases for philosophical construction ? Kant was feeling his way tentatively towards a richer and more unified concept of experience , when , in his Critique of Judgment , he argued , that in the judgments of aesthetic feeling , in other words , in the experiences and valuations of beauty , grandeur , sublimity , which we have in the contemplation of nature and of works of art , we have hints of how the gaps might be closed between the sensible and the supersensible worlds . We can not help seeing purpose in nature , especially in living organisms , and we can not help feeling beauty in nature and art . Beauty is the feeling of the perfect harmony of the world with intelligence . The judgment of purpose in nature gives // us the idea of the world as an organic system . The per-ception of beauty in nature seems to show us an organismic teleology . It suggests a cosmic purposiveness , operating in ways other than the halting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purpose and of vesthetic feeling , we get suggestions as to how the world of nature may be a living and worthful whole , one organism and life , which owes its existence and its continuance in existence to the creative and intuitive intelligence of a Cosmic Thinker , who in thinking creates the objects of his thought , in whose mind there is no pas-sivity , who is not dependent on the reception of sensory stimulations for the materials of his knowledge and who , hence , has no need of thinking discursively ; that is , of proceeding step by step by synthesis and analysis from the particular to the universal . Art , the creation of human genius , is produced without deliberate design by an intel-ligence which works like nature . This notion of a cosmic Intuitive Intellect or Creative Reason , whose nature is adumbrated by the creative imaginative work of the human artist or genius , is evidently one to which Kant returned again and again . We find it in the early stages of the Critique of Pure Reason " and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judgment 12 This notion of a creative or intuitive thinker , put out tentatively by Kant , plays an important part in the phi-losophy of his followers , Fichte , Schelling , Schleiermacher and Hegel 13 // The philosophy of Kant is epoch making . It was the most powerful influence , along with the philosophy of the French enlightenment ( which , in turn , was a populariza-tion , by Voltaire and others , of the ideas of Locke , Hume , Newton , Lord Shaftesbury , and the English moral philoso-phers ) , and the social philosophy of Rousseau , in bringing to pass a shift of emphasis from the ontological problems of substance to the problems of human nature ? from the problems of the Mind-body and Spirit-matter relationships , to the problems of human knowledge , human association , and the evolution of human culture . After Kant , phi-losophy in Germany was concerned chiefly with the in-terpretation of human society and the meaning of man 's cultural development ? with the evolution of human institutions and ideas . In other words , philosophy becomes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings , for the development of the human spirit , of morality , law , the state , science , art , and religion , all from the historical point of view . Later idealism is an idealistic reading of man 's cultural history , as being the most im-portant key to the meaning of reality as a whole . This movement achieved , as we shall see , its greatest results in Hegel . For Kant 's philosophy of history see Chapter XXVIII . CHAPTER XVIII SPIRITUALISM OR IDEALISM The basic thesis of this standpoint , in its principal modern classic forms , is that only minds and their contents exist . To my mind there are three chief forms of idealism , namely : 1 . Berkeleyan or Subjective 2 . Leibnitzian or Monadistic 3 . Hegelian or Objective I. BERKELEYAN IDEALISM The essence of the first is this : Berkeley argues that our knowledge consists of notions and ideas or perceptions . By notion he means an immediate awareness or intuition of the self . I know myself directly as an active being , thinking , perceiving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my activity , I also have ideas . Ideas are the sole contents or stuff of our experience when we perceive things by means of the senses . The being of things consists in being perceived . I am passive or receptive in having ideas . These two , Ideas and Notions , exhaust the whole field of knowledge . When I perceive any object such as desk , tree , snow , I have a congeries of sense qualities , united by the mind , and these congeries I call things . A cherry , for instance , consists of a specific roundness , smoothness , size , color , taste , odor , and interior structure , united by the mind into this thing . There is 242 // nothing behind the group of sense qualities , which is , hence , the real cherry . By things Berkeley means just what one perceives . The field of knowledge includes , then , notions and ideas . Notion is a knowledge of the spirit as an acting subject . I n perception we know that we are relatively passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they must , therefore , have a cause which is independent of ourselves . We are continually distinguishing between those images that are , and those that are not , under our control . We know that we do not cause our perceptions . I can not help seeing , feeling , hearing , the content of my present field of perception . There is involved in perception a degree of constancy and a type of order which attests the independent character of the cause of our perceptions . What causes our perceptions ? We have seen that the materialist argues that the cause is matter , or a substance which is very different from our perceptions . The materialist argues that matter has the primary qualities in minute , imperceptible forms , but is eviscerated of all secondary qualities . This distinction , says Berkeley , is illogical . If the primary qualities are objective , so also are the secondary . Berkeley convincingly and irrefutably shows that all qualities are on the same footing , since they are perceived in the same manner and subject to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived apart from the other . For instance , shape , size , texture , and motion are never perceived apart from color . The ordinary assumption of the believer in a material substance is that ideas are copies in our mind of the independent matter . Now Berkeley asks , if we can not perceive matter , how can we know that there is matter ? And if we can perceive matter , then matter is the content of the act of perception . We can not know the relation between ideas and matter if we do not perceive matter . Berkeley // says that the material world of common sense is only perception . Perception must have an objective cause . We have no knowledge of matter as a cause . We do know , however , that we , as selves or spirits , are causes . We are conscious of producing changes in the world , therefore the cause of our perceptions must be a spirit . As our perceptions show order , regularity , and an intelligible structure , so the cause of our perceptions must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligible character , as being the rational and permanent source of the constancy and order in our perceptual experience . Since our spirits are progressively discovering ever more order and meaning in the realm of sense perception , the Ground or Cause of the latter must be essentially akin in nature to the spirit of man . Mind I know intuitively ? by a notion ? as a thinking , acting principle . I thus know mind as the spiritual support of ideas . There is , therefore , no independent material substance for Berkeley . Nature is literally the living garment of the Deity . The world of nature , " the whole choir of heaven and furniture of earth , " is a divine , visual language . Just as I infer from your looks that you are intelligent , so I infer that an infinite , omnipresent , intelligent principle is speaking to me through nature . Nature is not a garment that hides the Deity , nor is nature a body of thought forms which hide reality from the percipient individual . Nature is the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not perceive my fellowman 's spirit directly , but I do infer from his actions that there is a spirit . So I infer from the order , utility , and beauty of nature that there is a Supreme Spirit . There is also this important difference between our perceptions of nature and of other finite selves . Nature we have constantly before us as a manifestation of the power and intelligence of the Supreme Spirit , // whereas human individuals do not bear this constant rela-tion to us . Since nature therefore is a language to man , all he has to do is to study it and it speaks . Berkeley would say that the whole technic , both mathematical and experimental , of modern science are but elements in the process of learning nature 's tongue . Do we eat and drink ideas when we eat and drink sense objects ? Yes . But it is , however , only a question of names at this point . Berkeley insists that his view is the common man 's view . The ma-terialist philosopher says that what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Berkeley , the materialist postulates some thoughtless , stupid , unintelli-gible thing . It is the futility of this postulate that Berkeley is seeking to show . He argues that such a postulate will not explain the facts of perception . When Dr. Johnson kicked the stone and it hurt , he did not refute Berkeley . It is the materialist who deprives our sense impressions of their reality . Esse est percipi , this famous expression , which has often been taken to be the whole of Berkeley 's system , is in reality only its beginning . The divine mind is the cause of our perceptions , and it is the cause of the continued existence of things when we do not perceive them . Mind is the only conceivable cause of our ideas and perceptions . God is the universal intelligence which we conceive on the analogy of our own existence as think-ing , willing selves . There are certain fundamental difficulties in Berkeley . Nature for him is simply the effect in human minds of the continuous activity of the divine mind . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the genesis of the solar system ; in short , what becomes of the whole world before man appeared ? Nature is simply a continuous manifestation of the divine mind to finite minds , on Berkeley 's premises . This continuous mani-festation of the divine is all there is to nature . At this // point we see , therefore , that Berkeley deprives nature of any existence on its own account . This is one of the two chief difficulties in his system . His doctrine is also unsatisfactory in the solution it offers of the relations of one finite mind to another and to God . Your body from your point of view is the effect of the divine will acting upon your mind . But your body as I perceive it is the effect of the action of the divine will on my mind . Here arises a serious difficulty . How can I distinguish between my body as I perceive it and my body as you perceive it ? This question is not satisfactorily answered in Berkeleyan idealism . As James has said , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy which I never experience in connection with my perceptions of your body . Never do I perceive your toothache quite as I do my own , Never do I perceive your difficulties as I do my own . Why feel in such an intimate way the action of the divine mind which I call my body , if the whole world is perceptual content ? Why is there not the same emotional tang to all my experiences ? If body is what I perceive and only that , then Berkeley 's theory fails to account for this patent fact . Berkeley argues that the constancy , coherence , and independence , in the order of our perceptions of things justify the inference that nature is the continuous expression of the Divine Mind to our minds , just as the constancy and independence of my will , in my perception of your body , leads me to infer that your mind speaks to me through your body . But your body is a part of the same total and continuous natural order of perceptions to which belong my perceptions of inanimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might infer a mind in every natural object , instead of One Divine Mind in all things . If the individual body is simply an effect of the action of one finite mind on another , it would follow that the whole of nature // is but the sum of the effects of all other finite minds on the mind of the percipient . Thus Berkeley assumes the independent realness of our percepts of one another 's bodies , and then argues that the remainder of our percepts ( that is , the physical world ) is the direct expression to us of God 's mind . Thus his argument at once assumes and denies that human bodies , and the minds associated with them , exist independently of the divine mind . In conclusion we may say that Berkeley 's theory does not give us a satisfactory doctrine of nature , nor does it account for the uniqueness and the discreteness of selves . II . LEIBNITZ 'S MONADOLOGY Leibnitz 's doctrine avoids one of Berkeley 's difficulties . Leibnitz starts from the idea of substance . He is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making substance the central explanatory principle . He sets up a plurality of monads , or individual substances . Now a monad is a center of force or of desire and activity . We may almost say that a monad is an animated point . In this respect Leibnitz shows profoundly the influence of the mathematics of his day . Galileo , in describing the path of moving bodies , called the differential a point of tendency and at no time in the physical series does Galileo resort to rest , as did Archimedes , as the final point of explanation . So here Leibnitz comes not to a position of equilibrium or rest , but to force . The whole universe consists of an infinite number of centers of desire or striving . There are three kinds ofdmonads , namely : 1 . Body monad ( animated molecule ) 2 . Soul monad ( monad having memory or conscious continuity ) 3 . Spirit monad ( a thinking center that reflects , thinks in conceptual terms , and sets up ends ) // All physical bodies are made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human bodies are governed by spirit monads . These centers of force and feeling exhaust the whole content of the world . The monad develops from within . The history of the monad is a consequence of inner impulsion and not of external impact . Here also we find employed the conception that Galileo , Huyghens , and other physicists of the time worked out , of the nature of a point of any function as expressed by the differential . Every monad is in some degree a soul or self . Even the body monads are rudimentary selves , that is , they are low grade centers of feeling or desire . Each monad mirrors or reflects the universe , and its development is entirely from its own internal impulse . It is self-active . The monad produces no change in any other one . Each develops solely by the law of its own being . In this aspect , Leibnitz expresses the central core of the mathematics of his day . The monad , in addition to being a point expressing the law of an entire series , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that which is both one and many , both unity and complexity . The best analogy of such a function Leibnitz finds in the self or soul . A human individual is complex ; it includes a variety of impulses in a unity of feeling and purposive activity . In the body monad there are only dazed flashes of consciousness , and from the lowest body monad there begins an infinite gradation of organization . There are no breaks in nature ; and so we have an infinite series from the very lowest up to the most rational and self-conscious monad . This may be pictured as an ascending scale which leads up to the perfect monad , namely , God . God is the one perfectly organized monad . He is the governing monad , and is also the cause of the existence of all the others . In conceiving of the relation of body and soul , Leibnitz // does not think that one term of the duality sends over any influence into the other term . Both members of the duality work together in harmony . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves in Lockian fashion as the unknown cause of our perceptions . On this point Leibnitz is in fundamental agreement with Aristotle . The soul is the entelechy of the body . Leibnitz has propounded an original conception in psychology , to wit , the conception of grades of consciousness . There are all sorts of modes of awareness ranging from the most transient and evanescent feelings up to clear self-consciousness . The inner life of the monad is made up of petites perceptions , minute perceptions . In the very lowest type of monads there are but few of these minute perceptions and the unifying principle is least operative . Since Leibnitz conceives all force as being in the final analysis psychical , the physical spatial order is but the phenomenal expression of an infinite number of interrelated monads . Force is of the nature of a self-acting and desiring type . I am a body governed by soul . I perceive most clearly those monads which are nearest to me in kind , and I also perceive their interrelationships under the form of space . The world is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in space , but space is in them . The same relation is also true of time . The laws of mechanics are true , but they are not the ultimate truth . The Newtonian principles express the order and continuity between spatial phenomena . From the spatial point of view , the world is through and through mechanical , but this mechanical system is the expression of an inner purposive , teleological nature . The monads constitute a kingdom of spirits , a cosmical harmony of souls . In this way Leibnitz has incorporated into a single principle the teleology of Plato and Aristotle , and the mechanics of Newton , Kepler , Galileo , Huyghens , et al . // Spiritualism or idealism in Leibnitz thus assumes a form which does not deprive nature of reality ? nature is real , apart from our minds . Nature is really alive , is psychical , and in this respect the Leibnitzian conception of nature is in perfect harmony with the nature-romanticism of Wordsworth , Byron , Shelley , and others . In nature there is an all-pervasive spirit akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent deliverances of physical science ; for both nature is dynamical , is process , activity . The doctrine of Leibnitz is one of the most original metaphysical conceptions of modern times . This type of spiritualism does not really account for the fact that the world of our experience has two aspects . This view may be true , but it fails to convince us that the whole of nature is alive and psychical . It does not tell why there should be this double aspect to experience and why , if physical nature really consists of souls , we commonly fail to be conscious of their presence and are usually incapable of communing with them . Royce , our late notable American idealist , and also Liebmann , l have tried to rectify this one defect . Royce says that the reason why we do not apprehend the psychical life of nature is because the souls distributed throughout nature have different time-spans . Our own consciousness has a certain beat , so to speak ; attention wavers and wanes at a fairly constant rate . Our consciousness has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm of consciousness , we might live in a minute as much as we now live in a hundred years . As compared with the elephant and lower forms of animal organism , and still more so with inorganic nature , our consciousness has a much more rapid rhythm . Now if we had different rhythms of consciousness , we could perhaps hold commuSPIRITUALISM // nion with stars , mountains , trees , yes , even with stones . Our failure to apprehend the all-pervading psychical life in nature is thus , according to Royce , due to the differences in time-span between their lives and ours . This seems unlikely to me . If all parts of nature have an indwelling consciousness , then our scientific formulae for the regular behavior of objects should be reducible to a common type , and all the different sciences could be shown to be only parts of one science , namely , psychology . Not only logic and ethics , but physics and chemistry , would be merged into psychology . As science develops , we discover that the rules of the behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the rules of the behavior of psychical beings . And , among psychical beings , those with the most highly organized individuality have the most unique and significant ways of behaving . Moreover , we also discover that the difference is not reducible to variations in the timespan . It is a difference in kind . There is a constancy , a regularity , that differs in kind in these different levels ? namely , the physical , the animal , and the rational  --  and I fancy that the time is not even relatively at hand when the only technic of the social engineer will be a book of log tables and other mathematical formula . I see no promise of the reduction of the psychical and the physical to a common basis . III . OBJECTIVE OR ABSOLUTE IDEALISM Berkeley 's Idealism is designated subjective , since for him only subjects ? God and finite spirits , human and superhuman ? really exist . For him Reality is a plurality of selves . Physical nature exists only in the minds of selves . Leibnitz differs from Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature for him consists of low grade centers of feeling and will . Nature // and man constitute elements in a harmonious system . Their existence and harmonious working together is constituted by God , the Governing Monad . Thus for Leibnitz nature is not , as it is for Berkeley , the mere effect of God 's direct action on human minds . Nature has a real existence . More recent objective idealism does not regard nature as being necessarily an assemblage of finite souls . Nature is unconscious mind . It does not exist as such independent . of all mind . But it has forces and ways of behaving that , are different . From the standpoint of objective idealism the physical world has a character of its own . In fact , it is only because the physical is " opposite " to , or " other " than , finite mind that the latter can realize itself , or develop to full consciousness . On the other hand , physical nature and finite mind , ultimately , really exist only as elements in the unity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the unity of the universe is that of one self-active , self-developing , self-expressing being , God or the Absolute ? which differentiates itself endlessly into nature and finite mind , but which never loses itself in the processes of the finite or for an instant ceases to be any less a unity . When we think of the universe , from the standpoint of its unity , it is the eternally self-active , self-differentiating One , that manifests its life in the ceaseless process of the finite ? in physical attraction and repulsion , in the play of the polarity of magnetism and electricity , in the analytic and synthetic forces of chemism , in the endless or circular process of self-reproduction , self-development , death and birth of living organisms , in the ceaselessly recurring and yet ever progressing conflicts of the human spirit in history . When we look at the universe from the standpoint of any finite member thereof , whether it be a physical atom , a living organism , a human being , a nation 's history , or the evolution of art or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find its being in process ? in attracting and reSPIRITUALISM // pelling other atoms , in growing and dying , and thus furthering the race life , in realizing its destiny or making way for the destiny of another nation , or another phase of art or religion . Thus reality is at once a self-differentiating unity and a struggling and conflicting procession of many finite and transitory elements . The key to the interpretation of the whole of reality , as having these two aspects which mutually imply one another , is to be found in the nature of mind ? not in the mind of the individual , as he thinks himself to be , but the racial mind , the cosmic mind . The names of chief importance in the development of objective idealism are J. G. Fichte , who took the first step in transforming the dualism of Kant into a system of objective idealism ; Hegel , who developed it , with systematic completeness , into a rounded-out system , and who applied his central insight to all spheres of existence , to nature and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ; the English objective or absolute idealists , T. II . Green , E. Caird. , F. H. Bradley and Bernard L-'osanquet , who give to the doctrine a freer and more elastic form than it has in Hegel 's hands ; but who , in fundamentals , represent a kindred standpoint ; and , finally , Josiah Royce , in whom it takes a decidedly original form . In the following exposition of the fundamental standpoint of objective idealism I shall follow Hegel chiefly , only noting briefly some of the later divergencies from Hegel 's standpoint . The present exposition of objective idealism can not be understood without reference to Chapter XXIV , for objective idealism is essentially a singularistic or monistic system . Indeed it is the most logical form of singularism . J. G. Fichte was an enthusiastic disciple of Kant . But he soon became dissatisfied with the impassable gulf that yawned in Kant 's system between the world of phenomenal I1 // knowledge , built up by the activity of the pure ego out of the raw materials of sensation , and the unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever hidden behind the impenetrable ( by any scientific thinking ) veil of phenomena . Kant had said that the human understanding , by its analytic and synthetic activity , fashions the nature known to science , that is , the realm of things causally connected into a system in the space-time world , out of the materials that come through the senses , out of the ceaseless stimulations that come to the mind through the organs of sense perception . But what causes these sensations or how the cause is related in character to the human mind , Kant said we can not know . Fichte , dissatisfied with this agnostic dualism , boldly undertakes to show why there is a sense world or physical world . He says that there are only two consistent systems of philosophy , dogmatism or materialism which affirms minds to be products of things , and idealism which affirms things to be products of minds . Either one or the other system is true . Neither can explain how that which it takes to be causally dependent is produced . Idealism can not explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter produces mind . Still less can it explain why mind , if the by-product of matter , should be self-conscious . Fichte holds that a man 's philosophy is the expression of his character . One who has a sense of man 's moral worth and spiritual freedom will choose idealism . One who , with the " pigsty philosophy " of hedonism , regards man as merely an animal , will accept materialism . Fichte chooses idealism on grounds of moral insight and faith . Then he proceeds to explain why , if idealism be true , there should be a sense realm at all . ( Note that he explains why , not how , the world of the senses comes into being ) . His standpoint is teleological and moralistic , not causal in the scientific sense at all . The explanation is as // follows . The finite moral will , in order that it may develop into a fully conscious , rational self-determining will or ego , , must be confronted by an opposite or other , which challenges it and stimulates it to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be developed only in conflict with , and in the overcoming of , the physical . Nature , the realm of the sensuous or material in experience , is that apparent other-than-mind , in the conquest of which mind comes into conscious self-possession . Nature is the sensuous material for the fulfillment of man 's moral vocation . This vocation , in turn , consists of free , rational self-activity . The individual wins his freedom through control of his sensuous impulses . The race wins its freedom and finds its vocation in subduing nature to cultural or spiritual ends . Thus the opposition between nature and reason is set up in order that in every finite self and , therefore , in the whole of the human race , reason may develop from unconscious latency to **26;97;TOOLONG . The eternal meaning of the universe is that there shall be a world of rational selves , hence the opposition between self and nature , ego and non-ego , is set up ( posited is Fichte 's term ) by the universal or cosmic will , in order that there may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his being . Reason 's world , the world of the cosmic will , is an infinity of self-production . All finite willing is to realize the infinite will , the universal ego , which is infinite activity . There is no real world but will . There is no destiny but the ceaseless selfrealization of rational will by finite selves , as organs of the world will , as sparks of the world reason . The moral vocation of man is the supreme clue to the meaning of reality . This moral vocation involves a dialectical or triadic process . First , is the universal will or ego . Second , in order that the universal ego may come to consciousness in a world of finite egos , there must be set up , // by the universal will , a non-ego , an opposite which is nature , the sense world . Third , is the process of overcoming the opposition , in which process the finite ego wins rational freedom and becomes a conscious member of the universal moral world order . The triadic process , **26;125;TOOLONG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hegel takes up this basic insight of Fichte 's and works it out , with unwearied assiduity , profound insight and comprehensive knowledge and great synthetic power , in all aspects of existence . Later forms of objective idealism are chiefly commentaries on , or emendations of , Hegel . In the following exposition of Ilegel 's doctrine I shall pass lightly over Ilegel 's philosophy of nature , as being the least interesting and least fortunate part of his system . Hegel works out the principles of absolute ' or objective idealism in all directions . his is a system of evolutionistic or dynamic idealism , into which is woven the whole content of the historical life of the human species . Reality is process , and process is essentially spirit or mind . Iluman history is the progressive expression of the supreme spirit , reason or purpose . He holds that the starting point for philosophical interpretation is experience , but says that , in interpreting experience , everything depends on the mind we bring to the task . Experience , in its true character , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of isolated particular facts . The scientific development of this system is the task of logic which , for Hegel , is identical with metaphysics , or theory of reality : " The science of things set and held in pure thought . Logic develops the system of the pure types of thought , not of the individual 's thought but of universal objective thought , the world reason . " Applied philosophy consists of two parts : ( 1 ) Philosophy of nature , which traces out the stages in the materialization or concretion of thought unconsciously operative in physical nature ; mind alienated // from itself ; ( 2 ) philosophy of mind , which traces out the stages in the ever increasing **36;153;TOOLONG of the universal reason in human thought and social culture . Philosophy of mind has three divisions : ( 1 ) Philosophy of subjective mind , the science of the individual mind operating in the bodily organism ( anthropology and psychology ) ; ( 2 ) philosophy of objective mind , the science of the mind as it objectifies itself in the social institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political life ; it is through social institutions that the individual mind becomes moralized and rationalized , in short , attains personality ; ( 3 ) absolute mind . In art , religion , and philosophy , human mind attains a higher and more adequate consciousness of itself as the organ of the absolute mind , and of the identity of itself with the absolute mind , than it is able to reach in social life . Thus the final and highest task of philosophy is to interpret the meanings of art and religion for the self-realization of Spirit 2 For Hegel the true is the whole . Truth is the self-comprehension of reality . When we say " true " we are thinking of that which is comprehended , that is of the contents of thought . Hence the test of truth for him is not agreement of thought with anything independent of thought . Truth is the agreement or coherence of thought with thought . The absolute truth is the self-consistent totality of truth . The absolute reality is the self-coherent whole of being . Absolute reality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject and object , Knowing that knows itself . ( Ilow reminiscent this is of Aristotle ! ) The utterly coherent or harmonious cosmical order , which is the absolute mind , is a living process ; it contains within itself the whole endless variety of finite events . It includes , and // ever subdues into its eternal harmony , all the clashes of physical forces , all the conflicts of history , all the striving and suffering of human life . It is eternal calm in the midst of the world storms , eternal harmony that runs through all the cosmical discords . The untrue , the bad , the transitory , is that which is discordant , that which is at war with itself and is , therefore , forever passing over into something other than itself . But the untrue , the bad , the apparent , the transitory , is ever being transmuted or transfigured into content of the true , the good , the real , the eternal . The one in the many , the infinite in the finite , the absolute in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Hegel , is the final insight attained by speculative philosophy . Such he thinks is the true meaning of mysticism . Hegel 's philosophy is a system of speculative mysticism , worked out with extraordinary industry , knowledge and insight , in application to all spheres of human life . Nowhere else in the history of Western philosophy does one find such a blending of mystical vision with logical vigor and wealth of concrete knowledge of man 's cultural history as in Hegel . The paradoxical union of opposites is achieved by the dialectic method . We have seen that Hegel was indebted to Fichte for the suggestion of his method . But he was also much influenced by Plato 's use of dialectic , especially in the Parmenides and Sophist . Reason , says Hegel , is the faculty of true speculative knowledge , the understanding only sets up oppositions . It is the reason which overcomes them by showing that they are united in a higher synthesis . Kant had argued in his antinomies that , on equally cogent grounds , one must affirm and deny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is and is not made up of simple parts , and that there is and there is not freedom and a self-existent and free first cause . Kant could find no solution for this conSPIRITUALISM // flict of reason with itself but to deny that time and space were ultimately real . Hegel thinks the statement of the antinomies the best thing in pant 's philosophy , but he holds that Kant failed to find the right solution which is this : " The true and positive meaning of the antinomies is that every actual thing involves a coexistence of opposed elements . Consequently to know , or in other words , to comprehend an object is equivalent to being conscious of it as a concrete unity of opposed determinations . " ( Wallace , The Logic of Hegel , p. 100 . ) Thus " by dialectic is meant the indwelling tendency outwards by which the one-sidedness and limitations of the predicates of understanding is seen in its true light . " ( Op. cit. , p. 147 . ) " For anything to be finite is just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dialectical principle constitutes the life and soul of scientific progress , the dynamic which alone gives immanent connection and necessity to the body of science . " " When we look more closely , we find that the limitations of the finite do not merely come from without ; that its own nature is the cause of its abrogation and that by its own act it passes into its counterpart . " ( Op. cit. , p. 148 . ) Man is mortal means not external circumstances cause death but life , as life , involves the germ of death ; " everything finite , instead of being stable and ultimate , is rather changeable and transient and this is exactly what we mean by that dialectic of the finite by which the finite , as implicitly other than what it is , is forced beyond its own immediate or natural being to turn suddenly into its opposite . " ( Op. cit. , p. 150 . ) Thus everything finite , from the humblest sense object to the greatest man or nation , implies always an " other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very being depend . For every being is specific or individual . Mere // being , undefined being , is the same as nothing . To be is to be something and hence not to be some other thing . Everything concrete is a unity of differents or opposites . Let us take an orange . We say an orange is a yellow spheroid with a rough skin and a soft interior with an acid juice . But yellow is not spheroidal , rough is not yellow , softness is not acidity and juiciness is not acidity . So on we might go . The orange is a unity of differents or distincts.3 Moreover , an orange is not any other finite object . There are on my desk paper , inkstand , books , pipe , pens , pencils . No one of these things is any other , and yet any one is definable and can exist only in relation to the others . Let us take , says Hegel , the spiritual world and we shall find everywhere illustrations of the dialectic . " Pride goeth before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls on the other side . " " Too much wit outwits itself . " " Push a right to an extreme and it becomes a wrong " ; for example , Shylock and his pound of flesh . Men can not live without one another or peacefully with one another . Thus , as Kant said , the chief cause of society is man 's unsocial sociableness. // Reasonableness , says Hegel , consists just in embracing these opposites as unsubstantial elements in the concrete unity of the whole system of reality . Heraelitus said : " All Being is becoming . " This , says Hegel , means that Hamlet 's question " to be or not to be " is posed at the level of the mere understanding . The truth is that to be is not to be , and not to be is to be ; for all life and mind are process , a passing from one stage of being to another . In any and every such transition , if the ( ' artier stage is taken as being , in relation to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later stage is taken as being , the earlier stage is nonbeing in relation to that . But the true insight is that being consists just in the continuous Transilion from one form of finitude to another . Everything finite is relative , transitional , in process and the infinite is the totality of the process , the absolute is the total system of the relative . Hence , says Hegel , it is a superficial and indeed a false philosophy which makes such assertions as these : " We know only appearance ; the essence of reality is hidden and unknowable . " " We do not know what force really is , we know only its manifestations . " " We do not know what electricity or life are ; we know only their phenomena . " " We do not know true causes , but only apparent effects . " The essence is simply the whole system of appearances . The noumenon is the systematic totality of phenomena . Force , electricity , life , are what they do . Causes are causes only in relation to effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God a being beyond the stars and inaccessible is to make him nothing , a mere abstract essence , a mere name with three letters . God is what he appears to be . He is essentially the being who manifests himself , and the whole world is his continuing manifestation . Thus far one might suppose Ilegel 's view identical with Hindu pantheism or that of Pope , // All are but parts of one stupendous whole Whose body nature is , and God the soul . But Hegel 's doctrine is much more profound . God , the absolute mind , is nothing apart from the universe . IIe is the unity , the coherent totality of which all finite forms and events are manifestations . In him these live and move and have their being , and through these he lives and moves and has his being ; but not all appearances are on the same level . The dialectic process of reality is an ascent , from physical movements of attraction and repulsion , through living organisms and species , to mind 's or spirit 's summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One star differeth from another in glory , and just so one finite form differeth from another in the degree of its adequacy of manifestation of divinity or of reality . There are three chief stages in the process : 1 . Being-for-another . In the physical world all things exist only in relation : for example , a thing and its properties , negative and positive electricity , the acid and the base , cause and effect . But until conscious life is reached , everything seems only to have being for another , that is , it can exist and be defined only in relation to another which is external to it . It is not a self-determining center of being and action . It has no inner life , no power of return into itself . The significance of things physical , existing side by side in space and following one another in temporal succession , is exhausted in their external relations . Nature , indeed , has neither kernel nor husk . She is both at once . But nature seems to flow on endlessly without achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a phase of existence that indeed depends upon the other , but also has a self-returning , self-possessing unity . Living organisms are not exhausted in their external relations . Life // maintains itself , enhances itself , reproduces itself . The individual is prolonged and perhaps enhanced in the life of the species . Thus individuality , as the centralizing operative power of relationship , appears . Still the individual organism is dependent on another , and is but a link in the endless chain of the life of the species which , since it is an endless procession , nowhere enables the principle of individuality to be fully realized . " Life , " says Hegel , " is the Idea ( or mind ) which has not yet realized its true purpose . " ( Op. cit. , 255. ) 3 . Being-in-and-for-itself . It is first in self-conscious or rational individuality that the true purpose of the dialectic process is achieved . By this Hegel means the individuality that goes out into and lives in all the relations which constitute the world , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central and conscious focus of these relations . Thus the true individual is an organized rational unity , a system of elements existing in conscious relations . The mechanical view of reality is inadequate , because it gives no real unity , only an external juxtaposition of parts related in space . The organism is higher , but single organisms are the prey of the environment , and the species is a mere succession of living individuals . The true whole , the true reality , is a self-differentiating unity , a selfunifying plurality . It is the absolute Spirit operative iii nature ( blindly ) and coming to ever fuller self-consciousness in Humanity . From the standpoint of the unity , reality is the eternal ground of the endless procession of spirits . From the standpoint of the plurality , reality is the society of selves realizing in time its unity with the eternal ground . The absolute is the universal spirit that lives and moves in the whole system of finite spirits . He is the perfect self or ego who lives in and through all imperfect selves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supremacy of selfhood . He says that Kant 's criticism , which denies that we can know the self , takes the self as a mere abstract essence . It is objected that in order that the ego may know itself it must make itself object and that this is a circle . Hegel remarks that it is true that if one thinks a stone is a stone , the stone does not stand in the way . But surely , he remarks , this does not mean that a stone is superior to a self , because it has no self-consciousness to stand in the way of its being thought by another . IIe affirms that it is the very nature of the ego or self to be subject-object . " In thinking itself the absolute , eternal nature and notion of selfhood is revealed in the immediate empirical consciousness , since self-consciousness is precisely the existing and therefore empirically perceivable pure notion , the absolutely selfrelating , which as distinguishing or separating judgment makes itself its own object and thus alone is able to constitute a circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The concrete self or ego is subject-object . It is that which moves and lives and knows itself in differences or otherness . The single living individual lives and knows himself through the species , and the species lives through being transformed into spirit . The unitary and eternal ground of the whole process is the absolute spirit : the absolute all-inclusive individual . For Hegel the individual , the concrete self is real , but there is only one absolutely real individual ? God . God is the eternally realized absolute idea or purpose , the perfect individual or personality . Ho is the absolute spirit , in whom finite spirits live and move and have their being . In terms of feeling , God may be defined as Love , as a play of differentiation , together with the consciousness of the unity which dwells in the differences . God is the universal self-consciousness which comprehends within itself all // concrete differences . He is the unity of spirits . The society of finite spirits exists as the object of his thought . In him the scattered rays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converge to a single point ? to the unstained purity and translucence of an absolute selfconsciousness . It has been maintained that God or the Absolute , for Hegel , is simply the impersonal unity of a perfect society or community of selves ' I have not space to discuss this view fully here . Hegel frequently refers to the absolute as an individual , nay the individual . We have just seen the high estimate he places on selfhood as at once subject and object . Again he says , speaking of the dialectic process or activity of selfhood , " Every new step in the going-outside-itself , that is , in the farther determination , is also a return-into-self ; the wider extension , is at the same time , the higher intensity . The richest is the most concrete and subjective , and the mightiest and most comprehensive which goes back into its own simplest depth . The highest , extremest summit is pure personality which alone , through the absolute dialectic , which is in its nature , grasps and encloses everything in itself  --  since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first Immediacy and Universality . " ( Hegel , Wcrlce , V , p. 339 . ) In short , God , for Hegel , is the conscious unity which lives and acts , thinks and feels , in and through the whole system of finite being . He is the unity of subject and object , the living one in and through which the many have their being . As the unitary totality of all related beings he is the absolute . He is the universal all-including , all-sustaining self-of-selves . Thus far we have been outlining Hegel 's conception of // reality , and indicating how he reached it . We have seen that he regards everything finite and transitory as a phase of the eternal self-manifestation of the Absolute Self or Spirit . This spirit is dynamically and progressively immanent in the works of nature and the whole political and cultural or social life of man . But this absolute Spirit , as the eternal ground of the finite , transcends nature and human history . Man 's highest knowledges of him are attained through art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other features of Hegel 's doctrine this is reminiscent of Plato and Aristotle . ) Hegel carries out his fundamental insight by tracing out the evolution of human culture ; that is of art , religion , political history , and philosophy as , from one side , aspects in the progressive self-manifestation in time of the Absolute Spirit and , from the other side , the progressive selfrealization by humanity of its spiritual destiny through the growth in self-conscious possession of reason , beauty , social order , and individual freedom and unity with God . It is beyond the scope of this introduction to outline these . The beginner in the study of objective idealism will probably profit most by studying this aspect of Hegel 's work . In fact his philosophy of history is probably the best introduction to the study of his system . I shall have occasion to refer to some of these parts of Hegel 's Philosophy in later chapters . ( Cf. , especially Chapter XXVIII . ) The reader will find it interesting and profitable to compare the dialectic method of modern idealism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeno the Eleatic , and of Plato . Zeno 's aim appears to have been purely negative ? to refute the common assumption of the reality of motion , number and multiplicity in things , by showing that those who make such assumptions fall into hopeless contradictions . Thus the belief in motion , change and multiplicity is reduced to a logical absurdity . The dialectic of Plato has a positive , as well as a negative , purport . Plato aims , ( 1 ) to refute the dogmatic assumptions of common opinion // and , more especially , of the Sophists , by showing up their inherently self-contradictory character ; ( 2 ) to lead the mind of his hearers and readers up , from the unreflecting status of persons in whose minds a heterogeneous collection of unexamined and unrelated beliefs find lodgment , to an insight into the rational and systematic or " ideal " structure of reality . To this end Plato sets out from many different points of departure in common " opinion , " from ordinary views concerning moral qualities , aesthetic qualities , natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aim , in his dialectic , seems to he the same as Plato 's ; there is , however , this fundamental difference ? whereas , for Hegel , the dialectic process is the moving spring of reality itself , since reality is spirit and spirit lives and functions in the process itself , Plato does not seem to admit that reality , in its total truth and nature , is a process that is forever transcending itself and returning to itself . Plato 's insight into the nature of spirit is not so profound as that of Ilegel , who had behind him the results of nearly eighteen centuries of Western civilization impregnated with Christianity . Plato , I think , taught that true reality is spirit and that spirit is one-in-many . He did glimpse the dynamic and dialectic character of spirit , but he failed to see clearly the consequence that , from his premises , spirit must be the immanent dynamic activity of the whole of being . He does say that Ideas are powers , but he does not see that , if this be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plato does not plumb the full depths of personality or spiritual selfhood , and , therefore , there remains a dualism for him between the Ideal and the Actual . Hegel boldly says that this dualism is a moment in the eternal process of spiritual self-realization . Whether we agree with his interpretation of reality or not , we must admit that it was he who has most nearly sounded the full depths of the philosophy of spirit . I do not mean that Ilegel was infallible , nor that there is nothing more to be done in the interpretation of personality . I mean that he sketched the main outlines . In this sense all objective idealism , every interpretation of reality in terms of spirit , must follow in his path , though not in every one of his footsteps . The most important recent statements of objective idealism are those of F. H. Bradley and B. Bosanquet in England , and Josiah Royce in America . // Mr. Bradley 's Appearance and Reality ( 2nd Edition ) is the most brilliant and incisive piece of metaphysical writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quite extraordinary power of putting subtle dialectical argumentation into clear English . Here I shall only state briefly wherein he seems to modify the Hegelian statement of absolute idealism . The criticism most frequently directed at Hegel is that he reduced . the whole of nature and human experience and life to a cobweb spun by pure thought . It is charged that his absolute is the hypostatisation of pure thought , and that he is one-sidedly intellectualistic or panlogistic , ignoring the dominant part played by will and feeling in human life . As a consequence of this vice , it is said , Hegel attempts to reduce nature , history , and human life to a network or mesh of logical relations spun out by the spiderlike intellect of the Absolute . I do not regard these criticisms as wholly justified . Hegel 's Thought , Idea , or Notion ( Begriff ) includes feeling cultivated by the reason , and will as rational activity . But there is some measure of justification in the criticisms ? just how much is beyond the scope of this work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the distinction between thinking or knowing and its objects ; and that volition involves a similar duality ? the contrast between purpose or striving and the ends or objects thereof . The same duality infects the entire lives of selves or persons . One can think a self only in relation to that which is not-itself . The absolute unity can not then be thought , volition , or even a self . It must transcend the oppositions or dualisms by which these are necessarily beset . An immediate experience , analogous to love or a sthetic feeling , an experience in which thought , desire , and will are all taken up and transmuted into a perfect , harmonious and stable unity of feeling , is the Absolute . The Absolute then is a living , single , and seamless whole of experience , in which thought and will find their fruition , in which every flame of passion chaste or carnal burns , not in separation , but as an element in the perfect and utterly harmonious whole of experience . Outside this experience nothing can maintain itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evils , imperfections , errors , all ugliness and discords , are transmuted into the eternally perfect harmony of the One . Thus Mr. Bradley 's view is a speculative mysticism . His nearest of kin , in spirit , is Plotinus . The most obvious difficulties that are suggested by this view are : // 1 . How an experience can exist that is not felt nor owned by a self . All experience seems to belong to a self . Mr. Bradley might appeal to the poet Tennyson 's words : " Love took up the harp of Life , and smote on all the chords with might , Smote the chord of Self , that , trembling , passed in music out of sight . " 2 . How are we to harmonize the eternal and timeless perfection of the absolute with the facts of change , instability , evolution in nature , and striving , change , development , and progress in human life ? Here Mr. Bradley would say that the goal of all change , the bourne of all progress , the cessation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a consciousness of his true being in the absolute . These points are more fully developed in Chapter XXIV . Mr. Bosanquet 's view does not differ essentially from Mr. Bradley 's except that he seems to admit a greater relative reality to the physical order . His works give , perhaps , the best balanced statement of objective idealism , or " speculative philosophy , " as he calls it , in English . I have not space to compare in detail his standpoint with those of Hegel and Bradley . Mr. Bosanquet dwells less on the contradictoriness of finite lives and experiences and more on their positive contributions to the whole or absolute than does Mr. Bradley . Josiah Royce , our late American Idealist , has emphasized the volitional element in man and nature and , therefore , in the Absolute . For him the Absolute is the self of selves , the eternal all-knower , the solver of all problems , the fulfiller of all volitions . Tie is the all-inclusive self or individual . Our temporal and fragmentary lives are fragments of his eternally whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royce insists on the active or practical character of ideas ) find their eternal and perfect fulfillment in his perfect insight and will . The chief difficulties of objective or absolute idealism , regarded as a form of singularism , will be discussed in a following chapter . In the meantime , may I suggest that , if objective idealism , which seems on the whole to be the doctrine which squares best with the postulates of knowledge and science and with man 's practical , social , // and esthetic interests , is to meet the criticisms which are leveled against it , it must broaden its base and become dynamic . Let us imagine that the universe of finite , tem-poral , developing multiplicity , the universe which is thronged with living organisms , selves , histories , with all the struggle , passion , and pathos of humanity , with planets and star systems in evolution , is the ceaseless manifestation of the energizing life-force , not a mere cosmic consciousness of self-revolving thought but an eternally creative life , will , spirit ; and yet the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexhaustible fountain of energy , life , and thought , the source and conservator of values , life of our lives , bone of our bone , flesh of our flesh , thought of our thought , feeling of our feeling and yet transcending all finite energy , will , feeling and thought , as being the eter-nally creative self-existent fountain , ground and goal of all life , will , thought , aspiration ! Might we not thus dimly see that there may be peace in the midst of strife , harmony ruling through discord , values victorious through the striv-ing , struggling lives of men and animals , a good that overcomes and is richer for evil , a joy that swallows up and is deeper for suffering , a truth that is fuller and more concrete for all the fragments , which , seen apart from one another , seem error ? CHAPTER XIX THE IDENTITY OR DOUBLE ASPECT THEORY The identity or double aspect theory of the relation of soul or mind and body in man and in the universe was first formulated by Spinoza . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schelling , Fechner , Paulsen , Herbert Spencer , Heymans , and others . Fechner , Paulsen , Strong , and others give it a spiritualistic twist and Haeckel gives it a materialistic twist . It has found favor with many psychologists . According to this theory , reality consists of two irreducible and absolutely parallel aspects . They do not interact ; they are the two aspects of one principle or substance . Ordo idearum idem est atque ordo rerum . The order of ideas is the same as the order of things , that is , Spinoza means to say that the mental and physiological processes are parallel orders . Each one constitutes a causal nexus uninfluenced by the other ; but each of the two orders is , down to the minutest and most momentary event , an expression of the single determined order of the one substance ? God . Therefore the correspondence between the two orders of events is complete . This psycho-physical parallelism rests on the assumption that the degree of mental organization and perfection corresponds to the degree of bodily organization and perfection but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-faced expressions of the one substantial being . This standpoint , starting as a metaphysical interpretation of the relation of soul and body in man , is generalized into a theory of the relation of mind and matter in the universe at large . It thus passes 272 // from a psychological doctrine into a cosmology . Reality is one , but it has two faces or aspects , known to us as mind and body . In itself the one substance is neither mind nor body ; to us it appears as both . One who thinks clearly , and follows it through , can not stay in this double aspect view . There is an inevitable tendency to emphasize the one or the other term of the parallelism , to shade off from a monism with two faces into either spiritualism or materialism . Nevertheless , as regards the relation of body and soul there is an element of truth in this view . Mental and neural processes do exhibit a considerable degree of parallelism and can be thus fruitfully regarded . But the mental self is not literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it operates in the closest connection with the nervous system . The self is a more intimate and unique kind of unity than even a living organism ? . It is a unity whose constituent parts are not parts in any spatial , or even numerical , sense ; they are distinguishable , but not separable , aspects or phases of a living and indivisible unity . Each moment of a self 's life is the single pulsation of a continuous activity . The elements of a self completely interpenetrate one another . Furthermore , self-consciousness , the consciousness of being conscious , of feeling , acting , and thinking , is a property possessed by nothing in the world except thinking selves ; a property that , strictly speaking , has no physical parallel . If psychological parallelism be taken to mean that mental and physiological or neurological processes run parallel to one another , but never influence one another , it is open to three fatal criticisms : 1 . It is not a fact that bodily and mental processes do not influence one another , and the supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for ( a ) we can not identify mental processes corresponding to every sort of bodily process ; events art ) constantly occurring in organisms ( metabolisms ; secretions ) to which no corresponding mental process can be shown ; ( b ) there is no balanced correspondence or equivalcnve between the physiological correlates and the mental manifestations , social and individual ( consider the mental and social differences between receiving , by telegraph , the news respectively of an invitation to play golf , of the death of one 's beloved child , of a bequest of a million dollars , of the capitulation of the German army ) ; ( c ) the self functions as a unity , not always in the same degree , but at its best moments very fully ; what , then , is parallel in the physiological series to this dynamic unity of thought and volition ? Parallelism is atomistic in principle and can , logically , have no place for the unity of the self ; ( d ) the mental and bodily processes that correspond should be synchronous , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in time . 2 . If parallelism be true then there must be mental processes corresponding to everything that goes on in atoms or electrons . We should then have a doctrine of the feelings , thoughts and volitions of the atoms and electrons , their loves and hates , joys and sorrows ? in short , an electronic psychology and sociology . This is simply the utter confusion of thought and science . 3 . Parallelism sets out from an extreme dualism and then violently converts it into an abstract monism . The parallelism of mental and physical would be inexplicable , unless these are two aspects of one substance which is the real reality . What , then , is this one substance ? If it be an unknown third or X then we have a doctrine which explains the relatively unknown by the absolutely unknown . We do not know the inner " go " of the relations of mind and body . But , certainly , it is no illumination , but rather // a further darkening , of this mystery , to be told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third ; that this is the real reality . If it means that reality is psychical , that is true of some , but not of all , actual forms of being . And , if it means that the real reality is the physical , parallelism is then a specious name for materialism . SUMMARY VIEW OF THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM The following seems to me the most reasonable hypothesis . There are three grades of individua : ( 1 ) Inorganic or Physical Individua or Monads . These are dynamic centers , which yield sense qualities when they are in interactive relations with percipients . All that can be said about them , when they are not being perceived , is that they have the real possibilities of yielding sense qualities . Physical individua attract and repel one another and they form aggregates , varying in complexity and coherence from a heap of sand to a crystal or a magnet . ( 2 ) Vital Individua or Monads . These develop and maintain themselves by processes in which they utilize inorganic monads . They reproduce their kinds , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vital monads have a plasticity both of adjustment , self-maintenance and reproduction much greater than inorganic monads . Some , perhaps all , of them have sentience or feeling . Inorganic monads are instrumental and constituent to the organization of life and thus , indirectly , to the operation of mind . ( 3 ) Mental Individua or Selves . These develop and function in organized bodies . They are centers of awareness , memory , reflection , selection , valuation , invention , and rational or purposive conation or volition . They are in space and time , in the sense that they are associated with spatial configurations and have histories . But they are not bounded // by space and time in the same sense in which physical bodies are ; for they have the power to know at great distances , and , partially , to conquer space , as well as to span time by making records and executing purposes . Inorganic monads do not , as such , develop into selves ; but , on the other hand , there is no absolute dualism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f inorganic monads actually became selves , then there would be no real grounds for distinguishing between their respective characteristics or modes of behavior . Then we should have , not only a psychology and sociology of the electron but , as well , a logic , ethics , msthetics of electrons and molecules . The distinction between physical science and the moral and social sciences would vanish . Some monistic fanatics look for this happy consummation . To my mind , it is to blot out , rather than to fill in , the lineaments of genuine science . The realist ' is correct in his contention that no convincing argument has been advanced for the view that all that exists is psychic content , stuff , or " ideas . " And the burden of the proof is upon him who assumes that every thing in the universe is simply psychic stuff ; for , on the face of it , as well as when its behavior is probed by science , the physical realm does not appear to be psychic stuff . On the other hand , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or possible matter of experience , or , that , as law , universal , concept or value , does not belong to the texture of experience . But to say that , in order that anything may be , or may become , known , it must be psychical stuff , seems like arguing that he who would drive fat oxen must himself be fat . The contemporary objective idealist does not mean that // the stuff or content of reality is all psychical or mental . He means that the structure and drift or meaning of reality , taken as a whole , is the partly actual , and partly possible , expression and instrument of purposes and ideals . Ile means that values and ideals are not the blind products and playthings of mass particles in motion . Li this sense of teleological or axiological idealism , there is no halfway house open to man between idealism and materialism , except the frail shelter which accepts a final dualism between the order of nature and the order of values , and , declining either to affirm or deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , constrained to regard them as homeless and unparented waifs adrift in the cosmic storms . ( See further Chapter XXVII . ) Thus realism in epistemology leads , according to the weight attributed to the values of personality in relation to the physical world , either to materialism , idealism , or agnosticism , in metaphysics . In view of the varied and misleading meanings of the word " Idealism " it would , perhaps , be better to call the view which I have stated , as my own , " Organic experientialism . " I will now summarize this view . Reality is experience ( actual and possible ) . It is an organized whole having many degrees of individuality . So far I go with Leibnitz . The whole world is a dynamic process , but the physical world is not psychical in itself . Selves are true parts of the world . The physical order is the substructure of the social order . There is therefore nothing real which is not subject or object of either actual or possible experience . Furthermore , experience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is accessible to all selves . Of the individual self we can have no adequate conception apart from society . The individual lives and develops only as a member of a social order . Now the physical is the real , common ground of our social // activities . But the social and spiritual is also a true part of the real . The physical is intelligible and is to some extent subject to human control . And because of this we may say it is a part of a teleological system , but it is not a figment of the ego 's imagination , as Fichte came perilously near saying . Nor is nature the mere subservient tool of purpose interpreted in a narrowly humanistic or supernaturalistic fashion , as was done by older naive and preevolutionary teleologists in their watchmaker theories of design . ( Of this matter more anon . ) In the real world of actual and really possible experience , which is the only world that has concrete meanings for human beings , **28;191;TOOLONG and physical nature are in organic or functional interdependence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains nonmental individuated centers of force or dynamic relationship , vitally organized and psychical individuals of various grades of wealth of content , degree of organization and harmony . All these various types of individual or monads live and function in what , for want of a better term , I call " organic or functional " interrelation and interexistence . The highest type of individuum that we know is a rational human individual or personality . In human individuality the functioning of mind is conditional upon the functioning of a central nervous system , but , as I have already argued , we are not compelled , since we have not sufficient grounds for the assumption , to say that mind and nervous system are absolutely identical . An individual mind is a conscious , active , and selective center of meanings and values expressing itself through , and therefore conditioned by , a physiological organization . The mind is the dynamic meaning and purpose of the body . The relation between them is not properly described as " causal . " It is the functional interdependence of two systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which body is the teleological instrument of mind . Such , with reference to the soul-body and mind-matter problems , is the standpoint which may be called " organic experientialism " or " dynamic idealism . "
