As usual , the sun did not set on the British Empire , last week ; but during a most unusual period of 36 hours the sun never rose except to beam upon a land where Death stood waiting for some British airmen . <P> At Hongkong , a Fairy 3-F seaplane with three Royal Air Force officers aboard became unmanageable in the air directly above the aircraft carrier H. M. S. Hermes . Plunging down like a plummet it tore a hole in the Hermes ' flying deck , burst into flames and then rolled overboard into the sea . By smart work with a boat-hook the dead body of Flying Officer A. W. Hale was recovered before it sank ; but divers had to go down after what remained of Air Lieutenant J. H. Graham and Telegraphist Stanley Jackson . <P> Two more Royal Air Force officers crashed to meet Death , last week , in the British-mandated Kingdom of Irak . Finally Death lay shrewdly in wait while an air shambattle was staged at Colchester , England . Two daring pilots attempted to sweep low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they crashed and scored for Death , last week , a total of seven . <P> Optimistic Royal Air Force officials pointed out that although 25 of their airmen have lost their lives this year , the number was 48 in 1927 and 85 in 1926 . With a little luck 1928 will not be Death 's Banner Year .
