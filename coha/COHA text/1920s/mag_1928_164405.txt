In 1886 , when " Uncle Alf " Taylor first stumped from Knoxville to Memphis and back again , campaigning for the Governorship against his Brother Bob , he fiddled in vain for the political support of the gentlemen of Tennessee . Last week , the gentlemen of Tennessee , political and notable , danced attendance on Uncle Alf . In the greatest fox hunt the state has ever known , Tennessee honored its beloved old sportsman and one time ( 1920-22 ) governor , Alfred Alexander Taylor . And up in the rugged foothills of the Smoky Mountains , on the northeastern tongue of Tennessee , the rugged 80-year-old " Sage of Happy Valley " played jovial host to the folk who had finally elected him their chief only eight years before . <P> On Bogart 's Knob , just before midnight , more than 100 blooded hounds pointed long noses into the crisp , still air , sniffed , caught the scent , were gone . At their head , gallantly leading his last hunt , ran " Old Limber , " Uncle Alf 's famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol 's walls . Baying excitedly , their notes cutting through the silent woods , the dogs circled . They closed in , relentlessly , on their furry , red prey . <P> Meanwhile on top of the Knob in a huge circus tent crowded with a thousand guests , steaming with the warm smell of barbecue , Southern style , Uncle Alf held court . The baying of the hounds grew fainter outside . Uncle Alf rambled on until dawn , delighting the merrymakers with reminiscences . Scores of uniformed Negroes bustled about , serving the immense banquet to which ten sheep , ten pigs , 500 pounds of beef , had contributed . All " the fixin 's " were there . <P> The Old Limber Quartet , three-fourths made up of Uncle Alf 's sons , crooned native spirituals . Old-time fiddlers jiggled out old-time favorites . A quartet of Negro bell hops shuffled , sweated , grinned . <P> Tennessee 's McKellar and Tennessee 's Tyson had slipped home from the U. S. Senate to be there . Governor Horton and Hill McAllister , his political antagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-time " Uncle Alf " Taylor , who used to spin yarns over 40 years ago , and was still going strong .
