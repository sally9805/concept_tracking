His father , a distinguished surgeon of Puritan spine , wanted him to join the Navy . But his mother was musical and did water colors . Besides , he was brought up traveling abroad , where talented young pencils itch in the art galleries . So John Singer Sargent* became a painter . <P> That he became perhaps the greatest painter ever born of U. S. parents was due in part to inheritance from a father whose very integrity overruled his prejudice against what , in 1870 when John Sargent was 14 , was regarded as a profession not quite respectable . <P> The upright father even decided in favor of naughty Paris . He had faith in his son . Never was faith better placed . Under Carolus Duran , dutiful young John Sargent so " persevered in the Pine Arts " that he had no time for Parisian gaiety . In a negligee Bohemia his dress remained correct . Amid fads and fashions ornate , voluptuous , bizarre , he followed only Frans Hals and Velasquez . He learned , thoroughly , to build on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> He migrated naturally to England , tilting his easel outside a Cotswold cottage wherein Henry James and Edmund Gos.se were busy writing . He painted Stevenson pacing thoughtfully in velveteen jacket . He took Whistler 's egg-colored studio in Tite Street , London , and deprecated with amused humility a chorus of praise that arose , swelled and continued without interruption during his life . <P> Max Beerbohm caricatured the queue of fashionables awaiting a sitting at Sargent 's door and Sargent grew to say " paughtraits " in mock disgust . The Boston Library and Harvard gave him splendid scope for his genius on their walls . Yet for " paughtraits " he continued most famous . His President Wilson fetched $50,000 . Some day , perhaps , his landscapes will bring the like . He was an outdoor man , a sketcher in the Alps , Tyrol , Rockies . Pre-Raphaelitism , or any ism omitting the air and light or nature , were incomprehensible to him . <P> John Sargent died in 1923 , reading peacefully one evening in his London bed . An artist who transplanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried a stuffed gazelle about Europe for another work , he was painstaking . A Victorian who said , " Ruskin , don t you know-rocks and clouds-silly old thing " , he had critical independence . An observer who called English trees " old Victorian ladies going perpetually to church in a land where it is always Sunday afternoon , " he was more whimsy-realistic than imaginative . An artist who , to fasten the attention of a restless , primitive Spanish model ( Dancer Carmencita ) , painted his nose red and ate his cigar , he had ingenuity , humor . An erect , burly , bearded man who waited days to cool off before thrashing an abusive farmer , he was gentle , temperate , poised , just . A portraitist who could block out , build up , polish and accent an oil masterpiece in one sitting , with never any weak " teasing up " or dishonest glossing over , he had the disciplined intensity of genius truly great . . . .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
