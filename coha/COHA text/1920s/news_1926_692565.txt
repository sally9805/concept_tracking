txt The wets in Congress challenged the drys today to an open test on the modification issue . offering to risk their whole case on the outcome , when Senator Edge , Republican , sif New Jersey . one of the prominent wet leaders , introduced in the Senate a joint resolution under the provisions of which the voters in all of the States would be permitted to express their opinion on prohibition by ballot in the Congressional elections in 1928 . The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee and Senator Edge will make every effort to have it reported and brought to a vote . Simultaneoualy in the Rouse the wets began another assault upon the Government 's handling of the prohibition problem , Representative Linthicura , Democrat , of Maryland . asserting that appropriations for enforcement amounted annually to $33,000.000 , while another $53,000,000 had been invested in expansion of the Coast Guard and other Government machinery , and despite this all efforts at enforcement had been unsuccessful . Andrews to Make Report Soon . The issue was also discussed by General Lincoln C. Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will round out his first year of service on April 1 , and will then make a report of what he believes has been accomplished . General Andrews said that , while the completion of his program for changes in the law had been delayed , he hoped to submit additional proposals to Congress next week . Favorable action by Congress , he felt , would aid materially in better enforcement . There was no hint by General Andrews today that he contemplated resigning . General Andrews indicated that the information turned over to Secretary Mellon recently by Governor Pinchot of Pennsylvania , in which the latter accused eighty-one permittees of illegal traffic in alcohol in Pennsylvania . had not proved very sensational . Renewal ' of permits in fiftyone of the cases , General Andrews said . bad already been refused , while in twenty-seven instances hearings had been in progress , with the probability that new permits would be withheld . The other three cases , he said , would be investigated . Edge Presses for Referendum . The Edge resolution proposed that in order to furnish Congress information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eighteenth Amendment there be authorized a national referendum which would give the voters an opportunity to cast their ballots for or against the following proposition : " Shall the Congress amend the National Prohibition act ( commonly known as the Volstead act ) so as to allow the manufacture , sale , transportation and possession of beverages containing as great an amount of alcohol as is lawful under the Constitution , provided that such amendments shall not interfere with the constitutional powers of the several States to legislate with respect to intoxicating liquors as each State may deem proper ? " The States would be authorized to conduct the referendum . The question above quoted would be stated upon the ballots without alteration , or explanation , and any individual qualified by law to vote for Congressional candidates would be qualified to vote on the modification issue . An appropriation would be made to reimburse each State for the cost of the referendum . Explains Ills Proposal . " The purpose of this resolution , " said Senator Edge , " is to provide a method for securing a national referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The overwhelming verdict for modification as presented by newspaper polls has been frequently challenged by spokesmen for the drys . They insist defenders of prohibition had not voted ; that the poll anyhow was wet propaganda and that the result should not be accepted as in any way conclusive . " While I disagree with their conten- ' ttion , still it has appealed to me that an opportunity for a legal referendum vote should be provided . If , as the drys claim , they have no fear that public opinion has reversed itself , then it would seem they should unhesitatingly endorse this plan for a legal national showdown . Naturally , if they are as confident they correctly estimate the public view as they claim , they should really sponsor this resolution . However , I have seen no indication of it being presented from that source , and as I believe the large majority of the public really want to know the facts , I am offering the opportunity . " In the House Representative Linthicum , declaring that prohibition is costing the Federal Government more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in enforcement work , submitted figures from the appropriation bills to show that they carried $14,560,011 for the Coast Guard 's share of prohibition enforcement , 310,635,685 for the Treasury Department and $5,000,000 for the Department of Justice , this being one-third the total appropriation for the latter department . The Government , he said , had invested $19,194,900 this fiscal year for new vessels and repairs for the Coast Guard Service and would spend $3,900 , - 000 for additional ships and repairs in the next fiscal year and $37,500,000 for twenty-five torpedo boats transferred from the navy to the Coast Guard . " Suppose we add to this . " Mr. Linthicum said , " the cost of the patrol of our boundaries to prevent the importation or entrance of liquor , the money which the States that are cooperating in the enforcement are expending , and the cost of the number of other incidentals necessary thereto , and just imagine what it is costing the citizens of the United States . " Sees Coast Guard Demoralized . Instead of doing good , Mr. Linthicum added , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beset us on all sides . " " I am told , " he said , " that of the 175 Coast Guard employes in the Narragansett service , seventy-five are under arrest . Two crews of the Coast Guard have gone over to the enemy entirely . From Cincinnati it is said that a great Pullman train carrying forty policemen and twenty prohibition officers left for the Atlanta prison . The great service known as the Coast Guard Service has been so injured through the efforts to enforce the Volstead act that no longer is it an honor to be a member thereof . " Our United States District Courts are so busy with the trials of prohibition cases that the courts have scarcely any time for other work . They are being largely reduced to criminal courts , or police courts , for the trial of such cases . The Judges are so overworked that it is necessary for us to provide additional Judges that the commercial and business interests of our country may have prompt service . " Mr. Linthicum said it appears that the best method for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method as that adopted by the Province of Quebec in Canada , where on 3 can secure liquor from Government dispensaries . " If we once remove the hazard and sporting feature from the liquor question , " be said , " I verily believe the hip-pocket flask will soon disappear from the young bloods of our country , that the moral conditions of the land will be greatly improved and that we shall no longer have the rum-runners at our oceanfront , the stills on our mountainsides and in the basements , garages and farms of the country ; that no longer will the bootleggers be removing the poison from some forty million gallons of alcohol released by the Government supposedly for industrial purposes . " Representatives Weller and Black of New York , wets , joined Representative Linthicum in scoring the Volstead law . " As to the political aspect of this subject , " said Mr. Black , " there IS only one thing certain and that is this : We have a Republican President . we have a Republican Congress , and they have not enforced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to enforce the law and they have not even modified the law . " There is the responsibility right over there , " concluded Mr. Black , as he pointed to the Republican side . Directing attention to newspaper polls on prohibition , Mr. Weller asserted that the results of these polls clearly indicated that the country favored a program of modification .
