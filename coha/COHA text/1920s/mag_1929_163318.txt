Broadway Nights . The Brothers Shubert , playing an infallible system which calls for sprigs of vaudeville and bouquets of decoration , find it profitable to keep at least two musical shows going at once . No sooner had their Pleasure Bound closed than they prepared Broadway Nights to companion their A Night in Venice . If a blindfolded playgoer were ushered into one , then permitted to look , he might easily mistake it for the other . <P> In the first act of Broadway Nights a group of tinted chorines dance before a mammoth synthetic rosebush . In the second act the celebration is repeated for orchids . The cast is headed by Odette Myrtil , a rough-voiced Parisienne who makes pantherlike glides around the stage while playing cardiac tunes on her violin . This combination of music and motion is popular , but by any comparative standard the name of Laura Lee , the show 's small , vivacious song-plugger , should also be featured . <P> Bogus lectures on anatomy are given by horn-spectacled Dr. Rockwell , who also plays a flageolet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls-the mad bellows and sobs of Harry Welsh as a shouting waiter ; the kicks which short , tough Joe Phillips aptly places on female targets . <P> Freddy is a blinking , fatuous caretaker on the Surrey estate of one Gommery who is busy trying to seduce a London actress . This leaves Mrs. Gommery idle , repressed . She would like to have Caretaker Freddy take care of her . Frightened , as an excuse for leaving , he invents for himself a-mistress in London to whom he must repair . By chance he selects the name of Mr. Gommery 's actress . This mock disclosure precipitates an extremely dull , English-accented farce in the P. G. Wodehouse manner but without the Wodehumor . C. Stafford Dickens is playwright and Gommery . Raymond Walburn is Freddy .
