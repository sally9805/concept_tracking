A SHORT HISTORY OF WOMEN-John Langdon-Davies-Viking ( $3 ) . It is no compliment to women that histories which deal with their past behavior must be so labeled ; histories of the world 's affairs seldom include them to any large extent . Of the many histories which have been devoted to women , perhaps this is the most enlightening . It follows the history , not of different individuals , but of women as a class through savagery to their present civilization . Why they differ from men , what they may hope to accomplish ; these are the points discussed . Several points are settled , among them this : " We have constantly seen throughout this history . . . that the right to work is absolutely essential to the happiness of women . . . . " If the title is in a sense a slur , a compliment to femininity is the distinguished style and brilliant perception of Author John Langdon-Davies , previously noted for The New Age of Faith .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
