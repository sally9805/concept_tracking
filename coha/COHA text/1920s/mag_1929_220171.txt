Astounding it was to U. S. physicians , patients and therapeutic lamp manufacturers to learn that the British Medical Research Council last week decried the use of light treatments . There are two general kinds of light used in medicine-heat-producing , generated by carbon filaments ; and ultraviolet ray ( artificial sunlight ) producing , generated by a carbon arc , by a mercury arc , or by special filaments lighting through quartz . Undoubtedly such lights have done good . This is particularly so of the ultraviolet light , used to overcome rickets by direct exposure of puny children . <P> Yet the British Medical Research Council , an authoritative organization , did proclaim last week that " when conditions between children with and without light treatment is equalized , the result of light treatment is wholly negative .
