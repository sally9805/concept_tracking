txt The Actors ' Equity Association , having withdrawn : under an order issued last night , from its ten weeks ' strike to enforce the Equity shop on the moving picture industry , Frank Gillmore , president of Equity . today criticized ? Ethel . Barrymore , implying that . the star was responsible - for his Members of Equity , were permitted to go back to ' work under " academy " conditions . Mr. Gillmore said he had been called back to New . York by William Canavan for conferences with heads of the international unions interested in the motion picture field to discuss cooperative steps . toward , enforcement of Equity rules in Hollywood . Meanwhile the bitter war is oyer  --  with the producers hole:ng the advantage . Of all the obstacles met with , Mr. Gillmore declared , the critical statement of his conduct of affairs recently issued by Ethel Barrymore , vice president of Equity and a member of the ' committee ' negotiating with the producers . served as the worst blow . He said the actress was not present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement saying " a solution " was re . rho " 1 . Charges " Personal Grudge . " " In my opinion , " Mr. Gillmore said , . " no matter what Miss Barrymore felt , she should have remained silent ; she should not have taken the risk of condemning her people , as she'herself calls you , to possible defeat . What , did she gain by her action ? Apparently nothing but the payment of a personal grudge against me : that is. if she had one , although when I look back over the years that I have known her , I can truthfully say that if any woman has been treated by me with careful consideration it is Ethel Barrymore . " Some people have asked why she was on the committee at all . Looking back at it now , I can see it was a mistake . but she made some effort to bring about a meeting , and apparently she wanted to be present : Wanted Woman 's Influence . " Frankly , we felt that the presence of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of discussion and keep everything within bounds . We could not anticipate she would act in the way she did . " Some people have asked why . I did not endeavor to get labor interested earlier . ' I have been after labor from the beginning , but all unions have their obligations and their officers have been hampered by agreements . " You remember the glorious telegrams of encouragement and strong resolutions which ' I wrote you . some nine weeks ago ? Unfortunately , they have been of no practical value : We made a final appeal to the international heads ten days ago and this may bring results . " Leaves Members Free to Sign . HOLLYWOOD , Cal. , Aug. 18 RI ? Frank Gillmore , Equity president , announced last night that Equity members from Monday until further notice were free to sign the standard contracts of the Motion Picture Producers , Inc. , against which Equity has fought for two months . more promised to " return within two or three weeks to renew the fight . " - Ethel Barrymore , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized Gillmore for advocating " a solution which was not a solution " - of the Hollywood problem and ? of passing by an agreement which she contended had virtually been reached with the producers regarding the inelusion of Equity members in motion picture casts . He declared that as Miss Barrymore 's connection with the Equity Council was an honorary one , she was not in a position to know whether an agreement with the producers was near . As a result of her statement many people have returned to work , " he said , " and this has brought about a crisis . " Equity 's original effort to place the Hollywood studios on a closedshop basis was to enforce . 100 per cent Equity membership in all casts . To this end Equity actors were forbidden to work under non-Equity contracts . The producers declined to cease employing non-Equity members and ten days ago Gillmore offered a compromise agreement by which all casts were to contain 80 per cent Equity members . The producers declined ' this also , offering instead . to allow Equity a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood provided there should ? be no Ties . tion regarding the producers ' right to employ any members of the profession which Equity failed to draw into its ranks . Gillmore and his committee members refused this , eliciting criticism from Miss Barrymore . The offer subsequently was withdrawn by the producers . Ethel Barrymore Is Pleased . SAN FRANCISCO , Aug. 18 ( M. ? Ethel Barrymore , first vice president of the Actors ' Equity Association , is glad the trouble in Hollywood is over , at least temporarily . " Can it really be true ? " she demanded , when told of President Gilmore 's withdrawal . " Now all the poor out-of-work actors and actresses can resume their careers . " Apparently fearing her enthusiasm might be misinterpreted , she hastened to add : " But , do n't forget , I have always been in sympathy with Equity . It is only because the actors are my own people that I feel as I do . " Harding Uninformed , He Says . Alfred Harding of the New York Equity office , said last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spending the weekend , that although the Hollywood strike had been called off , so far as he knew the . organization here had not been officially notified that Equity had abandoned its ? plan to organize players in sound and talking pictures . He said that Paul Dullzell , executive secretary of the association , had recently been in conference with . William Canavan , ? president of the stage employes ' . union , . about the possibility- of calling out the stage workers both in the studios andry in film theatres over the count . Equity announced its intention of invading the audible film field on June 4 , when it declared that . from that time on its members could-be engaged for motion picture work only under the terms of a contract prepared by it and only for pictures in - which ? all the players were Equity members The contract established a forty-eight hour week , With extra payment for overtime , and specified that all rehearsals should-be paid for . as regular employment .
