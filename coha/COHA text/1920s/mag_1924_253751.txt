In a competition for model airplanes conducted by the French Air Ministry , a 16-year-old boy , Gaston Beaulieux , did well . His wonderful model , with a few strands of twisted rubber driving a tiny propeller , was released from a captive balloon at a height of over 600 feet , went up in regular circles to a height of 1,500 feet and disappeared from view in the direction of Versailles . A search was conducted for the tiny airplane.
