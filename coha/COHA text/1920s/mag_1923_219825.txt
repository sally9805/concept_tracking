Until twelve years ago , when wild-eyed Madero unhoused the venerable Diaz , Mexico was just a place for foreign money to go and make more money . Madero started a series of rattling revolutions which lasted until the assassination of Carranza in 1920 . <P> Then in stepped Alvaro Obregon , one-armed fighter , idealist . He found a " Constitution " which had been evolved during the revolutionary period , and it was his intention to make the Constitution work . <P> The purpose of the Constitution was to make Mexico a free country in which most Mexicans would be able to live as citizens instead of existing as serfs . All the odds were against Obregon . The State Department at Washington , withholding official recognition , refused to bet on him . And Washington told London and Paris not to bet on him . <P> In Mexico , Obregon was threatened from front and rear . There were the " reactionaries " - old Spanish landlords who resented the new ideas of liberty , corrupt officials , the rich Catholic Church . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be no chance of getting them sober before they set the house on fire . <P> In three years Obregon has established his Constitution . Mexico is rapidly becoming a happy home for Mexicans . The great haciendas have been split up into small farms . Schools are increasing in numbers and merit . The railroads are beginning to function at a profit . And , for the first time since Madero 's wild plunge , the Government of Mexico has produced a budget which fulfills the constitutional requirements . It is by this budget that the first payments are being made to the landlords who were deprived of their land , and also the first payments on the international debt . The Army and Navy is decreased , while expenditures on education move up to 15 per cent of the total budget . <P> In achieving all this , Obregon has had capable coadjutators . First of all there is Huerta , the finance minister who arranged with Thomas W. Lament of J. P. Morgan &; Co. for the refunding of the Mexican debt . Descended from Yaqui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a soldier . Whatsoever things are practical , he thinks on those things . Then there is General Calles , head of the cabinet . A dreamer , a radical , once a school teacher , he has lived for " land and freedom . " An unofficial helper has been Morones , labor leader . He wears check suits , silk shirts , and a heavy revolver ; and from his one good eye watches the machinations of foreign capitalists . <P> The parliament is gradually learning how to behave . It has been two years since , by Obregon 's orders , the fire-hose was turned on the assembled members .
