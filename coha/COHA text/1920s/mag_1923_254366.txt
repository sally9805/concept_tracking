The actual cost of producing anthracite coal does not warrant the excessively high prices which the public are paying , according to a report made by a committee representing the United Mine Workers of America , and brought to the attention of the United States Coal Commission . <P> In the report the miners make the following main contentions : <P> 1 ) The earnings of miners average from $1,142 to $1,496 , annually , which is below the level of minimum subsistence . <P> 2 ) Some companies make many of their own supplies or are intimately connected with supply companies . This enables them to charge three or four times the actual cost of supplies in their accounting . <P> 3 ) Companies claim the amount necessary for miners ' insurance is 10 cents a ton , while in 1921 only 4 cents a ton was paid out to the miners , thus reducing the coal companies ' cost figures by $4,200,000 annually . <P> 4 ) Electrification of the mines has resulted in economies which have not been shown in the claimed costs . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving a corresponding increase in production . <P> " The cost of anthracite coal can never be figured in dollars and cents alone , " concludes the report , " there must be added to the labor cost an annual toll of over 500 lives , of over 20,000 workers who suffer accidents , of men and boys who do work as dirty and dangerous as soldiers in war , that coal may be produced to warm the homes of our people .
