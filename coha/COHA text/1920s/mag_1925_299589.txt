From day to day the pound sterling has bounded up and up . Its par level in terms of U. S. dollars is $4.8654 After 1919 , it fell by degrees to a figure far under $4.00 , the chief reason being that a major part of the world 's gold supply was in the U. S. In the early months of 1923 , it had climbed up to $4.71-the highest figure since the War control over Allied exchanges was abandoned in March , 1919 . The advance was short-lived and the pound sank back to $4.34 in December of the same year . This decline was due in part to the exportation of capital to the U. S. on account of the Ruhr occupation by France , and in part to the expatriation of capital caused by the advent of the Labor Ministry early last year . <P> Last November , a Conservative Ministry was elected in Britain .

The British Government must make up its mind to resume gold payments or extend the legislation prohibiting it . Which is it to be ? That is the argument . <P> It seems fairly certain that , if the pound continues to rise and maintains its advance , the British Government will permit the shackles about gold currency to be unlocked at the end of the year , but nothing is likely to happen before then .
