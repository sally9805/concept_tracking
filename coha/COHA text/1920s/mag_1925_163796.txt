Out of Boston , starting at scratch with Paul Revere one spring night in 1775 , William Dawes did his share in awakening the countryside to the news that the British were coming-although Revere got most of the credit . Out of Lincoln , Neb. , starting at scratch with Charles W. Bryan , one of William Dawes ' descendants set out on a long ride into U. S. politics . It is not yet determined which of them will get the more credit , although it appears that Dawes-Charles Gates Dawes it is this time-appears to have made greater headway in arousing the countryside . <P> In 1897 he turned the first lap when McKinley made him Comptroller of the Currency . In 1917 he turned the second lap when General Pershing took him on his staff and made him General Purchasing Agent of the A. E. F. After the War he did some first rate arousing when Congress be- gan to question him about purchases for the A. E. . F. and he ejaculated , " Hell ' nd Maria , the Army was sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over pennies . " He did some more arousing as the first Director of the Budget , when in 1921 he set to work hacking down Federal appropriations . Then the vice-presidency was shoved at him and he took it-and continued his arousing by making an opening speech to the Senate which made three-fourths of the senators " see red . " <P> In 1789 when the Senate assembled for the inauguration of the first President , the first Vice President faced the Senate and querulously asked : " When the President comes into the Senate , what shall I be ? I can not be President* then . I wish you gentlemen to think what I shall be . " <P> When Charles G. Dawes faced the Senate on March 4 , 1925 , he did not ask the senior Senator from New Hampshire , nor the junior Senator from Idaho , nor the senior Senator from California , nor the junior Senator from Arkansas , nor the senior Senator from Wisconsin - no , nor their colleagues assembled : " When the President comes into the Senate , what shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Charles G. Dawes , and in the presence of the President he proceeded to call the Senate to ac- count for wasting its time and the country 's , telling it that it ought to be ashamed of the way it allowed filibusters to frustrate its action - ashamed ! - until the blushes rose even to the brow of the modest President who sat waiting to be inaugurated ( TIME , March 16 ) . <P> At first the Senate was angry- not so much at what the Vice President said as at the bold way he said it-and then it was amused , or if it could not be amused , pretended to be . The Senate felt it had little to worry about . Once in four years the Vice President can make a little speech , and then he is done . For four years he then has to sit in the seat of the silent , attending to speeches ponderous or otherwise , of deliberation or humor . <P> But Mr. Dawes was unwilling to be silent . All summer long while he was away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and near , from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains , telling not Senators but their constituents that the Senate should put an end to filibustering by tightening up its rules .
