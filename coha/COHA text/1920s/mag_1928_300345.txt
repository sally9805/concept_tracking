U. S. President Atchison <P> Sirs : <P> It has been stated repeatedly in TIME that Herbert Hoover will be the 31st President . While I realize that this is the usual way of reckoning , it would be more accurate to say that he will be the 32d President . I do not believe you have considered David Rice Atchison , who was President for exactly two days in 1849 . <P> The inauguration day of General Zachary Taylor fell on Sunday , March 4 , 1849 . President Folk 's term expired on March 3 . As president of the senate David Rice Atchison became chief magistrate of the nation from noon on Saturday until noon on Monday-between Folk 's retirement and Taylor 's inauguration . <P> This is offered by way of news-not for unTIMEly fault finding . <P> <P> STEUART H. BRITT <P> Kansas City , Mo . <P> <P> According to Robert L. ( " Believe It or Not " ) Ripley in the New York Evening Post , President Atchison slept all during his term of office. - ED . <P> <P> Hoover-Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Nominees Smith and Hoover " never met . " Perhaps you meant during the campaign . I picked up a little pamphlet the other day and saw where Hoover and Smith both addressed some banquet in New York-at the Astor I think it was-several years ago . . . . <P> <P> T. T. SPENCER <P> Detroit , Mich . <P> <P> TIME should have qualified and said : " They never met during the campaign . " Could Reader Spencer 's " little pamphlet " have been the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. ' s Intelligencer ? In the September issue of that able house-organ , pride was taken in the fact that the Messrs . Hoover and Smith once attended and addressed a company banquet at the Hotel Astor , Manhattan . It was said that President Haley Fiske of the company was probably " the only living man who has the distinction of having sat at dinner with the candidates for President of the two great parties , one on his right and the other on his left . " The banquet was in 1923 . The Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they spoke together for the Red Cross at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. - ED . <P> McCoy und Gott <P> Sirs : <P> J. P. McCoy says ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) : " England has no more right in India than she has in Ireland , or Egypt , or in South Africa , and with the help of God she will one day yet be forcibly ejected from them . " <P> McCoy und Gott-is it-will do the job ? Or is the mention of God 's name a mere rhetorical flourish , characteristic of the race ? And will the job be McCoy's-alone ? <P> And , av coorse , India and South Africa will be restored to the Irish then-with J. P. McCoy himself as viceroy ! or , mebbe , king itself ! <P> RALPH WARDLAW GLOAG ( a joyous subscriber ) <P> Boston , Mass . <P> <P> Again , Vodka <P> Sirs : <P> . . .
