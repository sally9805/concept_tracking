Secretary of War Dwight Filley Davis would never think of suggesting that President Calvin Coolidge ought to do his own marketing , or that Mrs. Coolidge ought to be the White House cook . But just such suggestions were made last week by China 's Minister of War , the great Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang . <P> Addressing the Committee of Yuans , on which sit both the President of China and Mrs. Chiang Kaishek , Marshal Feng drew himself up to his potent height of six feet and said : <P> " I desire to emphasize the necessity of economy , both for our new Nationalist Government ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) and in our private lives . I hope that all members of this government will practice strict economy and avoid bad habits . Do n't degenerate ! Even our highest officials should do their own marketing , and their wives should do the family cooking . " <P> From a prissy little man such words would sound insufferably priggish . From Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang-who looks like the Great Buddha suddenly galvanized into something strenuous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance and power . Chinese know that the largest private army in the world-150,000 men-is maintained by Feng Yu-hsiang , and that he has inspired his soldiers to a remarkable degree with his own austere strength . Each soldier has been taught a trade . The whole army can support itself indefinitely upon the Chinese countryside in Liberty , Frugality , Fraternity . <P> Naturally War Minister Feng could not resist the temptation to preach his favorite principles , last week , to the new Nationalist Government and to President and Mrs. Chiang Kaishek . Whether the President will hereafter go marketing every day in his armoured Packard car remained to be seen . But the whole Government paid strictest attention as Marshal Feng developed the thesis of Spartan endeavor against a common enemy-JAPAN . <P> At the passionate climax of his address Marshal Feng boomed : " China has 400,000,000 people , yet we can not resist the bullying of a nation with only a few scores of millions . Japanese Imperialism is comparable only to the ways of wolves and tigers . What with their gunboat policy and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Take the recent Tsinan incident. * How many innocent country men of ours were killed there ? The bones of many still lie unburied , yet Japan still occupies Shantung . <P> " These national humiliations and other disheartening matters confront us for solution , and they are not easy to solve . Our great responsibility is to maintain and protect the legacy of our ancestors and to hand it over intact to our descendants ! " <P> Turning from foreign to domestic problems , Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang concluded his memorable address thus : <P> " What parasites and pests are the Communists , always plotting to create trouble , trying to poison the minds of our people and upset the social and political balance . <P> " Gentlemen , under such grave conditions , encroachments from abroad and communism from within , we must work in harmony and cooperate with each other , for we are besieged on all sides by enemies .
