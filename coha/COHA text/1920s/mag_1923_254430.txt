To Create the Essential Illusion Without Violating the Constitution <P> No real scene ever did look like a scene of the stage . That is true in greater or less degree whether the scene be a forest , waving like a set of green banners behind the proscenium , or a street in the Venetian ghetto of the Merchant of Venice , with every stick and stone and human being arranged with indefatigable precision by Belasco , king of realists . The spectator never can quite persuade himself that he is peeking through a chink in the fourth wall of the room , hiding behind a poison ivy vine in the woods , or bobbing about behind a wave on the ocean . <P> Every one but Belasco having been convinced of that , producing souls have been in a turmoil trying to decide just how to create the essential illusion without having to violate the Constitution every time a character is supposed to take a drink . <P> There are two solutions . The simplest is to shift the responsibility to the collective imagination of the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs in front , twin beds in the rear , and page Mr. Avery Hopwood . Or ( as in Dagmar , the sophisticated melodrama with Nazi mova ) , put three beach chairs on a yellow stage with a blue backdrop and call it the seashore . In Mary the 3rd , Rachel Crothers ' humorous tragedy of incompatibility , the first two scenes are mounted only with draperies , a modicum of furniture , and off-stage music . <P> The other solution is " Expressionism , " about which at present there is much alarmed twaddle . The only really fearsome thing about expressionism is its name-and an occasional crime ( such as Lionel Barrymore 's Macbeth last year ) committed in its name . <P> The fundamental principle of expressionism is the representation not of the appearance of a scene , but its meaning . A characteristic instance was the Fifth Avenue scene in Eugene O'Neill 's Hairy Ape . Jewels were to the misplaced stoker only tinsel ; so the shop window was filled not with gems , but tinsel . The wealthy churchgoers appeared to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the stage . <P> The most successful recent use of expressionism is in the Theatre Guild 's production of Ibsen 's astonishing poetic drama , Peer Gynt . Full-grown people live in dwarfed houses ; deserts are indicated by a suggestion of sand ; fjords , oceans , mountains become a pile of cubist rocks and a blue line on the backdrop .
