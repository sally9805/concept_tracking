The blackest horror in darkest Africa is sleeping sickness . Very different from encephalitis lethargica , the sleeping sickness found in the U. S. , this disease is caused by trypanosomes ( parasitic protozoa ) carried by the tsetse fly . Its toll is about 100,000 human victims a year and all the domestic animals the tsetse fly can find . <P> The earliest description of the disease was given by British Naval Surgeon John Atkins on his return from West Africa in 1734 . He wrote : " The Sleepy Distemper ( common among the Negroes ) gives no other previous Notice , than a want of Appetite two or three days before ; their sleeps are sound , and Sense and Feeling very little ; for pulling , drubbing or whipping will scarce stir up Sense and Power enough to move ; and the Moment you cease beating the smart is forgot , and down they fall again into a state of Insensibility , drivling constantly from the Mouth as if in deep salivation ; breathe slowly , but not unequally nor snort . Young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judgment generally pronounced is Death , the Prognostick seldom failing . If now and then one of them recovers he certainly loses the little Reason he had , and turns Ideot . . . . " <P> Soon a U. S. youth will leave for the Belgian Congo , to battle with the tsetse fly . He is Dr. Warren K. Stratman-Thomas , 28 , research pharmacologist at the University of Wisconsin , A. B. , M. A. , Ph . D. , M. D. , Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation which annually sends 75 young U. S. scholars , scientists , artists , to study in all parts of the world . <P> His luggage will consist largely of an arsenical arsenal : six different arsenical compounds which have already been tried on animals , found superior to Bayer 205. *Best of them all is Arsenical No. 130 , in which tear gas aids and abets arsenic to destroy the trypanosomes , restoring the sufferer to normalcy . Dr. Clement C. Chesterman , who has spent years in the Belgian Congo , will cooperate with Pharmacologist Stratman-Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of infected natives and animals with the drugs . They will follow epidemics around Africa , maintaining a base at Leopoldville , Congo capital . <P> The new compounds were prepared under the direction of Professor A. B. Loevenhart of Wisconsin . He believes the conquest of African sleeping sickness would be equivalent to the discovery of a continent . But more than Africa is at stake . Before the War the tsetse fly was unknown in Arabia ; in recent years it has turned up there . Also strange new diseases of camels have developed in Palestine , similar to sleeping sickness ; caused by trypanosomes . Finally , laymen are startled when Pharmacologist Stratman-Thomas tells them that : " In prehistoric times this fly lived in the Americas and fossils of some twenty-odd species have been found in the Colorado shales . Since the evolution of the horse can be most satisfactorily traced in the West , and since it seems there were no horses in America at the time of <P> Columbus , it seems quite possible that the vast herds of horses were wiped out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
