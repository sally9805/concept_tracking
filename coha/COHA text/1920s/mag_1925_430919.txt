THE FORUM , having conducted an impartial discussion of the Americanism of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States , wished to turn the searchlight of intelligent and thoughtful inquiry upon that recent phenomenon of our political life , which , because of its militant opposition to Catholicism , is associated with it in the public mind . To this end , the Editor sought the cooperation of Mr. Stanley Frost . It was not easy to find someone of authority and standing to analyze the Klan . Few men in public life care openly to discuss the hooded order ; fewer still have anything more valuable than vituperation to offer . It was only after considerable thought that Mr. Pattangall was chosen to be asked for his analysis of the Klan . Mr. Frost 's happy selection was made , finally , on the recommendation of a Catholic politician of wide acquaintance .  | " Go up and see that man in Maine , " he said . " He knows politics and he knows the Klan , ? none better . He 's a philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so square that if he did you an injustice it would hurt him more than it would you . Though you do n't hear much of him at the national conventions , he 's always the arbitrator who smooths out the inside quarrels . " " His appearance , " says Mr. Frost , " confirmed the impression of a man who is not only careful , but congenitally fair-minded . " A down-East Yankee with a touch of Mayflower blood , a Protestant , and a Mason , a former Attorney-General of Maine , and to-day its leading Democrat , Mr. Pattangall is the very epitome of the Klan 's own definition of a one hundred per cent American of three centuries standing , yet , he is not the Klan 's hero but its most distinguished victim . In his race for the governorship of Maine last year , the Klan issue was more sharply drawn than ever before , in any State . Mr. Pattangall ran against the Klan , and so has had exceptional opportunity to know what it is and what it does . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ignored because it attacks chiefly Roman Catholics and aliens , and those others who believe that if left alone it will die of itself , have completely failed to understand either the movement or its menace . The Klan is not dying ; it is becoming more powerful , even if less noisy . And the real danger from it is not only to aliens and Catholics , though that is serious enough . The Klan 's greatest threat is against American liberalism , which is and always has been the true Americanism ; and the danger menaces all American liberals . So far we have had only a preliminary skirmish , and the Catholics and aliens have borne the brunt because they happen to be good fuel for prejudice . But already it has been made clear that , if the Klan wins power , it will substitute the deadly conservatism of ignorance and prejudice for the free spirit that has made America . Many people , and particularly politicians , office seekers , and platform writers , would like to avoid the issues presented by the entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | almost constant growth in influence makes this impossible . The Klan menace embraces the issue of religious freedom , the issue of preserving equal opportunity to all citizens , the issue of government by , of , and for all , rather than a part , of the people . In brief , the issue is the maintenance or the abandonment of the American tradition and of American ideals . I wo n't attack the Klan by saying it is made up of liars and criminals and fools ; it is n't and it would be silly to say so . Also , to do it would be falling into one of the worst of the Klan 's own faults . The evils of the Klan movement can not be cured by denunciation and red-hot adjectives ; not even by denouncing the excesses and mistakes it sometimes makes . The trouble is that a lot of people , ? most of them very decent citizens , ? have taken the wrong road . The menace is not in the excesses but in the thing itself , in the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that which can not be ignored nor let alone . It must be understood and met . But the cure for the Klan , like the cure for the other evils it complains about , lies in education and Americanization , rather than in condemnation . The Klan is more than an organization ; it is a state of mind . The organization may not be so strong to-day , but the state of mind is stronger . The Klan 's propaganda has caused a tremendous development of anti-Catholic , anti-Jewish , and anti-alien sentiment all through the country . It is now the rallying point for all the religious and race prejudice in the nation . Thousands who would not think of joining the organization support it and follow it politically . If the Klan were merely dividing the country on race and religious lines , if it merely forced into opposition to it Catholics , Jews , and aliens , it would be bad enough . But the situation is far worse than that ; . every native-born , white Protestant of liberal mind must also oppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the prejudices on which the Klan is based must become allied with it . For , as I have said , the real attack of the Klan is upon the whole idea of liberalism . There is ample proof of this . The school laws which have been enacted in Oklahoma , Oregon , the two Carolinas , and Tennessee , and which have been attempted in other States , are proof enough . The crusade against religious research and progress in Protestant  | churches is a spiritual outbreak of Klanishness . The revival of ancient prejudices , the appeal to emotionalism , the rejection of reason as a guide , ? all show how the Klan idea is to replace thought with prejudice , enforce opinion by majority vote , stop progress for the sake of ignorant beliefs . They show that the Klan has turned its back on the liberalism of our American tradition , and is aligning itself with the ignorant and superstitious reactionaries who through all time have tried in vain to block the progress they do not understand . Hence , the whole people must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only setting Catholic and Jew against Protestant , but native American against other native Americans . It is creating the most dangerous of all divisions that can come upon a nation . And this is growing worse and will grow still worse . This division being present , time-serving politicians will cater to the Klan in communities in which it predominates . And , since bigotry begets bigotry , and intolerance breeds intolerance , so in communities in which the Jewish , Catholic , and alien vote controls , we get an inverted Klanism just as objectionable to right-thinking people as the Klan itself . The differences between the two ideas are so basic , so fundamental , that they can not be compromised . The gulf between them can not be bridged by an agreement on other questions . Taxation , tariff , foreign policy , ? every other issue goes by the board when men who meet to work them out discover that one faction believes the other is not entitled to consideration as full citizens but is inferior in civil rights . The situation into which this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is abominable . He can not join either faction ; he is despised and feared by both and so loses his influence on the life and future of the nation . His liberties , his education , his opportunities , and freedom of thought will be restricted no less than those of the classes against which the Klan declaims . Yet it is the liberal who has led the nation from the first . It is against him and against the nation , which will suffer if his leadership is destroyed , that the Klan strikes hardest . To understand either the Klan 's success or the menace which it carries , we must begin with its campaign methods and propa- ganda . I will admit that the growth of the Klan in this State ( Maine ) amazed me . We have never had divisions of that kind here ; we have a large proportion of Catholics , to be sure , but no Catholic issue . I did n't believe the Kiuxers could get a hundred members . Yet , now that it has happened , the reasons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial , like its skilful exaggeration of strength , which scares timid politicians and brings the " joiners " to the bandwagon . In a deeper way , the Klan shows clever adaptation to popular psychology in the simplicity of the issue it presents , its appeal to race and religious pride as well as prejudice ( perhaps they are the same thing ) , and the simplicity , speed , and direct ease of the so-called cure it offers . No work or thought is required ; all that is called for is a feeling of superiority , tinged with hatred ! The propaganda has . all the charm and appeal of the cleverest of the quack nostrum and sure-cures over which we Americans are so eternally losing our heads , whether in medicine , business , or politics . More important has been its success in stirring up race and religious prejudice . This has partly been due to clever lies about the Catholics ; its speakers spread perfectly vicious stories . They say , for example , that Lincoln was assassinated by order of the Pope , McKinley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knights of Columbus . They circulate the famous spurious oath of the Knights of Columbus , and they solemnly read bogus statistics to prove that ninety per cent of the deserters in the ' orld War were Catholics acting under orders of the Church ! This would not have accomplished much , however , had there not been a remnant of the ancient hostility between the sects , dating from the long-dead days of the religious wars . I did not even know it existed , did not realize at all how persistent such a hatred could be when there was nothing to excite it . It broke out all over the State under the Klan 's brilliant incendiarism , but particularly in places where there are no Catholics . In towns where the Protestants had become personally acquainted with individual Catholics the Klan made little headway ! Much of the Klan propaganda , however , is not only true but good ; the sort of thing with which every good citizen must agree . There is sound patriotism and sound religion in it ; even most of  | the complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are fools in every faction , and they do foolish things , and there are grasping and overbearing men in every group . The Catholics have had their share of such faults , and the Klan takes clever advantage of them . From all this material it builds up an immensely effective appeal . Its speakers are plausible and skilful , they work steadily on the emotions rather than risk reason , and though the emotions are mostly normal and creditable ones , the hearers are shorty worked up to a state of enthusiasm and excitement where they cease to think critically , and so swallow the ten per cent of poison which the Klan hides inside its patriotic and religious oratory . In other words , the Klan prevents people from ever making a sane , cool judgment on its program and the ideas behind it . When the excitement wears off , as it soon does after any revivalistic outburst like this , the emotion dies out . This has been shown all over the country in the rapid decline of the Klan , after each big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bad as the results are , the real menace to American liberal thought is not to be found in it , but in the cure proposed and in the basic ideas . Until one is prepared to accept the proposition that two wrongs make a right , there is no good word that can be said for the basic Klan doctrine . It is the patent nostrum par excellence . It exploits evils and a widespread unrest that are real enough and that need cure , but it makes a fake diagnosis , presents a false cure , gives poisons instead of remedies , and actually increases the evils it claims to relieve . Every plea that the Klan leaders make may be admitted , and every charge of violence , lawlessness , hatred , or fraud against it may be dropped , without weakening the indictment against it in the slightest degree . The Klan indicts itself from the very beginning of its own argument and in the statement of its own aims . The fundamental wrong is in the Klan idea of what makes Americanism . It assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman who happens to see the light first on American soil , that it is born in all such , and that no one else can achieve it . It adds the charge that no Catholic or Jew can consistently be a  | good American , because his religious loyalties come first and are hostile . This hardly needs more than to be stated to be proved false . Test it by the teachings of Washington , of Jefferson , of Lincoln , of Roosevelt , or Wilson , and it fails . Test it by the words of our Savior , and it fails still more completely . The whole idea is not only opposed to our traditional national spirit , but to the whole spirit of true Christianity . It is a reversion to the old , cruel , religious hatreds . Americanism , of course , is really an ideal and a spirit , ? faith in freedom , tolerance , humanity . It can not discriminate because of color , birthplace , or creed ; nor can it tolerate caste , class , or religious distinctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially it can not for a moment endure the breeding and exploitation of hatred and prejudice as a means to sway public opinion and win political power . The Klan , on its own statement , does just these things , and makes a virtue of doing them . The Klan , drawing these lines , and exploiting prejudice as a means to - Dower , goes openly into politics , and emphasizes in every way tDis un-American procedure , which the worst of the bodies it attacks practise only in secret and by stealth . It boasts of doing the very things which it attacks most bitterly in the classes against which it preaches discrimination , and which it holds up as proof of their unfitness for citizenship ! Equally un-American is its practise of attempting secret and threatening influence on the Government . No one has shown how great this evil is more clearly than the Klan speakers themselves ; then they turn about and try to do the same thing , not merely as a reprisal , but as a permanent method in American politics . The Klan seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials . It uses that hold to enforce its own demands , abandoning completely the American principle of rule by and for all . It maintains expensive lobbies , it acts secretly in both parties , it tries constantly for control ? secret control ? of elections , legislatures , and government . And again it has the effrontery to advertise all this as a great principle . In comparison with this enormous evil , the harm it may do by an occasional whipping or lynching , or by interference with private liberty , is unimportant .  | Worst of the political crimes of the Klan is its exploitation of religious enthusiasm and religious prejudice for the sake of political power . The most valid of all the charges the Klan brings against the Roman hierarchy is that secretly it does not accept the American principle of the separation of church and state , but furtively goes into politics as a church and attempts to use its spiritual hold on its members as a means for political control . Yet the Klan puts a crowning inconsistency on its position by openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasts that it succeeds in its attempt , to capitalize in the political field on Protestantism , spirituality , and religious faith ; still worse , it cultivates religious prejudice for the sake of increasing its ability to control the state through the church . It might , for the sake of argument , be admitted that these Klan evils could be endured for a time so that other and greater evils might be cured and Americanism restored to its old strength . But the Klan 's claim that the present evils and unrest are due to Catholics and aliens is a false diagnosis , ? one of the oldest tricks of the patent medicine vendor . There are many evils in America and there is much unrest , but it is not true that Catholics and aliens would have been blamed for much of this had it not been for the Klan propaganda . It is notable that this propaganda is most successful and the Klan strongest in places where there are the fewest of these classes , where people know least about them . The fact is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional alliance between the present unrest and the age-old hatreds which it has been America 's glory to mitigate , and that though it has sugar-coated the pill , it is still selling hatred just as truly if not quite so openly as ever . It should be added that the Klan propaganda helps to create unrest and exaggerate that which already exists . There are hundreds of thousands who had no idea they were being abused till the Klan told them so ! But even if it were true that the foreign-born and the Catholics were to blame for all our present evils , the Klan does not and can not cure them . In fact it does not even offer any cures but discrimination , ostracism , and inequality . It has not offered any other cure , nor proposed any program with a single constructive feature . The most ardent Kluxer can hardly believe that night- shirt parades or even flaming hatreds will save the nation . The things it actually has done have made no gain along the line it has itself laid down . It helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole country favored that , and its help was useless . It has played politics and nearly wrecked the Democratic Party by forcing a religious issue , which was the most disgraceful incident in the party 's history . It has won power and pie for its officials and their tools . It has , indeed , cleaned up bad local conditions in several places , but in few has the reform lasted long , and more often than not the Klan government has been worse than that of the old gang . This is proved by the fact that all over the country decent citizens , who once supported the Klan in hope of reform , have turned upon it after one experience of its performance . The Klan also has passed the school laws already mentioned . Finally it has in some cases done good and in some cases harm by regulation of private conduct in violation of every American principle of fair play and social justice . Surely there is no gain for Americanism in this . The one thing the Klan really has accomplished so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain persons who , before it was organized , had neither . This can not be blamed on the Klan as a whole , for it has certainly not enriched its members . But it is a fact which must be taken into consideration . It is probably true that the Klan no longer sells hatred for a few dollars ' profit , but is it less dangerous or vicious to sell the same commodity for political profit ? Finally , if all this indictment has been wrong so far , and if the Klan , with a real diagnosis of real troubles were making a real effort to cure them , still it could not . Its leaders are not competent to administer a cure , they have no understanding of our immensely complex structure , nor any ability to determine in advance the result of tampering with it . They are mostly undereducated ; practically none are familiar with any large affairs , many are wilfully ignorant , all are emotional , some are mere adventurers . The statement of Wizard Evans , published last year , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth but wanted to keep his faith unclouded even if it was wrong , shows the mental attitude with which the Klan leaders are  | blithely approaching the vast and complicated problems of government and society . They want to believe what they want to , and they are going to try their hand , though the Heavens fall . They are like a cheery blacksmith who might undertake to perform a necessary operation for concussion of the brain . He might even know what ought to be done , but there are few who would let him try . Thus the Klan is wrong at all points , and increasingly so from step to step of analysis . The kindest thing that can be said of it is that ignorant men , sincerely feeling a discontent they are incompetent even to understand , and utterly unconscious of the delicacy and difficulties of applying a remedy , are proceeding in blind panic to stir up prejudice and arouse passion with a vague hope that out of the turmoil some gain may come . Much worse might be said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , for I have found few real scoundrels . Meanwhile , the damage the Klan is actually doing is enormous . For one thing it is disrupting our politics . Its first and greatest sin , of course , is to bring in religion as a political issue and try to win power through the prostitution of American idealism . But almost as bad is its menace to the continued existence of the Democratic party . I feel this not merely because I value that party ; it is because under our system two parties are necessary , and there must always be two that are strong if we are to be governed safely . The Klan threatens this whole system . The Democratic Party has no right to existence except as a liberal party . If it can not fill that role it has no place in American politics . Its strength lies in the South and the industrial centres of the North . Its basis of equal rights as opposed to special privileges assumes an entire absence from its counsels of any racial or religious discrimination . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " all men were created free and equal " by adding the words " except Roman Catholics , Jews , Negroes and those born outside the United States . " The Klan is death to the Democratic Party . No one can subscribe at the same time to the creed of the Klan and the doctrine of Jefferson . A Klan-controlled liberal party is a contradiction in terms . Also , the Klan is directly and almost openly trying to destroy the party by driving from it , or at least from all share  | of power in it , the industrial States without which it can not hope to win . The acceptance of the Klan philosophy is just as destructive to the nation as to the Democratic Party . Political divisions based on religion or on the difference between native-born and naturalized citizens can not be tolerated if the nation is to endure . The South has , in a measure , solved its own problem on the basis of the mental superiority of the white man over the Negro . Quite a different situation would arise if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar superiority of native-born Protestant over native-born Catholic or Jew or over foreign-born regardless of creed . Yet the Klan idea would be to relegate these classes to the position of the Negro in the South , at least so far as political preferment is concerned , and , to a large degree , denial of political equality also denies social and industrial equality . The fallacy of the whole Klan theory is perhaps best brought out by applying it to a war situation . Suppose that our country should again have to fight , and be forced to call 4,000,000 to arms . What then becomes of the apostles of " one hundred per cent Americanism " ? Two days after a declaration of war the whole Klan idea would disappear like fog before the July sun . Fear would bring us all to a plane of equality again , as it did eight years ago . It would be a rather terrible commentary on the brains and conscience of America if our people could only be freed from bigotry and intolerance by fear ! Another political evil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevents sane thought and sane decision on all the vital economic and political questions which must be solved wisely if progress and prosperity are to continue . The average man or woman is induced to consider these questions only with difficulty ; given a simple and exciting issue like the Klan they forget all other matters . No one is ever too stupid or too drunk to yell " To Hell with the Pope ! " or " Damn the Klan ! " This even prevents the selection of decent officials , for with excitement running so high , thousands will vote for any crook or incompetent rather than for one of the opposite faction . Many a thief has gone into office because he was wise enough to be " dry " or " for suffrage " , and many more will win because they are either for or against the Klan .  | The social damage the Klan does is inherent in all this . It stirs up strife where there was none , nor need of any . It sets neighbors against each other , uselessly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it distracts from the attention that can profitably be paid to the rather necessary business of living . On the mental side the damage is beyond statement . The Klan is breaking down our old American spirit and distorting our tradition and outlook . That can not be measured with words . The Klan will not succeed permanently , of course . Nothing can set back the hands of the clock of civilization for five centuries , for any length of time , or on any large scale . But it may succeed temporarily . If it does its success will be due to the insidious nature of its propaganda and to the cowardice of politicians who value votes and personal advancement more than principle or the good of the country . It will be due , too , to our failure to make clear the true methods of cure for the real evils on which the Klan propaganda is based , ? if we do fail in that . The Klan must be answered by showing to all that we can not cure prejudice by increasing it , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions by drawing new class lines , nor make aliens into Americans by discriminating against them . In short , that we can not make America more American by violating the spirit and tradition of America . The true cure is slow , as all worth-while things are slow . It is often so slow as to be discouraging ; but , in very truth , the old , slow methods have worked . Catholics and aliens alike are becoming more American with each year ; there are fewer people of un-American minds among us to-day than ever before . The way to cure the evils , and the way to make better Americans , even of Klansmen , is through better education , greater liberality of thought , more tolerance , closer contacts between races , sects , and classes , and through the breaking down of all the barriers which now hold portions of our people apart . These are the true remedies , and these the Klan is making no effort to apply .  |              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
