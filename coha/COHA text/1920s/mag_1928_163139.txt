No Coward <P> Sirs : <P> I am of the age which some people call ' ' elderly , " and I put on glasses when I read TIME . Nonetheless I am no coward , and will not decline the challenge of Subscribess Catherine M. Whitsitt who writes to you ( TIME , April 30 ) that she wants to give me " a poke in the nose , " because I suggested to you ( TIME , April 9 ) that President Calvin Coolidge ought to make a flight with Charles Augustus Lindbergh . <P> By all means let the lady poke my nose , and I will poke hers-if it will further the development of aviation . <P> However , no amount of nose poking will disprove the plain fact , set forth in my original letter to you , that Coolidge ought to fly with Lindbergh . I repeat also that Roosevelt would have flown with Lindy like a shot , the day Lindbergh got home from Paris ! <P> In closing , permit me to chuckle over the typical sportswomanship of Subscribess Whitsitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " taken an air trip over to Paris more than 50 times . " Clearly the good lady fancies she would be betting on a sure thing , so I shall not inform her how many times I have " taken an air trip over to Paris " - from London . <P> Let her paste that on a wooden Indian 's nose and poke it ! <P> <P> SIDNEY HENDERSON <P> Chicago , 111 . <P> <P> Satin Dress , Ermine Coat Sirs : <P> <P> TIME in its issue of April 23 , printed a letter from J. F. Bassett of Boston in which he writes it would not be fitting for President Coolidge to humiliate himself by flying with Lindbergh in " those brown overalls that aviators wear . " <P> May I inform Mr. Bassett that I have just completed a 2,285 rnile hop from San Diego to Minneapolis clad in my seal and ermine coat , satin dress , white hat and corsage of roses , for I made the trip in a Ryan monoplane-brougham type , sistership to the one Lindbergh now owns . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cane and fly with Lindbergh . <P> Suggest that Correspondent Bassett obtain some back copies of Aviation and learn what is going on in the world outside of Boston . <P> <P> MARGARET DAVIES YARNELL ( MRS . C. S. YARNELL ) <P> Minneapolis , Minn . <P> <P> Pile of Hot Air <P> Sirs : <P> In the April 23 issue of TIME I came across some pieces of news about Persia . . . ( manifesting ) pitiable prejudice against that country , a prejudice which amounts to a pile of hot air pumped into the respected editor of TIME by British interests . <P> Reza Shah Pahlevi has never been a bandit . . . . It is we and our national assembly that has given him the Crown . . . . <P> So please , next time when you intend to write any thing about Persia , watch your step and write facts or nothing at all ; otherwise effective steps will be taken that the personal integrity of Pahlevi shall not be molested by such people that sell their honor and personality , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <P> <P> A. K. DASHTI New York , N. Y. <P> <P> Reza Pahlevi has indeed had his present status as Shah of Persia constitution-alized by Parliament , but his seizure of power was essentially a coup d'etat , staged by an officer who had frequently foraged supplies for his itinerant Cossack troops in the manner of a bandit. - ED . <P> <P> Tomcats <P> Sirs :
