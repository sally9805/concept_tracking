Last week 's Republican strategy was to fire big guns toward the South . <P> Nominee Curtis went to Raleigh , N. C. , Martinsburg , West Va. , and Wilmington , Del . Prohibition was his burden , immigration his refrain . He next entered New Jersey . If Democrats had been annoyed by Nominee Hoover 's refusal to acknowledge Nominee Smith 's presence in the campaign , Nominee Curtis made amends . He referred to " the dear Governor " and to " the gentleman from New York who thinks he is running for President on the Democratic ticket . " The further Curtis itinerary lay through Connecticut , Massachusetts , upper New York , western Pennsylvania , into Ohio . <P> Greater in bore if not in range than Nominee Curtis was Big Gun Borah , who was sent to boom in Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Kentucky . He , too , used Prohibition projectiles chiefly . There was a noticeable departure from the close reasoning , which usually marks the Borah manner . Perhaps because he felt that understanding diminishes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases and protestations such as the following : <P> " Tammany is opposed to law and order , anyway . " <P> " I ask you , my Democratic friends , is the repeal of the 18th Amendment good Democratic doctrine ? " <P> " The intelligence of all the great masses of the people is greater than the intelligence which the Almighty ever gave to any one individual . " <P> " During the last twelve years no task has been before any Administration in power that it did not turn to Hoover to take charge of it . " <P> " The issue in North Carolina , as I see it is the effort now being made to induce the people to vote the way they do n't want to vote . " <P> " I am not a candidate . I am sorry , but I am not . " <P> Part also of the Southern push was Secretary Curtis Dwight Wilbur of the Navy . At Newport News , Va. , he asked : <P> " If it takes courage to vote the Republican ticket , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the descendants of the men who for four long , weary years fought against ever-increasing odds with the hope of victory slowly diminishing for what they believed was right ?
