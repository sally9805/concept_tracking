Stone Walls and Precious Stones MR . FROST divides this book of verse about his state ( he lives in Vermont , and was born in California ) , into the easy-going , gossipy soliloquy which gives the book its name , and " Notes , " and " Grace Notes . " These parts are , in their manner and their mood , fairly distinct from each other , and they show Robert Frost with more colors on his palette than we had suspected , an artist with all sorts of distances from his subject , and with many different ways of approaching it . The title poem is hardly a poem at all ? though one soon forgets this , for it is not quite like anything else that was ever written , even by Mr. Frost . More than any ? thing perhaps it resembles a j1ourney across country in the company of a wise , shrewd , humorous person with an un ? common gift of common speech , a journey punctuated with philosophy , anecdotes , reminiscence , scandal , sudden gusts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local loveliness , sudden views , through narrow vistas , to the whole wide world . And at the end of the journey ? or rather when the horse stops , for there is a lot more to see , we have been across a whole state , and overheard a race of men , and been amused , and informed , and dis ? illusioned , and enchanted . The voice which talks to us does so in an easy , unhurried monotone , never dull , never lifted , never strained ; now it is speaking prose , now dog ? gerel , now verse , now poetry . This Morgan Pegasus sometimes slows his trot to a walk , but he never balks , nor shies , nor takes the bit in his teeth . The curse of bad poetry as of some that is good is its author 's destructive consciousness that what he is writing is 1-'poetry . " Those cut flowers flourishing in captive water arc not for Mr. Frost , who is careful to leave his growing from the earth . Weeds , grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alive . How he keeps his grass from turning to hay is his own secret . If any one else wrote about fire insurance , it would be hay , and dry at that . But listen to Mr. Frost : I knew a man who failing as a farmer Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance , And spent the proceeds on a telescope To satisfy a life-long curiosity About our place among the infinities . Maybe this is not poetry . But does that matter ? Or does it matter very-much that so many of Mr. Frost 's lines sound as if they had been overheard in a telephone booth And she has one I do n't know what to call him Who comes from Philadelphia every year .. . It does n't matter a bit if you are on the other end of the line listening to the whole conversation . Such lines are only the low spots and gaps in a long stone wall . And " New Hampshire " is just like an old , wandering stone wall . Made of human hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; it is never the same height in any two places ; here it has fallen away , further on it has become a solid protruding rib of the very hill under it ; curious , irregular lichens embellish it , flowers sprout through the cracks ; it is a museum of quaint beetles , and meager berries ; cows are stopped by it , men talk across it ; and it goes bending and ascending over hills and pastures illogically , variously , permanently . So bends and wanders Mr. Frost 's pithy , moving , garrulous , and invulnerable poem . The Notes to " New Hampshire " are shorter pieces , mostly about people , around whom they revolve slowly , toward whose tell-tale secrets they move with a sometimes annoying deliberateness . Yet when the circuitous expedi ? tion ? full of asides , pauses , details which in any one else would be resented as padding ? is completed , there stands clear a singularly real individual , belonging , not to his creator , but to himself . Even the grindstone and the axe-helve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them yield to Mr. Frost their likeness but not their ' secrets . If an ordinary conversation between ordinary people were written down , it would sound as if padding had been written into the stuff of life . Yet to those who spoke them , those matter of fact sentences meant something , What ? ever Mr. Frost says , he means . Even his most prosaic lines are intended so to be . To ask him to cut them out , or squeeze a little more poetry into them , or build a hotter fire under the whole poem , would be asking him to be ? come another person . His matter of factness in saying just what he means is a part of his virtue of never trying to say more than he means . If he does n't use as much precious stone as we would like him to , if he uses too many plain ordinary boulders to fill in the chinks , it is because he knows that 's the proper way to build his kind of a wall , because he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are n't enough real jewels to go all the way around . He never stoops to paste . This restraint , at its worst , verges upon caution ; at its best , it produces clear and lovely poetry . Mr. Frost is a perfect example of the difference between reticence and reserve . He never holds back true feeling for fear of giv ? ing rein to false . He will tell you how fast his heart is beating , but he will not wear ' it upon his sleeve . People with less sense of humor would manage to squeeze more poetry out of New Hampshire , and overpaint the portrait of a state for which Mr. Frost has so just an eye : She has a touch of gold , New Hampshire gold ? You may have heard of it . I had a farm Offered me not long since up Berlin way With a mine on it that was worked for gold ; But not gold in commercial quantities . Just enough gold to make the engagement rings And marriage rings of those who owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect proportion to the amount of gold in New Hampshire . All this applies to the Robert Frost of the title poem and the Notes . The Frost of the Grace Notes is a very different matter . Instead of the leisurely conversational pentameter straying over acres of time and country we have a number of delicate , economical , iwell-rounded poems , in the good old sense , poems with just and inevitable rhyme , with fragile cadences , with quick turns , with swift changes of mood . The stone wall architect has , in most of these poems , disappeared to give place to a sure and skilful jeweller . It is not so much that in these poems Mr. Frost has turned to another method . He has moved , emotionally , much closer to his subject . He is feeling things in a different way , which requires and inspires a different expression .
