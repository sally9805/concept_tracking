Last week , the history of earth 's north polar cap approached the climax of its most stirring chapter , One great event , a sporting feat , came to pass-the first visit to the Pole by a man in an airplane . Other events impended hourly . <P> In Alaska , the Australian-born soldier of fortune Captain George Hubert Wilkins , leading the expedition backed by citizens of Detroit , was in something of a hole but was summoning his final resources for a flight to see if land exists between Point Barrow and the Pole . In Spitsbergen , the young Virginian , Lieut. - Commander Richard E. Byrd U. S. N. , backed by Vincent Astor , Edsel Ford , John D. Rockefeller Jr . and others , rested after an historic 1,600-mile round-trip flight to the Pole , and laid out his next course-to wing westward from an advance base on north Greenland and search for unknown land where Explorers Peary and MacMillan each thought they descried it on different occasions years ago . Most formidable and promising of all , the dirigible Norge lurked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's last big " blind spot " from Spitzbergen clear over to Alaska . The Norwegian Roald Amundsen , the Italian Colonel Nobile and the American Lincoln Ellsworth , biding their hour for this trip , denied that there was any competitive spirit between themselves and the two parties of heavier-than-air flyers . Theirs seemed the best chance of completing the map of the world , judging by the past performance of their craft , though Byrd 's Fokker Josephine Ford had flown with astonishing success where Amundsen 's planes failed last year . There would be fame enough for one and all . Yet it was absurd to deny rivalry . Each party of polar pilgrims carried flags to plant , or drop , for the U. S. or Norway , upon whatever continent or islands have lain hidden to date in the polar fastnesses . <P> Events of the week among the polar pilgrims were as follows : <P> **25;7025;TOOLONG . The bitter winds droned , the ether pulsed with wireless signals , blank white leagues of steppes and frozen lakes passed underneath for 21 hours before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolate Vadso on the north tip of Scandinavia , 700 miles from Leningrad ( where she had waited two weeks for repairs and good weather on her way from Rome-to-Nome ) . Pausing only long-enough to refuel and bundle themselves more thickly in furs , Colonel Nobile and his mates cast off again and sailed all through another Arctic night , out over Barent 's ice-strewn sea for Spitzbergen . The headwinds that had buffeted the Norge over Russia , causing her to wallow and pitch like a great grey air whale , changed to following winds that added speed and made life more endurable for the wakeful voyagers , forced to stand close-packed in their unheated gondola . Bear Island was raised and passed without the fog complications that had been feared . Then the southern capes of Spitzbergen loomed dimly and the aeronauts established radio contact with operators at Kings Bay , who had listened all night to the whine of the Norge 's instrument asking for compass directions , reporting all was well .               @ @ @ @ @ @
