txt Automotive shipments from the United States in March were 22 per cent . larger than the preceding month and 13 per cent . greater than in March , 1926 . A new high record was made in the number of passenger car exports . Exports of trucks and cars combined were greater in number than for any other single month . This record was rounded out by lifting the aggregate exports for the first three months of 1927 to 20 per cent . above the corresponding period of 1926 . Detailed figures published by the Department of Commerce show that in March of this year there were 29,985 passenger cars exported . This compares with 21,355 in February of this year and 22,278 in March . 1926 . There were 7,646 trucks exported against 10,120 in February , 1927 , and 5,674 in March . 1926 . For the first three months of the year exports of cars and trucks represented 96.932 units . Balance of shipments was made up of electric vehicles , fire engines , motor cycles , marine and aircraft .. It is interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1927 represented a loss of 156,084 units as compared with 1926. the exports show a substantial gain . The average unit value also shows some changes . That of ears dropped from $737 in February to $712 in March . The value of trucks which averaged $595 in February increased to $636 in March . Over 60 per cent . of the value of the exports of cars was for the two classes ranging from $500 to $800 and from $800 to $1,200 . But notwithstanding this , there was a substantial increase in the number of cars priced at from $1,200 to $2,000 and of those selling above $2,000 . This increase in total exports is not due to a sudden spurt in some particular market . The different markets maintain nearly their relative positions . Australia leads in number of cars and trucks for the month . Canada did not buy quite as many cars , but paid more for them , and Argentina comes third . For the three months of 1927 Australia 's purchases of cars amounted to $9,000,000 and of trucks $ ? , 780,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smaller markets , however , are not to be overlooked . There is Denmark , for instance . She ships butter and bacon to England and then buys motor cars from . us . She bought ? so many in March that she took fifth rank . Busy Belgium , who believes that progress lies along the line of work and production , increased her purchases 100 per cent . Germany laid a tariff , effective July 1 , 1926 , that seemed prohibitive , yet her March purchases were four times as great as in the preceding month . Apparently , it is as difficult to keep our automobiles out of foreign markets as it is to keep a pig from a clover field after it has once got its nose under the gate . Because of price and quality the world goes riding  --  and in American cars . France apparently clings to silly nation that America 's bill should be for " account surrendered .
