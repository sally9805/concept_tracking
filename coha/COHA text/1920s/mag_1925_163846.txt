The history of a superior colored feller with a heap of style The Story . One brilliant noon a comely Negress made her way to the waterside at Barbadoes , leading by the hand her nine-year-old boy . At the quay she entered a small boat to carry her out to a barque , the captain of which had volunteered to take her along " kind o ' friendly-like " to Panama . But she left the boy at the water 's edge with the remark , " Dere is plenty of bananas and yams and things in B'bayados , also fowls . " So Young Jehu Sennacherib Dyle was launched upon the world . He grew up helter skelter , but at last an empty stomach induced him to try to make a living . So he enlisted as butler in the family of a puisne judge . There he learned to put on style , and as the gayest and sassiest man on the island he became a wooer of the local belle , Jezebel Pettyfer . At this flowing tide of his affairs he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the disposition of the cadaver of her lamented dog Aristotle . That same night he proposed to Jezebel , offering her Jehu Sennacherib Dyle in holy matrimony . Jezebel , though coy , finally decided : " I no mind livin ' wid yo ' here in dis house . But de marryin ' , it can come later on . " Dyle reluctantly agreed looking forward to the day when she would make him " a legitimate man .
