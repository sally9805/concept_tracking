SOME improvement has recently been made in the dime-snatching fare-recorders of the Fifth Avenue busses . The tone of the hell of the new models is more cheery than the old . We approve , but we will not be satisfied until our dime is made to play a little tune . Polite Music and Transportation could then be the company 's slogan . We suggest , " One , two , three , four , sometimes I wish there were more " . IT is stirring news that the United Fruit Company is going to try to make the banana as glorious as California has made the raisin . If the advertising man succeeds in sublimating the one unquestionably comic fruit , we will admit he can do anything . We will even go to lunch with him and let him tell us how he did it . last we understand why the telephone girl has not trapped the inventor of the dial and sued him for alimony .

THE Board of Trustees of the City College has announced its decision to continue compulsory military training in spite of student feeling against it . They are logical . How could they have compulsory training at all unless those to be trained objected to the compulsion ? Besides , Deans and such have to consider what would become of poor civilization if young people were n't trained to carry guns . THE usual , nay , the inevitable has happened . One of the Quality Group Magazines has published a poem about April , presenting the following good old rhymes : Lost-frost , years-tears , dream-stream , death-breath , bier-year . And following its good old custom , the Kansas City Star has reprinted it . Thank Heaven there are some gentlefolk left . IS it not suitable for someone to protest against the custom followed by charities of mailing you their wares and requiring you to send them back or pay for them ? The latest offender is Thomas Lamont , who sends Christmas anti-tuberculosis seals in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . But we would like to see Mr. Lamont 's method of raising money thoroughly discredited . BY the way . We hope the serious minded who read Kellogg 's speech of last week , read the TVorld 's editorial by , presumedly , Walter Lippman on the subject two days later . While not interested in the politics of it one way or the other , we found pleasure in reading an utterance to the public that was not afraid of offending those who disagreed with it . The Week EQUITY sounds the alarm over possibility of Sunday theatre under Mayor ' Walker and scientists decide that brains are not necessary to human life . Wall Street workers get fifty millions in Holiday bonuses and a new Hans Christian Andersen story is found . War head of British Secret Service disappears after police accuse him of misconduct with woman in Hyde Park and a geologist estimates that the race is 100,000 years old .

Experiments QOMEBODY is proposing that making the best of a bad job is raised to the rank of a major art . Miss Mary Wiborg , of East Hampton , Long Island , who had the Hammond slatted piano sent down to her house from Gloucester with Mr. Donahue as demonstrating artist , recently illustrated how to work in the new medium . On the way down , the truck which was carrying the instrument went over a bump , and the slats broke . " it does n't matter , " said Miss Wiborg , " no one will know the difference . " So the concert was given anyway , and was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose play " The Wisecrackers " no one could find a good word , says that the play was not at fault but the theatre , which was so small that no one but critics could be seated the first night . We noticed a pathetic group of figures huddled against the Public Library the day afterwards . They were the critics  --  all crushed . Carolling DURING the past week , the present week , and the week to come , the public is conscious that a vast amount of very expert and very beautiful music is being produced in its churches and synagogues . The programs , if that is the word , are always expanded at this season . If you care for music in the tradition'al Episcopalian style , with singing entirely by boys and men and much organ work , the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , Grace Church and St. Thomas 's are all worth hearing . So also is old Trinity . Less pure than any of these is the music of St. Mary the Virgin , which is replete with kettle-drums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical critics know what they are talking about , is the collection of voices of Clarence Dickinson , one-time conductor of the Mendelssohn Glee Club , at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Brick Church . Among the synagogues  --  for there is a Maccabean holiday season which synchronizes with Christmas ? the Temple Beth-El and the Free Synagogue of Rabbi Wise give very moving samples of the wail of Israel and the emotionalism of Asia Minor , not pretending for a moment that music , even in the church , can be anything but emotional . And with the same appeal , the Russian Cathedral , although the Greek Church celebration is not for two weeks , offers music from the throats of men with contra voices that can shake buildings . Of all the churches , the Catholic seem the weakest on music . There is the Paulist Fathers , of course ; which , if you can risk the crush along Worn bus Avenue on Christmas morning , you can hear do justice to a Gregorian chant as no other choir on the continent can do . But St. Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth much . So if you are not bound by ties of denominational loyalty , you have a wide choice of choirs to make your Christmas morning glad with sweet sounds . Model THAT excellent portrait painter , Mr. Howard Renwick , spends the Mr. Hyde periods of his dual career creating gaudy stocking advertisements . When he first decided to enter commercial art  --  via three masterpieces for a foot-ease company  --  he adopted the nom de foulere of Hayden Hayden , suggested , I am told , by the celebrated Brothers Haig of Scotland . This poetic combination , as well as his own baptismal designation , is listed in the telephone directory , thereby establishing art and commerce in separate niches , though both reside under the same roof in Sixty-seventh Street Lately , a young lady visiting his studio to view the Renwick portraits , chanced upon a canvas of a damsel whose matchless contours of limb testi fied to the excellence of certain hosiery . It was signed Hayden Hayden and the discovery brought an exclamation of delight . Did Mr. Ren wick know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you ? " he asked . " Oh yes . Very well . I used to pose for him . " Metamorphosis THERE is to be a New Masses . It is not to be anything like the old Masses , which the Government suspended in 1917 for obstructing the draft , excepting that it is to have as an editor Michael Gold who was with the old concern . From what I hear , the new paper is to be very pleasing to the eye , printed throughout in three colors , with forty per cent of its pages reserved for cartoons , decorations , and the higher art . To make this possible , Egmont Arens , once with Vanity Fair  --  note how times change  --  is to stamp it with his genius and print it on his own press , the press that prints the Playboy Magazine . Certainly Mr. Arens has had great experience in getting out periodicals worth looking at , and will do well with this new thing if anybody can . The contributors , as announced , are to be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upton Sinclair , of course ; then Susan Glaspell , Mary Heaton Vorse , and others known to readers of the Ladies Horne Journal ; Edmund Wilson , Jr. ; and a bodge podge of playwrights from Eugene O'Neill to John Lawson . It is to be welded into a periodical that knows no fear , is unsentimental , swift , athletic , intense , without fetish , committed to the international labor movement , but without political bias . ALL of this imposing program , however , is contingent upon whether or not the public will subscribe $10,000 . The $/0,000 , of course , wo n't run it ; but it is apparently to be a way of finding out how many people really want such a magazine . A form of insurance . The people who are putting up the real money are the beneficiaries of Charles Garland , who in 1922 inherited about a million dollars , refused on principle to accept it , changed his mind , refused it again , changed his mind again , and finally gave most of it to the American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nation , Professor Lovett of the New Republic , and others are in control of the fund . They arc going into it as they went into the ephemeral Leader  --  the old Call . Perhaps the fact that they lost $40,000 in that venture is why they-are insisting this time on the public 's putting in its mite . Finis THE war , it appears , is over . Lo-carob had something to do with the lowering of the curtain . . and then there was the late incident at " The Big Parade " , which the Duke of Amhalt , a German princeling , attended lately with an attractive post-debutante . Mr. Stallings 's moving picture is cunningly devised to play on the memory of wartime emotions and the music , most stirring of memories , crashes loud with the old appeals " Madelon " , " Tipperary " , " Pack Up Your Troubles " , " Hinky Dinky , Parley Vous " , and the rest . The young lady listened and as successive battle songs poured forth she wondered if she were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was forgetting the sacrifices , the glories . . . and there she sat beside a princeling of an enemy house . And then the thunder of the orchestra roared the opening bars of " Over There " . It seemed too much . The young lady stirred uneasily , half-resolved to rise and fly from the scene of her treason . But the Duke of Amhalt smiled benignly : " Ah , " said he , " that delightful fox trot they are playing now in Germany . " ? WE beard further proof last week that members of the Lucy Stone League are nevertheless feminine . It seems that Laurette Taylor and Ruth Hale debated for two hours at one of their meetings before they discovered that they were both on the same side . 12 to 17 THIS season there is as much giggling in the rows where the theatre parties sit as ever ; and the Parent 's League has not lost its faith in the laughter of the innocents . The Christmas bulletin of that organiza tion is in the hands of its 1300 members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day at the Park Lane : " Heaven 's ! Have n't you ever heard of the Parent 's League ? " And we turned to see a young lady , probably from out of town , being reduced to a grease spot . Mrs. Edwin G. Merrill is chairman of the theatre committee . Shc and others go to all the plays and decide whether it is suitable for the sheltered mind of from 12 to 17 . They do not recommend . They simply state the case and allow the individual parent to decide  --  a recent concession , by the way , to the fact that even among the 1300 carefully selected parents perfect agreement is no longer possible . Yes , one must qualify so-mill , to become a member , and one 's children must go to private schools . As to their policy : " Artists and Models " they would obviously damn . " The Green Hat " and " The Glass Slipper " would he frowned upon because in them people are openly in love with other people 's wives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peephole of his curtain , has n't seen more of the youth of our upper class . In our presence a producer once shrugged his shoulders to the question as to whether it were worth his while to try to please the League . " Theatre Parties decorate a house , " he said . Which anyone who has gone about the last two weeks and used his eyes will admit . Sanctified MR . BEN LYON , one of the more prominent of the late screen crop of Valentines , consented , as an item of publicity , to lend his cameo-theatre-like profile to the adornment of photographs of some gentlemen 's Fall hats . From this fact comes our practically weekly story of the so-called silent drama . The deed , presently , was done ; and , subsequently , the editor of the fashion magazine which had arranged the photographing made inquiries from Mr. Lyon 's personal representative . The hats furnished were model hats , and the manufacturer was anxious for their return . He could not manufacture his season 's supply until this was done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have a hundred if he wished  --  but these particular hats . They were very important ; vital , in fact . All this the editor explained . And would Mr. Lyon be so good as to return them ? " " Unthinkable , " said the personal representative . Then indignation faded from his voice and awe came into his tones . " Do n't you realize that Mr. Lyon has actually worn these hats on his own head ? " he demanded . Crusade oUR devotion to the cause of a smoking room in the Public Library has , at any rate , reduced Director Anderson to the expedient of relating anecdotes in defense of his persistent denial . Last Summer , it will be remembered , there was quite a to do over the wearing or doffing of coats in the reading rooms  --  the slaves to comfort deploring Director Anderson 's insistence upon full clothing . Very lately , however , the director has capitulated , with the announcement that coats will not be required during the next hot season . But just to show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will carry their whims , he related the aforementioned and immediately ensuing tale : Last Thursday a charming old gentleman approached the check room on the main floor and , gently doffing his shoes , asked that they be cared for against his return . Shoes , he explained , were the chief burden of modern civilization  --  he had always been able to enjoy a book most when sitting in socks  --  and he did not intend for city folks to destroy his ease . Needless to say , he was forced , after much argument , to conform to the commonplace , and wear his full harness during his encounter with Suetonius . Mr. Anderson was assured , thereupon , that no such mile would be attempted by tobacco users if only they were given their gently requested inch ; and he promised , I hurry to report , that the matter of a smoking room would be placed before the board of directors at their next gathering . ? THE office boy in George W. Wickersham 's office poked his head into the anteroom one day last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , Mr. Newton Baker , answered promptly . He says this has happened to him before in New York . aits IT is idle to sit back and shed tears over the disappearance of Christmas waits from the life of the town  --  although this seems to be an annual seasonal indulgence in sentiment  --  because , to be honest , in the memory of present man we have had no such strolling bands . The nearest approach to them were the heavily-brassed German musicians who cluttered apartment house courts with their guttural symphonies . Even these were not identified with the Yuletide , although they would stand ankle-deep in snow , inflating and deflating purpled cheeks for hours in the hope of small rewards , which were often merely red-hot pennies , heated over gas jets by mischievous youngsters and thrown from the windows . Now they have almost disappeared ; and soon , no doubt , they will be wholly extinct . The radio has done for them , it would seem . When the apartment housewife may , by turning a few knobs , tune in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she should stand by a window sill , tapping with her feet the measure indicated by the resonant " umph-phump-bah " ? of the lusty bass horn . Sequel IT is , perhaps , because Dr. Mary Stopes is an advocate of birth control that she is such an incurable optimist ; or it may be that the order of THE NEW YORKER the statement should be reversed . Whichever , her optimism is proved beyond hope ; and this by her own action . While " The Vortex " was playing in London , she wrote to Mr. Noel Coward suggesting that they colloborate on a sequel to his play  --  one of her own works had been produced at dire financial cost to her husband , they say  --  in which the same characters would appear , but in which their regeneration would be effected . Mr. Coward vouchsafed a reply to this kindly offer , looking towards something sweeter and finer . I should like very much to collaborate with you in such a worthy cause  --  so ran Mr. Coward 's courteous note  --  hut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes out . For instance , the box of dope which Nicky 's mother throws out the window is found , next morning , by the gardener 's daughter , who takes some and likes it very much . She eventually ends up in one of those places ( you know , those bad places ) in Marseilles . lacking Gentlemen DAILY the highways of our city become more colorful under the influence of the newer art in taxi decoration , an art of bright paint and brass , and more red and green lights than the Twentieth Century Limited carries . And the obvious explanation for the deluge comes in the recent high court decision in favor of the Luxor Cab , one of the most resplendent exponents , which gives them the right to enjoin such hacking gentlemen ( said to number two thousand ) as make bold to copy their distinctive design . The trade-mark of a taxi , hence , is officially recognized as its entire decorative scheme . The game of copying the color scheme of successful taxis is an old one  --  it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now yellow , now green . And with such imitation has come further complications . Early hacking organizations such as the I. T. 0 . A. , were groups of cab owners joined together for mutual protection , setting up rigid requirements for their drivers  --  three years of experience on the streets of Manhattan , etc . But , today , most organizations originate , not among the taxi owners , but , instead , among the automobile manufacturers . The modern practice is to sell cars on the installment plan , to whoever will buy and to include , with the buying price , trade-marks and distinguishing color schemes such as had already gained the confidence of the public . Companies even rent the use of insignia , including the legal insurance , at so much a month . And , in the heat of sales campaigns , the education of the purchaser , and prospective driver , ofttimes suffers . ALL this my obliging informant , the Club Taxi Starter , explained to me in much detail . He has , he says , much sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little for the modern practice installment plan sales . " What chance , " he asks , " have my drivers with ten years experience of getting a fare away from one of these new cabs ? A kid , two days out of training school , with only the first installment on his splendiferous coach paid for , comes sailing up with fresh paint enough to dazzle a blind man , and off our customer goes , probably to a wrong address . " ? BUSINESS : Alfred A. Knopf , the publisher , in a public advertisement , announces that he is all broken up over the death of Ladislas Reymont , one of his writers . He is going to publish the dead man 's " The Promised Land " right away . The promptness with which the publisher has got out his circular may be due , as ht says , to the fact that Reymont 's death was not unexpected . The Garden PROFESSIONAL hockey as a sport of fans , when last observed , was trembling in the balance as much as anything can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A visit to a heavily fur-coated box the night of the first match , two weeks ago , gave me the impression that most of the people that night were sight-seeing . Conversation was mostly about horses and bazaars . The second match , however , gave a chance for the hockey fans to bawl ai loud as they wanted . They did ; but for every bawling fan , there were a score of people turning their heads to see if it were really someone excited or only a man having a fit . The attendance was low the second night ; and the empty upper galleries , where , by the way , most of the money is made , exerted their deadening effect on all but the vitally interested . The spectators were still sight-seeing last week . By the end of the game , however , the excitement of the contest persuaded a good many out of their reserve . Tex Rickard knows that hockey , whether accepted by the prize fight going public or not , is a good sport to watch and an exciting one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy skaters in the intermissions soften hard hearts ; with an equipment like the Garden , badminton could be made to drive crowds into a frenzy . As my taxi driver said , Rickard is no fool . The ice , by the way , is coffee-colored , and as the evening progresses , grows to look more and more like a big cake of maple sugar the mice have scratched up . Distingue 14 R. VINCENT LOPEZ was the victim lately of that odd form of practical joking to which the larger figures of Broadway have turned for their relaxations . By telephone , he was advised that his supper club , Casa Lopez , was to be honored by the presence of the French Ambassador . Naturally , Mr. Lopez went to extensive preparations . And they seemed justified . One after another , gentlemen in the group made to withdraw their wallets , but the Ambassador waved them aside . " I will settle this personally with M'sieu Lopez , " he announced . Thus the fun continued until six A. M. , with the orchestra 's overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Ambassador cast aside the red sash and revealed himself as a vaudeville actor of note . Mr. Lopez , it is said , hopes that something may be done soon about the French debt . ? NEW liquor in old glasses : an en- terprising bootlegger , we learn , is furnishing , complimentarily , to selected patrons , half-dozen lots of whiskey glasses which have gained a small vogue since the onset of the great drought . They are the glasses upon which are graduated scales for drinks : the two finger line has a marking , " ladies " ; three fingers , " gentlemen 's " , and at four fingers there is an etching of a rather stout pig . In the latest edition , the bootlegger 's telephone number is etched upon the glassware .
