On Memorial Day <P> the paunches of the bourgeoisie <P> sway gently in the sun , <P> bend over , <P> place wreaths upon <P> the graves of those who died <P> that the paunches of the bourgeoisie <P> might sway <P> gently <P> in <P> the sun . <P> -A . B. MAGILL in the Daily Worker <P> Verses in this vein , appearing in the Communistic Daily Worker , induced one David Gordon also to write a poem . He called it " America , " and in it , by crass terms , described the Goddess of Liberty in New York Harbor as looking down upon a land where liberty no longer thrived . So vile did three New York judges think the boy 's phrases , so indecent his imagery that they would not excuse his adolescence . Last week they ordered him to the reformatory for 13 months . Three other judges had already sentenced Editor William F. Dunne of the Daily Worker to 30 days in the New York workhouse and a $500 fine for publishing the lines .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
