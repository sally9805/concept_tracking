TOE last year of my stay in the prison , thanks to the advent of a new matron , I was allowed to start a school , ' as it was rather ambitiously called . If one thinks of a school in terms of equipment ? an imposing building , library , modern textbooks ? that was not our school . Our equipment consisted of two square yards of blackboard space and a few old readers . We approached the standard of the log with a teacher mr one end and a pupil on the other ! My experiment is of interest because it was the first attempt of the kind in this women 's prison , and because the impulse for its organization came from the women themselves . When I first entered the institution , two of the girls came to me and asked if I could teach them to read English ; a girl who had been to high school asked if it would be possible that we should read together , study Italian , do something interesting and worth while . As the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period on Saturday , her idea was impractical . At this time one fourth of the ; iris were unable to write their own letters ; some could write in German , Polish , or Italian , but not in English . I asked the head matron if I might have the opportunity to teach . The refusal was peremptory ; I was to have no ' highflown ' ideas ; the State expected me to work , not to teach ; besides , YOU ca n't learn them con 's nothin ' . ' I was sent into the matrons ' house- hold to act as housekeeper and general factotum , and I stayed there for years , until I was too ill to do physical labor . The head matron who had vetoed the school project resigned and a new one reigned in her stead . Happily , at this time a very charming and intelligent woman came in as assistant-matron . She was interested in the girls and felt that her position offered opportunity for social service ? an official point of view so unique in this prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a month or so after she came , I saw Number 20003 , an illiterate , bring the new matron a slate upon which she had been copying some printed words from a book . I said , ' If I could only teach her ! ' The new matron : ' Would you really be willing to teach her ? ' Number 20003 : ' Would you learn me ? honest , would you ? ' And I : ' It is the very chance for which I have waited all these years . ' So Number 20003 was my first pupil . The warden gave a cordial assent to the plan and , as we progressed , was enthusiastic and interested . Number 20003 was anxious to be able to write her own letters . She was a Polish woman , twenty-five years of age ? the mother of two children . Her husband had promptly divorced her when she went to prison , but her devotion to him was unfaltering . The baby died in a charitable institution shortly after the mother entered prison ; 611 her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed to forget the incident . In spite of these fundamental experiences , her mentality was that of an eight-year-old child . We struggled through a primer , but the first reader was almost too much for her , not alone because she found it difficult to remember the word-symbols , but because she had so few associations with the content of the stories in the first reading-books . We read a story of a little rich girl who looked longingly at a group of children playing at games in a street below . Number woo had never heard of blindman 's buff or hide-and-seek ; the only game she had ever seen was drop-the-handkerchief , played one Saturday afternoon in the prison yard . She told of her childhood on a Northern timber-claim where the children began to work at the age when other little ones would begin to play . She had never attended school , except a Polish parochial one , where only the Polish language was taught . Life held nothing but working , eating , sleeping ; an early marriage , then prison at twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter de la Mare 's ' Silver This was a picture that she knew ; and Number 20003 said , ' I want to learn that , ' cause it 's kinda nice , when you ca n't see them things , to read about them . ' When Number 20015 heard that Number 20003 was going to learn to read English and to write her own letters , she asked for permission to be in the school . ' In a few weeks more than sixty per cent of the girls were enrolled , and we had classes five nights a week in the big sewing-roon I hope my pupils gained somethin from the work . To me it was a trnp illuminating experience ; I was selfish ) happy to be doing work that demande mental preparation and alertness. had often spent two hours darning ; stocking so worn that , even after al the work put on it , it would not stain another day 's wear ? a typical example of the futile labor on which the womet were put . The matron whose hosier ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this her . self , but when she had twenty slave at her service why should they not dc anything she asked ? The State said they should ! No one considered how incongruous or inefficient it was to put a woman capable of doing skilled work upon such a menial task . And no one thought how unspeakably dreary that sort of labor would be to a person accustomed to responsibility and to the joy of doing expert work . The division into classes that year was not wholly satisfactory , ? experi. ments seldom are , ? but we had a be . ginners ' class in reading that made commendable progress , another in third-year work , some tutoring in arith ? metic , and a group that took senior English ' ? they adored the term ' son-for English . ' Aside from the reading , we took up some work in the simpler forms of business and friendly letters , and we always had a short oral drill on correct forms of speech . I used to wen ? der if sometime , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular verb correctly . I realized that effort was being made when one day I heard Bessie saying to Bertha , ' You must n't say you saw somethin ' . You saw wood . But when you seen it with your eyes ? why , then you seen it . ' We read first Josephine Preston Peabody 's Old Greek Folk Stories , and it was pleasant when , later , with a portfolio of pictures of Greece , we saw the wooded shores of Ithaca , a fragment of a temple of the great Diana , and a long low mountain called Parnassus . One evening when we read , each one felt proud because Helen and the weary , wayworn wanderer were on her acquaintance list . Said Bessie , quite seriously : It 's sorta nice being educated , is n't it ? ' After we finished the Greek stories , I put on the board a list , from which choice was to be made for study , telling briefly of the author or the book . I had intended to guide them tactfully to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But every last sister voted for Edgar Allan Poe . They had liked what I said of his erratic life . We had a fine time reading some of his poems and short stories . We shuddered over the ' Masque of the Red Death , ' and even Bessie 's mulatto cheeks were pale when the House of Usher fell . I told them something of the characteristics of poetry : rhythm , rhyming schemes , versification , the topics most frequently chosen . After we had discussed a new poem we would acid it to our repertoire , and read and reread it with alternate solo and chorus effects , quite after the manner of the most approved community song festivals . Our pet poem was : ? It will be observed that we had a strong sense of rhythm . No meeting was ever complete unless we read Annabel Lee . ' Number 20022 said she just loved because it was written ' in such lovely waltz-time ' ? her translation of my dissertation on the anapmstic metre . The spontaneous response to poetry was not surprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for its rhythm and music . Before the beginners had completed their first reader they knew Joyce Kilmer 's Trees , ' Tennyson 's ' Sweet and Low , ' and a dozen more of that type . Shortly before my release I was permitted to organize the second year 's work . The usual groups for elementary reading and so forth were formed , but I was most interested in the two more advanced classes in English . The senior group had bravely started out on a survey of English literature . ( By the way , one of the rather nice things was that every girl wanted to buy and to own the excellent new texts that the State was furnishing for us . I always like people who want to own books . ) We read Beowulf , excerpts from the Saxon Chronicle , Mandeville 's Travels , with ready appreciation . Each night we would turn to the back of the book to some of the easy ones , ' and we would read a bit from Stevenson , or from Christina Rossetti ; once it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the description of Mabel in If Winter Comes , and Mark Sabre 's discovery of Byron . They liked that because it was akin to their own literary pioneering . At my last recitation with the junior group we read the Message to Garcia , and Kipling 's ' If . " My ! It ' s like going to church to read them things , is n't it ? Only you can understand what they mean , and you do n't always know what the minister is talking about . ' This , which would be everyday work elsewhere , was not commonplace with us . None of the women had read much before . We sat in a room with heavily barred windows that overlooked the grim prison-wall ; the rasp of a key turning in some door was always in our ears ; our garb was hideous . But the assistant-matron we loved sat with us , interested in us , as we proved anew the magic that lies in books . Perhaps my sweetest memory of the little school is this . We had read Rupert Brooke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendor and sadness of the sunset hour , and something of the young poet . A few days later one of the girls came to me and said : ' Last night when we were cleaning in the sewing-room , I looked out of the west windows , and the winter sky was yellow and gold and pretty colors just like our poem read . And I said to myself , " I ' d watched the sorrow of the evening sky . " ' She had looked through barred windows , over the great prison-wall , but had seen only the magic and beauty of a sunset . Sometimes I think the person was wrong who said , ' You ca n't learn them con 's nothin ' . ' If , in the manner we all once deemed highly possible , a benevolent fairy should appear and grant me one , and only one , wish for the improvement of conditions in penal institutions , without hesitation I should ask for a higher type of prison official . To one accustomed to the dictum that a legitimate trade or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison official is an anomaly . The ward . en is appointed by the Governor and as the position carries an excellent salary , it is given to a political partisan as a matter of course . The minor officials are chosen by the warden , subject to the approval of the Board of Control . There is a vague tradition that these appointments are made from a civil-service list , but anyone who can write his name or read a paragraph from a second reader could qualify . Aside from the institution 's physician and the stenographers in the office , I never knew an official who had any special training or qualification for his work . The upper officials who sponsored those things that are most deplorable ? repressions , enforced by heart-sickening brutality ? had risen from the ranks . The guard who was the sternest , most implacable disciplinarian became deputy warden and later a warden . The worst politician would have been preferable to a man of this type . The head matron who was in office when I entered had earned her livelihood as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow of a saloon-keeper . We had one assistant-matron who had been a general house-servant , a substitute who had been a washerwoman . Both of these spoke broken English ; they could barely read and write . The regular staff of the women 's prison consisted of the head matron and one assistant , who had charge of the work during the day ; a night matron ; a substitute who came eight days a month when the regular employees had their free days . There were frequent changes in the personnel of the stall ; perhaps twenty women served in these different capacities during my incarceration . Obviously , general statements regarding that number of individuals would carry little weight . But it was not possible to live in the constant wearisome proximity of confinement without becoming either deeply attached or fervently antagonistic to these women who held our lives ? almost ? in their hands . There were four whom I loved devotedly . They were kind to me , gave me a generous friendship when I knew only distress and despair ; and there was nothing half-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . As to the others , my antipathy is greatly modified by a realization of their limitations . I can conceive of no work which is so peculiarly and elementally a test of human character as that of a prison official . Put power , autocratic and irresponsible power , into the hands of a woman untrained for authority , and one of two things happens : if she has the intelligence , courage , and strength of natural leadership , she becomes a tremendous factor for good ; if she is of limited mentality , petty and narrow , the consequences are deplorable beyond the conception of the uninitiated . With the present system , the outsider has no means of gauging the ability of a prison official . Recently I read of the appointment as police matron of a woman who had served as an official in our prison . The article stated that she was deeply interested in the welfare of wayward girls . ' For two years I had endured existence under her , and knew her to be harsh , stupid , utterly regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can recall no act of hers to ameliorate the unsanitary conditions , the unhygienic mode of life , the depressing moral atmosphere . But she looked benevolent ; her gray hair was always nicely waved ? she could have // earned a princely competence posing as a benign mother in the movies . A prerequisite professional training for the prison official will not necessarily eliminate all those temperamentally unfitted for the exacting demands of this occupation , but it will mean the maximum rather than the present minimum number of desirable men and women for these positions . I talked with a young woman who had taken her Master 's degree under a great sociologist , with a research fellowship later , and two years of practical work in Eastern penal and corrective institutions . Why do n't you take that job as head matron in our prison and do something ? blaze a trail ? Surely that is what your training is for , ' I expostulated . Her reply is interesting . ' There are two reasons why I could not afford to take it . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secondly , I could not stand the ungodly hours and the confinement . Recently I was offered a position as head of a large reformatory for women , which was being built in a Western state . The work would have been interesting , the salary was excellent , and I said that I would accept the position if I might live away from the prison grounds , so that part of my life would be away from that abnormal atmosphere . I could not give the State acceptable work if I were subject to the constant strain of the oppressive environment . But they would not consider such a course . ' I did not blame her . With conditions as they are , work in a prison is not entirely attractive . It is time , for the sake both of the official and of the inmate , that a change was made . III Prison discipline is the most stupid assertion of autocratic power conceivable . To misquote Hannah More : ? Without exception , every writer on prison life has but one story : endless punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is petty , personal , and vindictive . The one aim of the voluminous code of rules is to reduce a group of human beings to automatons . Naturally the human beings resent this stultifying process , and the resultant interminable enmity between prison officials and inmates breeds fear and brutality on one side , fear and servility on the other . The rule of rules is , Thou shalt not talk . ' Imagine any man mad enough to think he could enforce that commandment in a group of women , saints or sinners ! For three and a half years I saw punishment ? varying from admonition to solitary confinement ? dealt out daily to stop the talking-habit , but I am thankful to say the women 's tongues ran with the same alacrity the day I left . What was developed was a superhuman slyness . Soon after my entrance , I came to a definite decision in regard to the discipline . One could not have the slightest respect for rules and regulations which promoted the petty tyranny of the officers and stifled every instinct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To obey them meant no exercise of ethical judgment ; it was sim- ply the canny thing to do . Some day an CF.pplication for my pardon would be entered , and I should need the good record which the officers could make or mar . Most of them had the inordinate self-esteem and vanity that is the result of autocratic power in individuals of impoverished intelligence ; they were opinionated to a ludicrous degree . I could not avoid realizing that I was regarded as a variation from the usual type of woman inmate . It was very sweet for these people to have me un . der their control ; nothing would feed their vanity more than to have me subservient and obsequious ; nothing would make them feel their power and importance more than a chance to punish me . I talked over the situation with my friend , the little assistant-matron . ' I fully intend to comply with all their rules , ' I said ; it ' s the sensible thing to do under the circumstances . I can easily refrain from talking , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . But some day I 'll break some rule ? no human being could help doing it , there are so many of them . What then ? Could one appeal to the warden or the deputy and obtain any clemency , any redress ? ' She hesitated ; she was an officer , but she was also a gentlewoman . ' Technically , they are supposed to be impartial . As a matter of fact , I have never known any report by an officer against an inmate to be questioned . And I have never known of any appeal to either of these men being considered . Stand everything you can , for the sake of the end in view . If the worst comes , appeal to the Board of Control . ' My later observation confirmed her statement . No matter how trivial , spiteful , or untruthful the charge en ? tered against a prisoner , the matron 's word was accepted . The higher official made no investigation as to circum ? stances , would listen to no explanation or defense . To enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control was , for obvious reasons , a very hazardous undertaking ; an inmate had a fearful path before her if she in. curred the personal enmity of a matron . One day , while scrubbing , Nellie asked a neighbor for a bar of soap . She was reported by the head matron , and in a short time the deputy appeared , apoplectic with rage . His bellow could have been heard a block away . Talking again , are you ? Well , I 'll learn you to stop that . God damn you ? I ' ll break your heart ? I ' ll break your spirit ? I ' 11 put you where you wo n't talk ! ' That was more than I could stand . I stopped Nellie on the stairway next day and told her I had overheard Ihe deputy 's blasphemous admonition . The Board of Control was to meet at the prison next week . I asked her to enter a request to see the president of the Board ; to tell him quietly and truthfully this incident , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humiliation of profanity . She did this . She was asked who else had heard the conversation . ' The head matron , ' she replied . He turned to the head matron . ' Is this correct ? ' Well , I guess Nellie was a little excited at the time , ' was the evasive reply . However , there was less swearing thereafter . Later , the head matron told me of this incident , as there was an enmity between the deputy and herself . ' I knew Nellie was right , ' she said , ' but what could I say ? You know we officers are supposed to stand up for one another . ' There was never the slightest disgrace felt when punishment befell one ; it was a joke , an inconvenience , or an affliction , demanding sympathy according to the degree of severity . We knew the most intimate details of the officials ' lives ; there were several who , if justice were always enforced , would have been on our side of the bars . We saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they held the whip hand , and we had no redress . I remained a ' model prisoner ' until a month before my release , when , to use the vernacular , they got me . ' I had several times been disciplined , but only once was official record made of my misdemeanors . I relate my experiences not with any sense of personal griev mice , but to show what is regarded as a serious offense , the logical treatment that follows , and the highly beneficial effect of the punishment . As I have stated before , my physical strength was very limited . The absurdity of my sentence , ' nineteen years of hard labor , ' was felt by no one , least of all the robust , stolid German judge . All my punishments in prison came because of my illness and my physical inability to carry heavy burdens . One Thursday ? it was the twentieth of February , 1919 ? I had one of the severe headaches to which I am subject . Although so ill that I could scarcely stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning I was too ill to arise . The head matron brought the deputy to my room . What 's the matter ? ' he asked . I am sick , ' I replied . Sick ! Well , we ' ve had enough of that damned nonsense and we ' re going to put a stop to it . I 'll send for the doctor , and we 'll see how sick you are ! ' The physician came and pronounced my illness genuine . I might explain that there were no hospital facilities in the women 's prison ; if a woman was sick , she remained locked in her cell . The doctor would visit her in the morning , some food would be brought at mealtimes ; there was no kindness , no care . Shortly before this incident we had passed through the flu ' epidemic ; one woman had died in her cell a few doors from mine , practically uncared for , and scattered along the unventilated corridor had been half a dozen others sick with the dread disease . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invasion of the epidemic ; the papers commented on the fact that there was no flu in the prison . As segregation of the sick had never been practised , I was quite unprepared for what followed . Take her downstairs , ' the deputy bellowed , ? he never spoke to an inmate , ? and keep her there three days . Give her nothing but bread and water . We 'll get this " being sick " business out of her head . ' I supposed I was being taken to the solitary-confinement cell , ? punishment for illness was not unusual , ? but instead found my destination to be a dirty , unused cell , furnished only with an old iron bed and an incredibly filthy mattress . Saturday morning I asked to go back to work , as I was able to stand , but I was told that I could not do so . I asked to see the warden , but was told that he was out of town . Sunday morning I asked to see the prison physician ; he sent word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as this was a matter of discipline , not illness . Sunday afternoon , as a last resort , I asked for permission to write to the Board of Control . Half an hour later I was released and allowed to go to my own room ! The words ' Board of Control ' had had a magical effect . Instantly the matron began to explain that I was not being punished , ? Oh dear , no ! ? but sometimes you have complained that the work was hard , and this , my dear , is a lovely chance to rest . ' Imagine resting in an unfurnished , dirty room , with nothing to eat ; for I refused the bread and water , protesting that that was the diet of those being punished , and that sickness was no cause for punishment . ' And then , my dear , it was not me who put you here . ' The deputy came posthaste , and was exceedingly solicitous for my welfare . He had decided to let me return to my own cell that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that letter to the Board of Control you were going to write ? well , I always say to the men I 'll treat ' em fifty-fifty . You 'll be coming up for pardon soon , ' he waxed very indignant over the injustice of my sentence , and you 'll need all of our help . ' I saw his point . The letter was not written . Monday I went back to work , weak from a four-day fast , but I had a new courage . I knew I had as enemies cowards and bullies , and that in an extremity the Board of Control would protect an inmate . In June 1920 I was ill again and was kept on bread and water for a week ; then I appealed to the Board for lighter work and a chance to buy nourishing food . However , I was never officially reported until October 6 , 1922 . The scene of my misdemeanor was the lawn . dry , with a substitute matron in charge . She asked me to fill the tubs with soft water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big buckets . I explained to her courteously that I was unable to carry the heavy pails ; that , because of my illness , I had been excused by the regular officials from that work . ' You are no better than anyone else , and you do as I say , ' was the reply . Without answering , I left the room and went to the head matron , told her the incident , and asked her to explain to the newcomer the fact that I had of . ficial sanction for my refusal to do the work . ' Sure I 'll explain , ' nobly . We do n't ask nobody to do work that is too hard for ' em , and the former warden and a member of the B. of C. and the doctor has all said you was too sick to do work like that . Sure I 'll tell her . ' That afternoon the substitute matron came to me , beaming with pleasure , to tell me I was wanted by the deputy . When I stood before that august @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I had disobeyed an officer ; I had made faces at an officer . In defense I explained that the head matron had sanctioned my refusal to carry water , because she knew I was not able to do that type of work ; that it was untrue that I had made faces ' ? I had not been guilty of that offense since I was a child . The substitute matron reiterated her statements , with the further embellishment that she had frequently seen me carrying pails of water ? which was quite untrue . No defense could be made in the face of the woman 's dishonesty , nor would any defense.be believed . I was taken back to my cell , the woman chanting a pan of spite ; ' Well , you could n't get by with your fine-lady airs . Sick , are you ? Well , you 'll be a damn sight sicker before you get through . This will spoil your good record ? queer any chance you ever had for getting out of here . ' At the time of this occurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he had the testimony of five physicians , three of whom were hired by the State , to the effect that I was seriously ill . Yet these petty officials quite deliberately undertook to spoil this opportunity of a sick Is-on-Ian 's chance for freedom . I was too ill , excited , and nervous to see things in their proper proportions , and I believed their threats ; I thought my one chance of leaving the prison had been lost through this unjust report . They found me unconscious on the floor of my cell several hours later , and for two days I was wildly delirious . To punish me for my frightful offense , I was locked up for eleven days . On the fifth day the prison physician went to the warden and asked to have the punishment stopped , as I was too sick to undergo the ordeal . Twice afterward he made the appeal to deaf ears , although punishment is supposed to cease when the physician so recommends . I can not speak of the suffering that was crowded into those eleven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could frighten me ; they attain the ultimate desire of the true prisoncIL official ? they had broken my spirit . ) As I sit propped up in my hospital bed , writing this , I find it difficult to realize that but a few months ago I was being punished because I was ill . It must have been an acute disappointment to those prison officials , but my one black mark did not bar my release . I try to tell my story dispassionately , but I can not . Because I had friends to intercede for me , and the requisite money to pay for professional services , I am now surrounded by care and attention . Had I been friendless and penniless , there would be no skillful physicians or pleasant , deft nurses , no intimate visits with beloved friends ? none of the things that help sick folk to get well . There are those whom I left behind in that place of wrath and tears who are not r fortunate ; it is for them that I plead . They need the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are well , of care and kindness when they are sick . Until prison discipline can fulfill these needs , it must be branded as inadequate to meet the standards of twentieth-century civilization . IV The different States have various systems of providing work for their prison inmates . Thirty-three per cent use the contract system , twenty-two per cent have the State-use system , sixteen per cent the public-account system , twelve per cent public-worksand-ways , the remainder the lease or piece-price system . Some penitentiaries are self-sustaining , some are even sources of revenue ; a few are listed as liabilities on the State ledger . The convict-labor problem at present is largely concerned with this financial aspect . The suggestion of modern penologists , that in the future the convict be considered the vital factor in the case , opens new horizons . The important thing is not so much to give people freedom as to make them fit for freedom . ' This might apply to penal as well as to economic questions . The State is giving the highest service when it assists the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges against the present system of convict labor : the work has no interest ? it is purely punitive ; it bears no relation to what the convict has done before or after he leaves prison ; it has no educational , vocational , or reformatory value ; there is no incentive for good work ; the convict is not paid for his labor . As an initial step to better working-conditions : the sick should be suitably cared for ; the mentally abnormal should be under the care of psychiatrists ; those whose condition can not be improved should be segregated . Those who are mentally and physically fit are well worth salvaging . The convict , man or woman , at the outset should be made to understand that he is in prison because he has failed in some definite way to respect the rights of his fellow men . He is to be helped , if he will cooperate , so that when he returns to society he may be an asset . He is to earn freedom , not by passive ' good conduct , ' but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or manual dexterity . The best physician can not help a patient who fails to cooperate with him . It is therefore important that the mental attitude of the convicted person be considered : self-respect , ambition , initiative , regard for the rights of others ? these basic qualities must be fostered , not utterly quenched . As I write these facts I try to remember one thing in my prison experience that tended to foster ambition or initiative or any superior quality . I can recall only endless humiliations , abasements , and degradations . In the prison I knew , the hard labor to which the thirty women inmates had been sentenced fell into four divisions : ( a ) service for the officials as house servants , seamstresses , laundresses , and so forth ; ( b ) sewing for the men 's department ; ( c ) maintenance for the women 's prison ; ( d ) employment in an annex to the prison shoe-factory . This last group , comprising five or six women , was considered most fortunate ; the work and environment were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , according to the amount of work accomplished . They were the only ones who were interested in the slightest degree in their work , because they alone had an incentive . The two servants at the deputy warden 's house and the one in the matrons ' residence received ten cents a day . All others drew three cents daily the first year , one cent a day afterward . Everyone agrees that the present system of payment or nonpayment is unsatisfactory , but no effort is made at any readjustment . When I went into the matrons ' house to work , I was entitled to the regulation ten cents a day , but I never received the munificent salary . Half was given to the girl who came in to act as assistant . I worked seventy hours a week ( at a minimum count ) for thirty-five cents ; my assistant worked five or ten hours a week for thirty-five cents . I had the temerity to protest to the matron against this arrangement . I said I thought that if the other person drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the work . ' Well , if you do n't like it , you can quit . Anyway , you ought to be ashamed ; she needs the money more than you do . The warden always does what I say , so if you complain to him you ' 11 see what you get . ' Naturally the small amount concerned did not warrant a formal protest , so the arrangement stood . The incident is worth recounting in that it illustrates the chance an inmate stands for fair play . A few days after my entrance I was given the usual physical examination . It was perfunctory and superficial . .. 1 The physician said , ' You are able to do a hard day 's work . ' ( I never knew of a case where the same judgment was not pronounced . ) She certainly is not able to do the usual work here , ' the little assistant-matron said decisively . ' If I could only be out of doors and regain my strength , I would later do my best , ' I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out of doors for an hour or two daily ? a tremendous concession . She was charming and kind ; our friendship flourished when the sharp-tongued head-matron was not near by . We had many discussions as to the work I was to do . I was frail physically , but I could teach and she felt the urgent need for some systematized instruction . But the head matron had settled that question summarily : ' You ca n't learn them con 's nothin ' . ' I was later installed as the entire , euite de menage in the matrons ' residence . My knowledge of cooking was fragmentary . I could make mayonnaise dressing , grill lamb-chops nicely , make a delectable spice-cake , but there remained vast areas of the culinary kingdom for me to master . I thought that would be interesting ? and it was . The head matron had never heard of olive oil , and wanted her meat fried hard , so my first two accomplishments went by the board ; my heavenly spice-cake alone had to stand as my initial sponsor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy she expended in learnin " me my place to teaching me the fundamentals of a new occupation , my progress would have been rapid . But her own knowledge waslimited and the directions she did give were vague and contradictory . I had three sources of information : the housekeeping magazines that were sent to me by friends when they learned of my new work , the little assistant-matron , and Selma . Selma was the big Polish woman who occasionally came in to help with the cleaning . She was an excellent cook , and would sometimes come stealing into the kitchen to show me how to prepare a roast , or bake a pie , or dress a fish . If she was caught there was a tremendous row . It seems as if it might be a very simple thing to furnish an incentive for hard labor . The work could easily be divided into definite units and credit given the prisoner for the time spent , for her attitude toward the work , her ability and progress , just as a trade-school pupil is given credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satisfactory progress should be rewarded in two ways : by the payment of perceptible wages or of a bonus , and by the assurance that recognition will be given to the units earned , when a prisoner becomes an applicant for release . Surely the woman who acquires a useful vocation is more fit to return to society than the lazy , unskilled worker . The incoming prisoner whose education is below fifth-grade standards should receive at least an hour of daily instruction from a competent teacher , and should be given due credit for her progress and application . Those who wish advanced work should have definite , substantial encouragement . At present the correspondence school of the State University offers the only chance for anything beyond the most rudimentary instruction , but this opportunity for advancement is barred from those who have no money . University records show that the prisoners who have taken courses in this extension department show markings decidedly above the average . Perhaps I dwell upon the possibility of education in the elementary and advanced academic branches because of the nature of my experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum along the lines of vocational education . The laundry , in which most of the women worked two and a half days a week , was operated solely for the use of a few of the officials . If a button was lost from the warden 's pajamas , or the deputy 's collars had too much starch , tremendous consternation ensued . If an officer had company , the guest thriftily brought a suitcase full of soiled clothes for free laundering . One Christmas the son of an official brought fifty pairs of socks to be washed and mended ! He was immediately christened ' the Centipede . ' When an inmate entered she was assigned to the linen tub or to the rags , ' to the mangle or to the ironing of shirts , and she usually remained a fixture at this original assignment . She might learn to do one thing well , but she gained no knowledge of the interesting , useful , and lucrative occupation of laundering . It would be a sensible and practical thing to reorganize the laundry and make the training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still be given the officials or any clientele who would pay for the work . A trained instructor should teach each step of the work : the chemical processes that underlie the cleaning process ; how different fabrics should be washed ; the use of the machines that are being installed in the average home ; and some of the simpler processes of dry-cleaning . Further , the management of a small laundry-establishment could be taught ? the marking and assorting of clothes ; some of the principles of bookkeeping . When the inmate had attained a degree of proficiency in this branch of work , she should be reward . ed by the payment of a perceptible wage and a recognition of ability that would count toward her release . A similar systematized correlation of work and instruction could he planned in the sewing-room , where there is ample opportunity to teach proficiency in household needleworl , and the simpler forms of dressmaking , The inmates ' kitchen , and later the homes of the officers , could be practice fields for cooking and housewifery . Stella R was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State time ' was appropriated by the more unscrupulous officers or officers ' wives for their per . sonal use ; she saved them the paying of dressmakers ' bills . No one considered Stella 's side of the transaction . She was desirous of taking a course in dress-designing , but she did not have the money or the opportunity for such advanced work . ' If I could only earn money enough to start myself in one of those little needlecraft shops , I am sure I could make it a success , ' she would say . How she hated the women who used her skill without paying her anything , without even a courteous acknowledgment of her work ! Expert waitresses , chambermaids , nursemaids , milliners , good cooks , dietitians ? what craft could not be listed ? The raising of poultry , the making of a garden ? all these things could be taught and learned as systematized units , , just as they are taught in an agricultural college or a trade school where practice and basic knowledge are interdependent . At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves would be a more exact word ? for the use of certain officials . The deputy warden , for instance , before his promotion to that eminence lived modestly in a rented house ; his wife , like most of the housewives in the small community , did all of her housework and most of her sewing . When he became deputy warden , the family moved into the eight-room house furnished by the State ; they were given the use of three women prisoners as servants ; a cook and housemaid gave full time , while a third woman was frequently required as seamstress or for cleaning . Their laundry was done in the women 's prison . A man of all work was furnished from the men 's prison . In short , this family assumed a standard of living to which it was unaccustomed , one which was maintained by no other folk ? even the most well-to-do ? in the community . Of course the warden 's menage was more elaborate than the deputy 's . A hired chef did his cooking ; two men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeur and a gardener were always on duty ; the laundry was done by the women prisoners . If the officers were to pay for this excessive personal service , or to become responsible for some part of the training in housewifery , this custom might have a logical excuse for its existence ; but as it stands to-day , such unrestricted use of the women prisoners as personal servants is pernicious ; there is nothing to be said in its behalf . The prisoners hate with special fervor these nonpaying employers , who are cruelly inconsiderate , often unkind . I know that no servant would stand the treatment I received in the matrons ' house . I am writing this chapter several years after my release from prison . It took me months , years , to regain my health , and months and years in hos-rt pitals and sanitariums are expensive ones . Always ahead of me stalked the terror , ' How am I going to earn myliving when I do get well ? ' I could not go back to my former profession . In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the handicap of limited physical strength . If my period of incarceration had held fewer days in punishment cells , and if I could have had some training for a trade or craft that would send me back to civic life as a skilled worker , my present problems would be easier to face and my memory of prison life less bitter . Surely civilization has advanced sufficiently to allow the present punitive system of convict labor to be replaced by work that is constructive ? that sends forth men and women strengthened , cured , prepared to earn a decent livelihood . The things asked for in prison reform are not unreasonable : a divorce of the penal system from politics ; the indeterminate sentence ; a disintegration of the prison population , permanently segregating the incorrigible and giving appropriate care and treatment to the subnormal ; the substitution of certificated , professional officers for the present untrained type ; an effective means by which the prisoner may obtain redress from the unreasoning brutality of irresponsible keepers ; a change from the present purposeless labor to work that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be changed from blind indiscriminate punishment to the fitting of the amenable delinquent for a successful rehabilitation in society . Our hope for a change from the present medieval penal system to one more in keeping with the modern standards of science , religion , and commonsense lies in the insistent discontent of the energetic minority . As soon as there is a general cognizance of the conditions prevalent in American prisons , it is not impossible to believe that radical changes will immediately follow .
