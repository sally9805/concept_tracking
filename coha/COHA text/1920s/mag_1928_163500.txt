Last week a smart launch detached itself and cut shoreward from the side of the S. S. President McKinley as she steamed into Manila Bay . From the launch , which seemed the liner 's emissary , stepped Col. Henry Lewis Stimson , emissary of the parent U. S. to the Philippines . <P> The erect , military figure made haste to Malacanan Palace , official residence of the Governors General . A knot of small , smart , brown-skinned men-Filipino politicians-were waiting to shake hands . Col. Stimson also greeted some other small , smart , brown-skinned men who were to be his servants . " Oh , yes , " he said , as a chef came forward . " Yes , I know Ming . How are you , Ming ? " <P> Inauguration ceremonies were held on the Luneta , one of the heights overlooking Manila Bay . After the oath , Governor General Stimson made a speech , portions of which his small , smart , brown-skinned audience took away behind impassive countenances to ponder upon . <P> The new Governor General had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor General to determine the future relations of the inhabitants of these Islands to the United States . . . I lay particular stress upon industrial and economic progress . " That seemed plain enough . It means that Col. Stimson would have little patience with Independence propagandists . <P> Another excerpt : " It is a simple truth not only that individual freedom and the practice of self government are found to be most prevalent and firmly held in those communities and nations which have a highly developed system of industry and commerce as their foundation , but it is also true that only in such communities and nations can the average citizen attain the degree of individual comfort , education and culture which modern civilization is coming to demand . <P> " Is there any reason why the Filipino people should not attain such economic development ? Manifestly they lack it today . . . . But the Philippine Islands are today possessed of political connections with the foremost industrial nation in the world . . . . " <P> Such words made paternalism sound genuinely beneficent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make while teaching its sturdy children . <P> Finally , Governor General Stimson had announced what his method would be . He was going to govern through a corps of " advisers " whose description sounded like the late Governor General Wood 's " Cavalry Cabinet " dismounted and sent about in mufti . " These men will be the best available , " said Governor General Stimson . " They will be my eyes and ears . They may be Filipinos . They may be Americans . But in any case they will be men whom I can be certain are trustworthy . They will be responsible to me and to me alone , without interference from the Assembly . This I want and I intend to have . <P> " I intend to keep these men out of politics . . . . No man who is doing a good job will object to an inspector 's visit . I should welcome such a visit . But any man who objects had better fear me. . . . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
