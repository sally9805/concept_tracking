They may now resume these negotiations , thus relieving the U. S. of much Latin American blame , which was incurred when the President of the U. S. did not succeed in settling the Tacna-Arica question , after accepting the joint invitations of Chile and Peru to act as arbiter ( TIME , March 16 , 1925 et seq . ) . <P> Nicaragua .
