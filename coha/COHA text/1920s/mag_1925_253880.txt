The oil situation continues to excite the speculator and puzzle the judicious . No sooner had record crude production been announced ( TIME , June 15 ) , than realistic indications of diminished crude output appeared . Oil prices continue to climb , and at length oil shares on the Stock Exchange have come in for a genuine advance . <P> Of course , the driving force behind this firming tone to the oil industry is this spring 's unprecedented consumption of gasoline . On May 1 , 1925 , stocks of gasoline in the U. S. were 1,561,002,024 gallons-a goodly amount still , although 64,867,000 gallons less than on May 1 , 1924 . Never since 1920 have gasoline stocks been smaller than they were the same date a year earlier . <P> April consumption of gasoline was unprecedented , at the rate-of 27,030,000 gallons a day , thus surpassing the previous record month of August , 1924 , when consumption reached 26,700,000 gallons daily . Some authorities expect to see a daily consumption rate of 29,000,000 gallons set for May , 1925 ; and , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over a billion gallons a month . If this transpires , stocks in this country would amount to only a little more than a month and a half 's supply . <P> Refiners start to store gasoline in November and continue to pile up stocks : until June 1 . Last winter , however , the increase of gasoline stocks was 225,000,000 gallons less than for 1923-24 , while consumption is now running 35% higher than at this time last year .
