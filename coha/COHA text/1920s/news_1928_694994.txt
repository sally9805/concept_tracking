txt The letters that I can not answer ? how they trouble me . Feeling the keen interest that I do In every letter that comes to me , I can not bear to have the writer think I am ignoring him or her . The letters that are on my mind are those which contain no addresses . Often they net forth a problem which they ask me to discuss in an article . Many times I can do this , but.smany times I can not . When I can not , pit is because of the nature of the difficulty they describe . Frequently it is a dilemma that is too personal , el* perhaps I should say , that Is too individual . It is not a general enough experience to use as the theme of an article , and yet the writer of it is so distressed that he should have a reply . But I can not answer because I have no address to write to . There are , for instance , the mothers who write me out of the bitterness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I can not answer fairly such letters without knowing the circumstances . Yet those letters spring from a feeling so strong that I do not want to seem to ignore them . But how can I answer them without an address ? Then , occasionally , , I am asked to do something which is impossible . For example , one young girl asked to tile reprint an article addressed to fathers which had already appeared , and to have it placed pn the first page instead of the women 's section , so that her father would be sure to see it . This could not be done  --  and the child gave me no address , so I can not answer her . And oh . how often have I been tempted to publish a letter that was so vivid , so well put that I knew it would be helpful to other parents ! But I refrained because the circumstances were so pelt/liar that I feared the writer might be identified with them by those who knew her and read the same paper . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if changed some of the details for purposes of disguise . I almost wish , at times like this , that people would add , " P. S. You may use this letter It you want to . " So I must repeat once more , that although thesek letters may be unanswered , - they are not Ignored .
