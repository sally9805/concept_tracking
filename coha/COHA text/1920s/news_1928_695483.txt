txt Governor Smith returned to the Executive Mansion in Albany tonight after sixteen days ' absence supremely happy over the nomination of Franklin D. Roosevelt to bead the State ticket as the Democratic gubernatorial candidate . The Governor was greeted at the Albany station by a band and about 500 people in celebration of his homecoming from his Western tour and the Rochester convention . A huge placard illuminated by red flares proclaimed : " You have won the West and the East is yours . " As he die . so many times on his campaign trip , the Executive stood in an open car and swung his hat to the cheering admirers . This time , however , the hat was a gray felt . The Governor is absolutely sure that Mr. Roosevelt is physically able to assume what the Governor called " the post of State leader " and he is equally certain that the candidate can make a comparatively active campaign . Mr. Roosevelt did not want , and would not be obliged , to dodge any of the duties ahead of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to suggest that a promise had been made to spare him from the work at hand . Calls Roosevelt as Good as Ever . " The real fact is this , " the Governor said . " Frank Roosevelt today is mentally as good as he ever was in his life Physically he is as good as he ever was In his life . His whole trouble is in his lack of muscular control of his lower limbs . But the answer to that is that a Governor does not have to be an acrobat . We do not elect him for his ability to do a double back flip or a handspring . The work of the governorship is brain work . Ninety-five per cent . of it is accomplished sitting at a desk . The : e is no doubt about his ability to do it . " As to comment that Mr. Roonvelt in his telegram of yesterday had expressed some doubt of the effects of the climatic conditions of Albany upon him , the Governor said : " Well , that was before the convention drafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be capable of making an " active campaign . " even to doing some traveling about the State . " Pcisonally , I do not think he will have to make very much of a campaign , but he can do it , " the Governor said . " Any man who can travel from New York to Houston and make the nominating speech for the Presidential candidate is certainly able to go around this State . This State will fit into a small part of Texas . " The Governor said a report that Mr. Roosevelt would have to confine his campaigning to the radio was erroneous . " As I look at the two tickets , the people of the State will be able to make their decision without very much campaigning , but they will get it anyway , " the Executive declared . Urged Roosevelt Over Phone . Describing the telephone conversation last night in which he urged Mr. Roosevelt to heed the demand that he run , the Governor said : I " I simply told him that the conven ' tion was unanimously for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see how he could refuse . " Mrs. Roosevelt was with the Governor in his room at the Hotel Seneca when he telephoned to her husband . Others there were Chairman Raskob of the National Committee , Dr. Henry Moskowitz and Colonel Herbert H. Lehman . As they understood Mr. Roosevelt 's condition , he was not suffering any pain from his disability , and there was considerable doubt that improvement in the use of his legs depended upon his wintering in the South . Mrs. Roosevelt had been persuaded to join in the demand of the leaders that her husband be a candidate , and when the Governor made his plea she gave her consent to Mr. Roosevelt over the wire . Governor Changes Plans . The friends who accompanied the ' cove nor on the train were no lass happy over the brighter prospects of , success that they saw for him both in New York State and the country at large by the addition of Mr. Roosevelt 's name to the ticket . There was talk of large bets placed at Rochester at odds which jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even money to 7 to 5 in favor of the ; overnor'a carrying the State in his Presidential campaign . With another announcement made by the Governor on the train to the effect that his campaign plans ahead were still unsettled , it was learned , t. at he had vetoed certain features lc , a tentative itinerary for his next trip . He objected to speaking every other night on his proposed tour and informed representatives of the National Committee that he had learned he was t at his best when be spoke too frequently , it was said . The next tour was supposed to take him , at least at its beginning , Into the South and the border States . " I am going to make the future plans , " the Governor said when he was asked about his itinerary . He meant , it was indicated , that he must reserve the right to look over Weans and change them it he thought it best . He will remain in Albany for the rest of the week and probably start on his next campaign trio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
