In heroic days , now several centuries past , when two opposing armies debouched upon a field of battle , each advanced a herald to warn the other of its aims , the intentness of its purpose , the justice of its cause , the dire results to be expected if the other did not summarily yield and to hold forth the promise that all would be well if its demands were immediately complied with . <P> This procedure is still observed between coal operators and coal miners when they are about to join battle over a wage scale . It was observed , last week , at Atlantic City . There the miners came , headed by John L. Lewis , President of the United Mine Workers , to present their demands , drawn up a week before at Scranton , Pa . ( TIME , July 13 ) , for a new wage contract to replace that which expires on Aug. 31 . The miners ask 1 ) a two-year contract ; 2 ) increases of 10% for contract miners and $1 a day for day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues out of miners ' pay by the coal companies ) . <P> John L. Lewis himself first came forward as herald for the miners to proclaim their cause . <P> He said he wished that he could parade along the boardwalk the 1,000 miners killed during the last two years , the 40,000 miners injured and their widows and orphans . He went on : <P> " Every bit of anthracite produced is smeared with blood . That is a gruesome thought , but harsh words may be necessary to awaken public opinion and a more or less sonmolent industry to a proper degree of responsibility in the premises . . . . " It may be that the operators may again suggest to the mine workers the arbitration of points of differences . The mine workers position on that question , if and when presented , will be just the same today as yesterday , the same in 1925 as in 1923 . Why ? Because , when a man who toils in your collieries agrees to let some third party say what shall be his conditions of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the character of his home , the food he shall eat , the degree of education he will give his children and to determine his standard as a citizen . Such a commission may determine what price a man may die for , what he will get for a broken back or a fractured limb . I do n't know , any man who works with his hands who will arbitrate such a question . " <P> Next spoke the herald of the operators , Samuel D. Warriner , veteran in Labor negotiations , making known the stand of the operators , surmised but not stated before . <P> He said that , if anthracite prices were increased , consumers would turn to other fuels ; that they are already doing so , using soft coal , oil , gas , coke , electricity . He referred to the soft-coal industry as an example : <P> " When the present wages in that industry were agreed to , some 66% of all bituminous coal was produced by Union miners and 33% by the non-Union fields . Today I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-Union fields and only about 30% in the Unionized fields ; that large Union operations are entirely shut down and that more than 200,000 Union miners are out of regular employment . There is no escaping from the meaning of these facts . The Unionized mines can not survive under the scale of wages attempted to be imposed upon them and the non-Union operators are taking the business .
