txt The Temps Says It Belies Our War Stand in Not Recognizing Who Caused the Catastrophe . SEES FIRST DEFAULT BY US And Adds That If Our Aid Means Revision of the Treaties the Price Is Too High . Special Cable to Tun NEW Tess TIMES . PARIS , May ** feeling of dissatisfaction in France over the tone of the speech of Ambassador Houghton at the Pilgrim dinner in London got into print this afternoon when the Temps , in a leading article , says that if the speech of this American diplomat represents the foreign policy of America . then the United States has belied its role in the war , when it helped defeat Germany , since it now throws at the head of composite Europe the advice to smooth out all its differences , and no longer appears to take sides , even sentimentally , in the task of ending the difficulties which exist between the conquered and conquering as a result of the war . With regard to Mr. Houghton 's warning that if Europe does not end its strife American financial aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same kind of talk when the United States was insisting on the adoption of the Dawes plan . " It is very natural for Americans to want to help only those who help themselves , " it says , " but in the circumstances that aid should be assured to France , which , despite the reparation defaults of Germany , has made a magnificent effort from her own means to reconstruct the devastated regions . " The sadness of the situation is that now Americans do not make the necessary distinction between the nations which were victims of German aggression and the preying nations which brought the Old World to where it is . They consider Europe as a bloc , without distinction between the executioner and the victim . " The Temps then expresses the opinion on the world situation which is held by almost all the statesmen of Europe , even privately by the leaders in England , namely , that in the present confusion America bears the responsibility . Bees First Default by Fs . " If matters over here remain so confused that the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault it is ? " it asks . " On the morrow of the victory of the Allies after four years of war there was a clear situation  --  Germany recognized her responsibility for the war , was beaten , and had signed a peace treaty forcing her to disarm and fixing her obligations . If the allied and associated powers had stuck to the treaty they made . Germany would have bowed before the fait accompli of her defeat and would have executed it . " But on the day that the United States refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles the Germans saw their chance to shake off the chains of the treaty and they organized resistance to all execution of it . At the base of the confused situation today there is the first default of America on the morrow of the common victory , and there is , secondly , the hesitations of England , which from year to year has gotten further away from the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles in the hope of facilitating reconciliation with the enemy of yesterday before the latter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe today to justify the hesitation of those who could contribute so powerfully to its political and economic reconstruction it is one 's duty to study whence came this confusion and on whom falls a large part of the responsibility . " The Temps asks why , when Mr. Houghton refers to lack of good faith . lie could not say he was talking about Germany . Insists France Kept Ifs Word . " All the experiences of the past six years show clearly that good faith has never been lacking on our side , " it continues , " for we went so far in conciliation that now we are not even able to maintain the rights which we had under the treaty of peace . If Americans start from the principle that those who suffered in the war ought to seek a settlement which so far as is humanly possible should be free from the conditions growing out of the war , we would like to ask if they mean by that that we must consent to a revision of the peace treaty . That would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our security does not permit us to renounce the guarantees given to us by the victory of our soldiers . " When the American Ambassador recommends good faith , we can not permit ourselves to suppose that he is addressing himself to any one but Germany , since up to the present it is Germany which has violated the spirit and letter of the treaties , constantly failed in international duty and has just elected as chief of the State the war leader who symbolizes the hope of conquest and revenge . " We do not doubt that Americans have the best sentiments in the world , but we fear they are strangely deceived on the intentions of Berlin and the sentiments which actuate the large majority of the German people . it is on the other side of the Rhine that the love of Peace must grow . It is there that Americans ought to go to talk about good faith . So long as it is otherwise it is our duty to watch out for our security . and we can only regret with sadness that an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted war and provoked the world catastrophe anti to those who were obliged to sacrifice everything  --  the blood of their children and the treasure of their harvest ? to defend the liberty and peace of the world .
