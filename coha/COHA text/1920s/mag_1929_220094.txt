After eight years of preparation , 21 days of trial , 590,000 words of testimony and 14 hours of deliberation by the jury , the Manhattan trial of Sir Joseph Duveen came , last week , to naught . Grey as the dawn in which they appeared , the jurymen reported a deadlock . Justice William Harman Black of the New York Supreme Court thanked and discharged them . <P> Mrs. Harry J. Hahn of Kansas City had been unable to prove that her heirloom painting was a Leonardo , or that Sir Joseph was guilty of slander when he pronounced it only a graceless copy of Leonardo 's La Belle Ferronire in the Louvre ( TIME , Feb. 18 et seq . ) . Therefore she could not extract $500,000 damages from Sir Joseph . He , on the other hand , had failed to impress the jury with his opinions . Therefore he could not feel the pride appropriate to an international art tycoon . <P> As final testimony X-ray pictures of both paintings were displayed . This comparison interested the jury , delighted the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louvre Xray . This indicated that the painter of the Louvre Belle had first laid down metallic flesh tints ( impermeable by X-rays ) then painted the jewelry over them . The practice of blocking out the whole figure before adding ornament is favored by artists working from live models . But in the Hahn X-ray the jewelry was clearly visible suggesting that the Hahn Belle had first been carefully sketched then colored in separate sections-flesh , fabric , jewelry . This is a practice favored by copyists . <P> The jury deadlocked at nine votes for Mrs. Hahn , three for Sir Joseph .
