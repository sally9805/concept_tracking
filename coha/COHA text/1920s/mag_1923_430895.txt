 | THERE is a country where the rivers run , so to speak , over the heads of the inhabitants ; where populous cities rest below the level of the sea , which persistently clamors for admission ; where cultivated fields are buried under unproductive sand , and marshes are drained to become fertile gardens ; where islands have been attached to the continent by ropes of sand , and where parts of the solid ground have been severed from the mainland and transformed into islands . Such a country is the United Netherlands , more familiar to many as Holland , the name of two of its eleven states . Holland , without quarries , has erected stately buildings and substantial cities and : aced miles of seacoast with protecting pavement ; almost without timber , she has built navies which have disputed the sea with the most powerful fleets . Lacking raw materials , Dutch ships have made it possible for factories to run , and Dutch ships have carried finished products to distant lands . With neither coal nor oil to drive the needed machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay toll , and the revolving wings of countless windmills transform this toll into energy . It is not astonishing that even a sterile country should , by cultivation , produce grain and stock , but it is surprising that Holland should exist , and its existence is a paradox in physical geography . A LAND CAPTURED Lao i THE SEA Frequently a visitor returning from Europe . in answer to request for news , will say . " The Dutch have taken Holland . " This reply contains more of truth than the respondent intends , for the inhabitants literally captured the land from the sea and labor unceasingly to hold their gains . That which interests the traveler more than the local scenery or the prosperity of the country is the mystery of formation and changing conditions , which is ex- plained partly by nature and partly by human industry . The ocean said to the Hollander , " You shall have no land here . " The Hollander said to the ocean , " We will have a country here " ; and they have one , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than any other region under the sun , illustrates the power of industry and perseverance , and its people have the undeniable right to look upon their work and say- , " It is good . " MAN HAS WATCHED HOLLAND GROW In other countries , when science seeks to unravel geologic problems , it examines the testimony of the rocks and reads from monuments regarding whose structure history is silent , but in Holland all is new ? the gulfs , lakes , and islands have come into existence under man 's observation . He has seen within historic times sand close a river 's mouth , land converted into water , and lakes dry up and disappear . The ordinary agencies of change wind and wave , rain and flood , and the rise and fall of land ? have here found a favoring field for their activities . Long after the greater part of the continent of Europe had become fixed and stable , Holland began its geographic formation and is still pursuing processes intended to hold or enlarge its boundaries . By the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time it first found a place and designation on the world 's charts , and following them in sequence one can note the changes that have been wrought by the action of the waters of the rivers , the waves of the sea , and the hands of man ? in short , how Holland was made . The power of the rivers one can now see in the inundations ; the action of the sea in the sand-dunes along the coast ; and the transformation by man everywhere . Before the birth of the Rhine a great part of the Netherlands , as we now see  | it . was a sea , limited on the German side by a rocky coast which now shows itself in the Tuetoburger Wald Hills . The uplifting of the Ardennes inclosed a sea in the interior of Germany which , shielded by the Alps on its southern coast and protected from the cold winds of the north , became full to overflowing from the melting ice . Finally the pent-up waters broke through , and in the bed thus formed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the waters masses of rocks were hurried along until the moving force exhausted itself ; smaller particles were carried farther , and when the sea was reached its resistance robbed the river of its final burden , and sand-dunes formed the northern boundaries of Holland . The pebbles and grains of sand on which rests the soil of Gelderland and Overyssel and the island of Texel show that their primeval home was the basalt regions of the Rhine . The result of the conflict between the waters of the rivers and the sea into which they seek to find an outlet is seen in the deltas of our largest streams . The struggles of the Danube have formed about its mouth vast tracts of marsh lands ; the Mississippi finds its way into the Gulf of Mexico through six channels , which are with great difficulty kept deep enough to carry the discharging flood ; the Nile demands a breadth of 120 miles through which to force its vacillating outlets into the Mediterranean . So Holland is the present of the Rhine ? that Rhine which rushes over the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumultuously under the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein , and beats in sonorous cadence at the foot of the Seven Mountains . THE DISSOLUTION OF A MIGHTY RIVER In its course it reflects Gothic cathedrals , princely castles , fertile hills , famous ruins , cities , groves , and gardens . But in giving up its load for the making of a state it forces its recipient to wall it in and watch with care its tortuous march to its death in the sea . Before reaching the Dutch frontier it has lost all the beauty of its banks , and flows in great , lazy curves suggestive of approaching old age . The indecision of senility is now seen in the separation of the Rhine into two parts . The main branch shamefully disavows its name and throws itself into the Meuse , a river of French origin ; the other branch , insulted by the name of Dannebrog Canal , after going nearly to Arnheim , separates into two parts , one emptying into the Zuider Zee ; the other , regaining its early name , though qualified as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it divides for the third time . One of these branches , like a fugitive from justice , changes its name and unites with the Maas near Rotterdam ; the other , still clinging to its old name , reaches with difficulty Utrecht , where for the fourth time it submits to a further partition . One part , denying its once boasted name , drags itself to Muiden , where it unites with the Zuider Zee ; the other , called the Old Rhine , flows slowly to Leyden , whose streets it languidly crosses . Then , gathered into a canal , it is carried to its death in the North Sea . A CANAL BUILT TO JOIN THE OLD RHINE TO THE SEA But this rite of decent burial is of recent origin . In the ninth century a furious storm not only drove back the waters of the Old Rhine , but threw across its channel great mountains of sand and blocked its entrance into the sea . The river lost itself partly in the sands near the coast and partly in the pools about the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opened through the dunes and the Rhine again conducted to the sea . The mouth of this canal is protected by enormous dikes and breakwaters and the sea itself is held in check by locks , or sluicegates . When the tide is high these locks are closed , to prevent the waters of the sea from invading the land ; when the tide falls they are opened , to give passage to the waters of the Rhine which have accumulated behind them , and then 3,000 cubic feet of water a minute pass out . The rivers of Holland , like all rivers whose lower reaches have but little fall , drop sediment along these lower levels , especially at their mouths . The sea has resisted this encroachment , and in retreating has continually fought to regain lost territory . It has thrown barriers across  | the river channels to make the rivers themselves destroy the land of their creation ; it has buried the rich alluvial soil fathoms deep under unproductive sands , and where it does not throw up sanddunes as a fortress against itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . VERITABLE FORTIFICATIONS PROTECT THE LAND PROM ENEMY WAVES The other rivers that have contributed to the weal and woe of Holland have been less vacillating in approaching their outlets , but equal vigilance has been needed to keep their waters from inundating the land . Dikes must be built on both banks as high and as far upstream as experience demands . Along the North Sea there are places where , owing to changing winds , the sand can not accumulate in quantities sufficient to form protecting dunes . Here seadikes must be built ? veritable fortifications . The three principal dikes of this sort are at West Capelle , near IIiddelburg ; at Fetten , near Alkmaar , and at the end of the Helder peninsula . They are built of earth , firmly packed on the sea-face , and partly paved with dressed Norway granite or Rhine basalt blocks ( p. 290 ) . Beginning at the top , the dimensions are as follows : Thirty feet across the top , on which there is a doubletrack railroad for the transportation of materials with which make repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 30 degrees for a distance of about 40 feet ; then the slope is one in three . Here the stone paving begins and extends about 50 feet . From this point for too feet a sod surface is maintained , but beyond that for Ito feet , where the forces of the stormlashed waves beat hardest , the surface is faced with stone . This carries the face to a point about three feet below high tide ; then a flat pavement is laid out to and beyond the low-water line . As a precaution , three rows of piles are driven in to hold the facing in place , and two other rows of larger piles , with their tops protruding , extend along the line where the waves are most aggressive . On the inner face the slope is more rapid and is protected by sod alone . The height of the railroad track above high water is 28 feet , and the length of the longest of these sea-dikes is about seven miles . The amount of labor required to con-  | struct such fortifications can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The piles , all of which came from other lands , cost , in place , $4 each . AMSTERDAM 'S HARBOR IS LOWER THAN THE SEA This defense is not an idle precaution . When the west winds drive the waters from the English Channel to meet those deflected by Norway 's unyielding shores , they fill up the North Sea and seek their old course across the Netherlands . Angered by man 's attempt to block the way , the persistent waters seek the vulnerable places in the face of the dike , and any negligence that allows even a single stone to remain loose is sure to pay a direful penalty . Fact and fable tell us of the disastrous results of a leak in the dike . The sluggish current of the Zuider Zee  | is a weak contestant with the remorseless tide of the North Sea . Consequently its shifting sands threatened to close up the harbor of Amsterdam and also rendered precarious the navigation out to and around the Helder . It was therefore decided some years ago to construct a ship canal directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1870 , with the sea terminus at Ijmuiden . The sea being higher at high tide than the water in the harbor at Amsterdam , it was necessary to have big locks at that end . The traffic through this canal is so great that the water let through in the locking would soon become a source of danger . The harbor of Amsterdam is , therefore . shut off from the Zuider Zee by means of dikes , with a series of locks to permit ingress and egress . Thus the canal , so necessary to Amsterdam 's prosperity , is in league with the enemy . The Haarlem lake-bed , which is the city 's kitchen-garden , drains its waters into the filling harbor , and the Zuider Zee. barred out because of its fickleness , takes  | to itself the threatening flood through sluice-gates , when wind and tide are favorable , and at other times through the service of enormous pumps over the protecting dike . POLDERS VARY IN SIZE FROM SMALL PLOTS TO 40,000 ACRES It is not the sea alone that calls for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embankments high enough to overtop the highest incoming tide , for twice every clay these outlets become estuaries of the sea , and the land would be covered by the invading brackish water if it were not for the dike-like banks . The farmers frequently build their dwelling-houses under the lee of these banks , and from the deck of a passing steamboat one can literally look down the  | chimney , though he may hardly , as some have claimed , see what the farmer 's wife is cooking for his dinner . The Dutch word polder is a term applied to any area of land protected by an encircling dike and drained by its own system of pumps . Some of these are barely below the general level and need only a slight embankment ; such are usually of firm soil , and after the removal of the water become arable fields . Others were originally ponds or lakes , or deposits of wet muck which have to be inclosed by more substantial embankments , and the removal of the water in the first instance as well as subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two or three acres to 40,000 acres and they lie from a few inches below the level of the sea to 1S feet below it . The former were drained by single windmills , while in the latter cases strong dikes were required and the best pumping machinery kept in operation for years . The interior of each polder is cut with ditches and canals , which conduct the drainage to the point where pumps are established to lift the water over the bank into the encircling canal . In summer droughts the reverse process brings in a bountiful supply of water for irrigation purposes . THE WATERS HAVE GREATLY MODIFIED THE MAP OF ' HOLLAND In the Rhineland district there are 90,000 acres of land which would be under water still were it not for the skill , capital , and energy of the doughty Dutch warriors . And there are even now within the borders of Holland thousands of acres of first-rate mud aching to contribute toward the making of Dutch cheese for the foreign markets , but their existence is smothered by the same thousands of acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers itching to feel the guilders that would come in exchange for the cheeses thus produced . In time the government will set about to relieve the aching and the itching and the names now attached to ponds and lakes will appear as prefixes to polders . North Holland has undergone great changes in its water-washed boundaries as well as in its interior character . Even going no further back than 1288 and ac- cepting as reasonably accurate the map of that date , we can trace , century by century , if not year by year , the fortunes of the constant war with the waters . By 1775 the outward form had changed somewhat , while the interior had melted so rapidly that the feeling became general that determined efforts should be made to prevent further wasting . These efforts were at first precautionary , the war being wholly on the defensive . The holding of the streams in check , keeping them within their proper channels , allowed some of the marshes to become dry . This gain of land whetted the people 's appetite for more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shallow lakes , which had now become isolated . The Beemster Lake was drained by the use of 44 windmills , which , after two years ' constant operation , converted this body of water into a polder of 28 square miles . Its rim dike is more than 20 miles in length and the land within lies at a uniform depth of 16 feet below the level of the sea . This protecting rim serves also as a wind brake , and the forward vegetation in the early summer proves that within the basin the climate is milder than it is without . The most important change wrought by man upon the face of Holland was the drying up of the Haarlem Lake . This lake , or , as it was called , this sea , had been formed by the joining of four smaller lakes and enlarged by frequent inundations until it attained a circumference of 37 miles . The soil of its shores was very fertile and so readily dissolved by water that no prediction could be made as to which way or to what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zee , through a branch known as Het Ij , vessels could enter it and pass from shore to shore . At one time fleets of 70 ships had fought upon the lake and on more than one occasion storms have strewn its banks with wrecks . Fortunately sand-dunes skirted its western shore ; but for these the lake would have joined the North Sea and North Holland would have become an island . The friable character of the banks and the fierce winds that ruffled its surface  | made it necessary for the people near at hand to be always on the defensive . As early as 1643 a Dutch engineer , Jan Adriaanszoon Leeghwater , published in book form a detailed plan for the draining of this lake . At this time Holland was too much engaged in the war with Spain to undertake a work so extensive and so fraught with difficulties as this was conceded to be . The political complications following the peace of 1684 and the war between England and prance caused Leeghwater 's project to be forgotten . DESTRUCTIVE STORM AWAKENED HOLLANDERS TO ENGINEERING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delayed partly because of the many rival plans submitted and partly because of the great cost of the undertaking . However , the authorities were suddenly awakened to the danger coming from this foe within by the storms of 1836 . On November 9th a violent west wind drove the waters of the lake into the streets of Amsterdam . They swept over one polder after another and covered dikes and roads and even bridges . On Christmas Day a fierce east wind arose and did not rest until a part of Leyden was inundated . When the inventory of the damage was made it was found that 100,000 acres of land had been under water and 18,000 acres of polder completely filled . An entire year was consumed in freeing the submerged lands and great losses were found to have resulted from the overflow . This was the final provocation . The challenge was accepted . In 1839 the States General decided to attack this enemy and placed the entire matter in the hands of a commission of 13 members .  | It would be interesting to the engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally adopted . English engines were employed , and the II pumps at each of the three stations raised at every stroke more than 2,000 cubic feet of water , while the total output of all the pumps in 24 hours was more than 1,000 tons . At first only one station was equipped , fearful was the commission that the performance of the engines and pumps ould not come up to their expectations . It worked alone for 11 months , during which time the level of the lake was lowered only 5 1/2 inches . The other two stations began in April , 1849 , and in July , 1852 , the lake was dry , the work having consumed 39 months instead of 14 , as at first contemplated . In this time 946,000,000 tons of water had been removed . A gridiron system of canals , with a total length of 750 miles , furnishes the interior drainage with skirting roads for a length of 140 miles . The level of the land in the polder is 14 feet below the water outside . The completion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several medals . The one struck by the government contained in Latin the inscription : " Haarlem Lake , after having for centuries assailed the surrounding fields to enlarge itself by their destruction , conquered at last by machinery , has returned to Holland its 44,280 acres of invaded land . " BOTTOM OF LAKE CONVI.RTED INTO CHOICEST LAND These acres are now occupied by about 12,000 people , and their products are the choicest of the land . In this vast plain , so recently the bottom of a navigable lake , straight roads are bordered with trees , substantial and even elegant farmhouses are seen on every hand , periodical cattle markets are held , the motor bus makes its stated trips , a steamboat plies on the en-  | circling canal , grain mills are at work , and life within the polder is independent of that without . The commission was well within the bounds of modesty when , after recounting the material benefits resulting from this work , closed its report with these words : " But this is not all . We have driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy ; we have at the same time augmented the means for defending our capital in time of war . " We have conquered a province in combat without tears and without blood , where science and genius took the place of generals and where workmen were the worthy soldiers . " They might have added : " And where wooden shoes and quinine were invaluable allies . " MIDGET WINDMILLS ACT AS SENTINELS The land that is lower than the sea becomes so saturated with moisture that it must be drained in order to be productive . This drainage is primarily into ditches ; but , the water of the sea being higher , there can be no direct outlet ; hence the water from the ditches must be raised by artificial means high enough to run through well-guarded sluice-gates into the sea . In the three-sevenths of the entire territory that is below sea-level , ditches form the dividing line between farms . When these become full , the water is pumped by windmill power into larger ditches , having higher banks , and from these into another still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet to the sea . The first lifting is done by private parties , but when larger areas are interested in the prompt handling of the water , it is in the hands of the government , and steam pumps are employed . As you travel through Holland you will frequently see windmills so small that you will be inclined to think they are toys . Not so . They are sentinels . With vanes outstretched , they are always in the wind and ready to respond just as soon as they are thrown into gear . This is done by a wooden float resting on the water in the ditch beneath . The rising water lifts the float , and when it reaches a height which threatens to submerge the surrounding fields the machine is thrown into gear , and its revolving wings warn the farmer to start his pumps and keep them going until his truthful ally , by coming to rest , tells him that the danger is past . This entire question of drainage , the conduct of rivers to the sea , and the protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Affairs . So important is this department that it might with justice be called the Ministry of Outward Defense and Inward Expansion . The visitor to Holland is apt to think that all of the windmills which one sees are for freeing the land from water Hundreds and even thousands know no other service in this land " Which rides at anchor and is moor 'd , Where people do not live , but go aboard , " but there are others which furnish the power for sawmills , so plentiful in this shipbuilding country , or drive machinery for the extraction of oil , for grinding grain , or crushing stone . If one wants to see Holland on its windmill side , one should go to Zaandam and look upon its famous 400 and enjoy the way in which their proud owners , in a lavish use of strong colors , seem to catch just the right tones to go with the gray-blue haze that so often hangs over the lowlands . WATER MUST BE FOUGHT UNDERGROUND , TOO The war with the watery element is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superabundance of water is encountered and the building itself must rest upon piles . It is fascinating to watch a pile-driver at work ? to see it swing a log into place and then with stroke after stroke drive it home , while a steam-pump industriously strives to keep out the seeping water . The piles are placed in rows , like the teeth of a comb ; then the tops are sawed off at the same level , tenon cut on them , and great horizontal sleepers mortised fast . The space between these beams is filled with cement and the whole covered with a heavy flooring , but the pump must keep up its monotonous throbbing . On this  | floor the brick walls are erected , and later a six-story building stands on wooden feet . When will the pumping cease ? Never . Under the building there is a catch-basin , and when it becomes full it must be emptied , and this will be often , because the canal at its side is higher than the basement floor . No wonder that Diderot was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE RABBIT IS A DANGEROUS FOE The sea has had its allies also , two in number , both living , and , though man 's inferior in strength and genius , they , by their rapid increase , are dangerous foes . The sand-dunes which are thrown up along the seacoast form protecting hills ; but as free sand they shift so much and so rapidly that if unrestrained they may leave a vulnerable spot unprotected or bury productive land under a blighting mass . It therefore becomes necessary to check the migrations of these shifting ridges , and this is done by planting upon their sides a sort of reed grass . This grows quite rapidly under the injunction , with a penalty attached , " Do not pull the grass , " and very soon their roots , forming a sort of vegetable cement , aid in holding in place its nourishing soil . But these same roots are tempting tillbits for the burrowing rabbits , which open insidious small tunnels that are dangerous as opening wedges . It becomes necessary to make war on this ally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage before it is too late . The other foe is the dreaded teredo , or borer of the sea . It appears rarely , it is true . but in such numbers and is so destructive that commissions of learned specialists have been appointed to study its life-history and to devise means for protecting timber from its attack . About the middle of the last century it was discovered that a shellfish was industriously perforating submerged piles and wharf timbers . A hasty examination showed that at many places the very bulwarks of Holland 's safety were honeycombed . The discovery of this condition threw the country into dismay . Its continuance meant destruction , while ignorance of anv preventive stimulated the fear that the worst possible calamity was at hand . Fortunately , the means which were taken to protect the piles undesignedly assisted in the extermination of the pest . Large-headed nails were driven into the wood so close together that they practically gave to it a coat of mail . But chemistry was more potent than physics , for the oxides from the rusting nails were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , where its exposed condition soon resulted in death . however , they have reappeared , and caution has kept the more important piles covered with a copper sheathing . Along the dikes of Friesland enough copper has been used for this purpose to cover practically the entire dike . A worm had made 1 lolland tremble ? a triumph denied to the tempests of the ocean and the anger of Philip of Spain . THE SEA AS AN ALLY AS WELL AS A FOE If the sea has been Holland 's foe it has also been an opportune ally . In 1574 the Spaniards , led by Valdez , laid siege to Leyden . In a short time the volunteer defenders of the city were completely cut off by the besiegers , who built 6o forts to command every possible means of egress by sea or land , and Leyden was isolated and helpless . But its courageous people did not lose heart . William of Orange had sent them word to hold out for three months , within which time he would come to their assistance , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile within the city walls provisions began to grow scarce , and the circle of the besiegers became tighter day by day . William , who occupied the fortress near Delft , seeing no other way to succor the city , conceived the design of raising the siege of Leyden by cutting the dikes of the Ijssel and the Maas and driving out the Spaniards by water , since it could not be done by arms . This desperate design was forthwith put into execution . The dikes were broken in 6o places , the sluice-gates at Gouda and Amsterdam were opened , and the sea invaded the land . A fleet of 200 barges followed the inflowing tide , the  | amphibious Zealanders routed such Spaniards as resisted this novel water attack , and the power of Spain in the Netherlands was broken for all time . The people of Holland have never forgotten the effective assistance of the onrushing waters , and all who look upon the City Hall of Leyden will be reminded of the fact by the inscription over the right-hand door that the good city for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative of Holland 's incessant war with the sea mention has been made of successes only . Unfortunately , there have been periods of reverses . More than once a terrific deluge , which is a part of every Dutchman 's to-morrow , has swept along the valley of the Rhine , the Ijssel , and the Maas , and even from the sea itself . In a single clay the revengeful waters have carried away twenty , thirty , and even forty thousand lives . Of those prior to the eighteenth century we have only traditional accounts , but faithful and voluminous reports have been published of the terrible flood which occurred in 1776 along the valley of the Overyssel . At that time many were drowned and property to the value of millions was destroyed . In 1775 the waters of the Maas were driven back by a violent westerly storm until they overflowed the locks at Delf shaven and laid waste the populous plains surrounding Delft . The entire western coast was strewn with wrecked villages , Enkhuizen and Texel were under water , and Ioo , 000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON MOUNDS There is one piece of Holland soil from hich even Dutch determination does not strain the invading waters ? one battleground which for generations has been held under tribute by the foe . It is the Island of Marken , in the Zuider Zee , about a dozen miles from Amsterdam . This island , detached from the mainland in the thirteenth century , lies out of the ordinary routes of travel ; hence its inhabitants have perpetuated the quaint costumes and queer customs that prevailed when their land became an island . The ground is barely above the water at high tide , so that any unusual storm would sweep completely over such protecting dikes as the people could afford to build . With characteristic shrewdness , they long ago counted the cost of such fortifications as the exposed position would necessitate and wisely concluded that the ground at stake would not justify the expenditure . They therefore dug such canals as would drain the soil tinder ordinary conditions . and used the earth thus obtained in building hillocks on which houses are erected . On seven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the silent home of the ( lead . The buildings that are not so favorably situated with respect to the highest point of the hill are built on stilts , the lower story being merely framework and only the upper part occupied . A gangway connects with adjacent houses , so that in case of an overflow isolation can not be complete . When the plan , already agreed upon , to drain the greater part of the Zuider Zee is executed , Marken will be a part of a polder with such close connection with the mainland and its conventionalities that its side-show character will probably disappear . HARDSHIPS IIAVE MOLDED THE IIOLL , AxDER 'S CLIARACTER In most countries wealth begets idleness . In Holland , never . A little crevice in the dike , unnoticed for a few hours , might permit the devastation of a district , and even with the most watchful care the possessions of one clay are no guarantee of the wealth of the next . When one community is rejoicing over its escape from an inundation , the people near by may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus one sympathizes with the other . This possibility of a coming misfortune makes every one generous , and the hundreds of charitable institutions in Holland prove that this generosity assumes tangible form . " Have no fear for Amsterdam , " said Louis XIS ' ; " I firmly believe Providence will save her because of her benevolence to the poor . " When the surging waters approach dangerously near the vulnerable points  | of an important dike , every shovelful of earth must count ; the opposing forces must be placed and used to the best advantage , and safety is assured only when obedience is obtained . Discipline is therefore a shining Dutch trait . The inhabitants of a country are , in a large measure , molded by external influences . They respond to their local environment . And the geography of their country is a preface to its history , as well as a key to the understanding of the people 's habits , genius , and institutions .
