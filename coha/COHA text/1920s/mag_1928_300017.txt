Alarmed , peppery little Senator Carter Glass of Virginia sent a telegram to Manhattan . Reassuring , lively little Chairman John J. Raskob of the Democracy telegraphed back : " The story of Jack Johnson being authorized to speak on behalf of the Democratic National Committee is cheap Republican propaganda . Johnson has no connection with this committee in any capacity . " <P> Mr. Johnson , onetime ( 1908-15 ) world 's champion heavyweight pugilist , is working locally for the Democrats . Last December he was made a Democratic Committeeman in the Second Ward of Chicago . The theory was that he , one of the most famed Negroes of all time , could do much toward organizing the Chicago Black Belt the way Harlem had been organized by the New York Democrats . <P> In January , Committeeman Johnson reported to TIME : <P> " We ... are glad to state that we are meeting with wonderful success . Members are coming in daily , glad for a chance to receive their long delayed political justice . <P> " Knowing as they do the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to our organization , far beyond our most sanguine expectations . <P> " I shall in the future as in the past do my full duty to my country and my race . " <P> Political speculators wondered how Black Jack Democrat 's " sanguine expectations " might have been affected by Little John Democrat 's somewhat insulting denial of any connection between them .
