A MIRROR FOR WITCHES - Esther Forbes-Houghton Mifflin ( $2.50 ) . Child of witches burned in Brittany , Bilby 's Doll is haunted in Salem by the stench of their burning flesh , remembers their Black Masses , and says the Lord 's Prayer backward . Thereupon the impish child is accused of withering the fruit of her foster-mother 's womb , and of casting a fatal ailment upon her beloved foster-father . When God ignores her challenge that He restore this good man 's life , she believes herself indeed a witch , and sets herself weirdly to learning the trade . Straws and hairs and fingernails are stuff for fantastic poppets ; Ahab , the neighbor Thumb 's bull is fit to make a virile familiar . In answer to her prayers that the Prince of Darkness send her a tutor in the black arts , there appears nightly a demon disguised in the swarthy skin and gold hooped earrings of a pirate . <P> At her trial for witchcraft ( Increase Mather and many another divine officiating ) , an old medicine woman swears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hell , was none other than her earthly son . Doll of course denies his earthliness , swears it is carnal knowledge of a fiend she has , and convicts herself of her witchcraft . <P> Neurotics are the favorite topic of dreary modern fiction . Bilby 's Doll is a neurotic whose hallucinations are logically built upon the terrific shock of her childhood . But the lore of her witchcraft , and the superstitions of her New England neighbors , lift her out of the psychiatric laboratory into the worthy realm of fiction . Author Forbes formalizes her fantastics with a prose borrowed in part from the 17th century when witches were common subject of puritanical debate .
