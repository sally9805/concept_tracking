Bigger than Barnum 's ( Ralph Lewis-Viola Dana ) . The story has probably been told before of the tight-rope walker who displayed his talent in private life and rescued a beleaguered heroine . This particular walker walked a telegraph wire into a burning building to complete the rescue . Previously he had refused to perform a certain difficult stunt in the circus and was branded a coward . The circus scenes are fair , the climax exciting , and the whole picture dangerously close to average . <P> Men of Steel ( Milton Sills-Doris Kenyon ) . The pictorial possibilities of the steel mills are boldly seized upon by this endeavor and frittered away on a silly story . Mr. Sills plays a worker who assumes the blame for a murder , committed by the girl he loves . He escapes to the East and takes up his trade in other mills . The story follows him . The blistering scenery of steel manufacture surrounds the slothful narrative impressively . Perhaps the story might be eliminated and the remains be used for a two-reel educational . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star of the open spaces has a great horse and a terrible sense of plot . He is employed in an old-fashioned howler about the gang of desperadoes trying to do the old father out of his ranch . The young son comes back from the war , congressional medal and all , just in time . There is also a girl and a beautiful white horse . The latter is good enough even to make Tom Mix 's Tony jealous . <P> Mantrap . Sinclair Lewis may refuse the Pulitzer Prize but he does not object to the butchery of his literature in pictures . It is to be supposed that Mr. Lewis contrived his latest story with some care and regards it with some pride . In the movies it comes out as just one more of those dull afternoons . The story tells of a lawyer in a lonely north woods town . He engages in a flirtation with a lovely lady who has once been a manicurist in Minneapolis but is now the wife of one of the best inhabitants of Mantrap .
