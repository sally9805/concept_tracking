txt America ' has many associations of scientists and men of letters , of scholars in this field of learning and in that , but she has one society devoted to the recognition and promotion of scholarship in general . That organization which had its modest origin in the year of the Declaration of Independence in America 's oldest college , after Harvard , William and Mary College , in Williamsburg , Va. , is known as " Phi Beta Kappa " ; and whatever the significance of those three Greek initial letters was to the young men who met in Raleigh Tavern and formed the first chapter in 1776 , they have come to stand for the highest aspiration and achievement in the humanities . Though this initial chap I ter 's life . was suspended for years because of the vicissitudes and closing of the college , it gave life to chapters in other colleges and in its own resurrection finds itself the parent of nearly a hundred chapters whose representatives meet today in New York for their triennial conference . While in the early ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its proceedings , that practice has long since ceased . Its membership is openly recruited from the students of highest rank In the higher classes or the universities and colleges , year after year , and from graduates who by reason of their surpassing achievements in their post-collegiate , days are deemed worthy of inclusion with those who proved their excellence  --  or at any rate gave promise of it  --  in their college days . Those who are chosen on the- basis of their scholarly record in college and of its promise do not always , to be sure , fulfill the prophecy of their record ; . but taken as a body it will be found that Phi Beta Kappa ' men and women have contributed more to society than any other group of like size . : raven according to the " Who 's Who " standard , the Phi Beta Kappa men have the best chance of success , whatever - their fields or . activity . It has been found to be true , statistically , also of men of science , that those who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in their scientific subjects have a better chance of success as leaders in science than those who neglected part of their courses in order to specialize . But the values of scholarly pursuits are not to be measured in these terms alone , nor in the successes of the contemporaneous years . What is contended is that the satisfactions of sound and pure Scholarship are the highest that can come to the intellect of man , and that without the recognition and encouragement of scholarship by a democracy Its common life will descend to lower levels . The uniting of these scattered chapters in promoting scholarship becomes , thus , a patriotic service of the highest order . It is an unpropitious moment that these representatives of American culture have chosen to come to New York City . They will see democracy in one of its worst phases in the Billingsgate exchange that is going on in a local campaign , ' but they will also be made keenly aware that what they are urging is more than ever needed . Their symbol is the golden key , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that by due steps aspire To lay their just hands on that golden key . and will welcome their " pure ambrosial " culture .
