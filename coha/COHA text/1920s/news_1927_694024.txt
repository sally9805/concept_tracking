txt While the main development today at the tri-power conference for limitation of naval armaments was the lining-up of Great Britain , Japan and the United States against the program recently framed in Paris to make France the world 's strongest submarine power , interest remains centred upon the British cruiser figures , which leaked out of the committee room yesterday and which tha.experts now admit were practically correct . Next Wednesday , instead of Tues-1 day , has now been set for resuming discussion of this subject , the change having been made in order to give the British delegation more time to reconsider their proposals . If they insist then upon seventy-eight cruisers aggregating 600,000 tons as " necessary for their needs , " thus doubling the maximum figures offered by the United States , all the 16-inch guns of the American delegations will be turned upon them . On this point , in the opinion of Many here , W. C. Bridgeman , First Lord of the Admiralty and head of the British delegation , has just about as much chance of persuading ' Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has of budging Gibraltar . Hint of American Compromise . " This stubborn American , " as he has been called , who is head of the United States delegation and Chairman of the conference , intends to remain just as firm on this point as he Was earlier in the meeting in the matter of capital ship revision-7even if such a stand should mean a conference smash . An able interpreter of his opinions today voiced the situation in the following words : " We shall make no speeches at the final plenary session of this conference congratulating ourselves and each other and the world at large upon our ' happy agreement ' if the treaty then to be signed contains such canting hypocrisy . " However , he then indicated that if the British , on the other hand , would abandon their present position the United States might agree to a slight increase in her maximum figures that would permit Great Britain to retain most of the cruiser tonnage she now owns , about 380,000 tons . If the British then insisted on having cruisers of 7,500 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program for 10,000 , he added . In that case a striking memoranda would be presented to the American public showing why such super-cruisers were necessary for American protection . An American argument being used against British cruiser-needs is that what Great Britain really means when she mentions her " far-flung " sea routes is protection of her commerce rather than of her food supply . It is contended that in*case ? of war with the United States Great Britain could easily keep her food channels open via the Continent , or in case of war with the Continent the same operation could be effected from the United States . Committee-Room Leak Investigated .. The daily leakage of information giving the experts ' figures has been investigated . The Chairman of the committee is British . The Americans asked at the outset of the meetings that the press be admitted " in order to avoid misunderstandings . " It was explained that the doors of Mr. Gibson 's headquarters swung both ways and that the Americans had nothing to conceal . Both Great Britain and Japan objected and are now considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans . French afternoon newspapers have been the first to publish the figures , always a few hours after the cora- mittee adjourns , but Commandant de Leuze , the French representative , made an indignant denial today that the information came from him , wiring the American headquarters to explain that such an act was always furthest from his thoughts . Details of French Submarine Plans . Which brings us back to today 's submarine parley ? vitally important to France , inasmuch as the experts now seem to have agreed to limit the size of sue hcraft to 600 tons for defense and 1,600 tons for the larger type . Thus , if in the face of these three great powers France persists in her present program , the onus of moral turpitude may rest upon her . Tgs NEW Yorac Truss is now able to present for the first time the complete French program  --  the actual French submarine fleet and that authorized  --  totaling 115,000 tons , against the 90,000 tons laid down in the proposals of the United States . The French figures are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 800 and 950 tons ; four of 750 tons each ; four of 3,000 tons each ; two of 3,250 each ; nineteen between 1,200 and 1,600 tons each ; twenty-four authorized , totaling 32,318 tons , and sixteen authorized , totaling 14,097 tons . This makes a grand aggregate of about 115,000 tons , with a total of ninety boats . In addition , the French have begun to build one submarine cruiser larger than anything of its kind ever launched , all the figures are as yet supposed to be secret , but estimates give the largest French under-water craft a cruising radius of 25,000 miles and an ability to remain at sea for a couple of months , thus making France a formidable potential threat to any other power . It is now suggested that in view of the present attitude of the conference , France may decide that it would have been better to have accepted America 's invitation to attend as a full member rather than to send an observer .               @ @ @ @ @ @
