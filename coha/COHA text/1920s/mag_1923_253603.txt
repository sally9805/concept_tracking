" We want a Flemish university . ' ' For a century that cry has been in the hearts of the Flemish , 3,000,000 of them , three-sevenths of the popution of Belgium . By recent vote of the Belgian Parliament , the Flemish language will replace French at the University of Ghent , and the 3,000,000 rejoice in their emancipation from the tyranny of a foreign language . <P> Flemish was the language of a great culture . It was the language of Charles V , Rubens , Van Dyck , Teniers , Reynaert the Fox and a hundred other immortals . But political troubles , culminating in the inclusion of the Flemings ( Lowlanders ) in the new Belgian state ( 1830 ) , drove the language from power . Says a correspondent of The New York Times : " Political leaders have feared that popular intellectual development would make the Flemish less docile , but now , partly as a result of the war , they have been forced to restore the University of Ghent to its cultural heirs . The Flemish have their university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make it easier for every young Fleming to acquire an education . "
