BLACK SUNLIGHT-Earl Rossman - Oxford University Press ( $1.75 ) . With so many bold men preparing these spring days to explore by air over the icy wastes of the Polar Sea , this journalistic account of life on the upper fringes of Alaska makes a well-timed appearance . As Explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson agrees in the preface , it is a good kind of introduction to " the friendly Arctic " for folk who have never been there , since Author Rossman was a tenderfoot when he took his cinema cameras to the Eskimo village of Wainwright* and settled down for the hard winter of 1923-24 . An able newspaperman , Rossman put in his diary , and has here expanded , facts and fresh impressions which an habitue of the North might have omitted as commonplace : that an Alaskan city was called Nome when , in 1849 , an Admiralty draftsman misread the notation " Name ? " ; that the <P> Malamute Saloon , brought to fame by Rhymster Robert W. Service , still functions tamely ; that igloos are seldom built of snow , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onetime U. S. education chief for Alaska , got the Eskimos started in the reindeer industry , of which Carl Lomen is king ; that there is said to be a mountain of jade in the wild hinterland ; that Eskimo seamstresses wear their teeth to the gums chewing deerhide into shape ; that whaling parties will travel afoot 30 miles out on the unevenly frozen ocean hunting for open leads to watch for a blowing bowhead ; that flocks of duck , whose northward flight beyond Barrow is strong evidence of land in the Arctic " blind-spot , " fly so thickly and so low that the natives can lasso them with weighted strings ; that the last suicidal migration of the Alas kan lemmings* was in 1888 ; that , protected against unmitigated sunshine glaring on ice and snow only by crude wooden masks or slit leather straps , the endless days are nights for many snow-blind Eskimos , days of black sunlight ; that the Eskimo appetite is prodigious , measurable only by the amount of food available ; that thieving is unknown among them ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all to sit stripped to the buff ; that if land is ever discovered beyond Barrow , and utilized for an aero base , Manhattan may be within two days and a half of Tokyo . Besides such statistics , human interest , personalities , abound . The one maddening thing is , that for a book written by a camera man , this one is most stingily illustrated . <P> <P> * Near Point Barrow , northernmost settlement in the Americas and base of the current Detroit Arctic expedition under Captain George H.
