On Oct. 23 , 1929 , the New York Curb listed 1,227,392 preferred shares and 7,477,392 common shares of Blue Ridge Corp. , investment trust sponsored by Harrison Williams and by Goldman , Sachs &; Co . As the same date is more memorable as opening day for greatest market crash in history , unfortunate has been Blue Ridge 's Curb career . In retrospect , indeed , the history both of Blue Ridge and of Shenandoah Corp. , companion investment trust formed by the same interests , appears somewhat ironic . In August , Blue Ridge had announced a policy of exchanging its shares for shares of other corporations , had thus indirectly endorsed such quotations as 238 for U. S. Steel , 395 for General Electric , 349 for Detroit Edison . In September Shenandoah had announced an intensive selling campaign by which Shenandoah and Goldman Sachs Trading Corp . shares would be sold to small investors . Yet potent and prosperous appeared , last summer , both Blue Ridge and Shenandoah . Their securities and the securities in their portfolios* were rising harmoniously together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sidney Weinberg . Waddill Catchings . Nobody realized that these were almost the last two investment trust rabbits to be pulled out of the prosperity hat . <P> Then the Market broke and with it broke Blue Ridge and Shenandoah . Blue Ridge common went from a high of 29 ? to a low of 3 . Shenandoah went from 39 ? to 6 ? . Furthermore , the first of the year was rapidly approaching-a significant period at which the Market break would be clearly reflected in investment trusts ' reports of operations . Many a market student anticipated a severe January slump in investment trust securities . <P> Last week , however , Blue Ridge and Shenandoah sponsors gave first aid to their injured . To Blue Ridge was sold a large block of Central States Electric at a price considerably below the market . Seller , number of shares and price were not announced . But Blue Ridge assets showed a November appreciation of $12,000,000 and Central States on the day of the sale closed at 28 . One method of giving Blue Ridge a $12,000,000 profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States at 16 ( 12 points below the market ) . As to the seller , Harrison Williams ' control of Central States and part sponsorship of Blue Ridge indicated him as Angel . <P> Shenandoah was permitted to purchase . for retirement , 765,200 shares of its own $50 preferred shares at a price considerably below its current $35 quotation . As a result of their favorable refinancing , both corporations closed last week with assets per share not far removed from their original assets-per-share figure . <P> *Besides large holdings in Goldman Sachs Trading Corp. , Central States Electric and Blue Ridge , Chief Shenandoah investments last fall included : American Tel . &; Tel. , Commercial Investment Trust , Consolidated Gas of Baltimore , Electric Investors ( now merged with Electric Bond &; Share ) , Hydro-Electric Securities Co. , Southern California Edison , Pacific Gas &; Electric , Pacific Lighting , North American Co.
