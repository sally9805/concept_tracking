On the low , grassy hills of Jugoslavia , shepherds have lounged for centuries , watching the smoke curl up from far-away villages and amusing themselves with strange , melancholy songs , gentle and careless as their flocks . To peasants who have often heard these songs , sounding far away and faint through a whole summer night or winding along the high paths in the twilight , they remain the most pervasive of all music . One such peasant is famed Michael Idvorsky Pupin , who long ago immigrated to the U. S. to become an electrical engineer and professor of mechanics ( Columbia ) . He , with Croatian Violinist Zlatko Balokovic , last year offered a prize of 52,000 dinars ( about $5,000 ) for a musical composition based on Jugoslavian themes and designed for the violin with orchestral accompaniment . <P> Last week the judges , Rubin Goldmark , U. S. composer , and Ernest Henry Schelling , U. S. pianist , awarded this prize to one Bozidar Kunc .. Composer Kunc had concocted a short concerto in two movements , the first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance which utilized folk melodies . Hitherto unheard of , Composer Kunc was discovered to be a native of Zagreb , capital of Croatia . His concerto will be heard publicly for the first time in October when Violinist Balokovic will play it in Berlin . Thereafter it will occupy a place on 66 programs with which Violinist Balokovic will tour European cities .
