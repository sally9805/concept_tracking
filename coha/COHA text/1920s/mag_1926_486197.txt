0NCE MORE THE UNYIELDING MAN in the White House has shown that he can be turned and twisted like any town alderman . On December 9 Mr. Coolidge wrote to the editors of the Array and Navy Journal , in reply to that journal 's insistent demand for more cruisers , that " my views are epitomized in the annual message and budget message presented to Congress this week . I am Convinced the estimates submitted provide adequately for the services ; and economic ! administration will . . . maintain the navy in a high state of efficiency . " The day this letter appeared in the press the strong man was waited upon by members of the House Naval Affairs ' Committee , whereupon he forgot all about his messages , " economic " administration , his program of economy , and his pledge to stand by the budget estimates , and consented not only to the three cruisers which he himself had held up since 1924 but also to a new program for building ten more new cruisers at the enormous cost of $105,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to Mr. Coolidge sudden/y  --  convinced him that we were dropping to fourth place in the cruiser race ; at any rate he who declared on December 7 that " No navy in the world , with one exception , approaches ours and none surpasses it , " and on December 8 that to begin work on even three cruisers " would be unfortunate at this time and not in keeping withour attitude toward these disarmament negotiations " has joined the ballyhoo for international competition in cruisers . It is stated that this is to be a warning to Great Britain and Japan that " the. , united State 's r fo'lieep pace with them . " Which re  --  mincli us iliatAf Was " CaSirin Coolidge who on October 26 , 1925 , at ( ) Inaba , declaind that vin spite of all arguments ill fayoi ir-eat if4litaty , : fgrees  --  no nation ever had an army rarge renailertO guarantee it against attack in time of peace or to insure its victory in time of war . " The President , evidently , has neither the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own policies . B EFORE THE FALL-DOHENY acquittal fades out of the public mind we must protest against the assumption that the Executive or any of his assistants has the right to withhold facts from any court whatsoever . The Executive has the constitutional right to withhold from Congress information the publication of which it deems inimical to the public welfare , but we have never heard that an official has the right to conceal facts when they are demanded by a court in a regular judicial procedure . That the judge in the Fall-Doheny case refused to insist upon the production of the Gleaves documents upon which the alleged Japanese war scare was based reflects gravely upon his conduct of the case besides establishing a precedent which lawyers must recognize as extremely dangerous . It is an unfortunate coincidence that Secretary Wilbur , who took this high-handed position , comes from the same California town in which Doheny was a leading figure when Mr. Wilbur began his career ; that he was only recently chief justice of California makes his action still more regrettable . The suppression of the Gleaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen more cruisers can only have unfortunate echoes in Japan . T HE SITUATION AS TO MEXICO hourly grows more serious . Secretary Kellogg threatens that if President Calles does not yield before January 1 the United States will withdraw recognition , raise the embargo on the export of arms to Mexico , and refuse all American credits . This means a deliberate effort to overthrow a neighboring government . Lifting the arms embargo can only mean that the Government intends to look with a blind eye upon expeditions against Mexico organized in America . Such action is sure to rally the Mexicans to Galles and to put him in a stronger position than he now holds . Instead of toppling him , as intended , it might make him impregnable . Still worse for the American oil interests  --  whose obedient ally Mr. Kellogg , erstwhile prosecutor of the Standard Oil , has now become  --  may be the reaction from such a policy . It may lead , in retaliation , to still more radical action against their properties . Overthrow of Calles , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might satisfy Mr. Kellogg and Mr. Sheffield , but would hardly produce dividends on Mexican oil holdings . Stockholders may well contrast the defiant American attitude with the acceptance of the new order by some of the English oil companies . If the American oil men are wise they will decide before the New Year to follow suit . ET US BEGIN THE NEW YEAR with a vote of thanks to the Senate for defeating on a point of order Gen-eral Andrews 's request for a $500,000 appropriation for his " under-cover men " in the prohibition-enforcement army . This money was intended to be used secretly , and without accounting , for government spies , go-betweens , and agents provocateurs . We are for honest enforcement of the Vol-stead Act as long as it is on the statute-books  --  in contrast to our good Clarence Darrow , who wishes to kill it by civil disobedifqiCe . ? But : ivehavemo iiidre use for underhand spy work , han.anybodY- 61 ? 6 . In the p. rohibition battle it is , ? first of pn ; ziniqct , ssarys:betgase. , tpere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second place , this secret underhand spying is almost always undertaken by scoundrels or by men who , if they are not scoundrels when they begin , speedily become so . It is almost on a par with the most degrading police practice of all  --  the paying of policemen to cohabit with street women and then to prosecute them . We want General Andrews to show that the government is superior to the bootleggers and their criminal tribe ; but as a beginning let the government itself be above the dirty business of the snooper and the spy . W E HOPE that the Senate will now promptly ratify two treaties  --  that abolishing poison gas and the pact with Turkey . Senator Borah has thrown himself into the fight for the former with courage and determination . In the face of protests from the American Legion and many chemists  --  all of whom were doubtless horrified when Germany began her " barbarous " chemical warfare ? General Pershing , as the fair , honest , and just fighter he is known to be , has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other nations in barring poison gas we shall make hypocritical our insistence that we are for genuine disarmament . As for the treaty with Turkey , that does nothing more than ratify the existing status and simplify it by permitting the resumption of regular diplomatic relations . We are aware that men and women of conscience oppose ratification on sincerely held grounds . They see in acceptance of the treaty approval of all the acts of past and present Turkish governments of which public opinion disapproves . We can not agree , and the majority of the Americans living and working in Turkey as ' business men or missionaries also favor ratification . The best way for the United States to aid Turkey to the right kind of position in the family of nations is to enter into those treaty relations which make for peace and give us an opportunity to influence Turkey as a friend . G ERMANY 'S MINORITY CABINET has been forced out . It was a " center coalition , " and could carry on only when the Socialists on the Left or the Nationalists on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoroughgoing Right orientation while the Socialists denounced it for tolerating the secret enlargement of the Reichswehr disclosed in the recent Feme trials . Readers of The Nation will recall Louis Fischer 's article , Is Germany Disarmed ? in our issue of October 20 . Secret organizations of reactionaries have drilled openly in Germany ; real republicans have been barred from the army of the German Republic by its monarchist officers ; political murders even have been committed by secret organizations led by Reichswehr officers . If the High Command has not been aware of these machinations it has been culpably negligent  --  and the Social-ists who forced these issues on the attention of an unwilling Reichstag deserve credit as truer German patriots than those who , concealing facts , have increased foreign suspicions . The old Cabinet will carry on until after the holidays . Mean , while a new uncertainty reigns in Eastern Europe , because of the Lithuanian coup d'etat . A reactionary military clique has ousted the Cabinet which had negotiated a friendly treaty with Russia , and the suspicion naturally arises that Poland 's dictator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pie . T HE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES has passed a compromise bill dealing with the alien property and American claims against Germany . It will return 80 per cent of the sequestrated property , giving to the owners certificates for the other 20 per cent , entitling them to share in payments made to the United States under the Dawes Plan , apart from the Rhine army costs . The Americans holding claims against Germany are to receive payment for 70 per cent of their claims now , taking certificates for the balance . The unallocated interest fund , accumulated down to March 4 , 1923 , amounting to $26,000,000 , is to be used for the American claimants , the original alien owners to receive certificates in return . This is an improvement on the original administration bill , which provided for outright confiscation of the interest , but we must express astonishment at the statement in the President 's message that we have " scrupulously observed " the principle that private property may not be confiscated in time of war . Has the President heard of the Chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the armistice ? Inasmuch as the owners of the sequestrated property , and of the ships , radios , and patents taken over by the Government itself , are glad to take what a niggardly government will permit them to have , the bill probably deserves support in the Senate . But it would make our national record a little more savory if the United States undertook to guarantee the certificates against any default in the Dawes Plan . We owe the money ; why not promise to pay it ourselves ? W HO CAN VALUE UTILITIES ? Can a federal judge , linked by family ties with the traction company upon whose rates he is passing judgment , throw out the testimony of as eminent an authority as Delos F. Wilcox , on the specious plea of company counsel that Mr. Wilcox was not an engineer and had never worked for a street-railway company ? In the Denver Tramways Company case , to be heard soon on appeal by the United States Supreme Court , Judge Robert E. Lewis made such a ruling when a special master rendered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was virtually nullified , but the newly elected Klan administration , with Rice W. Means as City Attorney , continued impassive , having failed to criticize in any way the master 's high valuation or to protest against Judge Lewis 's family connections and expressions of prejudice . Public-utility valuation is an intricate subject , full of moot points , involving economics , accounting , engineering , and , above all , public policy . It calls preeminently for a mind which can correlate these many aspects and arrive at -a comprehensive judgment . In the course of his wide experience in public-utility matters Delos Wilcox was chosen by the post-war Federal Electric Railways Commission to analyze the voluminous testimony given before it ; and the commission styled his analysis " a complete and masterful study of the whole electric-railway problem . " Various other authoritative experts who have appeared for the cities are , fortunately , the product neither of engineering schools nor of company employmerit . Judge Lewis 's decision , if allowed to stand , would bar such men and make valuation and rate hearings field-days for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " workers I receive ? The most recent and comprehensive answer is from the Massachusetts Department of Labor and Industries , covering a survey as of May 1 , 1926 , of 1,075 establishments in representative districts of the State . The number Of persons classifiable as office workers was found to be 22,427 , of whom 36.5 per cent were men and 63.5 were women . This is about 12 per cent of the total number of office workers disclosed by the federal census of 1920 . The Massachusetts survey reveals a sharp difference between the earnings of men and women and some decidedly low averages ' for large groups of the latter . Among men 6.4 per cent receive less than $16 a week , 13.7 per cent less than $20 , 25.4 per cent less than $25 , 40.1 per cent less than $30 , 67.8 per cent less than $40 , 81.7 per cent less than $50 , and 18.3 per cent $50 or more . Among women 13.7 per cent receive less than $16 a week , 38.4 per cent less than $20 , 70.4 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30 , and 98 per cent less than $40 ! Various morals suggest themselves ; the reader may pick his own . We are content merely to compare the returns of these " white-collar " employees , generally unorganized , with the earnings of 824,313 union workers in the United States , employed in the building trades , in printing and publishing , in baking , on street railways , in laundries , and as teamsters , chauffeurs , or longshoremen . These earnings , as given by the federal Department of Labor for the year ended with last June , averaged $52.12 for a full-time week . There 's a difference . Can any bright boy guess why ? T HE POLICE HAVE WON the strike of the textile workers of Passaic , New Jersey  --  for the strikers . With the signing of an agreement between the Botany Consolidated Mills and the union this bitter industrial controversy of a year 's duration is virtually settled , for , although some companies have not yet capitulated , the surrender of the most influential employing group undoubtedly fixes the terms which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in wages  --  already at the impoverishing level of $12 to $22 a week  --  which precipitated the strike has been rescinded , and the workers have won in addition collective bargaining , recognition of their organization , and preference for union members in reinstatement . The workers have not obtained the closed shop , a wage increase , nor reduced hours , but the last two demands were not put forward for any except bargaining purposes . And to celebrate the victory what could be more appropriate than that the union should spread a banquet and invite as honorary guests the Sheriff of Bergen County , the police chiefs of Passaic and Garfield , and other administrative and judicial officials whose lawlessness and brutality raised the strike from a local protest of unorganized and inarticulate aliens to a national fight for civil liberties and common decency ? S O WE PROPOSE A TOAST to the various bullies and buffoons in high places who imagined they were helping the employers by permitting the clubbing of peaceful pickets , the breaking up of lawful meetings , and the promulgation of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact they created a nationwide moral and financial support for the strike and a determination and devotion among the strikeris without which the struggle would have been abandoned and forgotten months ago . Although begun by a helpless and almost voiceless group of workers , the strike has been one of the most eloquent and resounding conflicts in recent years . Ignored if not scorned at the outset by the national union of the trade , the United Textile Workers , the strikers rallied under communist leadership but eventually won their way to organization and protection under the American Federation of Labor . It is inspiring also to reflect that a press and public which are apathetic to many wrongs have been singularly responsive to the cfy of oppression from Passaic and did not dismiss it after a few brief weeks in the preoccupation of other matters . But we must not forget that a dozen prisoners still suffer in Jersey jails on what seem to be outlandishly impossible charges of using bombs in the strike . They must be freed and those who tortured and beat them must be prosecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . T HERE ARE DOMAINS which science should not enter ? or at least where the thought of its entrance is appalling . For example , a man today may sit in the privacy of his bedroom  --  even in the ultra-privacy of his bed , and , thanks to the wonderful invention of the telephone , may carry on a conversation with the most beautiful lady he knows . He may have laid his wig on the wig-stand ; his pajamas may be minus their top button ; there is , in short , no limit to the possible extent of ' his dishabille , but the colloquy may be of the utmost propriety and decorum . Science , however , intrudes ; the television apparatus makes it possible for the image of the telephone speaker to be conveyed simultaneously with his voice . Privacy is gone , comfort is gone , the early hours of the morning are lost in primping and preening , all in order to carry on a short conversation over the telephone . T HE INVENTORS OF THE TELEPHOTE , of course , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the image of a baseball game or a peace conference to be conveyed as speeches now are transmitted over the radio . They picture images of the opera , bright lights , gorgeous costumes , the tenor , the basso , the contralto , the lyric soprano with her golden hair in a braid down her back , floating into the family sitting-room along with the music . A desideratum indeed , for those who care for opera ; just so with the prize-fight , the symphony orchestra , the Kiwanis banquet , the bedtime story of the benevolent rabbit and squirrel . But there is no guaranty that the benefits of the telephote will end with the transmittal of public activities . The inventors have imperiled the home . Nor is this the only direction from which it is threatened . In New York City a skyscraper 110 stories in height has been builded in the-brain of an architect ; its site has been chosen , plans for it have been filed , there remains only a question of time before it begins to hurl its steel girders into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming even darker and colder ; the sun never enters . The New York home is increasingly lighted by artificial light and warmed far from the , beneficent rays of the sun . Invention has made New . York a city of cave-dwellers.
