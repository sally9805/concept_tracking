txt Congressman Green , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , snakes a poor case for high surtaxes in a letter to Professor Adams of Yale . He says high taxes can be collected from the rich in Canada and Great Britain , and dismisses the tax-exempt bonds of this country as having little or nothing to do with the case . Canada 's war borrowing was in tax-exempt bonds . She soon saw the unsoundness of selling tax exemption , and her Victory loan was  --  not exempt . Her present taxexempt bonds are retired as rapidly as may be and are already too few to afford a permanent refuge to wealth . A rich Canadian must pay income tax in Canada-on federal , state or municipal bonds of the United States taxexempt here . The comparison with Great Britain is still indre fallacious . Mr. Green does not mention that no bond issue there is , or ever has been , tax-exempt , except in past centuries where that was a condition made for a personal loan to the King . But the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . High taxes in England undoubtedly affect the cost of living , as they do anywhere , as nothing else ever does . But at least they can not be evaded by anybody . The burden is therefore more or less equitably distributed . Saved capital goes into productive use because it will be taxed , anyway , anywhere in Great Britain . Again , Mr. Green says that if our rich man would not go into industry with an income surtax reduced to 35 per cent . from the present 50 per cent . he would still continue to , take refuge in tax-exempt bonds with a surtax of 25 per cent . That is a. matter of simple arithmetic , and Mr. Mellon has worked out the sum for Mr. Green time and again , to say nothing of what he has done in the somewhat hopeless task of educating Senator Couzens . Mr. Green may be surprised to know that in the difference between 35 per cent . and 25 per cent . lies the entire housing problem of the United States . With a surtax of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist 's while to build tenements for working people . Not a single building of the kind has been put up in New York city for more than five years . With a 35 per cent . surtax the profit on such an enterprise would be too precarious to be worth considering , because it would require a certainty of at least 12 per cent . on the investment , after income taxes , to justify the risk . Again , Mr. Green uses the question-begging epithet of tax evasion . The buyer of tax-exempt bonds is making an open and straightforward bargain with the public borrower on terms Congress itself suggested . He is buying a commutation of taxes by paying a high price for his bonds and accepting a lower interest rate . Congress itself , in almost the last act of March , 1923 , offered a further $600,000,000 of tax-exempt farm loan bonds . Did it consider then that it was legalizing a fraud on the revenue ? On every point of his argument Congressman Green begs the question . Foreign experts in American affairs might explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clemenceau or anybody else is even thinkable under our Constitution .
