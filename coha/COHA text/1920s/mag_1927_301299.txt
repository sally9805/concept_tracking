For more than two decades , Columbia University has had varsity crews that have just missed being good . The 1927 season seemed , at the beginning , no exception . With an all-sophomore crew , which had been magnificent in 1926 as freshmen , Columbia 's hopes were thwarted on the Housatonic River in May by Yale . Then Columbia tried a shakeup , put a couple of upperclassmen in the boat , trailed the Navy and Princeton in the combined Stewards ' and Childs ' Cup regatta at Philadelphia a few weeks later . <P> Water sharps picked Columbia to finish behind the Navy , Washington and California at Poughkeepsie last week ; but sharps have been wrong so many times this season that duller men have taken to flipping coins before betting . <P> Columbia took the lead at the start at Poughkeepsie , but was soon passed by California . Just before the three-mile ( three-quarters ) mark , Stroke Eric Lambert raised the beat in the Columbia boat , killed California in a mighty struggle . Then along came the giants from Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngsters from Columbia , averaging 19 years in age , had something left-an unbelievable spurt that Washington failed to catch by three-quarters of a boat-length . It was Columbia 's first victory in the intercollegiate four-mile regatta since 1914 . The winning time , 20 min. , 57 sec. , was slower than had been made at Poughkeepsie since the original race in 1895 . <P> Washington , California , Navy , <P> Cornell , Syracuse , Pennsylvania* finished in the order named . <P> <P> * Hitting a log early in the race , puncturing its shell , Pennsylvania did well to finish at all .
