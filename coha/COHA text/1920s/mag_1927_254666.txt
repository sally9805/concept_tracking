GO SHE MUST-David Garnett-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . What shall befall the tall but beautiful , timid but intelligent daughter of a widowed vicar in a hamlet of the English fen country ? Author T. F. Powys would surely bring her to harm through the primeval malice of some local lout . Sheila Kaye-Smith might supply her with a young gentleman and beset their true love with gossip and the father 's disapproval . H. G. Wells would find her at least a temporary career ; Arnold Bennett would describe her shoelaces and thoughts on dusting the stairs . Hugh Walpole might make her a sweet minor character . <P> The young author of Lady into Fox , A Man in the Zoo and The Sailor 's Return does none of these things . In his matter-of-fact fashion , so quiet that it becomes mysterious , he makes her father a sort of pocket-borough St. Francis of Assisi . He fills her heart with restlessness and her head with innocent resolution , keeps her procrastinating over escape until her father 's mania for feeding birds is quite pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grocer 's son , until one more village Easter passes and the first nightingale has sung . Then go she does , Anne Dunnock of Dry Coulter , to equivocal Paris where the grocer 's son , an artist , turns out to be no lover at all but her means of meeting one , whom she marries and by whom all her perplexed misgivings about being lost in life are removed . There is nothing probable or improbable about the story . Author Garnett simply contrives to fill his pages with an imminence surpassing even the beauty of Anne 's straw-colored hair and the coming of spring to an English countryside . <P> Part of the overtone is homeliness : there is a prose poem on turning mattresses and tucking fresh sheets in an old house . Part is swiftness and grace : Mr. Dunnock , before his birds become his angels , skates on the fens like a big bird himself . Part is earthiness : angry yokels plow a furrow across the vicarage lawn , plow up the doorstep , with three chestnut horses steaming and gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathercock whines ; people tell their dreams ; once Mr. Dunnock stuffs his beard quickly into his mouth . <P> The Author . Son of Critic Edward Garnett and Constance Garnett , to whom the great Russians own their most perfect translations into English , and grandson of Author Richard Garnett ( Twilight of the Gods ) , David Garnett nearly betrayed his literary birthright by studying science ( gentle Botany ) . But in 1920 , aged 27 , he was claimed by books . He opened a bookshop and fell to writing . Lady into Fox appeared after two years . Lest he turn back to science , he was awarded a prize . His wife , who was Rachel Marshall , does woodcuts .
