Last week J. K. Rpbison completed four years ' service as Chief of the Bureau of Naval Engineering . In that post he had approved the Teapot Dome and Elk Hills oil leases . With his quitting the post of Chief of the Bureau of Engineering , he lost his temporary rank of Rear Admiral and reverted to his permanent rank of Captain . His application to retire with his temporary rank was denied by the President . He can never achieve the rank of Rear Admiral now , since he will be 55 in a few weeks and according to rule no one is given that rank after reaching 55.
