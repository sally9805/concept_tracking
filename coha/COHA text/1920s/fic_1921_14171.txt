The usual chattering audience of our theatres is waiting for the curtains to part on a performance of Ibsen 's The Master Builder . Presently the lights are lowered to a colored darkness , and the warm glow of the footlights begins again the ancient magic . The orchestra draws its bows soothingly to a gradual close and files out gropingly into the rabbit hutch prepared for it , leaving perhaps a sentimental viola player staring upward into the darkness . Suddenly the curtains are parted by an earnest young man , who stares into the shadowy audience and starts , with some difficulty , to address it . SHELLEY My name is Shelley . I I am told that some of you may have heard of me , may even know my poems  --  or some of my poems . I can not imagine what they may seem like to you who live in this world that that is , I have just seen your streets for the first time  --  your machines , your buildings , and especially the machines with which you talk to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of such things . ( Awkward pause ) Well , I wanted to say something about this play , but I do n't know how to put it into words for you . You see , I feel that , in part , I wrote this play . ( With sudden relief calling back through the curtains ) Hilda ! Will you help me a moment ? p. 3 WANGEL Yes , I 'm coming . SHELLEY ( Constrainedly , to the audience ) : A friend of mine . ( Hilda appears in her mountaineering costume of the first act , carrying an alpenstock . Vigorously , to the audience : ) WANGEL He promised to do this by himself , but he has gotten into difficulties . Have you told them that you wrote it ? SHELLEY I tried to . It did n't sound reasonable . WANGEL Well , you were able to explain it to me . Help me to persuade Papa to come out here . ( She disappears . ) SHELLEY Henrik , for my sake . WANGEL There , did you hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you kindly push forward the wicker settee from the last act ? Thank you . ( A wicker settee suddenly appears ) Now , Papa . ( Hilda reappears leading the dramatist . Ibsen is smiling sternly through his spectacles and through his fringe of upcurling white whiskers . ) Now sit down and Shelley will begin again . IBSEN Hurry , young man . My beautiful play is ready to begin . The kingdom is on the table , the nurseries are empty , and this house is full of unconverted people . p. 4 WANGEL ( Touching his shoe with the tip of her alpenstock ) : Hush , Papa . Let him go about it in his own way . Have you told them about the poem you were about to write when you died ? SHELLEY No . ( To the audience ) Ladies and Gentlemen , on the day I died  --  drowned in the Mediterranean  --  I was full of a poem to be called The Death of a Centaur , that I did not have time to put on paper . WANGEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem . SHELLEY I could n't say that . WANGEL You said it to me . ( Turning to the audience ) You should know that this young man had come to a time when everything he wrote was valuable . He was as sure to write great poems as a good apple tree is to give good apples . SHELLEY Perhaps it would have been one of the better ones . At all events , it was never written IBSEN ( Rising excitedly and stamping his feet as though they had snow on them ) : And I claim that I wrote it . The poem hung for a while above the Mediterranean , and then drifted up toward the Tyrol , and I caught it and wrote it down . And it is The Master Builder . p. 5 WANGEL Now you must sit down , Papa , and keep calm . We must reason this out calmly . In the first place , both are certainly about centaurs . What do you say , Shelley ? SHELLEY Well , it is not a strange idea , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made drifts about the world waiting to be clothed with words . It is a truth that Plato would have understood that the mere language , the words of a masterpiece , are the least of its offerings . Nay , in the world we have come into now , the languages of the planet have no value ; but the impulse , the idea of " Comus " is a miracle , even in heaven . Let you remember this when you regret the work that has been lost through this war that has been laid upon your treasurable young men . The work they might have done is still with you , and will yet find its way into your lives and into your children 's lives . IBSEN Enough , enough ! You will be revealing all the mysteries soon . Enough has been said to prove that The Death of a Centaur and The Master Builder are the same poem . Get in with you , children . The play is ready to start . Solness sits with his head in his hands , and the harps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains . Shelley lingers a moment ; a shadow has fallen across his face . ) WANGEL ( Laying her hand on his arm ) :
