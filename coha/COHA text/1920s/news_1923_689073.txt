txt A NEW PLAN FOR FARMERS . The plan proposed by Mr. BERNARD BARUCH for relieving American wheat growers from the depression which just now surrounds their market is interesting and ingenious . This is not the first season when the course of the wheat market has shown the disadvantage under which the American farmer labors through lack of co-operation in his marketing of grain . Acting individually as he does in the disposal of his crop , the inevitable tendency is for the great mass of the season 's product to come on the market in the first few months after harvest . tinder such circumstances , and with the export market itself limited through the competition of the newly harvested foreign crops , the result has always been the forcing down of prices while the farmer was selling the bulk of his crop , often followed by an even more excessive advance in the months when the farmers ' holdings of wheat had been reduced to nominal proportions . Mr. BARUCH 'S suggestion is that the machinery of the large dealers : xi grain should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing farmers ; that they should employ such an experienced dealer as their agent and place their own product under his control . He would then sell it or hold it for later sale , according as circumstances of the market rendered it wise . In the end , Mr. BARUCH foresees the possibility of the selling concern coming wholly under the management of the participating farmers . The idea of co-operative marketing is not new ; it has been forced forward again by the circumstances of the present year 's wheat market . Last June the lowest price reached by wheat for delivery in July was $1.08% , in June of 1921 the lowest price was $1.18 , and from these prices the market value ranged during the month to figures which have not been touched this year . The price of wheat may in fact be said to be ruling ati the prewar level . It is lower than the prevailing price at this time of year in 1913 , 1912 , 1910 and 1909 . This is the state of the farmer 's market at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 per cent . above the prewar average . The statement given out at the recent conference of Western Governors by Dr.-TAYLOR , a high expert on grain production , shows the nature of the problem . He emphasized the fact that the trouble with the wheat market/does not originate in Europe , for Europe in fact taking from America quite as much wheat as her people took before the war , but that the planted . American acreage of the past four years has been 65,000,000 acres , as compared with 45,000,000 on the average during the five years before the war . Clearly , the situation would not be wholly solved even by the satisfactory avorkMg out of the plan proposed by Mr. BARUCH . That plan does not contemplate regulation of planted acreage , but rather the scientific distribution of the wheat subject to practical judgment of the market . The objections to it lie upon the surface . There would always be many farmers whose individual necessities would compel them : o sell promptly , in order to clear off he obligations incurred while the prop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a single agency of this kind that the men in . iontrol of marketing would themselves misjudge the course of prices . ) evasions have been numerous when large grain-dealing houses have them selves misjudged the situation , and b hOlding back accumulated wheat hav missed their market , giving to Can ada , Argentina or Russia the ? ppm tunity to fill the demaiads from con suming States . In the end they hay at times been forced to sell out at proportionately disadvantageous price When the matter is one of inclividus speculation , such a dealer protect himself by " hedging . " Whether an to what extent that expedient woul be plausible under the arrangemen now proposed , it would be difficult t ? say . Nevertheless , it will be general : agreed that the plan of co-operativi marketing is a desirable objectiv point in all efforts to relieve the farmer 's present situation : also that up to the ' present time , the chief ob stacle has seemed to be the difficulty of obtaining such practical and ex perienced management as should in sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall hear more of this subject in the discussions of the corn . ing season .
