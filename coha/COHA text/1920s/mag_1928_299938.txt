The country seemed surprised last week when President Coolidge appointed William Fairfield Whiting to the Commerce Secretariat . Mr. Whiting was an " unknown , " people said . It was a " personal " appointment . It was calculated to please , encourage and rally the G. O. P. of New England , which is gloomy and restive under the textile industry 's depression . <P> Doubtless , the President , a man of much sly humor , was pleased with the country 's surprise . He knew that as people began to learn about his mysterious friend it would gradually dawn on them how unusually " logical " and defensible an appointment it was . Not the thinnest cream of the jest would be when newspaper readers and editors discovered that the " unknown 's " name has appeared daily for many years on the front pages of leading U. S. newspapers-in the tiny bottom-line advertisements which say : " When you think of Writing , think of Whiting . " The personal phase of the appointment was that from the time Calvin Coolidge was president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whiting has believed him a man of destiny . He believed even more faithfully than Mr. Coolidge 's political pastor , the late great Winthrop Murray Crane . In 1920 a delegate to the Chicago convention , Mr. Whiting voted to the bitter end to head the ticket with Mr. Coolidge . Then , after Mr. Crane and Senator Lodge and the rest of the Massachusetts men had capitulated to the Ohio idea , Mr. Whiting pushed their man again for vice president . Mr. Crane was dour . " He 's done , " he said . But Mr. Whiting had distributed copies of Calvin Coolidge 's essay " Have Faith in Massachusetts . " Over he went and Delegate Whiting had the pleasure of voting to keep him over in 1924 . In 1928 he was the last Massachusettsman to despair of drafting-Coolidge . <P> Mr. Whiting , like Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow and other Coolidge intimates , went to Amherst college . But he was nine years ahead of Mr. Coolidge , whose class was 1895 . It remained for their sons to be undergraduate comrades . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Morgan Butler and Frank Waterman Stearns to being " the original Coolidge man . " If Mr. Butler or Mr. Stearns was invited to the Commerce Department ahead of Mr. Whiting-and one of them was so invited-no false pride or lack of understanding prevented Mr. Whiting from playing a distinguished second fiddle .
