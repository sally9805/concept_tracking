txt The Bronx County Grand Jury will be asked today by District Attorney John E. to investigate the Police Department to find out who or what is responsible for a serious short , age of uniformed policemen in the Bronx . District Attorney let it be known last night that he had ' decided to go before the August Grand fury as the result of a preliminary Investigation lie made after receiving numerous complaints from Bronx merchants . householders and citizens generally who have been victimized by burglars , sneak thieves , pickpockets and criminals of an even more desperate Class . Mr. said he began an investigation on his own initiative after he had been flooded with letters , telephone calls , and also personal visits . from indignant citizens who complained that the Bronx , including an area of forty-two square miles . with a population of more than 1,000,000 , was underpoliced even assuming it to be possible for its conipletement of 1,000 policemen to be available for duty at all times . Citizens of the Bronx are said to be resentful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special duty .  --  Say Precincts Are Stripped . The special assignments are made from police headquarters in Manhattan . it is said , and It often happens that a whole precinct is entirety stripped of its uniformed patrolmen by instructions for an elaborate policing of a ball game at the Yankee Stadium , a band concert or some other public function . On Saturday night , a week ago , it is said there was only one uniformed patrolman left for duty in one of the largest precincts of the Bronx . . In that precinct there were thirty posts to be covered and the lives and property of more than 150,000 citizens to be protected . The lone patrolman was supposed to cover an entire square mile with the aid of eight runabout automobiles driven by as many motor police . The next night , the District Attorney heard , there were only two patrolmen in that precinct . Those and other allegations are to be laid before the Grand Jury " y District Attorney . It is understood that the District Attorney will recommend that Commissioner Enright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they know of the special assignments that are often said to leave : the Bronx precincts policed by a skeleton force . The Grand Jury will subpoena police station records and ' from them study the assignments which have taken uniformed policemen off the streets and distributed them among what other members of the force describe as " sinecures . " No Conflict of Inquiries . The Bronx inquiry probably will not conflict with the New York Grand Jury investigation of Commissioner Enright 's distribution of " P. D. " automobile plates to a large group of his and the Police Department 's friends , including the so-called " millionaire " honorary and Special Deputy Police Commissioners . The New York Grand Jury investigation , it is understood , will also seek to throw further light on the fund of more than $50,000 rased by the honorary Police Commissioners and others to defray the expenses of Mr. Enright 's South American trip and the expenses of entertaining the 300 odd delegates to the Third International Police Conference at . the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel last May . An admission that wealthy friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses of the Commissioner 's trip was made last week by Herman A .. Metz , an Honorary Deputy Police Commissioner , who said Ca ' fund was started at a meeting at the LOtos Club last Winter . after- Commissioner Enright hadtold the group his Plans for the conference . Mr. Metz denied that all those contributing to the fund were holders of the " P. D. " license plates . The agitation against the alleged abuse of the " P. D. " Plates was first started by Mayor . Hylan himself in a letter to Commissioner Enright several weeks ago , saying that city cars should not be permitted to flout traffic regulations . Last week the July Grand Jury , investigating motor vehicle accidents , asked to be permitted to continue its investigations , especially of charges of reckless driving imputed to holders ofsthe " P. D. " plates , until the return of Commissioner ( Enright , who sailed a few days ago for , Canada .

A. typical case , it was said last night , was that of a Bronx policeman who was assigned practically continuously for five years to watch a suspected estaklishmeat on ) 25th Street , Manhattan , although lie was still carried on the Bronx police payroll . In another instance a uniformed policeman on the Bronx payroll iS said to have been assigned to do the work of a civilian horseshoer of Manhattan , when the latter went on vacation . - The fact that so much inside information as to the activities of the Bronx police had been gathered by Mr. for presentation to . the Grand Jury was interpreted as meaning that some of his informants were members of the Bronx Police Department who %fere dissatisfied at having to do the extra work entailed by the reduction of their number . A police captain of the Bronx , commenting on the situation recently , is quoted as having said : " A uniformed patrolman in the Bronx is getting to be as are as a horse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirous of questioning Commission.er Enright because he wishes the Police Commissioner to explain what will be the Bronx 's quota of the 2,500 additional policemen Commissioner EnrIght recently sought to get through the Board of Estimate . 30 ROBBED IN BRONX AT DEMOCRATIC CLUB Gang of 7 Line Up Members Against Wall , Take Up $4,000 Collection ' and Escape Seven hold-up men took $4,000 in money and jewelry from thirty members of the Fairmount Democratic-Club in the Seventh Assembly District in the Bronx early yesterday morning .
