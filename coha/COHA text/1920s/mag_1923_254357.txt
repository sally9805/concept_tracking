Major Alexander P. Cronkhite died of a bullet wound at Camp Lewis , Washington , in 1918 . <P> His father , Major-General Adelbert Cronkhite , appealed to President Harding in 1921 , charging that the War Department had no record of any investigation , inquest or autopsy following his son 's death . He still presses the charge . <P> Captain Robert Rosenbluth , tried in 1922 and acquitted of Cronkhite 's murder , also demands a full investigation-to exonerate himself . <P> Secretary Weeks has promised a thorough inquiry . No evidence of murder has ever been produced . A confession made by a bugler implicating Captain Rosenbluth has been retracted . <P> The case has been capitalized by certain politicians in Congress , who charge that Major-General Cronkhite 's recent retirement was in some way connected with the proposed investigation .
