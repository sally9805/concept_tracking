The curtain rises on the sitting-room of a negro 's squalid dwelling in Goat Alley , Washington , D.C. At the Right Back there is a door giving directly on the street , and when it is open one gets a glimpse of the miserable , tumble-down houses on the opposite side . At Left Back is a window , one pane of which is broken out and an old shirt stuck in the hole . The one or two filthy rag-carpet rugs which lie on the floor serve only in a small measure to cover its bareness . Several old , broken , and battered chairs stand here and there about the room . At Left Center is a door leading into the other room of the house . Between it and the wall at Back is a door opening into a closet . Near the door , Left Center , and toward the front stands a battered table on which lie , in disordered array , papers and one or two dog-eared books with their backs off . It is night and a lighted oil lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . The wick is turned low , and the guttering flame causes countless shadows to disport themselves eerily about the room . Flamboyant lithographs , a gilt-framed picture of Jack Johnson , wearing his golden smile , an engraved portrait of Abraham Lincoln , and several grotesque crayon portraits , presumably of members of the family ( crassly inexpressive ) , adorn the dirty and discolored walls . An old corset , a half-eaten roll , and a doll , with the head-off , lie about on the floor . A horseshoe is nailed over the center of the door , Back . Aunt Rebecca , an old , coal-black negress , enters , Back , with a shawl thrown over her shoulders . She has the appearance of an animated mummy . Her eyes are small and bead-like , and shine with an uncanny lustre ; her hands , long and bony , resembling the talons of a hawk . She glances about inquiringly , gives an impatient grunt , then turns and slowly closes the door . AUNT REBECCA ( in high-pitched , raspy tones , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy Belle ! p. 3 LUCY BELLE ( from the next room ) Yassum ! Jes ' a minute . ( Aunt Rebecca moves slowly about the room , mumbling to herself . Presently Lucy Belle enters , Left , wearing a black straw sailor hat , badly misshapen , and carrying a basket of washing . She is a frail , light-brown , young negress of about twenty-eight . She has a nervous , hesitating manner . ) LUCY BELLE Oh ! I'se so glad yo 's yere . Yo ' kin stay a while , kai n't yo ' ? ( Aunt Rebecca grunts and nods . ) I wants yo ' ter stay wid de chillen while I runs out wid dis yere washin ' . Only take a minute  --  ' roun ter Miss Erminie 's .

Aunt Rebecca sits in perplexed preoccupation for several moments . At length she speaks slowly . ) ' Deed , chile , I kai n't seem ter ' member who Henry 's fawther was . Dat gin got mah haid all tangle up . LUCY BELLE ( turning and moving toward Left ) I reckon I bettah bring dat baby out yere . No tellin ' what dem chillen liable ter do to it .

( She places the baby in Aunt Rebecca 's arms . ) ( Fanny Dorsey , a little negro girl of eight , and Israel Dorsey , a little negro boy of six , run in , Left . Both wear nightgowns . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamma ! Git me some candy ! p. 5 LUCY BELLE ( harshly ) Yo ' all hush ! Git right back ter bed ! Go ' long !

ISRAEL Mamma ! Git me  --  ( Lucy Belle grabs them roughly and pushes them through door , Left , closing it after them . Their cries are heard for several moments and then gradually cease . ) LUCY BELLE Some day I'se gwine ter git good an ' mad an ' knock dere haids off !

He is a tall , slender , light-colored , young negro of about twenty-four . He wears a cap and old ragged suit of clothes. ) p. 8 SLIM Hello , Aun ' Becky . What yo ' all doin ' yere ?
