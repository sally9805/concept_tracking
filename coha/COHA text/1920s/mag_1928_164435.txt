Guilds , popular in the Middle Ages among artisans and such , are now once more a favorite form of organization . Last fortnight the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra ( Georges Zaslawskey , Conductor ) , which has just completed its first active season , became the Beethoven Symphony Guild , and incorporated in Manhattan as a non-profit-sharing membership corporation . The aims of the Beethoven Symphony Guild are : to maintain a high-calibre 100-piece symphony orchestra , to give low price concerts in obscure communities as well as metropolitan centres , to raise $200,000 , to be selfsupporting.
