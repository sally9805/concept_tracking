The facts tend all the other way . Poland had pursued towards Russia indeed towards all her neighbors ) a policy of reckless provocation and aggression . So anxious was Moscow to avoid a war , that it was willing , before the Polish march on K ; ev , to purchase peace with vast territorial concessiolis. - Hie attempt to force a revolution was a grave blunder , but seas essentially a defensive move . ' I here iSr no reason to suppose that Russia will repeat it , unless she is again provoked by wanton attack . ' 61 N I ? ( But what , the reader it ar say , ( lo yi:ni make of AIriscow 's eastern policy ? is shc not subsidizing the " I-nrkish Nationalists ? Has she nor sent some kind of Red force into l'ersia ? Did die not , this summer , at Baku , summon a Congress of the eastern peoples , and bid them join her in a revolutionary Holy War ? Certainly she has done all these things . Napoleon in a similar siniation ed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little , to invade Persia as Lord Curzon has , and the French only wish that they had been before her in securing the alliance of the Turks . The Baku Congress must have been a most picturesque convention , and that must have been a telling oration of Zinovicv 's , which caused a thousand Moslem chieftains to draw their swords front their scabbards and swear a jehad upon them . None the less this eastern policy is not a development of Communism . The basis of Russian propaganda in the east is nationality , and its rallying cry is " Down with Imperialism . " Lenin himself made this clear in a note presented to the Third International , and apologized in a rather labored essay for not preaching social revolution in the east . So true is this , that I even met in Moscow an able Indian Communist , who had refused to attend the Baku Congress , because its basis was merely the " bourgeois " idea of nationality . This man , an obviously honest extremist , was ill-at-ease about the whole trend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could get no support for his own project of preaching a proletarian revolution in India , That would , he admitted , need time , and Moscow evidently wanted quick results , THE OFFENSIVE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ENGLAND The plain fact is , as I gathered in a very free talk with Radek , who had just returned from Baku , that this eastern policy is purely tactical . It is the obvious offensive defensive against England . Lenin , like Napoleon , strikes at our most vulnerable spot . Radek , with his dazzling habit of calculated indiscretion , told me many details of the scheme ( doubtless with many omissions ) . The essence of what he said was , however , this , that Moscow disposes absolutely of all levers in this intrigue , and controls all the powder trains for this conflagration . She can touch the levers or refrain , exactly as she wills , and stop when she wills , and she will be guided solely by her own interests . To drop metaphor , it is mainly a question of giving subsidies and arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the one or the other , according as Downing Street chooses peace or war . I have little hesitation in accepting this statement as true . If Russia were preaching Communism in the east , then indeed she might well go on , whatever we might do . Principle , indeed , might require her to go on . But nationality is not her creed . It is a cry which she uses for a temporary tactical end . It would cost her nothing to desist from it . My own reading of the " armed doctrine " is , then , thatit is in actual practice mainly a defensive weapon . Moscow will try to rouse the western masses , will appeal even to the eastern trihc , s , just so long as we blockade her , and subsidize the endless series of enemies who attack her . The notion that she prefers war , and consciously bases the dictatorship rot continual war is a gross delusion . On the contrary , three-fourths of her ditlieulties are due to the continual war . Peace is her only chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply . Leery Communist , however fanatical , indeed every Russian , repeated this thesis to me , till I grew weary of hearing it . But surely , the reader may object . the nation did rally to Moscow during the Polish attack ? Mae not Moscow keep war going in order to exploit this patriotism ? There certainly was a patriotic rally , vet I believe that the nation rallied with much more enthusiasm , much more hope , a winch nearer approach to genuine loyalty , during the constroctive idyll which preceded the Polish attack . Never have the men in the Kremlin enjoyed a period so tranquil and so reassuring as the months in the early spring of ro2u , S NEED OF Russians are not Frenclimen , and the Napoleonic analogy may lead us sadly astray . They do not enjoy war : they never think of glory , and they know only too well that war means famine . I believe firmly that it we could but bring ourselves to give Russia peace , the nation would ding itself into the tasks of education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armed doctrine to the dim regions of theory . Years will elapse before her shattered life can be even moderately easy , and many years more , before she could realize her high ambition of universal culture and diffused prosperity . She can not make the world-revolution . The men who can make it , the men whose mad fear of it dooms them to prepare it , are to he sought not in Moscow , but in Paris . If France continues to prolong the epoch of militarism , if she forbids Germany to hope , above all , if she ruins her economic life by seizing the Ruhr coalfield , or handing Silesia to Poland , then certainly I foresee another attempt from .11 . Ioscow to raise revolution in the west . The danger is not a vain imagining , but if it comes , it will be of our making . Moscow can not make a revolution in Europe . She can only reap where we have sowed despair . H. N. BRr.ILSFORD .
