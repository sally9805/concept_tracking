His Britannic Majesty 's Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish People . <P> - Balfour Declaration . <P> Nov. 2 , 1917 . <P> There are seven Arabs in Palestine to every Jew , and they do not view with favor the British Mandate over Palestine which is making a national home for the Jewish people . Therefore the Arab majority has obstructed the supply of needed public funds ; and today the budgetary deficit of Palestine stands at 1,000,000 ( $4,870,000 ) . <P> Recently this state of affairs was stigmatized as " intolerable ! " by peppery Baron Herbert Charles Onslow Plumer of Messines and of Bilton , who has been British High Commissioner to Palestine since 1925 . He prescribed a remedy : more British troops . He had tested his prescriptions in 1918-19 , when , with the rank of Field Marshal , he commanded the Second British Army occupying the German Rhineland . Methods which reduced Germans to submission ought to be good for Arabs . <P> Last week Lord Plumer 's prescription went unheeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who appointed to succeed him another old soldier , but less peppery , Lt.-Col. Sir John Robert Chancellor , 58 , Scotch , a veteran of the Indian and World Wars , and , since 1923 , Governor of Southern Rhodesia , Africa . <P> Since Palestine is held by Great Britain as a Mandate from the League of Nations , it was to that body that the Palestine Arab Congress addressed , last week , the following appeal : <P> " It is the duty of the League of Nations , after ten years of absolute colonial rule , to grant to Palestine a democratic parliamentary government in accordance with the League 's pledges and the pledges of the allies to the Arabs . <P> " The people of Palestine can not and will not tolerate the present absolute colonial system , and urgently insist upon and demand an alteration . " <P> Christians and Jews were shocked at this evidence of infidel determination to make of Palestine a home for Arabs .                  @ @ @
