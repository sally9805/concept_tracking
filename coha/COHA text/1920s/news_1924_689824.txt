txt " Das Lied von der Erde. , " I have just read in your issue of Jan. 28 a notice of Mahler 's Immortal work . ' ' Das lied von der Erde . " It is a pity that its extraordinary beauty misses the mark with some listeners . The work is masterly , and to most of us it is plain that a yearly performance of " Das lied von der Erde " will mean complete revelation eventually to those who can not yet hear its beauty . The article in your paper also refers to what it expresses as a " lack of applause , " I beg to contradict this , and say that the entire audience stood at the end of the performance and applauded singers , conductor and orchestra for at lean ten minutes . As for the stand the Friends of Music have taken to prevent those who are late from disturbing the people who care enough to be there on time for Its concerts , it Is - one to comm nd itself to every one who really wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public who comes late be treated with more consideration than those of us who make sacrifices to be on time ? The Friends of Music have decreed that this shall not be , and they have the gratitude of all those who do not go to concerts merely to be entertained . MRS . JAMES A ROOSEVELT . New York , Jan. 29 , 1924.
