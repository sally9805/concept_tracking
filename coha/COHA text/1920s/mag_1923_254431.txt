These are the plays which in the light of metropolitan criticism seem most important . <P> LOYALTIES-The adventures of a rich and disagreeable Jew , persecuted by amiable clubmen , prove that conflicts in loyalties may bring disaster . The play is always interesting , if somewhat theatric . <P> THE SEVENTH HEAVEN - Helen Menken begins as the timorous sister of an absinthe-soaked shrew , but at the end of the second act , her courage restored by love , she turns on the sister and lashes her with a black whip . <P> RAIN-A devastating attack on the missionary who uses the Bible as a club to drive lost sheep into the fold . The play is distinguished by Jeanne Eagels ' acting and by real rain falling dismally throughout . <P> MERTON OF THE MOVIES-A skilful dramatization of Harry Leon Wilson 's story of the movie-struck youth who quite unintentionally becomes a great comedian , with a corresponding loss of illusions . <P> WILL SHAKESPEARE-Shakespeare is represented as a sort of divine sponge . When properly squeezed by a woman , an immortal play trickles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he deserts ( Winifred Lenihan ) ; by Queen Elizabeth ( Haidee Wright ) ; and chiefly by the " dark lady of the sonnets " ( Katherine Cornell ) . It is these three stirring performers who make Will Shakespeare excellent . <P> MOSCOW ART THEATRE-It is a very trifling barrier that the Moscow players use their native tongue . The reality and expressiveness of the performance make broader meanings as clear as daylight and inconceivably moving . This is the most justly famous group of actors in the world . Plays by Tchekov , Gorki , Tolstoi , are presented . <P> ROMEO AND JULIET - Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters offer a vitalized Romeo and Juliet . The interpretation is not notable for subtlety or profundity . Careless enthusiasm is its chief charm . <P> THE GOD OF VENGEANCE-The daughter of a Polish Jew , keeper of a brothel , falls a victim to her environment in a repulsively explicit scene with a Lesbian . Rudolph Schildkraut makes the father 's misery immensely moving . <P> PEER GYNT-Ibsen 's poetic phantasmagoria of self-sufficient compromise , with expressionist settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality change with equal celerity . <P> KIKI-Lenore Ulric as the little Parisienne who is not quite naughty and altogether captivating . A year on Broadway has not exhausted her supply of enthusiastic audiences .
