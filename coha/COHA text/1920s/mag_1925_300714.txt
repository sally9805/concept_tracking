Last year the city of Copenhagen paid a graceful compliment to the Gothic intellect by holding a memorial exhibit of reliques , papers , letters , reminiscent of the life of Wolfgang Goethe . To reciprocate , the Prussian State Library recently opened a similar exhibit for a Scandinavian genius , Hans Christian Andersen . First editions of his books , illustrations for his earliest fairy tales , letters from Hugo , Heine , Balzac , Lamartine , De Vigny , the Grimm brothers and the Grand Duke of Weimar , ladies ' favors , gentlemen 's favors , and the souvenirs of princes , are shown there , and the German schoolchildren who went to gaze at them were told first the fantastic plot of his life , which was , after all , one of the strangest fairy stories he had anything to do with . <P> A sickly young shoemaker of Odense , in Fnen , Denmark , married when he was 20 a woman still younger than himself and was very well content when she bore him a son . They called the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to eat , in a room which was also the home of their fine black pig . <P> Little Hans was not a manly lad ; he had , for instance , a terrible fear of the great geese that were driven in flocks through the streets of Odense , marching with a military step , their eyes glistening like buttons , and their red bills pointing forward in a row . When he beheld them he would run and hide behind the black pig , which was his friend . <P> Now his father the cobbler , who , like Hans Christian , was sick a good deal , died one day , and after that Frau Andersen had no time to think about Hans . He stopped going to school ; instead , he built himself a toy theatre and sat about all day in the cobbler 's shop , making clothes for marionettes or reading plays . Such conduct irritated the Dominie of Odense . He had no liking for Hans ; what was more , the boy did not know his catechism . So he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the ceremony he took him into the grim vicarage and shook a forefinger in his face : <P> " Now , Hans , " he said , " your father is dead and your mother is penniless and you are confirmed . It is about time for you to make your way in the world . What are you going to do ? " <P> Hans did not know . <P> " The clothes you make for your marionettes are not bad , " said the dominie . " Perhaps you had better be a tailor . Yes , I will apprentice you to a tailor . " <P> But Hans would not agree . Rather than do that , he said , he would become an opera singer . <P> So off he went to Copenhagen . At the opera they took him for a lunatic . He tried to be a dancer , but his feet were too big and his legs were too thin . So there was nothing left for him to do but turn writer .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
