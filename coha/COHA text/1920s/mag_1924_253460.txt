When the blood in a man 's body becomes fouled , it may be possible to remove and wash it , like linen . A remarkable device to accomplish this is being perfected by Dr. John J. Abel , distinguished pharmacologist of Johns Hopkins University . It is , in effect , an artificial kidney , an external laundry for the blood . The purpose of the apparatus is to extract foreign substances and mineral poisons from the circulation by tapping one of the large arteries , passing the blood through a purifier , and returning it to the heart by reinjection in a vein . <P> As simple as this is in principle , the method is complicated in procedure by many difficulties : 1 ) What is to be put back into the body to take the place of the missing blood ? A salt solution properly proportioned-the " normal saline solution " frequently injected after hemorrhages-can act as substitute for a considerable quantity of blood . A balanced amount of this is contained in the tube of the artificial kidney so that the blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein at the receiving end . 2 ) How is the blood to be cleansed without any halt in its passage through the tube ? By the substance of the tube itself , which is made of a porous material called celloidin . This is permeable to certain solids , among them mineral poisons , which it absorbs as the blood flows through ( " Dializing out " is the stock laboratory idiom for this method of removing impurities ) . 3 ) How can substances necessary to the blood be prevented from escaping through the porous tube ? They can not be prevented , but identical substances in compensating amounts are dissolved in the surrounding solution so that the blood can lose nothing that it is desirable for it to maintain . <P> Dr. Abel has not yet used his invention in human experiment . It has been employed with considerable success on dogs and a few larger animals . Until it is perfected , the usual doubts abound .
