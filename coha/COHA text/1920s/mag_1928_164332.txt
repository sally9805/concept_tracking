( See front cover ) <P> Destiny is a strange thing . For some men it flows evenly , broadening like a river . For others it expands like a gas . If the expansion is hurried there may be an explosion and a man 's career will settle to earth in floccules of soot . <P> Harry Ford Sinclair , oilman , who last week faced trial , a second time and less hopefully , for criminal conspiracy to defraud the U. S. , has learned a lot about Destiny . Sinclair is not yet 52 years old . He was born in Wheeling , W. Va . It is less than 25 years since he was first heard of in Wall Street and on Long Island as a wealthy young parvenu from the midwestern oilfields . It is not 30 years since he was the son of a village druggist in Kansas , a son who , when his father died , lacked the patience to keep the little business going . One day he came in from rabbit-hunting with a wound in his foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,000 for the loss of a toe . Something told him where to put the money ; not into the drug business , but into " mud sills , " the big logs men were using then in Kansas to bolster their oil derricks . <P> Young Sinclair 's logs brought a profit . He sank the money in an Oklahoma oil pool and came out with $100,000 . Soon he was a millionaire producer with properties dotted all through the midwest , from southern Kansas to northern Texas . He would spot a place , buy or lease it , develop it , sell out and look for another place . He kept control of richest wells . <P> In those early years , Harry Sinclair helped fix the standard type of U. S. oil-boom promoters . His energy was tremendous . His big smile and loud , harshly good-natured laugh would persuade strong men to work and inspire other gamblers ' confidence . But , if necessary , Harry Sinclair could drive strong men to work and outsmart the money fellows . He was , and still is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . His big laugh and heavy hand are the foils of a cunning mind . <P> Not until 1916 did he start branching out from production into Oil 's subtler phases-transportation , refining , marketing . He formed the Sinclair Oil &; Refining Co. out of seven small enterprises and built his own pipe-line to the Great Lakes . In 1917 he formed the Sinclair Gulf Corp . with his own fleet of ships . While larger companies were getting War contracts , he , an alert independent , developed a Latin-American trade . In 1919 he let his friends in on various " ground floors " of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corp. , a towering organization of world-wide schemes . <P> In the U. S. , outside of oil , he was making his dominance felt by bucking the baseball business with a league of his own . The National and American leagues were too much for him , however , and his costly Federal League died in its 2nd year ( 1915 ) . With racehorses he did better . He bought the services of famed Trainer Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came Zev , world 's champion . He bought a yacht , a private car , a Fifth Avenue mansion , an estate at Great Neck , L. I.
