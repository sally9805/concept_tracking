txt As the result . of developments at the Capitol today the passage in both branches of the Legislature of the Lbckwood committee 's bill which would enable the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to devote $100 , - 000,000 of its investable funds to housing relief in New York City seems assured The prospect is also that both Senate and Assembly will act favorably on five other measures already on the calendar of the Senate which are directly concerned with rents and housing . . The financial part of the Lockwood committee 's program , however , has been placed in jeopardy through the conduct of Senator Lockwood himself , which has greatly puzzled tits colleagues in the Senate . After serving notice that he would move to discharge the Cities Committee from further consideration of those of his committee 's bills not already reported , and after filing with Senator Gibbs , Chairman of the Cities Committee , a petition in which seven other members of that committee joined him , demanding that the bills be reported promptly , Senator Lockwood departed for New York City and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take action on his bills . Under the circumstances no action could be taken . At an earlier stage of the session the loss of time would not necessarily prove fatal . But final adjournment is only a week away and bills reported from committees automatically go on what is known as the general orders calendar in the Senate , where they remain until advanced to third reading . General orders is the last order of business in the Senate and is seldom reached during the closing week of a session . In fact , Senator Lusk announced today , while measures on the general orders calendar were under consideration , that the Senate probably would not return to that order of ? business again before the session ends next Friday . The general orders calendar in the Senate , during the final days , is the morgue to which undesirable measures are consigned if they have not already been left there . It will probably be necessary when the bills finally are reported ? by the Senate Cities Committee for Senator Lockwood to ask that they be immediately advanced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One solitary objection will prevent this , for bills can be advanced in this fashion only by unanimous consent . The petition sent.to Chairman Gibbs of the Cities Committee read as follows : " We , the undersigned. members of the Cities Committee , respectfully request that you report promptly for the consideration of the Senate , the bills introduced by the Joint Legislative Committee on Housing . " Very truly yours ; " CHARLES C. LOCKWOOD . " SEYMQUR LOWMAN . " HOMER E. DICK . " WILLIAM. -W . CAMPBELL . " PARTON SWIFT . " C. ERNEST SMITH . " JAMES J. WALKER . " PETER J. . " Senators Walker and were the only Democratic signers . As a result of the petition ; Senator Gibbs called a meeting of his committee , which was held immediately after the Senate had ? adjourned for the day . Only five members appeared , Senator Lockwood not being among them , and three , Campbell , " Dick and Smith , had signed the ' petition . The others were Senator Gibbs and Senator Fearon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we had no right to take action on any bills before us , especially in the absence of the introducer , " said Senator Gibbs . " Senator Lockwood ran out on us after asking that action be taken by the committee . I am frankly puzzled by his conduct . " The Metropolitan Life bill will probably be passed by the Senate on Monday night , according to Senator Lusk . Speaker Machold of the Assembly said tonight that he favored the enactment of this bill and that it would , be reported front the Rules Committee with a recommendation for final passage early next week . A survey today indicated that while a majority has not been positively pledged in the lower house , the leaders of the majority feel certain that ** the time the measure is placed on/ final passage. , it will Sun no danger of defeat , so long as the Speaker favors it . His attitude that he " could see no objection to the enactment of the bill " was regarded by others at the Capitol as a clear indication that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had succeeded in " showing " the Governor why the $100,000,000 project should receive legislative sanctien , consequently , it is believed that when the bill reaches the Governor it will receive his approval . " I can see no objection to the.Metropolitan Life bill becoming a law , " said the Speaker . " It is purely permissive . It has only a limited period to run  --  a year or so  --  for the company must take advantage of the tax , exemption op dwellings In order to avail Itself of the enabling act . It may do some good . The Rules Committee will report the bill to the Assembly early next week . " It was also made clear today by the leaders that the bill extending the period during which - the emergency rent laws shall continue to operate until Feb. 15 , 1924 , the bill extending for another year the period . during which new tax-H , exempt dwellings may be put up and three other measures dealing with relations between landlords and tenants , clarifying and broadening the existing laws in some respects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated : The bill compelling savings banks and insurance companies to invest 40 per cent . of their assets in mortgages and building loans , the hill creating a State Trade Commission to enforce the anti-trust statutes and prevent combinations in re straint of trade and the bill which would i take away from Judges the discretion they have exercised of imposing fines On violators of the Donnelly ? anti-trust law and make it compulsory to send such offenders to prison . The fate of half a dozen other measures in the Lockwood series , is in the balance . LOCKWOOD DEFENDS COURSE . Denies His Trip Placed Housing Bills in Jeopardy . Senator Lockwood denied last night that some of the - housing bills had been placed in jeopardy at Albany by his coming to New York . " The truth is , " he said , " that I was unable to get the committee to report the bilis to third reading for the con ' ? consideration of the Senate and that today I gave notice of a motion to discharge on all bills . Under the rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 had afght members of the committee sign a request to report the bills today but the Chairman declined to do it without a full meeting , and there was no quorum of the committee in Albany to hold a meeting . " Senator Lusk , the majority leader , asked for Saturday apd Sunday to go over the bills . I carne down to New York with the ; ull knowledge of the majority and minvIty leaders , leaving Albany on the 2:11i train , for the purpose of getting additional information and data on several of the bills and of conferring with Mr. Untermyer tomorrow ( Saturday ) morning , going back to Albany on the early afternoon train . " I have spent the last month solidly on this legislation and have made every move that could possibly have been made for the benefit of this legislation , and I deeply regret that such an erroneous story has been sent out from Albany . The financial part of the program has not been placed in jeopardy . The notice I gave today gives me they right to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills , one objection would have consigned them to the morgue , but with my notice they come before the Senate and it will take twenty-six objections to kill ' them .
