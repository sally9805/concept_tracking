Three Kings and three Queens made a full house in Sandringham , Norfolk , last week when King Haakon &; Queen Maud of Norway , King Christian &; Queen Alexandrine of Denmark sat down to take pink milk with King George &; Queen Mary of Britain . <P> The pink milk was a thoughtful gift from still another monarch , round King Fuad of Egypt . Ever since his illness , George of Britain has been peckish at his food . In recent weeks royal doctors have asked for special recipes and dishes to tempt the royal appetite . In Cairo , amiable King Fuad remembered that when he suffered from lassitude and loss of appetite , nothing was quite so good as a long cool glass of bright pink " preserved milk , " specially prepared by his Egyptian chef . Obligingly he sent a case to George V. Britain 's royal chef , M. Cedard , utilized the pink milk to make a pink milk pudding . All six of Their Majesties were said at Sandringham to have pronounced it " extraordinarily palatable . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
