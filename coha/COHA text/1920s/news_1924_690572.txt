txt The Hungarian Issue . I have read in today 's issue of Tug Times the account of the " ( lute ' sent to the three candidates far the Presidency concerning their attitude and the course of action which they will pursue , if elected , in regard to persecutions suffered by Jews ' under the present Ilungarian regime . May I as an American and a Jew register my protest against this proceeding ? I am not one who believes that the Jew should tolerate in silence oppression either of himself or of his fellow-Jews . When protest and intervention are needed , let them by all moans be made ; but let them be made through the legitimate channels of the American State Department , which has never turned a deaf ear , under any party , to the Cry of persecuted Jews In foreign lands . But to use the plight of the unfortunate Jewry of Hungary in order to create an Issue in an American political election seems to me not only unwise but insincere . If this " quiz ? is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapening way of dealing with a very tragic matter . If tt is seriously meant , it implies a complete misunderstanding of a grave problem In American political life . " QuIzes " such as this are the sort of thing calculated to lead to that arch vice of our democracy , the hyphenated vote . And the hyphenated vote , whether Irish-American or GermanAmerican or Jewish-American. is something to be discouraged and discountenanced , not lightly and artificially to be stimulated . Anti-Semitism in Hungary ought not , even through indirection. be suggested to the Jews of America as a decisive factor In a Presidential election . JAMES WATER - IAN WISE . New York .
