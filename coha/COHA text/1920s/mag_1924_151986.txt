One day last week a blind violinist played in the street in front of the Fort Pitt Hotel , Pittsburgh . Blind musicians have doubtless played there before-they are not infrequent . A music lover , goaded to desperation , will from time to time resort to bribery to make them stop . Thus they eke out their precarious livelihood . In this case , strange things happened . Men , hurrying past , paused , listened , stayed . A crowd gathered . An occasional ear was strained to catch the excellences of an unexpected technique . For two hours the crowd stood , respectfully attentive to the program of classical favorites-Schumann 's Traumerei , the prison scene from Trovatore , the Intermezzo from Cavalleria . Then the violin was silent again . A buzz of surprised admiration from the gathered audience ; a collection on the spot netted more than $50 for the sightless wanderer with the magic gift . <P> Sixteen years ago , a new star was heralded on the horizon of music . A young Dutch violinist , Peter van der Meer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recital in Carnegie Hall . His interpretation of Paganini 's Concerto in D Major met with especial acclaim . But soon Van der Meer was forgotten . In 1915 , he became blind , after a long illness . He spent six years in the Bellevue Hospital , Manhattan . Recently he was pronounced cured-but his sight had left him forever . <P> Peter Van der Meer , who enthralled a street crowd in Pittsburgh , has gone on his way southward , the magic violin under his arm . Where he is going he knows not . He has no money other than the gifts of casual hearers .
