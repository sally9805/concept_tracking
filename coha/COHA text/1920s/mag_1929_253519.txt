Sixty thousand Italians fired with religious zeal knelt in the Basilica of St. Peter 's last week and 100,000 more bared and bowed their heads under a chill driving rain outside . Signor Benito Mussolini was not present , but his daughter Edda was on her knees in a part of the Basilica usually reserved for princes of the blood . For the first time since 1870 several cabinet ministers had officially entered St. Peter 's . This was possible because the Papacy and the government of Italy had just patched up their 59-year-old feud by a treaty ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) ; and now a papist host had met for joyful and pious celebration . " Il Papa ! Il Papa ! " shouted the throng , which had now increased to a full 200,000 . " Il Papa Consolatore ! Il Papa Consolatore ! " <P> He came , entering St. Peter 's from the Vatican for the first time since his coronation ( exactly seven years ago last week ) . He was borne aloft on the Sedia Gestatoria , by attendants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitating great clusters of ostrich plumes upon long poles . His garment was white of a creamy richness , but lis robe was all bloodred . On his breast blazed the Crux Pectorale , a great cross of diamonds . And above the shapely , bespectacled head of Pope Pius XI towered the holy apostolic tiara of pure , massy gold . <P> He came as the lord spiritual , and for the first time since 1870 as the lord temporal . " Il Papa ! Il Papa Consolatore ! " chanted the kneeling multitude , " The Pope ! The Pope Consoler ! " Amid out bursts of the purest ecstasy the supreme pontiff then performed the miracle of the high mass , transforming things inanimate into the veritable body and blood . . . . <P> Because the Italo-Papal treaty had not yet been ratified , His Holiness had positively announced before entering St. Peter 's that he would not appear upon the balcony to bless the kneelers . However 200,000 Italians shouting " Il Papa ! Il Papa ! " in the rain are a powerful inducement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Relenting at last , the vicar of Christ briefly appeared and adequately blessed the sopping flock , but he did not impart the especially potent blessing " Urbi et Orbi ! " ( " to the city and to the world ! " ) . <P> Commenting afterward upon the new treaty , His Holiness exclaimed in vibrant tones of pious emotion : " It gives God back to Italy , and Italy to God ! " Of Benito Mussolini , who made the treaty possible , Pope Pius mystically observed : " There was revealed to us a man whom Providence caused us to meet . " <P> A scurrilous correspondent of the wet Chicago Tribune pretended that the Summits Pontifex also said , last week , " We consider the Volstead Act immoral and contrary to the laws of Christ . " Although the Savior and His disciples and the Virgin Mary did , indeed , all drink wine , it is impossible that the discreet Holy Father could have made such a remark within hearing of the world press .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
