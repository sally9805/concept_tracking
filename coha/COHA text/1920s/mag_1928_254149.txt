Britons who dearly love a Lord tut-tutted in dismay last week . <P> Tut was for the 27-year-old 21st Earl of Enroll , last of a line of Hereditary Lord High Constables of Scotland dating from 1315 . He was roundly called a " blackguard " in London , last week , by Judge Sir Maurice Hill who assessed $15,000 damages against him as the corespondent in a successful divorce suit brought by Major Cyril S. R. Hill . " Mrs. Hill , " said Judge Hill ( no relation ) , " is a woman of the lowest character and a liar , perhaps due to the influence of the corespondent . " <P> Tut was for Mrs. Kate Evelyn Merrick , " The Queen of London Nightclub Keepers , " who was sentenced to six months in jail for selling liquor after hours . Vexed were her sons-in-law , Baron de Clifford and the 13th Earl of Kinnoull.
