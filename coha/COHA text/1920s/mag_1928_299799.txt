One of the things which makes Massachusetts a doubtful State this year is Governor Alvan Tufts Fuller of Sacco-Vanzetti fame . His is the only workable Republican machine in the State . He is the nearest the State comes to having a G. O. P. boss . He wanted the nomination for the Vice-Presidency for himself and since he did not get it , he has been cool , in a quiet way , toward the Nominee with whom he wanted to run . <P> Following are excerpts from a speech which Republican Governor Fuller made last week to the Massachusetts American Legion : <P> " Who better can sound the tocsin that will start a revolt to raise the tone of American politics ? " <P> " Theodore Roosevelt once said that he could never discriminate against a man because he embraced the religion that came to him with his mother 's milk . " <P> " We must not allow our politics to be torpedoed by prejudice . " <P> " President Wilson . . . was one of this nation 's three greatest Presidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
