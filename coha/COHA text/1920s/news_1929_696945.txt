txt The Julius Rosenwald Fund in its report published today does not claim to be the sole or even chief exponent of the new philanthropy , but its varied activities reveal a nommon nhilosonhv of nivinz . This is seen in the statement that , should any of its projects become permanently dependent upon its help , it would feel that , to that extent , it had failed . A similar belief underlies and explains Mr. ROSENWALD 'S attitude toward permanent endowments : If a cause is good , it can count upon current support , once its usefulness is demonstrated ; if it is poor , it ought not to be bolstered up by permanent endowment . One of the obstructions to progress is vested interests in things as they are . His policy is notably shown by what the fund has done for negro education . It has not set up schools of its own but has given encouragement by expert advice and material aid in building schools where responsibility is taken by local authorities or where substantial support is given by negroes themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly five thousand schools , shops and teachers ' homes in 818 counties of fourteen Southern States . But the negroes themselves have contributed even more than the fund ( something more than $4,000,000 ) , while the States and counties in 1929 met 74 per cent of the cost as compared with only 18.4 per cent in 1914 . These figures suggest the progress toward the goal which the fund set for itself  --  withdrawal from this whole program with assurance that the schools will go on and multiply . While this has been the outstanding achievement of the . fund , it has sought out and will continue - to seek ' : out other " fields and " cultivate them intensively for a period . " Its chief contribution will be to demonstrate the practicability or impracticability of certain proposals . One of concern to every family between the extremes of riches and poverty is the provision of clinics to which they may go with assur- ance of careful diagnosis by competent physicians and proper medical care within the patients ' capacity to pay . The Rosenwald Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to a national committee in the study of the cost of medical care . The list of the objects to which this fund of $30,000,000 is being devoted " for the well-being of mankind " is long . Since the period covered by the report it has been lengthened by appropriations made to finance a survey of the relations of the Federal Government to education by the National Advisory Committee on Education appointed by Secretary WILBUR and to help forward the national campaign against illiteracy . The " new philanthropy " does not lack sympathy for men , women and children in present need . It would still urge the charity which will be needed when prophecies fail and tongues cease and knowledge vanishes away ; but it hopes to help make " permanent gains " by seizing upon social energy and turning it to prevent what even charity can not wholly cure . No one can read this brief report without new faith and hope that the most serious ' social problems will yield their solutions under such intelligent study .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
