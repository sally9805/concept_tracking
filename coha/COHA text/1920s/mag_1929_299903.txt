Lean , wiry Bacha Sakao , " The Water Carrier , " bandit King of Afghanistan sat , unconcerned , in the capital city of Kabul last fortnight while the King he drove from the throne , plump , oily Amanullah , prestidigitated in far off Kandahar to show his fitness to rule . <P> To suspicious Kandahar Afghans plump Amanullah promised last fortnight to show the famed Khirkai Shereef ( Prophet 's Cloak ) , a religious relic of great potency kept in a locked box which only " a man fit to be King " can open . The holy cloak has rarely been seen for the last 200 years . Bearded Afghans assembled by thousands for the show . <P> On a platform in Kandahar 's largest square stood throneless King Amanullah and a small ironbound box . Seizing the box firmly , plump Amanullah struggled with the iron hasp . Loudly he grunted , stoutly he tugged . So entertaining was the fat man 's performance that though he sweated and wrestled on the platform for two full hours , the entire audience remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to pall , Amanullah paused , cried aloud to Mohammed for assistance . A final tug , and the box flew open . Perspiring Amanullah held high Mohammed 's sacred cloak . Convinced , the Afghan audience prostrated themselves in the dust . <P> In the royal palace at Kabul , Padishah Habibullah , as the muscular Bacha Sakao now calls himself , opened no boxes , neither tugged nor grunted . He , debonair , wears tight kid gloves to show his gentility , brandishes two loaded rifles to show his dexterity , wears plentiful ammunition against emergencies , rules most of Afghanistan .
