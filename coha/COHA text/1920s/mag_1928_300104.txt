On one side of Jerusalem 's Wailing Wall , sole remnant of Solomon 's Temple , and holiest place in the world of Jewry , several thousand ululating Jews , of both sexes , gathered last week . Separating Jews from Jewesses , as it is ordained , was a large screen . They were celebrating Yom Kippur , the Day of Atonement . <P> On the other side of the Wall were many Moslems , who now own the Wall . They were vexed by the wailing prayers of the Jews . In fact , they threatened to stone them . <P> A troop of Anglo-Arab police perceiving the imminence of Moslem brickbats and desirous that the Day of Atonement should not become a day of stonement , tried to disperse the Jewish ululators . <P> They , thinking that the police meant to take away the holy screen dividing Jews from Jewesses , protested . Their ululations increased . They screeched , they snorted , they piped . They yauped . Several were belabored , dragged on the ground by the police . <P> Thereafter worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council of Palestine Jews succeeded in quieting the outraged worshippers , by declaring that it would beseech the League of Nations to restore the Wailing Wall from Moslem to Jewish ownership . <P> None the less , Jewish mobs adopted so truculent an attitude that H. C. Luke , Acting British High Commissioner of Palestine , felt obliged to cancel a reception planned in honor of officers from the world famed British battleship Royal Oak. * <P> *The Royal Oak affair ( TIME , March 26 to April 16 ) climaxed in the demotion of her Captain , Kenneth G. B. Dewar , and her Commander Henry M. Daniel , because they had rebuked their superior Admiral , contrary to the rules of discipline , for using " vile and insulting language . " Commander Daniel capitalized his notoriety by becoming a highly paid feature writer for the London Daily Mail . Captain Dewar , no capitalizer , suffered his demotion silently until last week , when he was promoted to be captain of the battle cruiser Tiger , Public sympathy and the potency of the press are responsible for Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will shortly be advanced to the rank of Rear Admiral .
