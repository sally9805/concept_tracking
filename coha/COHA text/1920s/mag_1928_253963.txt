The mortgage was being foreclosed on a broken-down Indiana onion farm which President Coolidge was given " for an unrendered service to agriculture . " There were bills to be signed-$6,792,000 for Army Housing , $125,000,000 for new Federal buildings throughout the land . People were already agitating about the next " Summer White House " and suggesting places as exotic as Hollywood , Calif. , despite the President 's known feeling that he should stay near Washington this summer . There was also the Jardines ' dinner , which President Coolidge had to attend alone , Mrs. Coolidge not feeling well enough , after her cold , to go out of doors until three days later . There was a holiday trip to Alexandria , Va. , to celebrate Washington 's Birthday , and there was a new harbor , at Hollywood , Fla. , to be blasted open by the touch of a button . Eclipsing all these there was Flood Control , around which the Coolidge week revolved . <P> The flood control bill reported to the House last fortnight called for estimated expenditures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Coolidge , whose recommendation had been for a $296,400,000 program with 20% borne by the States , began the week by calculating out loud that the Committee 's bill , of which the provisions were so sweeping that they might apply to every stream between the Appalachians and the Rockies , would triple itself before the work was finished , costing the U. S. more than anything it ever undertook except the last War . After this attack , the President assumed a role of arbitrator between Congress and the Army engineers who had told the Administration what to recommend . <P> The author of the House bill , Representative Frank R. Reid , is from Illinois . Fortunately for the President , Chairman Martin Barnaby Madden of the House Appropriations Committee is also from Illinois* Mr. Madden was called to the White House for a conference with Mr. Reid , Chief of Engineers Jadwin and President Coolidge . He emerged as the Coolidge spokesman for a compromise . <P> This move took a lot of wind out of the next figure on the scene , who was none other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson of Chicago , self-anointed savior of the Mississippi Basin . He blustered into town calling the Coolidge compromise plan " absurd , " saying he had come ( as chairman of the Thompson-invented Flood Control Conference ) to put over the Reid bill . President Coolidge invited him to luncheon . When he heard about the Madden appointment and President Coolidge 's willingness to waive the question of State-shared costs , except in principle , for the present , so that work might get started on the rivers below Illinois at once , Mayor Thompson 's bluster vanished . He went back to Chicago saying he would work to draft Mr. Coolidge again for President . When Representative Reid next called at the White House he found that his large friend had made no dent in the Coolidge opposition to the Reid bill .
