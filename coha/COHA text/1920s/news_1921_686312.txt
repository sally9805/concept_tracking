txt Marshal Foch with General Weygand left Paris this evening for London , where he has been called by the Premiers to discuss the details of the military steps to be taken if the Germans persist in their refusal to accept the allied terms when they meet the allied Ministers next week . The Temps tonight publishes the text of an agreement reached on Jan. 29 between Premiers Briand and Lloyd George with regard to penalties . This reads : " Resolution  --  If the , German Government fails to take necessary measures in view of execution of the demands drawn up by the Allies during the present conference and relative either to disarmament or reparations , the following penalties will be applied : " 1 . The date from which will begin to run the term of occupation of the Rhine territories will be that on which satisfaction has been given to the Allies . " 2 . There will be occupation of a new section of German territory , either the Ruhr or some other . ? " 3 . Suitable measures , customs or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Allies will oppose the entry of Germany into the League of Nations . " However , Mr. Lloyd George made the reservation that Germany might be permitted to meet the allied demand as to amount in other matter than that laid down . on Jan. 29 , and that the agreed penalties applied to the collection of the amounts rather than to the enforcement of any particular method then planned . He ' pointed out that it was a question whether the Allies could lay down flatly penalties if Germany did not accept the forty-two-year plan payment , inasmuch as the treaty says thirty years . But the Allies are in perfect accord that these sanctions apply to whatever methods of payment may be finally fixed and will thus apply to the Reparations Commission demands if the Germans refuse to accept the Jan. 29 plan calling for the payment of 100,000 , - 000,000 marks less than the commission asks for ; Germans Bring Counter-Proposals . Copyright , 1921 , by The Nes ' York Times Company , Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES , LONDON , Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference arrived here today and concurrently it is reported that Germany 's counter-proposals to the Allies ' reparations bill will consist of an offer to pay 150,000,000,000 gold marks ( 1.7,500,000 , - 000 ) in thirty years . The Entente had fixed the sum at 226,000,000,000 gold marks payable in forty-two years .. J. L. Garvin , whose relations with Lloyd George are close , thus defines the British attitude in regard to reparations : " British sentiment of every shade supports the demand tot ' reparations with no conditions save two . These are that neither the amount RUC method of securing it shall be impracticable . Otherwise we are committed t9. a farce . It is idle to etend that complete payment in cash in payments over a term of nearly half a century Is practicable .. To declare that it is not is no disputation of allied , and especially French , rights . " There is no reason why patience and a sense of realities should not bring the conference to an arrangement under which , at the lowest , France shall not be penalized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by German aggression . With firmness-on principle and reasonableness in method , it can be reached , but it will mean readiness to agree on a practicable total and readiness to accept . " As soon as , the Allies have entered the true figure on the credit side of their balance sheets , it will be time for interallied consultation and co-operation to . relieve the situation then disclosed . Justice demands from Germany economy and high taxation , and a higher level of financial and economic sacrifice than from France or her allies . We are at one with France in this . But the decisions to be taken this week , unlike previous deeisionA , may involve as a consequence definite events in Germany more serious than newspaper articles indicate . It must be frankly and soberly stated that British opinion will not support with the unanimity necessary for success a virtual reopening of the war for a patently impracticable demand .. It will not be prepared to spend money and , perhaps , life , or to intensify social distress in order to prove that the impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will readily adhere . "
