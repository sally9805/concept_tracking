txt For the year 1921 , . the League to Enforce Peace does well to remind us , , the expenses of the League of Nation are estimated at $4,200,000 . If the United States were a member , it would have to contribute $220,290 to4 the League budget of 1921 . Compare this modest cost of  --  the new machinery to prevent war with the cost of the system , ' under which , the world groans , of preparing for future wars . In 1913 , the year of . peace , /Congress appropriated nearly $220,000,000 for military and naval expenses . In 1918 , . when the United States was in the great war , the bill . rose to the enormous sum of more than $10,220,000 , - 000 . In 1920 , in a state of actual if not technical peace , the navy budget is ' $132,000,000 ' and the army budget $377 , 000,000 .

She has entered upon a program of naval expansion which will cost her $235 , - 000,000 ' or more in the next few years . In 1914 her army appropriation Was $49,000,000 . This year , deducting as a special Or extraordinary expense the cost of the Siberian expedition , estimated at $100,000,000 , the ' army appropriation has risen to $105,000 , - 000 , more than twice . the figures of 1914 ; and she is to spend $200,000,000 for . aviation . From $224,000,000 in 1914 , the British ittrmy appropriation has risen to $600,000,000 in 1920 , and the , naval appropriation has been immensely increased . Making ' all allowance for the increased cost of living , materials , construction and so on , the growing size of these bills is gigantic .

In time the custom and tradition of peace may supplant the long tradition and , custom of war . In time armaments may be reduced and all the nations be freed from the crushing burden of taxation for armies and navies . The only insurapce against war is the League . The cost of belonging to it , as the League to Enforce Peace says , would be " exactly one-tenth of 1 per " cent . of what we spent on arm " aments during a single year before " the war , while it would amount to " something like two-thousandths of 1 " per cent . of what the direct cost of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indirect cost of war can only be guessed .
