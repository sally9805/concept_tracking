It used to be a custom-it was until 1913-that every year the Vice President gave a party for Congress . Quite a reception it was , the invited including 96 Senators , 435 Congressmen , Cabinet members and Justices of the Supreme Court , Army and Navy officers of high degree , a few hundred diplomats-a crush . But the modest Marshalls and the retiring Coolidges gave up the demonstration . This year the Daweses , with a large house and plenty of money , decided to resume it . In fact it is to take place very soon . <P> The reception is certain to be a mob scene , the envy of Producers D. W. Griffith or Cecil B. De Mille . Imagine the quandary of even a well-informed newspaper correspondent , cornered perhaps by Pra Sundra Vachana , First Secretary of the Siamese legation , or Abu-el-Enein Salem Effendi , second attach of the Egyptian legation , with the inquiry : " Monsieur , will you be so kind as to point out to me the gentlemen who have recently distinguished themselves in the operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with assurance : " Well , now I 'll point out the celebrities of the Senate . . . . <P> " Of course there 's your host , the Vice President . He began by making all the Senators angry by proposing that they put a limit to their talk . Every now and then he still speaks of that limitation , but the whole incident seems in a fair way of being forgotten . You see that man with the iron grey hair and iron jaw-rather a fine figure - that is Senator Jim Reed , a Democrat . He is dissociated from his Democratic colleagues but he has put up a fine fight on nearly every issue that has come before this Congress . He poured forth fire and brimstone on the World Court , on the Debt settlements . He is one of the fiercest attackers of prohibition . You see that map with the big weather-worn face ? That is Mr. Borah . He is our finest orator . The galleries are always full when he is going to speak . He belongs to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee-is about the same as Jim Reed 's . They are the two most forceful men in the Senate , but each of them is more likely than not to be opposed to the rest of his party on any given question . That is why they are not leaders . That erudite looking man over there is one of the two Mormons in the Senate-Senator King of Utah . He talks more than any other Senator . He has something learned to say on almost every subject , but he does not carry many votes with him . That good looking , young-looking fellow just to your left-he is David Reed , a cousin of the other Reed but a Republican . He is rising fast , a staunch supporter of the Administration . . . . <P> " There is Norris . He is a Progressive Republican , perhaps the ablest of the insurgent group-now that LaFollette is dead . He keeps the regulars hopping . That dark , short young man over there , immaculately dressed , is young LaFollette who succeeded his father . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done much yet .
