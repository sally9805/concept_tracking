So eager was President Hoover to push ahead with Farm Relief , to catch this year 's harvest at the crest , that last week , before its membership was completed , he ordered his new Farm Board to assemble in Washington for its initial meeting July 15 . Five men had accepted service on this nine-man board : Alexander H. Legge , Chairman ; James Clifton Stone , Vice-Chairman ; Carl Williams , C. B. Denman , Charles C. Teague . Secretary of Agriculture Hyde , the sixth member ex officio , was despatched by the President to the Mid-West , there to search out likely candidates for the other three places , to interview them , report on their fitness . <P> With a two-thirds quorum already chosen , the Board was ready to organize . Its first duty was to get itself squared away in Washington . Looking for possible office space , inspectors went through the old Southern R. R. building , at Pennsylvania Avenue and 13th Street , lately acquired by the U. S. Secretaries , assistants , experts , clerks-the large personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Wheat was the Board 's primary problem . Between the Board and that crop , the harvest of which was moving north out of Kansas at the rate of 25 miles per day , a hard-driven race had developed . The Board 's first aim was to interpose its relief machinery before this year 's wheat crop heaps up on last year 's carry over and again depresses prices . A scant two months remained in which to erect dikes against the grain flood . In that time a wheat advisory council had to be named by the Board . The council had to make recommendations as to methods of handling the crop . The wheat co-operatives had to join together to create a stabilization corporation which could borrow from the Board . <P> Last week President Hoover was still searching for a wheat representative on his Farm Board and having a hard time finding someone satisfactory to the varying shades of political opinion in that major branch of husbandry . When Chairman Legge accepted his appointment , he was in a Kansas wheat field , watching the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of his Board . <P> Aged 63 , farm-born , business-bred ( International Harvester for 40 years ) , Chairman Legge had nothing to say in advance of his new work . " Results , not words , " his friends said for him . <P> To give the Board a headstart on the wheat problem , the Department of Agriculture last week began a nationwide movement to get wheat-growers to increase their own storage facilities on the farm . Purpose : if each wheat man stored a part of his own crop , the autumn market peak would be diminished , prices would be steadied , car shortages and terminal embargoes would be avoided . <P> It was the Hoover hope to have the Farm Board installed on recess appointments and swinging along at full stride before the Senate reconvenes Aug. 19 to take up the members ' confirmations.
