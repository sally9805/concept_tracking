In London , one F. H. Wallis issued a slogan : " Flying for the million . " When pooh-poohed , he told how he had invented an airplane so light it can be lifted by an ordinary man , so small it can be driven by a six-horsepower motorcycle engine , so sturdy it can fly 70 miles an hour , so cheap to manufacture that it can be sold for $1,000 . Next month , hopeful Wallis will test his plans . <P> At Washington , D. C , the National Air Transport Co. ( recently organized $10,000,000 commercial air service company ) drafted a committee on Public Relations , appointed Will H. Hays chairman . <P> In Detroit , the National Air Transport Co. ( see above ) mailed to the Curtiss Airplane Co. the biggest single order for commercial aircraft ever placed in the U. S.-ten carrier pigeon planes . They will be used to carry from city to city , at night , those communications that are too important to delay and not important enough to telegraph . <P> At Mitchel Field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths in 31,363 flights , in 25 months . <P> Out of England , in the columns of the Daily Graphic , came the preposterous story of one Charles Gligorin , young Austrian inventor , who claimed to have " deeply interested " the British Air Ministry with a design for a monoplane flying on the principle of Herr Anton Flettner 's rotorship ( TIME , Nov. 17 , Dec. 8 , Mar. 2 , July 6 ) . Replacing wings with rotors , retaining the normal propeller , Inventor Gligorin claimed a 240-horsepower motor would drive his monoplane at 300 miles an hour , would enable it to rise almost vertically like a helicopter . It would , he claimed , cross the Atlantic in 12 hours , be able to land in a city street . The Graphic stated that the Air Ministry had offered to build an experimental model according to Gligorin 's plan . Awaiting Gligorin 's arrival , the U. S. remained highly skeptical.
