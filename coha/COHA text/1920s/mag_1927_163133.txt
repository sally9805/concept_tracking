Stepping on the 5,900-yard Oakley Country Club links at 4:24 a. m. , James A. McLaughlin , 35-year-old Harvard law professor , set out to win a bet that he could not play 126 holes ( seven rounds ) of golf in twelve hours without extending himself . Able Mr. McLaughlin surpassed his estimate , played 130 holes in 11 hours , 21 minutes , finished in good condition . And , what is more , he averaged a fraction under 82 strokes for each round . His pedometer showed that he had walked 36 miles . Strong men and duffers were awed .
