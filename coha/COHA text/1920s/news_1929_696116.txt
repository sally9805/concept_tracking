txt Helen Morgan , actress and night club entertainer , was acquitted last night ? by a jury before Federal Judge Bdwin S. Thomas of a charge of maintaining a common nuisance under the national prohibition act at Helen Morgan 's Summer Home , 134 West Fifty-second Street . Miss Morgan did not . take the stand in her own behalf , nor did the single witness called by the defense attempt to refute any of the testimony offered by government witnesses . The jurors retired at 4:35 P. M. , deliberated until about 7 P. M. , when they went out for dinner . They resumed their deliberations at 8:15 and rapped on the jury room door , signifying they had arrived at a ver : diet , at 8:55 P. M. Their actual deliberations lasted three hours and five minutes . The first ballot , it was said , stood eight to four for acquittal . At 7 P. M. only one juror was holding out for conviction . Defendant Cries at Verdict . Miss Morgan was pale and trembling ' when the jury came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint . She regained partial control of herself and then , ' begin . ping to cry softly , she was soon weeping unrestrainedly . Her only comment was : " I do n't want to think any more about it . " The court room was quickly cleared . There was no demonstration , as only a comparatively few persons had been able to produce the credentials required to get into the Federal Building after closing hours . Judge Thomas seemed puzzled by the verdict ane cupped his hand to his ear after it had been announced . Special Deputy United States Attorney Leslie Salter , who prosecuted the case , seemed disappointed and mildly surprised . J. Arthur Adler , Miss Morgan 's attorney , showed his pleasure and issued a statement that such a verdict had been expected and was just . Defense Calls One Witness . Miss Morgan 's failure to take the stand in her own behalf was a distinct surprise . As late as yesterday morning Mr. Adler had said she would " certainly " testify , and that two or more ae litional witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this announced program , however , her attorney called only one witness , Myron S. Bentham , Miss Morgan 's manager . who testified that she had never ? been other than a salaried employe at any night club . The defense did not attempt , through witnesses , to refute a. single charge made on the stand against Miss Morgan by the two Federal prohibition agents whose testimony constituted the whole of the government 's case . The agents testified that liquor had been sold at Helen Morgan 's Summer Home , that she was the great drawing card there and had given them the " impression " that she was a partner in the business . They attempted to link her with an actual sale of intoxicants by testifying that , when they had ordered brandy , at her suggestion , she had sent a waiter to her home for six quarts , two pints of which they said they had later purchased . They also alleged that on one occasion Miss Morgan had become intoxicated and had thrown dollar bills to negro entertainers at the Furnace Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stand yesterday morning immediately after the government had rested and Judge Thomas had denied motions by Mr. Adler to dismiss the charges . He said he had been an actors ' representative for thirty years , having managed such stars as Irene Bordoni , Ina Claire , Laurette Taylor , Alice Brady , Leon Errol , W. C. Fields , Mary Eaton and others . He said he had drawn up Miss Mor- gan 's contract to appear m " Show Boat , " a Ziegfeld production . Mr. Bentham testified he had drawn " all " of Miss Morgan 's night club contracts with Nicholas Blair , who was manager of the Helen Morgan Club at 151 West Fifty-fourth Street , and later of the Summer Home at 134 West Fifty-second Street . He said she had refused earlier night club offers , but had finally accepted a contract with Blair at a salary of $750 a. week , for work between 1 and 3 A. M. , on week days only . Later she signed another contract at $1,000. a week , to include work on Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract at $1,250 a week . " She did not share in the profits , " said Mr. Bentham , " and had no interest in the club other than her salary . She never worked in a night club after the June raid and said she would never play in one again at any price . " Under cross-examination Mr. Bentham admitted he had had some little " trouble " with Miss Morgan , but it had not been about contracts . He said all artists were " that way " and she was " no different . " He was still her manager , he said , and she still owed him money . He admitted he had been to the Summer Home on several occasions , but said he had never bought liquor there because his visits had been in the Summer and he did not drink during the hot season . He had liquor on his yacht , he volunteered with a smile . Asked About Refusal of Fee . " Did n't Miss Morgan once refuse to pay you your 10 per cent of her salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and therefore did not owe you anything , and then did you not write Blair for a copy of this contract ? " asked Mr. Salter . " She never said a word to me about me not being entitled to commissions , " replied the witnes.7 .. Then Mr. Salter mentioned an alleged contract between Miss Morgan and Blair , the one he had referred to as having been drawn by her , and asked the witness if his files contained a copy of it . Mr. Bentham said it was not in the file he had brought into court . He was asked to search his office for it and report later , but when his name was called at the afternoon session there was no response . While on the stand Mr. Bentham admitted he had advised Miss Morgan to accept a contract from Blair although he knew at the time that the club had been raided by Federal agents . He added , however , that the night club was one of the most " exclusive " in the city . At the conclusion of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a murmur of surprise and disappointment from spectators . Miss Morgan , during Mr. Bentham 's cross-examination , had displayed extreme nervousness . Her hands - shook and she seemed on the verge of tears which . however , she held back until the end of the government 's summing up . As the jury filed out to deliberate she was in tears . Adler Assails Dry Methods . Mr. Adler , in summing up , attacked the prohibition enforcement methods used to " entrap " Miss Morgan . He stressed the large sums of money spent by the Federal agents in obtaining evidence and declared they  --  had been out to get some one of prominence , some one whose name " would appear on the front page . " Referring to agents ' testimony that Miss Morgan had sent a waiter to her home for brandy and instructed him to tell her mother to send a certain kind , Mr. Adler said ; " They deliberately planned to entrap Miss Morgan . Can you imagine men stooping so low as to attempt to make you believe Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the widest stretch of imagination , believe that Miss Morgan , . who had met these agents but a short time before , advised the wife of one of them to go into the night club business by getting three good fellows who , in case of trouble , would take the blame and say she was only an employe ? " Yet , for your money as taxpayers , you get this kind of enforcement . You get men who shoot at women and fire on defenseless boats so they can justify themselves before certain hypocrites . A conviction in this case would be an approval of enforcement activities which have been condemned throughout the country . " " Lie " by Agents Defended . Defending the agents In his summing up , Mr. Salter referred to their admissions that they had " lied " to Miss Morgan in seeking evidence . " Of course the agents had to tell a lie ! " he thundered . " But the government approves of that . Had the defense been able to get one witness who could truthfully deny the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here and it would have been shouted from the housetops . " I compliment the defendant in this case . She has conducted herself like a lady in court . There has been no wise-cracking around here . But this woman , with her God-given talents , has sold her birthright for a mess of pottage . She has betrayed her talents for $1,000 a week . " Your duty is to think of the youth of our land , the young girls especially , who look at stars like Helen Morgan and say if she can play in a play like ' Show Boat ' and then make $1,000 a week extra in some night club , why ca n't they do likewise ? By such conduct she would influence young girls to go slinking down the pathway of corruption and crime . " Judge Thomas 's charge to the jury lasted just thirty minutes . He told the jurors they must first decide whether the Summer Home had been a nuisance under the prohibition law . He explained that , under the law , any place where liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then said that it was not necessary to establish that Miss Morgan had been a proprietor . but only to satisfy themselves beyond a reasonable doubt that she had aided , abetted , counseled or assisted the proprietors in maintaining a nuisance , in order to justify a verdict of guilty . The jury retired at 4:35 P. M. , deliberated until about 7 P. M. and then went out for dinner , returning at 8:15 P. M. Sentences for Others Today . While the jury was out Judge Thomas granted Mr. Salter 's motion to postpone sentence upon the seven co-defendants of Miss Morgan , who had pleaded guilty , until this morning . Leo Judson , proprietor of the Club Shadowland , at 102 West Fifty-third Street ; Benny Levy , a doorman at that club , and another Benny Levy , bartender , all of whom had pleaded guilty to a charge of maintaining a nuisance at the club , appeared for sentence Lsfore Judge Thomas . Each received a suspended sentence of four months and was placed on probation for two years . Judson was fined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorman $100.
