Wickham Steed , onetime Foreign Editor of The Times , contributed an article to the Review of Reviews ( London ) . In his article , he reproduced a letter , published in The Times in 1919 , signed by " F. S. T. " The argument of this letter was that the wealthy classes should set an example to the Nation by imposing upon themselves a capital levy . It continued : <P> " I have been considering this matter for nearly two years , but my mind moves slowly . I dislike publicity and I hoped some one else might lead the way . I have made as accurate an estimate as I am able of the value of my own estate and arrived at a total of about 580,000 . I decided to realize 20% of that amount or , say , 120,000 , which will purchase 150,000 of the new War loan and present it to the Government for cancellation . " <P> " F. S. T. , " said Mr. Steed , " is Premier Stanley Baldwin and it is well known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury acknowledged receipt of 150,000 of the War loan for cancellation . " His example , however , only inspired others to the amount of 350,000 , a total of 500,000 in all .
