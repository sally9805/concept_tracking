" Lucky Strikes ! A flood of reminiscences sweeps across my mind . I heard first of this fine cigaret many years ago in San Francisco where my sons and thousands of soldiers were confined in an Army Hospital . I recall The American Tobacco Company 's generosity in giving thousands of cigarets to the wounded boys and how delighted they were in smoking them . I recommend Lucky Strikes because they are kind to my throat . " <P> ERNESTINE SCHUMANN HEINK <P> By printing this testimonial beside a picture of Singer Schumann Heink and stating unequivocally : " When smoking , she prefers Lucky Strikes because they give the greatest enjoyment and throat protection , " the American Tobacco Co. broke an advertising precedent ( TiME , Feb. 7 ) . Theretofore no cigaret manufacturer dared state baldly that women smoke . <P> Last week another precedent was broken . Singer Schumann Heink , in Atlanta , Ga. , refuted the testimonial : " I never smoked a cigaret in my life , and , although I do n't condemn women who do , neither do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sons are not permitted to smoke in my presence on the days I sing . " Rarely had so gross an error crept into the advertising of an honest firm . <P> The explanation was simple . A whippersnapper told his chiefs that he could get an endorsement of Lucky Strikes from Singer Schumann Heink ; she had long been a friend of his family . To her he said that she could help him earn some money , and she , benign woman , signed a note saying that she knew many American soldiers smoked Lucky Strikes in France . Later , too few questions were asked about this windfall testimonial . However , Singer Schumann Heink 's reputation is too solid , she is too revered , to be injured by this boy 's hoax . <P> In spite of this error , The American Tobacco Co. remains the first to print a woman 's testimonial of cigarets-Actress Alia Nazimova 's " . . . Even when I go abroad I carry with me my little trunk of Luckies-and enjoy a puff from America . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
