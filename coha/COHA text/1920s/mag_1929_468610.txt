I REMEMBER the bitter contro versy which arose over the argument ment , Should a lady ride a bicycle ? ' In those days a woman 's legs were supposed to be known only to her ? self and God . Before that it had been Could a real lady ride outside an omnibus ? ' or ' Might a virtuous female ride alone in a hansom cab ? ' The woman question would seem to have been always with us . The landlady of a hotel in the Ripley Road much fre ? quented by cyclists went to the length of refusing to serve a rider who , on close inspection , turned out to be of the feminine gender . The Surrey magis ? trate supported her . The contention was that a good woman would not wear knickerbockers ? bloomers , ' they were then termed ? that consequently any woman who did wear bloomers must be a had citizeness , in legal language a dis ? orderly person . This decision turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the cyclist trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright young genius oc ? curred the ' dropped bar . ' A bishop 's wife clothed in seemly skirts rode a bicycle through the streets of Leaming ? ton . " All this , which I quote from Jerome K. Jerome , My Life and Times , is delight ? fully amusing ; it gives us a comfortable feeling of superiority over the England of the late nineties and the first years of the present century . Only Mr. Jerome 's contemporaries in the United States recollect that our own attitude toward women , even toward women upon bicycles , was much the same in those days . Do you doubt this ? Reflect thenupon the position of the American woman in sport during those very years . In 1895 , when the first woman 's golf championship was held , there were not more than a hundred women who played the game in this country . The winner , Mrs. C. S. Brown , turned in the amazing score of 132 for the eighteen-hole course at the Meadowbrook Club . Lawn ten ? nis was at the time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southampton ; the competitors wore long skirts and wide hats , they served underhand . Feminine participation in track and field athletics was confined to a small minority of the girls in the women 's colleges , who , in turn , were a small minority of the women of the nation . Only a handful of collegians attempted basket ball . There were no swimming championships and if there had been , the bathing suits worn by women would have prevented active competition . There were no skating meets , no contests in field hockey , in archery , in squash racquets , in fact , al ? most no competitive sport of any kind for women , except perhaps a little garden-party tennis , a little croquet now and then , or for the more advanced a round of golf ? after the men had finished . That was the status of sport for women in the United States during the latter part of the last century . Girls ' athletics sprang from men 's ath ? letics and , as women began to obtain more freedom , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as their brothers . The answer came after due thought that there was really no reason why they should n't . And they did . The advances made during the past thirty years scarcely need elabora ? tion . Since 19 ; 26 six women have swum the English Channel , one of them the mother of two children . Miss Helen Wills , the woman 's tennis champion , last summer defeated Mr. Frederick Mercur , the seventh ranking man player . Miss Glenna Collett , the woman 's golf champion , allowed a handicap of seven bisques , defeated Jess Sweetser by three and two at about the same time . Natu ? rally this does not mean that Miss Wills can defeat Mr. Tilden or that Miss Collett is as good as Mr. Jones It certainly does show , however , that women are no longer far behind men in the sports which they were just beginning to learn some thirty years ago . To-day there are women polo teams , women track teams , women field hockey teams , squash racquets teams , basket ball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every branch of athletics under the sun except in games Iike foot ? ball , for which they are obviously un ? suited . That this growing participation of women in sport has been a magnificent thing for them and for the race , no sen ? sible person would deny . You have only to watch the modern girl , at home in the saddle , in the water , or at the wheel of an automobile , to look back with as ? tonishment and pity upon the women of thirty years ago . If you like statistics ? and I do not ? you will discover that the health of the nation has improved im ? measurably since women in increasing numbers began to take up outdoor sports . Nor is it generally realized that the freedom and convenience of woman 's dress to-day are largely due to her in ? terest in games and sports . The spread of athletics among women has brought blessings of a less material but even more important kind . The lessons learned upon the fields of sport are the lessons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were forced to learn long ago in business : the advantages of co-operation , of fairplay , and that self-reliance which was not a characteristic of the Victorian woman . We take much for granted at the present time ; but we have simply to look upon the position of women thirty years ago to realize that the world does advance , and to be impressed with how much we owe to their steadily increasing interest in sport . Despite many of the benefits that women have reaped from outdoor exer ? cise , there are signs , unfortunately , that some of the excesses which have come to characterize men 's athletics are begin ? ning to spread to athletics for women . American athletics have done more than any one other thing to establish the health and strength of American youth . At present our sports are copied by every nation in the world . The youngster in this country swims , rides , and plays games as a matter of course ; his health profits without the old-fash ? ioned systematic attempt to build up his constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built for Har ? vard University only a few square feet out of several thousand will be devoted to pulleys , weights , and dumb-bells ; the rest will be given over to games and sports arenas . But although athletics have done a vast amount for the health of the youth of the United States , the tendency in recent years has been to over-stress competition as opposed to play . Abuses have crept in , commercialization of ama ? teur games has increased rapidly , and at the same time there has come into exist ? ence a large , highly organized class of men professionally dependent upon sport , including many news-gatherers , heads of athletic associations , coaches and trainers , as well as others far more devoted to games for the sake of their own careers than for the sake of the game . These men have , it is true , suc ? ceeded in producing world 's champions in every branch of athletics ; but in so doing they have often neglected the great mass of American youth who need physical development and recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the situation by explaining that there is not too much emphasis on athletics nowadays , but too little . " It is appar ? ent to everyone , " says he , " that we are going to extremes in intercollegiate com ? petition , that we have a highly special ? ized team in the field and a lot of bally ? hoo in the bleachers . It seems obvious that as long as this discrepancy exists , we are not pursuing the proper policy in athletics . " And it might be added that Mr. Tacusch 's remarks apply with equal force to sport in extra-collegiate athletics , in clubs , and in a few boys ' schools . These are some of the evils that are likely to spread to women 's sport both within and outside the colleges if it maintains its present trend . To understand the nature of the dan ? ger it is necessary first to realize that sport for women is no longer confined , as it used to be , to the colleges and the socially desirable country clubs . Nu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mass of girls all over the land who are interested in athletics to-day . Nearly all the big industrial concerns , the big banks , the big insurance companies , and large corporations conduct sporting ac ? tivities for their employees . There are , it is true , some college women on the teams ; but it is mainly from these girls ? girls in factories , girls in offices , girls in shops ? that the material comes which makes up our women 's Olympic teams every four years . In some cities the principal corporations are organized in groups like the Industrial Recreation Federation of New Haven which , in con ? junction with the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. , has leagues and regular playing rules in half a dozen different sports for both sexes . And it is the great mass of American girls , the thou ? sands and thousands of girls in industry ? not the comparatively few who attend college ? who are most likely to be in ? jured if the evils which now exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no Vassar-Smith basket ball game , no Wellesley-Bryn Mawr crew race , because the authorities in the colleges believe in sport as a form of recreation rather than as a means of establishing athletic superiority . Those entrusted with the direction of women 's sports in this country are without exception women of high principle and high educational standards , women trained for their work , who have a firm belief in the value of real sport . Under their leadership there has been developed in the colleges a broad program of athlet ? ics that includes not merely one or two games for organized competitive teams , but many sports that can be enjoyed by everyone in after-life . They have suc ? ceeded in emphasizing the spirit of play in athletics , something free from all over ? strain and exploitation . This , unfortu ? nately , is not generally true of those who have charge of industrial sport . Obviously at the present time one can not dogmatize upon the physical ability of women to stand the strain and stress of athletic competition ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport women are far more in need of medical supervision than men . Those who doubt this statement should have stood beside me during the eight-hun ? dred-meter run in the Olympic Games at Amsterdam last summer Below us on the cinder path were eleven wretched women , five of whom dropped out before the finish , while five collapsed after reaching the tape . I was informed later that the remaining starter fainted in the dressing room shortly afterward . The fact is that the women in many branches of sport have begun to ape the athletics of men , and in so doing have succeeded in making almost every single mistake the men have managed to make . Certain forces are attempting for their own ends to entangle the girls of this country in highly organized competitive sport . Briefly , there are among them the following interested bodies : First , political organizations such as Chambers of Commerce or Boards of Trade in towns and cities , which see in a championship woman 's laisket ball team an excellent advertisement for the com ? community . Some such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauty Contests . Second , industrial concerns , sporting-goods houses , department stores , and other big corporations which also derive publicity and benefit in the same way . Third , the churches , particularly the churches in the smaller cities and towns . Some of the worst athletic leagues in the country are the inter-church leagues , because , although their leaders are men of character they are frequently ignorant of many fundamentals of modern ath ? letic problems . Fourth , certain national sporting or ? ganizations which for their own sake desire a woman 's championship system with all that this implies , in order that they may extend over women 's athletics the power they now exert over athletics for men . Let me take you to a typical contest between the women 's basket ball teams of two large industrial concerns . The men 's team of the Johnson Manufactur ? ing Company is playing the William Smith 's Sons Corporation and , as an added attraction , the athletic directors have arranged that the girls of each com ? pany shall meet in a preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hundred young men and girls sitting on the floor right up to the lines of the court ; the smoke is so thick you can hardly see the closed windows at each end of the room , and the sultry atmos ? phere of a rainy spring evening outside is deepened and intensified within . Add to this the keenness of the struggle , the hundreds of watching ? and sometimes leering ? eyes , the incessant cheers and jibes from the spectators , the emotion produced by constantly being tumbledagainst the front row of onlookers , and the result is that the players are in a brittle state of taut excitement . The nerves of the strongest are on edge ; one of the players , weaker than the rest , collapses completely before the crowd . In the dressing room she becomes racked by hysterics , her body tightly drawn into a knot : for the moment she is a nervous invalid . Although she is physically sound , so acute is her nervous suffering that it will be weeks before her health is fully restored . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ' teams tells us that " the girls were worked up to a frenzy of nervous excitement . They pulled hair , hit one another viciously in the ribs with sharp elbows , tripped one another , tore one another 's clothing , in fact did everything but play basket ball . Finally one girl kicked her opponent a terrific kick in the abdomen which sent her sprawling to the floor , doubled up with pain . " If this were an isolated case it would hardly be worth mention ? ing ; but it is the sort of thing which too often happens in championship contests with big stakes at issue . Nor is a little roughness , without which sports of this kind are almost impossible , anything to view with alarm . When , however , kick ? ing , biting , tearing , and tripping are in ? cluded in the roughness , it is nearly time to draw the line . " The physical effect of games under such conditions , " says a leading director of women 's athletics , " is often dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when the girl gets through without apparent distress ? may require several weeks for complete recovery . " The possibilities of danger to women in strenuous sports are plain enough even when they are conducted by capable , competent , and conscientious women directors . It would be an excellent thing if the athletic directors of the various commercial and industrial con ? cerns throughout the country were leaders of this type . Unfortunately they are almost always men and , more over , men not interested primarily in the physical well-being of their charges . They are not alert , and indeed can not be alert , to see that the girls under their care do not compete at times when they should not , and thus run the risk of some permanent serious injury . It is obvious that the attitude of these men toward games is quite different from that of the trained women directors of physical education in colleges and universities . And , after all , why should it not be different ? For if the physical director of a great university turns out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeating everyone in the state , it will remain unknown because there is no inter ? collegiate competition in which it can shine . But if the physical director of the Insomnia Insurance Company can turn out such a team , or better still , develop a girl athlete from the cost-ac ? counting department who can run a hundred yards in record time , his name is made . Not merely will the girl 's photograph -- with his own , perhaps ? be printed in every daily newspaper in the city ; but his feat will redound to the credit of the corporation . And when the physical director helps his employer , he helps himself . Naturally this gentle ? man whose job depends on turning out a winning team is primarily interested in that team , and only secondarily in teaching the girls a game they can play and enjoy . The more girls come out for the team , the less time he will have . it is true , to look after the ordinary indi ? vidual , but the more chance he will have of developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. M. Bilik has remarked : " Various industrial corporations hire star ath ? letes as physical directors , their only qualifications being their athletic records and pull with some official of the com ? pany . These trainers are utterly igno ? rant of the principles of physical educa ? tion , and yet they are entrusted with the care and health of the employees of our institution . ' The aim is a noble one ; but a potential stevedore is hardly the right man for the task . Thus our much-advertised women athletes of to-day do not come mostly from the schools where properly qualified educationists control the situation ; but from the athletic asso ? ciations of department stores , insurance companies , and industrial plants . " These are the sort of persons who have the health of the American girl in their hands . What they teach is not , as one prominent educator observed , " physical training , " but rather " physical strain ? ing . " In the industrial and commercial leagues the girls from offices and fac ? tories ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise ? are being forced into competitive sport , often without medical supervision of any sort , by masculine directors far more interested in the size of their pay check than in the health of the athletes in their charge . Meanwhile what of the selected few , the ones who succeed in making a team like the organization that competes in the Olympics ? An observant man who traveled with the last American Olympic team testified as follows : " The whole voyage was the worst possible thing for the women on board . It was all entirely animalistic ; the competitors , both men and women , ate , slept , and worked daily like animals rather than human beings . Not once during the entire trip of six weeks was any appeal made to the morals of these young people , any sug ? gestion of the Olympic ideal , or of what the Olympic oath meant , any hint that in the eyes of the world at Amsterdam these young people represented their country . Nothing in fact but a strenu ? ous effort to develop winners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the management of the last Olympic team and the management of a kennel ! " Have you ever stood near the track exits of a great city railroad terminal in September and watched the girls pour out from the trains after a summer at camps in the mountains or by the lake shores ? Tanned , healthy , sturdy , these girls have grown in every way in three short months ; grown so that their parents hardly know them . They are more mature , more self-reliant , more confident of life ; they are proud of their ability to manage a canoe , of the mountain peaks they have climbed , of the distances they have swum , and the miles they have rid ? den on horseback . The participation in athletics of these girls has not been sacrificed to the needs of a few star per ? formers ; at camps of this sort every girl has been in sport all summer long . Here is the best of athletics at its best , in con ? trast to those factory and industrial leagues , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few girls compete as a rule , while the rest arc left to their own devices because they are not of championship caliber . Luckily for American sport , there is an organization anxious to see that there are equal opportunities for all women in athletics , that the " winning team " idea which has so obsessed the masculine mind is changed for something more nearly approaching a real athletic ideal . This organization is the Women 's Division of the National Amateur Athletic Federation . The National Amateur Athletic Fed ? eration , of which Colonel Henry Breekin ? ridge is president , is not to be confused with the Amateur Athletic Union , which has charge of club and institutional track and field sports in the United States . The National Amateur Athletic Federa ? tion is exactly what its title suggests , a loose organization of the amateur ath ? letic societies of this country and those other bodies ( such as the American Le ? religion and the Boy Scouts ) which have any ? thing to do with sport . The Women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of co-ordinating the work of all individuals and groups interested in girls ' and women 's ath ? letics . In other words , an attempt was made to take the control of women'ssports out of the hands of men and place it where it belongs , in the hands of women . So sensible is the policy of the Women 's Division of the National Amateur Ath ? letic Federation that it is worth while to quote in some detail their platform of sporting ideals , called by Dr. John Cooper a " Declaration of Independence that promises to free the girl and the woman from the thralldom of the heredi ? tary lord of the athletic realm . " A. The Women 's Division of the N. A. A. F. believes in the spirit of play for its own sake , and works for the promotion of physical activity for the largest portion of persons in any given group , in form suitable to indi ? vidual needs and capacities , under leadership and environmental conditions that foster health , physical efficiency , and the develop ? ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and girls , it aims : To promote programs of physical activi ? ties for all members of given social groups rather than for a limited number chosen for their physical prowess . To protect athletics from exploitation for the enjoyment of the spectator or for the athletic reputation or commercial advantage of any institution or any organization . To stress enjoyment of sportsmanship and to minimize the emphasis placed upon the individual accomplishment and the winning of championships . To eliminate types and systems of compe ? tition which put the emphasis upon individ ? ual accomplishment and winning rather than upon stressing the enjoyment of sport and the development of sportsmanship among the many . To restrict recognition for athletic ac ? complishment to awards which are symbolical and which have the least possible intrinsic value . To discourage sensational publicity and to guide publicity along educational lines and to stress the sport rather than the individual and the group competitor . To eliminate gate receipts . To discourage athletic competition which involves traveling . To avoid countenancing the sacrifice of an individual 's health for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement and you will be more and more struck by its strength and sanity . It discourages the amateur athlete traveling from one end of the world to the other in pursuit of her highly amateur sport . It obviates the crowds clicking at the turnstiles , it does away with the money complication which has ruined so much sport , it eliminates the columns of laudatory matter in the sporting pages about this or that stellar athletic performer . That a pronuncia ? mento of this sort ? embodying nothing but the veriest common sense about athletics ? should even be necessary , shows how far we have departed from the ideals of real sport in the United States . The women of the country are to be congratulated that such an organization is looking out for their athletic future . Women 's athletics to-day are at the crossroads . Which way they turn will mean much in the future for American sport and for the womanhood of the country . Should they turn in the wrong direction , even the present sane policy of the majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows whether a pub ? lic mania for championship contests and winning teams in the colleges could be long withstood ? Already pressure is being exerted on all sides to force women into the competitive whirlpool . Any physical director familiar with the situa ? tion will agree . The professor of physi ? cal education at a large Middle Western university said in this connection : " The principal of a high school called me recently on the telephone . ' I want your help , ' he said . ' We have a girls ' basket-ball team that we are mighty proud of . We have gone to considerable expense to have the team coached and now we 're sure we can defeat any other team in this part of the country . Can you put me in touch with some other teams we can play ? We really want to put our town on the map . ' " Commenting on this request the pro ? fessor remarked , " One wonders what kind of an educational ideal these men have . Here they are at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American slogan of ' Growth at Any Price , ' that they are willing to sacrifice the health of the girls in their high school in order that their own particular town may become better known . " These basket-hall tournaments are interesting developments . The organiza ? tion back of them is exceedingly com ? plex . First of all , a certain high school girls ' team won a so-called tri-state tour ? nament . ' The team was utterly ex ? hausted by having to play six games in two days , and girls were removed from the floor in a fainting and hysterical condition ; but all of this was soon for ? gotten and the team ? together with a few enthusiastic supporters ? went home to paint the town red . The Chamber of Commerce and some of the leading busi ? ness men met together and with a burst of local patriotism decided to build a large gymnasium and hold tournaments in their home town . The experiment was successful as a business venture ; the men promised the girls almost anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles around and the gathering attained social significance rivaling that of the annual fair . Local patriotism lmew no bounds , the audiences grew wilder and wilder , all at the expense of these small groups of girls who be ? came every minute more tense and ex ? cited . There was only one result ; in ? stead of playing together in a friendly , normal sort of competition , the game became a wild frenzy . The referee was an ogre and victory was all that mattered . " Exceptional ? An isolated case ? Per ? haps . But one is led to doubt it . For instance , the situation became so bad in a girls ' basket-ball league in a Western city that an investigation was made , and it was discovered that some of the play ? ers were members of no less than five different teams simultaneously , playing practically every night from November until March . ( And , of course , receiving money for their efforts . ) In another large city a girl playing in a church league came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the team , but was joining an " outlaw " team playing under boys ' rules , which represented a commercial firm in the city . She did not wish to leave , but her mother wanted her to do so because she would obtain more publicity ! This girl developed into a real star , playing a game a week for some sixteen weeks , and finally was sent abroad with the Olympic team . On her return her heart was found to be overstrained so that she is now unable to take part in athletics of any kind . A well-known woman in charge of college athletics in the Middle West tells of a basket ball game she refereed , with the audience sprawled out along the edges of the court so that " the opposing rooters would reach out and trip up the girls as they ran near the sidelines . " So close was this contest and so loud the yells and catcalls of the crowd that the players were " worked up until they committed so many fouls my lung power gave out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver and for the re ? mainder of the game he would shoot it whenever I put the whistle to my lips . " The director of athletics at one of the largest state universities in the country told me of a request made of her to referee a game between two leading high schools in a neighboring city . When she refused , this answer was given : " Why Miss X , you will have to . Last year when the game was over , not only were the students not speaking to one another , but neither were the principals from the competing schools , there was so much feeling . " In an Eastern city a man employed by a commercial firm gathered together a girls ' basket ball team , one member of which was taken from the local Sunday School league . This girl was in the eighth grade , and in four successive games she fainted away . An iuvestiga ? tion of her doctor 's examination card showed that she had a rapid heart . malnutrition , and ana'mia . This girl staggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end attended a banquet at which the male coach of the team made a long speech about the benefits of sport for women ! No , these incidents are unfortunately not exceptional , and this is why the Women 's Division of the N A k stands against competitive sport of this kind . What it is attempting to do is to frustrate those who see in the advent of women in athletics more chances for exploitation and publicity . The Wom ? en 's Division does not believe that the Olympic Games as conducted are bene ? ficial to women . It thinks that the com ? ing Olympiad , to be held in 1932 in Los Angeles , for which strenuous efforts are being made to include women 's events , " throws not light , but a cloud of dark ? ness , over a program that is as wide as the nation . It is black with menace to the progress in athletics for girls . " Naturally enough , there are many who do not agree with this statement ; and . you will hear all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women 's Division . It has been said that interest in athletics will be increased by the entrance of women in the Olym ? pics . But in whom will that interest be increased ? In the few women selected for the team ? Certainly . But what about the hundreds of thousands of girls not worth bothering about because they can not run , jump . swim , or dive well enough ? And if increased interest re ? sults , what kind of interest will it be ? Will it he that of the gentlemen whom Mr. McGeehan so tenderly calls " the Badgers , " those gentlemen who as heads of athletic organizations are anxious to see a team of American women in the Games because their authority , prestige , and power will be thereby doubled ? You will also hear the word " sportsman ? ship " glibly brought in . Sportsmanship for whom ? For the few dozens of competitors , or for the thousands of girls who are non-competitors ? You may even hear it said that the girls want it . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat the opportunity . Making the team means publicity , publicity means fame , fame means a better job , and there you are . All this we have heard before . It it simply the story of masculine athletics all over again . Mr. George F. Smith , the editor of a newspaper in a small Texas town , tells of a woman 's basket-ball meet held un ? der the auspices of the Amateur Athletic Union . " Twenty-one teams entered for our meet here . " writes Mr. Smith . " Each team paid an entry fee of $7.50 , plus 25 cents for each player . That aver ? aged over $10 a team ; a total of $210 that went to the A. A. U. Twenty-five per cent of the gross receipts of $1,129.75 went to the A. A. U. , calling for another check of $282.43 . A. A. U. referees , their traveling expenses and eating , added $206.30 more . Trophies cost $250 , and were purchased from the A. A. U. . . . That makes four checks to the A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of interest which is increased by the entrance of women into competitive sport . Once let the mania for competitive ath ? letics of this kind grip women as it has gripped the men , and the sane and constructive attitude of the majority of the colleges and universities toward the participation of their girls in intercol ? legiate athletics will be seriously threat ? ened ; soon we shall begin to have Vassar-Smith basket ball games , with the scramble for seats , the vast sums coming in at the box office , the eligibility rulings , the amateur-professional tangle , and all the other absurdities which at present are found in athletics for men . Enough has been said to give a fairly general idea of the situation of women in the sport business at the present time . On the one band is an active and articu ? late group endeavoring to foster com ? petitive sport of the worst kind , at ? tempting to develop champions andworld-beaters at the expense of the mass. attempting to drag women 's sport into the morass of hypocrisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand is a group ? not of obstruc ? tionists , but of idealists who are anxious to keep the American girl from this commercialized competition , to safe ? guard her health by placing her athletic activities under the direction of properly qualified women supervisors , and to provide for her a program of games which will spread a love of sport not only among the minority but also among the majority of the women of the United States . At a meeting of the Women 's Division of the N. A. A. F. held in New York early in the year , a resolution was passed against the inclusion of women in the coming Olympiad . The next morning a city daily paper carried a picture of one of the American champions of the 1928 Games , a charming young lady in a track suit clasping her bare knees , with the caption : THE OLYMPIC BABY . WOULD DEAL DEATH BLOW TO llErt GAME . The Women 's Division , eager to promote real sport of all kinds , would deal a death blow to no one 's game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every ? one on a team , " is not a meaningless phrase . Nor is the Women 's Division against competitive sport , for its mem ? bers are aware that you can not have a match of tiddledywinks without compe ? tition . Their stand in this matter was stated at their second annual meeting in 1925 : No athletics can exist without competition . The object of the Women 's Division of the N. A. A. F. is to promote wholesome athletic competition for the greatest number of girls and women . The type of organization which fosters extramural games does not build toward these ideals . Therefore the Women 's Division eneour ages a broadly planned intramural program and for the present time stands firmly against the policy of extramural competition . Favoring , in other words , competitive sport of the best kind , these women have looked about to discover some form of organized athletics which will have the necessary competitive clement and yet possess none of the obvious disadvan ? tages of gate money , publicity , cham ? pionships for the few and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the Play Day idea . The Play Day idea is new , original , practical , and best of all beneficial . It can be utilized in elementary schools , in high schools , finishing schools , colleges and universities , industrial and civic groups , in fact , in all bodies of girls and women in need of physical education and sport . Despite the handicap of an unfortunate name , which suggests folk dancing or community singing , these Play Days , started in California , have spread the country over . Briefly the idea is this : Fifty girls , let us say , from ten differ ? ent institutions meet for a day of ath ? letics . They arc formed into ten teams of five girls each ; but these teams do not represent the various schools or business houses participating ? they are mixed teams , each girl on each team being chosen from a different group . Each team plays against the others in any number of sports : volley ball , field hockey , tennis , and ? if time permits -- golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few play , yet there is enough com ? petition to furnish plenty of rivalry and keep up interest , although the allegiance of the player is transferred from herschool or institution to the team . Thus while retaining the advantages of outdoor exercise , Play Days remove many of the disadvantages of the former system , under which a girl who failed to show a marked aptitude for a sport never made the team and thus often missed a chance to learn the game . Play Days can he adapted to the use of small children or to that of the college undergraduate or factory employee , merely by varying the sports to be played . They can he held outdoors with games like golf , tennis , or field hockey in summer ; in winter with games like basket ball ; in a civic swimming pool in July , or in a winter-sport country in January . At Play Days there is no star team playing with another star team ; there are large groups of girls competing together in as many different sports as time and the facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try for varsity teams for lack of ability do not hesitate to play beside others as awkward and unskilled as themselves ; and few there are who do not care for one sport or another during the course of the day . Here the play is the thing , not the winning for one 's college or club . There are no gate receipts , no grandstands and spectators ; there is nothing sensational for the newspaper reporter . Play Days can be , and have been , the means of breaking up petty jealousies between schools and institutions , of making those real friendships of sport so often talked about and so seldom made , of turning athletics into the thing it should be ? a means to an end instead of the end itself . I do not know whether Play Days of ? fer the only nr the best possible solution of the problem of athletics for the American woman . But to encourage them is certainly to take a step in the right direction . Mrs. Herbert Hoover , who has lent her help and influence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the average girl and boy , and explains that when she speaks of " good sports " she is thinking in terms of character . She says it will make " hap ? pier individuals , happier citizens , hap ? pier communities . " Now if Play Days can do this or one-tenth of this they should be widely promoted by those in charge of ath ? letics in the United States . And at the very least they suggest the sort of at ? titude which must prevail if the evils of masculine competition are to be avoided . Anyone who queries the prevailing tem per of American athletics is constantly called upon for " constructive ideas " by the authorities in charge of men 's sport . " Do not , " they say , " be destructive . Do not harp upon what is wrong , upon the many errors inevitably committed , the mistakes unwittingly made . " Well , gentlemen , here is your constructive idea . Moreover , it is a constructive idea put forward by a constructive body of women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sport for girls remains a recreation and does not become a vocation or an in ? industry , in having it supervised by women who best know the needs and limitations of their own sex . It is by no means an easy task that the Women 's Division of the N. A. A. F. have before them ; but they can tackle it in the confidence that all who care for real athletics the country over are behind them in their efforts to keep women out of that great new commercial under ? taking of the twentieth century : The Business of Sport .
