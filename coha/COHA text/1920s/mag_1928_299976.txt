Enticing , exciting and authoritative books on Soviet Russia are beginning to appear in quantities , notably from the presses of a new firm : International Publishers , Manhattan . Ready this week is International 's 855-page Guide-Book to the Soviet Union ( $5 ) , the first such book to appear in English since Baedeker 's Russia of 1914 . Smart folk will note Moscow 's Savoy Hotel , Leningrad 's Hotel d ' Europe , and that taxis have a fixed tariff in Moscow but must be bargained for in Leningrad . Map fiends will revel in hundreds of renamed towns , and the heretofore seldom seen Russian spelling of the nation 's name : Soyus Sotsialisticheskekh Sovietskikh Respublik ( " Union of Socialist Soviet Republics " ) .
