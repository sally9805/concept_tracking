S. , 255 ; Finland , 166 ; Great Britain , 85 ; Sweden , 31 ; France , 26 . <P> Third* Day .

Next morning three gigantic American shot-putters-Clarence Houser , Glenn Hartranft , Ralph G. Hills-strode determinedly out of the locker-room . Picking up their missiles they catapulted them afar , shook hands with each other , strode back to the locker-room .

Katz , his countryman , followed close . <P> Sixth Day . The stage was set for two races . Imperturbable Paavo Nurmi ( Finland ) trotted forth , wiriest of the wiry , hard , slender and supple as a rapier . Carrying a stop watch in his hand to gauge his pace , he first loped 1,500 , then 5,000 metres at a speed that broke all his followers ' hearts and lungs , save Ritola 's , who finished at Nurmi 's shoulder in the second race . ( Ritola had run 26,000 metres in five days . Nurmi had won twice within two hours . ) <P> U.
