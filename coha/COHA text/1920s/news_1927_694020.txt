txt FEW FLAGS SEEN ON FOURTH Comparison Is Made With French Display on Their Holiday . Visiting different parts of the city I noticed with surprise the scarcity of the display of our national colors . I was in nearly all parts of the city and at the humblest and richest dwellings the absence of our emblem drew my attention . Ten days from now the French national holiday will take place and I am sure that all over France on this day of days the Tricolor will float from the poorest to richest Frenchmen 's homes . It is a shame that the American forgets what he owes to the heroic deeds of his forefathers . Even public buildings , schools and banks were made conspicuous by the absence of the Stars and Stripes . I wondered why flagstaffs were attached to houses if they were not used for a day like this . CHARLES H. STAEDICK . New York , July 4 , 1927.
