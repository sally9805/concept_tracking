Since last autumn , the stock-market price of John D. Ryan's* Montana Power Co. shares have gone up and down queerly . Since January 1 their quotations have ranged between $102.25 and $169.50 . Last week , trading in the stock became steady at $165.50 a share ; and pat upon that situation , Mr. Ryan who theretofore had always smiled mockingly at offers to buy the company , let it be known that he and other directors had agreed to sell out to the American Power &; Light Co. , for the equivalent of $166 a share . That is , they were trading each of their Montana Power shares for two shares of a new issue which the American Power &; Light was issuing ; and a banking-syndicate ( Bonbright &; Co. , White , Weld &; Co. and National City Co. ) was willing to pay $83 for each of those new American Power &; Light shares . Mr. Ryan , in Manhattan last week , recommended that other Montana Power shareholders make the trade . They as a group would be getting somewhat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a good deal . <P> To Sidney Z. Mitchell , another director of Montana Power , it was doubly a good deal . Mr. Mitchell is chairman of the American Power &; Light Co. , and has long maneuvered to persuade Mr. Ryan to sell out . Montana Power , which Mr. <P> <P> Ryan formed in 1912 , owns 95% of the electric light and power resources of Montana ; it sells current to Mr. Ryan 's greater company , the Anaconda Copper Mining Co. ( he is chairman ) and its subsidiaries , including a 120-mile electrified railroad ; and it has a 99-year contract to furnish power to the electrified portion of the St. Paul Railroad . Montana Power is one of the largest and most powerful concerns in the Northwest . Isolated it is worth a good many millions . <P> As part of Mr. Mitchell 's American Power &; Light Co. , it is worth several millions more .
