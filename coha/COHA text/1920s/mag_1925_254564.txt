Physicians are often gulled by sharpers . Many of them combine a spotless naivete in business matters with the conviction ( bred by their familiarity with physical exigencies ) that they are keen men of affairs . Over their stumblings in realms of finance the maternal Journal of the American Medical Association keeps zealous watch . Last week it published a warning to those medicos who might be persuaded , by the circulars of a group of flim-flams , to avail themselves of the " Special Subscription Privilege " of purchasing " Banker 's Shares " in the Ford Motor Co. of Canada , Ltd . The circulars stated the indisputable fact that $100 invested in Ford of Canada in 1904 is now $32,000 ; it set down the names of officers of this company , all correctly spelled . The fellows who devised this chicanery had gone so far as to buy a small block of Ford Co. of Canada stock at $490 a share ; each share they divided into 100 ; each one-hundredth they called a " Banker 's Share . " These " shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 a " share . " Thus the special subscription offer enabled gulled physicians to pay $1,000 for stock worth less than $500 . Said the A. M. A. Journal : " Physicians will do well to throw these ' Special Subscription Privilege ' blanks into their waste baskets . "
