txt We do not think that Mr. Marry Roar , as a lawyer diligent for the interests of his client , would be content to submit to any tribunal presided over by a judicial officer higher than a Justice of the Peace his defense against the charge that in his Carnegie Hall speech he had misrepresented the position of Mr. Cox in respect to the League of Nations . The issue is extremely simple , it is clear . Mr. ROOT fails to meet it . He said in his Carnegie Hall speech : " Mr. Cox " declares that he will insist upon the " Treaty just as Mr. WILSON nego " tiated it . " In his telegram requesting Mr. ROOT to correct that misstatement Mr. Cox pointed out that invariably in his utterances he had made known his willingness to " accept " reservations that will clarify , that " will be helpful , that will reassure " 6 the American people " ; verbatim reports of his speeches prove this fact . In respect to Article X. Mr. Cox in the ' article he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prior to his nomination , made this proposal of a reservation : It will , of course , be understood that in carrying out the purpose of the League the Government of the United States must at all times act in strict harmony with the terms and intent of the United States Constitution , which can not in any ' way be altered by the treatymaking power . Also in his campaign addresses Mr. Cox has stated his willingness to accept a reservation that will clearly state to our associates in the League that Congrass , and Congress alone , has the right to declare war , and that the treaty-making power can not override that provision . This is enough completely to disprove Mr. ROOT 'S imprudent statement in the Carnegie Han speech . It is strange that Mr. ROOT should fall into the mistake of " declaring that such a reservation would mean " absolutely nothing . " Mr. Lenan 's reservation meant nothing more . It declared that the United States would assume no obligation under Article X. " unless in any particular case Con " gress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole power to declare " war or authorize the employment " of the military or naval forces of " the United States , shall by act or " joint resolution so provide . " But it is something more than strange , it is fairly comic , that Mr. Roar should admonish the Democratic candidate that , when he was asked by a heckler at Providence whether he would accept the Lodge reservations , " there was your opportunity . " Inasmuch as Mr. LODGE in his Chicago Convention speech declared that he would not vote for ratification even with his own reservations , of what avail would have been Governor Cox 's acceptance of them ? Mr. ROOT wanders far from the very inconvenient point at issue into an argument in support of his thesis that Article X. binds Congress to declare war , a refusal to make that declaration being , in his opinion , " a breach of the Treaty . " Mr. ROOT supports this contention ' by a perilous argument from analogy : An analogous case is the power of Congress to appropriate money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , but if the United States makes a treaty agreeing to pay $1,000,000 to another country , would any one say that the obligation could be canceled by refusal of Congress to appropriate the money ? Certainly not ; the only effect would be that the United States would-have broken faith . There has been no serious contention to the contrary since 1808 . The case that then arose was that of Mr. SEWARD 'S treaty for the purchase of Alaska from Russia . In Article VI . of that treaty we find ' these words : In consideration of the cession aforesaid , the United States agree to pay at the Treasury in Washington , within ten months after the exchange of the ratification of this convention , to the diplomatic representative or other agent of his Majesty . the Emperor of All the Russlas , duly authorized to receive the same , $7,200,000 in gold . That is a definite promise and agreement , in precise words . The right of Congress to refuse the appropriation was much discussed in the House , but the appropriation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anywhere else in the League Covenant or in the Treaty any promise and  --  agreement that the United States will go to war at the command of the League ? Article X. contains an undertaking , and an agreement that the Council shall consider means by which the undertaking can be carried out . Of these methods there are many , notably the boycott . But if the Council should raise its voice for war , our C -- igress might ' nevertheless withhold its deelaration , either from insufficiency of the cause of war or because it felt ' that the other resources of the.League had not been exhausted ; and this country could not be reproached with breach of the Treaty . That ' is the meaning of Article X. as Mr. Wn ... sorr interprets ? it , and he expresslydeclares that this was the intent and understanding of the ? egotiators ? , of the Treaty ; that ' they would have rejected indignantly any interpretation that interfered with the constitutional arrangements of the member nations . It is an unsupposable case , for nobody ? believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war were the only means Of- shielding the world against the danger of a general convulsion . Nothing is more . obvious than that the Republican opponents of the League are living in a neu-existent world and are discussing hypothetical situations that can never arise .
