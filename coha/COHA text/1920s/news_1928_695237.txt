In response to an appeal by this bureau for a suitable slogan 2,500 slogans were submitted from various parts of the United States , Canada , and Etienne . In announcing its choice obi this slogan the tautmittee - writes as follows : " The committee 's task was not to find a slogan which would be acceptable to every Lutheran as the very best slogan or one which in its own opin ? ion was the most fitting . It was appointed merely to choose the best of those submitted . Whether the best among those scrutinized by them is the best which could be found and adequately exPresses in a dignified way the characteristics of the Lutheran church and is specific enough to identify just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogan ha. ; met- with general approval and enthusiasm . Rightly understood it expresses in a striking and very timely way the position of the Lutheran church toward the Bible and a World of many and surprising changes . ? Change is stamped upon everything earthy . Nature takes on ever varying moods . Society is in a constant state of transformation . . One of the I ancient Greek philosophers already coined the well known phrase , " Pants rei , " that is , everything changes . This applies to the individual , the family , the generation , the nation , in fact , to everything and everybody . " Change and decay ' in all around I see . " On account of many inventions and discoveries In recent years marvelous changes have taken place in this material world of ours . The progress of our times has been truly marvelous . Man has well nigh conquered the air , the land , and the sea . He has to a remarkable extent overcome time , space , and gravitation . The world today seems like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . We rejoice in this progress . But no material progress has changed the nature of sin . Nothing has been invented or discovered by man outside of God 's revelation to hnprove the soul of man . The abuse of many of our best inventions and discoveries has to some extent aggravated the problem of , sin . The problem of sin , its mysterious nature and its disastrous result , is today the outstanding problem of the human race . As far as man is concerned in the cure of sin it is a hopeless problem . All must wrestle with It , but no one can solve it by his own ingenuity or by his own endeavors . Some try to deny the problem sin . Others attempt to smother the voice of conscience , but no pne can ' succeed in stifling this voice altogether . Nor can any man work out his own salvation by his own good deeds . In re ? gard to this problem the world has seen many attempts in recent years , but no real progress . God , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution r for this problem and published it immediately aftbr sin entered into the world . Throughout the Bible ho clearly reveals this solution for every person , in the world , and His solution for the problem of sin is briefly stated in the words of this slogan , " A Changeless Christ . " Christ Jesus is revealed throughout the Bible as the God appointed savior from sin . In the fullness of time God fulfilled all His prophesies concerning the coming Savior , and : Sent forth His only begotten son , Jesus Christ , to be born of the Virgin Mary . Christ was " put under the law " to fulfill the law in man 's stead ; the sins of the world were imnuted to Him . As man 's substitute . Christ , true God and true man , suffered the full punishment for the sins of the world upon the cross . " God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself not imputing their trespasses unto them ; and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation . Now then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by us ; wo Pray you in Christ 's stead be ye reconciled to God : For Ho hath made Him ( I. e. , Jesus Christ ) to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made tho righteousness of Cod in Hint .

With the slogan , " A Changeless Christ , " the Lutheran church Pledges itself to proclaim this chief and foremost message to the world . ? This foremost message . of A ) Bible is at the same time its distinctive message . In , no other socalled sacred book of the world is this message to . be found . The celebrated Dr. Max Mueller of Oxford university fame writes as follows : , " In the discharge of my duties for 40 years . as professor of Sanskrit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the sacred books of the east , and I have found the one keynote , the one diapason , so &o; speak , of all the sacred books , the one refrain throughout , is salvation by our own works and deservings . Our own Holy Bible is . from beginning , fo end a protest against this doctrine . " The slogan , " A Changeless Christ , " is therefore to emphasize the fact that we are saves by free grace without any merit Of our , own through faith in Christ and his vicarious atonement , but at the same time it is to Uphold the claim of ' finalIty- that the Bible sets up.for the religion of Jesus . There can never be a substitute for or a superior to Christ in the solution of Finally the slogan , " A Changeless Christ for a Changing World , " is to emphasize the importance of holy thinking and holy living out of love and gratitude to Christ .

" Nothing can improve this world of ours more than right and holy living . What legislation dannot do , what new resolutions fail to do , the " Changeless Christ " does through His Holy Spirit by working repentan &; and faith in man and causing him to battle against sin and to lead a different and better life . We improve the world by improving the individual . Thus the church is to change the world , individually and collectively , not by force , not by fear , not by outward changes and rules , but by love , by grace , by a change of hear ( through faith in a changeless Christ . The church 's real business is , therefore , to preach an open . Bible , free grace and faith in Christ Jesus and to preach this the divinely inspired solution for sin .
