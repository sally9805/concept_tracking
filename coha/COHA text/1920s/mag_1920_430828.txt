Mdear Roberval : You ask me to give you a picture of after-the-war New York . You wonder what traces the greatest war of history has left on the face of the greatest city of the world , and whether it has wrought any essential changes . In a corner of the balustrade in front of the Public Library on Fifth Avenue stand two little girl-scouts holding a little flag out by the four corners to catch the pennies of passers-by . Beside them stand two little boy-scouts . One of them timidly beats a little drum . The other holds up a little placard tacked to a stick which reads : " America ' Gift to France ? A Monument to Commemorate the Marne . " But the drum is almost inaudible in the roar of motors and the rush of feet and the clamor of newsboys .. The crowd surges by without noticing it or the flag or the placard ; or , if they notice , they give nothing but a preoccupied glance . A block farther on I pass a one-legged soldier in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand while with his right he holds out a tattered trench-cap . The crowd surges by him , too , in intense preoccupation . I think of the Fifth Avenue of two years ago , a sea of billowing flags , booths , platforms , posters , machineguns , tanks , orators at every corner detailing Hun atrocities , appealing for recruits to fight the Hun , money to entertain the men who were fighting the Hun . The air throbbed with the voice of guns and bugles . The crowd moved up and down slowly , drinking it in with shining eyes , parting at intervals to give place to soldiers in brand-new uniforms striding swiftly on important errands . It was the most glorious circus America has ever seen . That ' s gone now , of course ; the war ' s over . But why does to-day 's crowd rush past the beating drum and the one-legged soldier with such determined preoccupation ?  | An explanation suggests itself . No doubt the crowd has spent all its money on clothes , and has nothing for less important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the thousands of women thronging the sidewalk wears a fur coat , silk stockings , and new shoes . A glance at the prices in the window of a shoe-shop is sufficient proof that any one who has purchased one pair of new shoes must be virtually penniless . No ; the surmise is wrong . The crowd is boldly swooping into the shops that line the avenue not merely to look , but to buy ? to buy stockings at the former price of shoes , shoes at the former price of gowns , and gowns at ? well , at what were kings ' ransoms before the war brushed away most of the kings . " Two years ago , " the manager of the stocking department in one of the shops tells me , " our stocking sales were about fifty thousand dollars . This year they will be approximately one million dollars . Oh , yes , increase in price accounts for some of the difference ; but it mostly comes from the shift from cotton to silk . No one will wear cotton stockings any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You mean no one who can afford silk . " " Every one can afford silk . " And he tells me about some stockings at twenty-five dollars a pair . So it is n't lack of money that hurries the crowd past the timidly beating drum and the one-legged soldier who , I own , has no business begging on Fifth Avenue . That determined preoccupation is the sign of a change of mopd that would have astounded one who had foreseen it two years ago . " Shall I say that the heroine had been a Red-Cross nurse ? " a popular novelist friend of mine asked his editor the other day , discussing the plot of a forthcoming serial . " No , no , no . Write the story just as if the war had never happened . " Editors win their success by shrewdly guessing the public taste ; this man is a very successful editor , so he must have known what he was talking about . Indeed , Roberval , a large part of America is trying to do just this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who leok at us from a distance , and attempt to estimate the effect on us of the greatest event of history , must always remember one important thing ? our naive belief in our superiority to the rest of the world . For three years we watched the Old World conflict with a certain contempt . To be sure we had a vague sentimental preference for the Allies , but on the whole our feeling was exactly that of tolerant contempt for a hemisphere which could n't settle its little differences without an orgy of bloodshed . Then we came in . We had ridiculed Henry Ford 's peace ship , but , after all , we went at making war much in the way that Ford went at making peace . It was a simple business . Go in , smash the Germans , then set the poor old eastern hemisphere on its feet so it would n't get into such a pitiful mess again . Well , the war was won , and peace has come , and suddenly America discovers that nothing is settled . We find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe 's complicated affairs . Our soldiers came home , bringing a fresh confirmation of our feeling of superiority to the rest of the world , and so we are all the more puzzled , hurt , that our participation in the war had so slight an effect on you peculiar mortals over there . To our amazement , you remain the same incomprehensible mix-up of racial and capitalist and nationalist rivalries and ambitions and thwarted hopes and cheerful , inveterate hates . It is a terrific blow to our pride . To save our pride , to preserve our belief in ourselves , we have decided to wipe the war and all its associations off the slate , as we say . Naturally , this is n't at all a conscious pxbcess of mj , nd , and remember , of course , that I ' m speaking of the crowd . On a board fence at the next corner , from behind which comes the racka-tack of pneumatic hammers shaping the frame of a new sky-scraper , is a poster with the startling head-line : " The Kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the poster is the signature , " Interchurch World Movement . " Another trace of the war on the face of New York . What a cry ran through England in 1914 that the war would bring a spiritual rebirth ! That cry was repeated  | here in 1917 . It rang from every pulpit ? almost every pulpit . And the people crowded to the churches , as they had in England in 1914 . But then " After the first two months of war , " Joseph Fort Newton of the Church of the Divine Paternity said to me the other day , " the congregations vanished from the English churches . Now the church in England is dead . " Dr. Newton has just returned to America after several years ' work in London . " The people left the church because they found they welt getting the same thing there that they got in their newspapers ? mad , bloodthirsty rage . " Here in America the same thing has happened . The wilder the rage preached from the pulpit , the greater the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known preacher of Brooklyn , who , when hostilities broke out , went to France and was filled by official propaganda bureaus with detailed accounts of all the German atrocities that had and had n't occurred . This minister of the gospel carried these stories from Atlantic to Pacific , whipping his audiences into savage fury . And a few days ago I read in a magazine a frantic appeal he writes to the American people . " The church is dying , " he cries . By adopting the role of exciter to bloodshed , the church naturally had a fleeting access of strength . But people unconsciously expected something different from the church . Not necessarily that it should oppose the war , but that it should be the moderator , the healer of wounds ' and hate . During our silly " Red " excitement of last spring and winter the pulpit outdid the press in violent hysterical denunciations . There were distinguished exceptions here , too ; a group of churchmen issued a written protest against the illegal unAmerican deportation of aliens without judicial trial . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in almost every other war , the church as a whole took the easier , weaker course . Dying ? The Interchurch World Movement , with its elaborate executive and publicity organizations that crowd floor after floor in several office buildings , ? its advertisements I see on billboards and in newspapers and magazines , framed in the style of cigarette " copy , " ? is a last desperate , impossible effort to save something that can not be saved unless , by a miracle , a real spiritual movement comes . But for that some other cause than the war must be sought . Yet , curiously enough , Roberval , many people believe that this spiritual movement is here or is briskly on its way . " Did you ever hear so much talk about spiritualism ? " a woman asked me recently . No , I admitted , I never did . When real religion goes , superstition comes in . All New York is mad about ouija-boards . The ouija-board fills the same place in empty lives that was once filled by picture-puzzles and ping-pong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the shivery thrill of the unknown hovering over the players ' heads . There is a play on Broadway called " The Ouija-Board . " Children tease their parents for ouijas as they used to tease for velocipedes . " Has your ouija told you anything yet ? " I asked a little boy the other day . " No , " he admitted , " not yet ; but I ' m going to coax it . " And , finally , the ouija is proving a wonderful virgin field for comic cartoon serials , conclusive proof that it has become a serious part of life . I stroll on . The billowing mass of evening newspapers on the news-stand at the next corner suggests another trace of the war on New York and America . The crowd is buying the papers with its usual automatic eagerness . But is it reading them with the same confidence it read them before the war ? I wonder . One of the great weapons of the war was propaganda at home and abroad . That had to be so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In France your newspapers , you have often said to me yourself , Roberval , are papers of political and economic cliques , with one or two exceptions . Each of your papers speaks its own gospel to its clique , and to that clique all other papers are anathema . We have , or have had , a large number of independent newspapers of national reputation , tied to no party or social or political philosophy , papers whose news had the confidence of every one regardless of party . But in the last two years  | or so , I find , people have begun to suspect that all news , even in these papers , all supposedly authentic information on any subject , ? politics , foreign affairs , labor , ? is written with a twist unjustified by the facts . People have got into the troublesome habit , I find , of comparing the foreign news in one authoritative paper with that in another , or even comparing to-day 's authoritative news with yesterday 's or last week 's in the same newspaper . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank cynicism . I have been forced to explain several times the genesis of our foreign news ? how the correspondent must , by tradition , build his picture of the economic or political or social situation of a country out of vagrant scraps of conversation picked up in hotel lobbies , supplemented by the neatly typed " releases " passed out by official publicity bureaus , and how he is often impelled to select even among these scraps and " releases " so as to frame a despatch agreeable to the policy of his paper . Strangely , I have been unable to convince certain stubborn minds that this is the necessary method of gathering foreign news . " People , " I said . Yet I realize that all this refers merely to the circle of people I know . People as a whole may accept the newspapers as implicitly as they did before the war . In a recent letter I told you how thoroughly bankrupt , in the eyes of those who see clearly , are the two great political parties in America , and yet how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as the only avenue of political expression , and vote automatically for the candidates the party leaders name . So why should one imagine a vital change of attitude toward the newspaper which manufactures political opinion along with opinions on all other matters ? I turn west toward Times Square . This is the " cocktail hour , " when the bars of the big hotels once were lined with tired business men , three deep , seeking balm after a hard day 's labor in those American achievements , the Bronx , the Clover Club , the Royal Smile . The doors of the regal bar , at the Times Square corner , with its Parrish painting of " Old King Cole , " are grimly closed . The bar has been transformed into an overflow bedroom , a clerk tells me sadly . I go on up toward another famous resort at the " cocktail hour " ; it displays the sign " Soda . " I peep in . There is a magnificent soda bar , and dainty tables scattered about a daintily decprated room , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest elaborations in sodaed and iced and candied and chocolated drinks . Soda , soda , soda , and candy-shops ! I suddenly realize that just as almost every other door used to sport the sign " Cafe , " our euphemism for bar , now almost every other sign here in Times Square is " Candy , Soda . " The righteous war mood that gave us prohibition was strengthened by substantial contributions from the soft-drink and candymakers , I have heard it suggested . If so , no money was ever more shrewdly spent . Across the street is another great hotel . Yes , the bar is still here , but the glittering array of bottles has vanished . Behind the bar , in a far corner , lurks a single dejected aproned person . Do they call them bartenders now ? " What have you got to drink ? " I whisper . " Ginger-ale , " he proposes sadly , " pluto water , grape juice ? " I turn away . Yes , prohibition has come to New York ! But half-way back across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been in over two years . " Come and have a drink , " he welcomes . " Drink of what ? " " A drink , " he explains , and I follow in wonder . We enter an establishment only half a block from Bjoadway . My friend says something in a low tone , a bottle appears from beneath the bar , and the two tiny glasses placed in front of us are swiftly filled . It is , veritably , a drink . " Five places in a minute 's walk of here where you can get anything you want , " my friend advises . " You ' ve got to know the bartender ; that ' s all . If there are five right here , how many are there in Manhattan ? Have another ? "  | I decline regretfully . One such drink is a quite adequate welcome home . My friend pays , ? the price is one dollar a drink , ? and we go out . He gives me other interesting information . " The , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has three sub-cellars staeked with booze , enough to last twenty years . All you ' ve got to do is to get enrolled as one of their customers , and they ' 11 put your name on as many bottles as you order . Then you can go there at any time and call for what you want . " " If you ' ve got the price . " " Um ? well , their Scotch is forty dollars a bottle . " " Is that all ? " I cry , astonished . New York does n't believe in prohibition ; it ca n't . I bid my friend adieu and stroll on . Already , up against the fading rose of the western sky , a row of tiny tots , twenty feet tall , have begun to kick up their legs and salaam and salute in honor of a famous brand of our national delight ? chewing-gum . Now a graceful electrically limbed lady , thirty feet tall , takes off her soiled waist and begins to launder it with a marvelous glittering soap ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and announces that it is time to retire , and thereupon vanishes to give place to the name of an automobile tire ; a kitten the size of a cow begins playing with a ball of silk the size of a cart-wheel ; a giant bull snorts electric fire ; a cock somewhat larger than an ostrich crows a vast electric cockadoodledoo ; a little colossal miss mounts a swing and swoops across the heavens , her incandescent hair streaming behind her ; a tremendous bell tolls silently ; and an automobile somewhat larger than an express-train bears down out of the zenith at terrifying speed . Then the blazonry of forty theaters and a dozen moving-picture palaces leaps out of the early dusk . Everything has suddenly become a dazzling phantasmagoria of brobdingnagian animals and men and things to smoke and things to eat and things to wear and leaping fiery fountains and showering stars of crimson and gold and green and blue , set off more and more vividly against the darkening spring sky . It is hideous and gorgeous . It is infernally ugly and somehow fascinating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do n't be fooled . The crowd knows it is there , and is proud . This is New York , and they are of it . This is what every Main Street in America would like to be . I pity you , Roberval . You have nothing like this . Yet these lights of forty theaters suggest another fact in our quest for results of the war in America . This is the most successful theatrical season New York has ever known . There is the usual quota of jazzy musical comedies , trick melodramas , and snappy mechanical farces . But this year there is something else . Play-producers have always taken it for granted that nothing could succeed on Broadway unless built to the last phrase with this sole aim ? to thrill and amuse . To the amazement of producers , several plays that are nothing but pieces of life , and pretty tragic pieces at that , have last year and this outrun certain sure-fire farces and melodramas . Last year St. John Irvine 's " John Ferguson " ran all through spring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clegg " has now been running for several months , and at another theater a genuine and unforgetable play of American life , " Beyond the Horizon , " by Eugene O'Neill , is finding enormous success . Gorki 's " NightLodging " hay ' been very successful in matinee performances and will shortly be put on as a regular evening attraction . These plays would n't have run a week before the war . Has the war made their success possible ? As I consider that question , I think of what booksellers in New York , Cleveland , Detroit , and Boston have told me in the past few weeks . " We never had such a , call for serious books , " was a representative remark . " Think of it , The Education of Henry Adams ' has sold over one hundred and fifty thousand copies , and Keynes 's Economic Consequences of the Peace ' over fifty thousand . Both expensive books , too . Books of this sort would never have sold like that before the war ; never . " Suddenly I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessly ,  | and then brought up sharp by a traffic cop , to let pass a glittering string of limousines . I twist my head and meet the spectacled gaze of an old friend , a professor in Columbia University . We fight free into the comparatively peaceful clamor of a side street . " Effect of the war on America ? " he repeats when greetings are over and I explain the object of my quest . " No effect whatever . " I recite the things that have just been passing through my mind . He purses his lips . " Passing moods ; that ' s all . " But as I walk home along Sixth Avenue my eye catches something I had n't seen before ? immense electric letters pendent over the sidewalk : " Chateau- . Thierry Delicatessen . " Who dares say that a war which achieved that linguistic triumph has done nothing to America ? April 7 , 1920 . Almost the first whisper into the foreign visitor 's ear is the assurance that New York is n't America . Yet sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , one would have a pretty fair epitome of America . Of course New York is America 's dictator ) f fashion ; New York sets our social standards . But how many foreigners realize to what an extent New York is cur intellectual center ? Chicago has its own intellectual and artistic life , but go to Pittsburgh , Louisville , Cleveland , Detroit , St. Louis , Kansas City , and what do you find ? Not only does the social set look to New York for its cues , and the pillars of opinion to the New York newspapers for confirmation of their prejudices , but the group of artists and writers and thinkers in each ) f these cities turns its eyes constantly ) n New York . Consider the case of the oung person in a small town of the Middle West or Far West with artistic ) r literary ambitions or , unluckily for himself , with a mind that questions soand economic standards . The more individual he is , the more he suffers in his surroundings . He goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kind there . But almost all ) f our magazine editorial offices and our gook publishers are in New York . New York is the music center of the country . All our play-producers are in New York . New York is the single big art-market . An illustrator , if he wants to break into the big magazines , must live in or near New York . New York is the birthplace of rebel movements . And so the best , the most daring , and the ambitious out of these groups from Atlantic to Pacific are cbnstantly being drained off by New York . New York draws even from Chicago . If a boy on an Iowa farm , for instance , dreams of becoming an artist , his goal is the Chicago Art Institute . Suppose he wins some success there ; he realizes that to win the biggest success in America he must of necessity come to New York . Sooner or later he is almost certain to come . Here in New York the young painter , poet , playwright , musician , would-be reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the freedom he or she has dreamed of . " New York is the only place I know where one can be what one wants to be and not be thought queer ' or dangerous , " a girl writer said . " You may live where you please and in any way you please , and it ' s no handicap . " Then she added something which would astonish most Americans , whether in New York or out of it . " New York is the only place in the United States where a poor person does n't have to feel apologetic . " What has the war done to these people , the artists and writers and/thinkers ? It sent some of them to jail as conscientious objectors , it sent some of them to France as flaming patriots ; but it has left most of them I know in a mood of disillusion , whatever part they did or did n't play in it . " We ' re trying to find where we are at , " an artist explained to me the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war has given . It ' s a question of what the war has taken away , and whether we can get it back ? the old confidence that beauty had its place and authority . " Which seemed to me approximately the answer any real artist would make , whether in America or France or Germany or England .  | April 8 . Down in Southampton , Long Island , is a butcher who is sailing for France this month with his wife and family to visit the butcher of Misery , a little town in Picardy . The Southampton butcher has never seen the Misery butcher . He is no blood relation to him . In fact , he never even heard of him till two Americans came to Southampton from Paris last summer with stories of Misery ( aptly named ! ) and other villages in the pays devaste . These two Americans are Otis and Elizabeth Mygatt . I do n't remember whether I spoke to you about them in Paris or not . Their scheme , perhaps I told you , was to interest Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . It is a striking idea , and had an instant success . Scores of American engineers , architects , lawyers , doctors , for instance , have pledged themselves to pay for the education of the children of French engineers , architects , lawyers , doctors killed in the war . The purpose is to make this pledge the basis of a real friendship between an American family and a French family by constant interchange of letters , photographs , reports showing the progress of the children , and so on . The Mygatts worked on this idea for over two years in Paris . When they came back to this country last year and went down to Southampton for the summer , they soon had interested virtually every family in Southampton in a family of corresponding station in France . The Southampton butcher sent money to buy a pig for the ruined butcher in Misery . Imagine his satisfaction when he received a photograph of the Misery butcher standing happily beside his new pig and her litter . No wonder the other butchers in town pricked up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him one thing and another , and finally said they did n't see why they should n't rebuild that butcher 's house and set him up in business again . Every time the Mygatts went down town the butcher who had sent money for the pig had some new question to ask . Once it was whether they did n't think he might be descended from French ancestry . ( His name is very Irish . ) Once it was to know the fare to France . And now he ' s sailing ! In this way it has come about that Misery finds itself adopted by Southampton , not wholesale and impersonally , but every man , woman , and child in it has become a household name and personality in some Long Island home . The Mygatts have been carrying this scheme of developing real FrancoAmerican friendship to other towns of our East . What can sooner upset our ridiculous sense of superiority to the rest of the world , and our piqued ego at our failure to adjust the world 's future at a stroke , than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs be determined by the maneuvers of politicians and military men ? Ca n't there be something more genuine than that ? You and I asked ourselves this question years ago . When some thousands of French and American families know one another as well as yours and mine , for instance , or as well as the Misery and Southampton butchers , then we can talk about international understandings . Yours sincerely , WEBB WALDRON . Cedar Ridge , Colorado , April 27 , 1920 . My dear Roberval : The answer one finds out here to our question , " Where 4 America going ? " is " Going West . " There is an impression in the East that our West is a settled country by this time , that every one has found his plot long ago and settled on it for life . It is n't true . This is still a way-station on the journey West . I came out here unexpectedly a few days ago to look after some land that 1 homesteaded and " proved up on " soon after I got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I perched here ter years ago on the south slope of Grand Mesa , I can look down to the shining loops of the Gunnison River , twenty miles away , yet apparently so near one could fling a stone into it . Beyond the - river rises fold after fold of barren ' yellow mesa and canon , up , up , up , to the  | saw-tooth line of the San Miguel Mountains , always covered with snow . Though those mountains are over a hundred miles away , at certain hours of the day they seem not only to thrust to the zenith , but to be toppling over upon my head . So , you see , my location is rather stagy . Twenty-five or thirty years ago settlers began to transform these sagebrush and scrub-oak slopes into appleorchards . And now the whole valley from the river up to the edge of the cedars is an orchard patchwork . Settlers , I said . But people do n't come here to settle . The man who buys land or homesteads and chops out scrub-oak , pulls sage-brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the orchard gets far enough along so that he can attract a buyer and move on ? West . The same impulse that drove him from a tenant farm in Iowa to a try at dry-farming in Kansas still drives him on ? to Oregon , Washington , California . The buyer is another restless farmer , tired of Kansas or Nebraska , who has read the bonanza stories of Colorado apple yields . After a man has sold his ranch , he invariably holds an auction sale of his household goods , animals , and farm machinery . He must have an auction , even if he ' s taking most of his stuff with him . The fence-posts at crossroads are constantly plastered with " Auction Sale . " I ' ve just been to one of these sales . Everybody goes . It ' s a sort of countryside festival . The auctioneer stood on a box at the side door of the house and induced the crowd clustered round to buy rusty pots and cracked kitchen chairs at somewhat more than the price of new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a " moveon " gossip . What a contrast to the French country-side , where each man reverently farms the little strips of ground which his father and his father 's father farmed before him ? ground he clings to even when shells have churned it into a likeness to the plains of hell ! And here I met old Mrs. Johns , who used to live across the creek from my homestead , but has now bought a chicken ranch farther down the valley . Mrs. Johns had two sons . One was drafted , went to France , and was killed in the Argonne . I knew Herb Johns when I taught in the Cedar Ridge School , and I ' ve been talking to Mrs. Johns about him . " I hated to have him go , of course , " she said . " But it was all right , because this was n't a war like others . Least that ' s the idea we got from the papers ? what the President said . A war to stop wars for good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? the belief that our entrance into the war would sweep away the past of Europe , make wars forever after impossible . But Mrs. Johns 's after-war state of soul is n't exactly pique . It ' s something rather troublesome to face . We walked out toward some cottonwoods at the edge of the road . The auctioneer 's voice was cut off by a corner of the house . The dazzling Southwestern sunshine filled the valley . We looked down toward the glittering Gunnison . Mrs. Johns 's voice had grown rather choked . " But it looks as if it had n't settled anything , " she went on after a minute . " The Delta paper says they ' re getting ready to fight again , and we may have to join in . What ' s the reason ? Is it because Congress did n't pass the peace treaty ? " I told her I was afraid it was n't so simple as that . " We do n't know much about such things out here , but I can tell you one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rickety gate . " No son of mine ' s going to fight in any foreign country again . Not for any reason whatever . He ' 11 go to jail first . " We who think about international friendship , world peace , leagues of nations , must take account of Mrs. Johns . Why is she embittered , disillusioned ? Why does she think her sacrifice was useless ? Whose fault is it ? As ever , yours sincerely , WEBB WALDRON.  |
