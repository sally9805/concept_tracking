txt " The electrical rndustry during the past year has enjoyed a period of healthy and steady growth , " stated Otto H. Falk , president of Allis Chalmers Mfg . Co . " Its progress , " he remarked , " particularly in relation to electrical machinery . has been more along the line of improvements and refinements than in radically new developments . The higher efficiency and greater economy of large generating units have only been made possible through the concentration of power production in huge central stations . Tying these stations together in systems and with systems interconnected with super-power chains , extending over vast distances , has brought the advantages of labor , saving , and cheap and reliable electric power and light to a great majority of our citizens , in factory , shop and home . " The carrying of electricity to the rural community and farm , which has been given great impetus during the past few years , will be an important factor in the solution of our agricultural problems , in bringing the cheaper labor of power to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and convenience to the farm . " He declared that electrification of important divisions of railway systems will prove a great impetus to concerns supplying equipment and power . " This , however , " he continued , " Is a development of the future rather than the year just ahead . " One of the most significant movements of industry and particularly in the electrical branch , according to Mr. Falk , has been the getting together of all those having a common interest . " Such associations as the National Electrical Manufacturers Association , " he said , " are bringing the business men of the industry together for interchange of ideas , experiences and methods . This is resulting in a standardization of equipment , appliances and sup- plies with a consequent saving in manufacturing costs , permitting greater use at diminishing cost to the user . " The virile spirit of its leaders wale carry the electrical industry far along in the path of progress , ' he concluded .                 @ @ @ @
