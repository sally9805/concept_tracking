txt Speaking In the f'onimons today to : t strangely quiet house , Premier Boner LBW made clear In his eagerly n wafted statement Op011 the reparations question that there could be no remission of interallied debts until final arrangements for their settlement had been reached . ' Also that he was still opposed to an advance in the ' Buhr because this would be one of those decisive eels that for the moment he deprecates its calculated to precipitate the ruin he sees impending ht Germaily or to endanger unity with France . Ile dwelt upon Great Britain 's debt to America which he said it would be impossible to pay if nothing were received from France , Italy or Germany . To pieeqto meet this obligation otherwise , he was convinced , would reduce I Ito an of living in this country for generations .

" Mr. Donal . Law went on to point out how it would also tend to aggravate the problem of unemployment and said that if the central position of British finance was strong It was only because the taepayers were poor . Germany , he believed , was very near complete collapse . ' She could not improve unless she stabilized the mark , but ' the very process of stabilizing the mark would bring about just such a collapse of industry as Great Britain had suffered . The House listened in silence to this pronouncement , but it gave one cheer as the Premier , in speaking with great caution about the Ruhr problem , declared the Government could not look with equanimity on any action that would make it more difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France and the belief that there could be no solution of the European troubles if the two countries did not act together , and he was sure that the French Premier and Government realized that no misfortune could be worse . than to create vital difficulties between the two countries . Pacifist- Tilts at Lloyd George E. D. Morel , a well-known pacifist , declared the French Government was encouraged to believe that the whole cost of the war could be recovered from Germany by Mr. Lloyd George 's utterances during the armistice and during the peace negotiations . Mr. Lloyd George interposed and asked Mr. Morel to point out a single utterance of his that had given such encouragement . Mr. Morel retorted that he thought it was a. matter of common agreement that one of the main causes which got Mr. Lloyd George back into power in 1918 was the belief that Germany could be Made to pay the whole cost of the war . Lady Astor hereupon exclaimed amid ministerial cheers : " He won the war . " A Labor member retorted : " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astor raised laughter by the quick response : " Better me than you . " Mr. Morel revel quotations from a speech by Lloyd George which Mr. Morel maintained proved his contention . A Labor member interrupted another member who referred to the great military machinery which Germany had built up before the war . The Labor member exclaimed : " What about the British Navy ? " " What do you know about fighting ? " was Lady Astor 's retort . , Lloyd George spoke very briefly . He expressed great satisfaction with Premier Bonar Litw 's statement of policy , but declined to discuss it in detail , as he was anxious that no word of his might obstruct a settlement . Then , dealing with Mr. Morel 's charges he declared he had been misquoted . He read passages from the only speech he made during the 1918 election on the question of indemnities , in which he stated that Germany should pay to fhe utmost limit of her capacity . He said in that speech he pointed out that one committee of experts at the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , while another financial committee had decided she could , but that until the Government had gone into the whole matter more thoroughly he was not going to mislead the public . Balfour Note Policy Upheld . LONDOiq , Dec. 14 ( Associated Press ) : ? Premier Bonar Law in an important statement in the House of Commons today declared frankly for the policy of the Balfour note , which , advocated an adjustment of interallied debts by an all-round cancellation , England on her part surrendering her share of reparations to be paid by Germany . Thus the Prime Minister indicated that the new Government , despite its first declaration that the Balfour note no longer existed so far as the present British Government was concerned and that it would not consider itself bound by it , feels impelled to the same policy as the previous Government . The remainder of Mr. Bonar Law 's speech was clearly addressed to both France and the United States  --  to France , a plea for moderation in dealing with Germany , on the ground that that country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call for help and co-operation in settling the difficult problems of reparations and interallied debts . Another important phase of his speech was the dark picture drawn of England 's economic- and industrial future , should the much hoped for improvement in trade not materialize . The Prime Minister showed the utmost anxiety that there should be no misunderstanding British feelings toward both France and the United States , and said that it was only England 's difficult position he was making clear . England Was burdened with very heavy taxation , which Was a clob on industrial enterprise , resulting in terrible unemployment  --  a problem that made it necessary first that there should be no military occupation of German territory , which would still further handicap European trade without producing results in cash , and , second , compelled him frankly to faze the fact that England was unable to pay the American debt if she received nothina rrom Europe . Strong points in the speech were the unfairness of the view that because England had made sacrifices to pay her way she should be expected to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices escaped , and the warning that too sudden deflation In Germany might produce there all the evils of unemployment from which other countries are already suffering . Policy of Labor Explained . In the subsequent debate Mr. Lloyd George expressed complete approval of Mr. Bonar Law 's speech . The most noteworthy contribution was by James Ramsay Macdonald , the Labor leader , who gave a complete elucidation of the policy of the Labor Party . He maintained that the United States held the key and was the only country able to give Great Britain any help . He differed from the Prime Minister , however , in believing that it was inadvisable to mix together too much the questions of reparations and interallied debts . He admitted that Germany possessed enormous industrial possibilities , yet she must be carefully handled , or she would follow Austria into bankruptcy . He feared that both France and England would need to lower their expectations from Germany very substantially . Declaring that reparations were a curse to both those who paid and those who received , the labor leader said the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what the Allies . could afford to receive , and even if Germany could pay the full amount demanded it would not be to the advantage of the Allies to receive it . France must remember that England had her own trade to consider , and while threats of military penalties were mixed up with economic aims peace would be impossible . E. D. Morel maintained that it would be ridiculous to say that Germany had paid nothing , and declared that , including the cost of the armies of occupation , her actual cash payments , coal deliveries , surrendered mercantile marine and other payments , Germany had already paid the equivalent of ? 1,000,000 , - 000 , or quadruple the indemnity France paid in 1870 . Great unanimity was displayed in support of the Government throughout the whole debate . The submission of questions drafted by agreement between Mr. Macdonald ; Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George was a complete novelty in parliamentary procedure , especially as the questions had been shown to the Prime Minister in advance . Similarly , after Mr. Bonar Law 's speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and agreed that there was no occasion for theta to speak , as they were in accord with the Prime ? Minister 's pronouncement . The opinion in the lobbies was that this unusual unanimity would not he without influence on the adjourned conference to be held in Paris Jan. 2 . Questions Put to Premier . The questions asked of the Prime Minister were , in substance , as follows : What Is the Government 's attitude regarding the proposals or suggestions that a moratorium granted by the Allies in respect to the reparations payments should be accompanied or conditioned by further allied control of Germany , whether that control be - of mines and forests or occupation of further German territory , and in particular occupation of the Ruhr Valley ? What is the attitude of the Government anent France 's desiring to take such action on her own account ? ? ? What , in the view of the Government , is the relation between the discussion and settlement of the questions of reparations and interallied debts on the one hand and in the taking of independent action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ? In his reply Prime Minister Bonar Law said : " I think it is right that we should try to look at these questions from the point of view of France . What Is their view ? Germany undertook to pay a very large amount . Almost nothing has been paid . " Since then we have had conference after conference , and what has been the result ? The result has been in every case , in one form or another , that at the end of the period of moratorium we have found ourselves in a worse position for getting money out of Germany than we were before the discussions . " That is the view of France . - She may also very fairly say that this result Is largely due to the deliberate ace thin of Germany . Now , what was that action ? There is not the smallest doubt that the German Government did allow this tremendous depreciation to take place , and it is a fact that this depreciation does make it impossible for Germany to meet these reparations payments . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by Germany . Well , honestly , I can not myself take that view . I can not do it for this reason : by the method of passive resistance they could forever avoid paying the in-demnity " But there is this to be said for the French view  --  the inflation has enabled the great industrial groups who exercise great power in Germany to make enormous fortunes , although it was part of the arrangement with the German Government that this should not take place and that the money should be made available for reparations . " There is no doubt whatever the . a if there had been a strong enough Government in Germany to face the real position , it was their clear duty , and not only in their own interest , that they should try to put their finances on a sound basis . They have never tried . Maybe this was not their policy , maybe they had not the power , but that is the result . " Pointing out that the result of the most terrible misfortune for Germany , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's internal debt wan wiped out , the Premier said : " If the Germans ever do recover they will be free from that terrible burden of internal debt that falls on us . " " They are sure to recover some day . " he continued , " and the sole problem for consideration is how we can get a legitimate debt paid while doing the least possible injury to the rest of the world and to Germany . " The Prime Minister said the opposing views were held abroad that England had no interest In the reparations and could afford to ? forego not only her share of the reparations but the debts owing her from the European countries , and at the same time pay enormous sums to the United States . Tribute to United States . He did not wish to say a word in criticism of America , because he believed America today was the nearest ' to Great Britain in ideals and that the United States entered the late war without any motive of gain , but solely to help the world in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , but he could not forget the facts . Great Britain had secured a strong budget position and financial organization because she had made the taxpayer poor , but , he asked , did any one imagine these enormous sums could have been taken from industry without seriously impeding the possibility of industrial expansion ? Had we adopted different methods , " he said , " we might have had today much less unemployment , and the world would have recognized through our less sound financial position that we were not in a position to pay these large sums . That is the unfairness of it . " Public opinion abroad has assumed that we are able to meet our obligations and help our friends . In realty we are in no such position . We are paying ? 100 , - 000,1100 yearly to the unemployed . " The effect of the unemployment he described as terrible , declaring that , unless there was a trade improvement within a reasonable time , Britain would reach a position which , in his opinion , would be worse than almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Germany , lie said that the Government was not thinking of past mistakes or or enmity . but only desired to find the best method of ascertaining the amount Germany could pay . " If Germany ever does recover , " he added , " she will he in a far better position to pay these indemnities than we should be to pay our debt to America . That is a fact . "
