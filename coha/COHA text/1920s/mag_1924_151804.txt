During the election campaign , ex-Premier Paul Painlev , pacifist , academician , the man reputed to have favored pacifism during the War , yet took such delight in claiming responsibility for the appointment of le marchal Foch to supreme command of the French Army that he wrote a book about it , this man was reported in the cho de Paris to have said : " Citoyens ! The bloc National is the cause of all our national calamities . ... I am French , but I am European . . . . Liberty , fraternity , socialism ! . . . Peace with Soviet Russia ! . . . Above all peace with republican and pacific Germany who is also democratic and sincere . . . . Peace , peace at all costs ! . . . " <P> M. Henri de Kerillis , journalist , last week quoted a speech made by Painlev in 1913 , showing how the politicien made a bad prophecy , and asked if he may not now be a bad prophet . The 1913 speech : " Above their hateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands and open their hearts to us . Citoyens , do not allow yourselves to be impressed by the phantoms of War stirred up by Reaction and Clericalism at bay . "
