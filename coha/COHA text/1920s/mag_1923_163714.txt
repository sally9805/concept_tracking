The United States Coal Commission , headed by John Hays Hammond , made public its preliminary report on the Anthracite Coal situation . <P> Although it is only a preliminary report it consists of some 27,000 words and is the result of eight months ' investigation of six men and a corps of expert assistants . <P> In its fact finding capacity , the Commission did not confine itself merely to gathering statistics , but also drew general conclusions . The more important points of the report follow : Existing property rights in anthracite mines should not be abolished either by Government purchase or by expropriation . The Government should exercise control of the industry and also , if at any time the supply of anthracite is cut off by labor troubles or otherwise , the President should be empowered to declare an emergency , take over the mines temporarily , fix wages , mine , transport and distribute coal . The retail price of anthracite has practically doubled in ten years . About 50 cents of the consumer 's dollar goes to pay for coal at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers ' and jobbers ' profits . Of this same dollar about eleven cents , altogether , goes as profit , divided between the producer , jobber , it ' any , and retailer . In times of shortage , however , jobbers often buy and sell the same coal several times so that a whole series of extra profits is pyramided on the retail price . Freight charges consume from 16 to 30 cents of the consumer 's dollar ( depending on his distance from the mine ) so that a material reduction in the cost of coal could be brought about by lower freight rates . I The average cost of mining a ton of coal increased from $2.23 in 1913 labor cost 70% of the $2.23 ton cost . There were 147,456 anthracite mine workers , according to 1920 returns . Those miners who work all year earn from $1,500 to $2,000 a year . The Government should get and publish regular reports on the entire anthracite business . - costs and production . There is no standard method of valuing coal mines which can be applied to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1913 , anthracite production increased in proportion to population . Since 1913 anthracite production on the average has remained the same every year in spite of increasing population . As for labor , neither union nor non-union advocates can show " absolutely clean hands in keeping and helping to enforce the civil rights of American citizens . " There should be a " continuing umpire " to sit on the Conciliation Board between operators and miners . " There has been too much epithet , too little argument " between the operators and the miners . The Commission will recommend no " punitive measures " unless the outcome of the present conference at Atlantic City seems to call for such action .
