The Senior Senator from Idaho has been pressing other public men for their views on Prohibition in the next election . Last week he was himself pressed for views . Wrote a Dr. Charles Alfred Lee Reed of Cincinnati : <P> " Dear Senator Borah . . . " <P> 1 . Are you in favor of the principles and practices of super-government as exemplified by the Anti-Saloon League , the Board of Prohibition , Temperance and Public Morals of the Methodist Episcopal Church and by their ancillary organization , the late , unlamented Ku Klux Klan ? <P> 2 . Are you in favor of having any religious denomination , Protestant or Catholic , backed by a nation-wide militant organization , established at Washington for the declared purpose of exercising what the Methodist Church now openly assumes to exercise , namely , the functions of censorship and dictatorship over all branches of our constitutional government ? <P> " 3 . Are you , as a Republican , in favor of having our party as a stalking horse for any candidate who emanates from super-government sources , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of election would be the agent of the super-government rather than the executive of the people under constitutional government ? " <P> Dr. Reed also said to Senator Borah : " You have diverted attention from the vastly more important questions upon which that issue Prohibition enforcement rests . You have also in a measure diverted attention from the fact that you yourself are a potential candidate . . . from the equally evident fact that your championship of this particular issue puts you on a favorable position to have its organized friends . . . stampede the convention to you in the event of a deadlock . " <P> Senator Borah , bearlike friend of logic , answered plainly , boldly : <P> " Assuming for the purposes of this letter that I am a candidate for President , which I am not , and assuming for the purposes of this letter that the implications and inferences and statements in your questions are based upon facts , then I answer your interrogatories as follows : <P> " To interrogatory No. 1 , my answer is , No . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . <P> " To interrogatory No. 3 , my answer is , No. "
