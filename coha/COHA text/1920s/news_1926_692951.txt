According to The Chicago Tribune , which is not always quite as respectful to the East as the Middle West ought to be , the New York papers have not sent reporters of the right sort up into the Adirondacks to report the happenings at and near White Pine Camp . The Tribune grows facetious over the inability , as it imagines , of the assigned correspondents to decide whether it was a pike or a pickerel that the President caught . Only when Governor Smrrn appeared by the lake , it-says , and talked of light wines and beer and other things familiar to metropolitan reporters could they write with any ease or certainty .

Now , " peasantry " is a word safe to apply to the resident and born inhabitants of the Adirondacks only from a distance at least as great as Chicago .

They have , however , not one trait of peasants- ? neither their humility nor their occasion ferocity , and still less either their illiteracy or their superstitions .
