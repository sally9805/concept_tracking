The heavy hand of the censor having fallen upon Brazil ( see THE PRESS ) , news from that " revoluting " country was a tangled mass of conflicting rumors , in which the truth was all but inextricable . <P> The communiqus issued by the Brazilian Government stated that victory was in sight : that a great battle was raging in which the defeat of the rebels was momentarily expected ; that the rebel cause was doomed ; that strong reinforcements had been sent to the Sao Paulo front and a decisive engagement planned ; that the great assault was certain to crush the rebels ; that the attack was about to begin . <P> Rumors from the rebel side were based upon the usual journalistic " trustworthy information . " This information was exclusively to the effect that the rebels were gaining ; that they were stronger than was supposed ; that they awaited the Federal 's attack with serene contempt ; that they were entirely confident that they could hold the city of Sao Paulo against their enemy until further orders ; and much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems pretty well established that the cause of the revolt is ancient . The State of Sao Paulo is the home of the rich coffee planters , known as the " Yankees of Brazil , " because of their enterprise and wealth . This State has an area of 112,312 square miles and is therefore larger than all the New England States with Pennsylvania added . <P> Away back in 1889 Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil , reformer and pacifist , lost his throne by decreeing the release of hundreds of thousands of slaves belonging to the coffee planters without compensation . At the same time his pacifism alienated the militarists and his refusal to grant them the rights they demanded caused them to join the planters ; since that time the two ( planters and militarists ) groups have remained together . <P> The situation leading up to the present revolt is similar . President Artur da Silva Bernardes is a reformer . To improve the nation 's finances , he cut the Army appropriations , and , unheard-of thing , he introduced the income tax to Brazil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their appropriations , and the rich planters , who suffered most from the hated income tax , became the President 's intractable enemies , the more so since he was also a vigorous opponent of peonage ( system of quasi-feudalism ) which they were anxious to have recognized . <P> Thus , after much hostility , embittered by personal feelings and actions , the revolt broke out in Sao Paulo , richest State of Brazil , and battle is now being waged between " liberalism " in power and " reactionism " out of power .
