Happy Valley , Tenn. , was full of new trouble last week . Ten thousand idle hands itched with mischief . Strikers from the American Bemberg and Glantzoff artificial silk factories at Elizabethton , Tenn. , felt the prick of National Guard bayonets . <P> These mills had been reopened in the face of the union strike ( TIME , April 15 et seg . ) . Their German managers demanded and received military protection from the State . Machine guns bristled on the plant roofs , manned by young Guardsmen , many of them students from the University of Tennessee . Some 800 militiamen and special deputies enforced what was , in effect , martial law through Happy Valley . <P> To operate the mills , the managers scoured the East Tennessee mountain country for strikebreakers whom they drove to the plants in busses and trucks under armed guards . The strikers , many of them also back-countrymen , attempted to block the highways , break up the convoys . Trees were felled across the road . In one case a " loyal worker " injured three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilt through a blockading group . Adjutant General W. C. Boyd in charge of militia at Elizabethton was arrested on a charge of " aiding and abetting an attempt to commit murder , " preferred by a woman striker seriously injured by this motor onslaught . <P> Riots and bloodshed ensued . Tear bombs were hurled . Several hundred strikers were arrested at once and herded , shouting and cursing , into the Carter County Courthouse auditorium . The tiny jail was full . No sooner did law officers release some of the prisoners , than others were brought in . Elizabethton 's 16-inch water conduit was dynamited three miles out of town . Schools closed . Trucks trundled to Johnson City , eleven miles away , for drinking water . Homes of strikers and strikebreakers were dynamited , barns burned . <P> These disorders drew protests against the use of troops in Happy Valley . Lieut . Gov . Herbert H. Lehman of New York State resigned as a director of the Bemberg and Glantzoff companies after futile attempts to induce their managements to settle the strike , to forego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollis Horton had appointed President George L. Berry of the International Pressman 's Union as the State 's mediator in this Labor dispute . Major Berry was born one county away from Happy Valley . He knows the temper of its people . He was a Vice Presidential candidate at the Republican National Convention last year . Great is his influence among Union Workers . Great is the respect U. S. publishers have for him , for his word keeps their presses turning . His good offices quickly settled the famed New York City Pressmen 's strike in 1923 , when for several days all New Yorkers were reduced to reading one jointly-issued tabloid for their news . <P> Last week Major Berry withdrew as mediator because Gov . Horton had sent into Elizabethton additional troops " under whose guise the rayon plants are being operated . " Mayor Berry sided with the strikers and , with a voice like an organ , called for a $100,000 relief fund to carry the strike through to success .               @ @ @ @ @ @
