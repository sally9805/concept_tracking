When the U. S. Steel Corporation acquired its own railroad lines to expedite the passage of its raw material and products from mine to mill , much comment was occasioned . In recent years , the example set by the Steel Corporation has been followed by Henry Ford in acquiring the Detroit , Toledo &; Ironton Railroad . <P> Apparently the Willys-Overland interests have decided to emulate their great rival in Detroit . Together with the Wabash Railroad , Willys-Overland has just acquired the Toledo &; Western Railroad , as well as several hundred acres of industrial sites in West Toledo . The joint owners have organized the Toledo &; Western Railway Co. to operate the road and develop the new industrial acreage . The value of road and land is estimated at $2,000,000 ; in addition , $1,000,000 will be spent in modernizing the road and improving its terminal facilities in West Toledo . A spur line will very shortly be extended from West Toledo to the great Willys-Overland factory in Toledo .               @ @ @ @ @ @
