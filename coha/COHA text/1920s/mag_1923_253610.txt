Dr. Edouard Benes , Czecho-Slovakian Foreign Minister , abandoned a projected visit to Warsaw , capital of Poland , on account of strong opposition shown by the Polish public . The object of Dr. Benes ' visit was to induce Poland to enter the Little Entente-Czecho-Slovakia , Yugo-Slavia , Rumania . But Polish public opinion is against such a step . <P> The main differences between these two Slav States is that Czecho-Slovakia is the enthusiastic exponent of Pan-Slavism , ( a doctrine purporting to join up the Slavonic races , which include the Russians , Poles , Czechs , Slovaks , Slovenes , Bulgars , Serbs , Croats ) while Poland , remembering her fate as a part of Russia , is strongly against a movement that might eventually resubject her to Russian authority . Another important difference , intimately related to the Pan-Slav question , is that Czechoslovakia is opposed to the award of Galicia to Poland , because such an arrangement interferes with Czecho-Slovakian plans for a Pan-Slav corridor reaching from Russia in the northeast to Yugo-Slavia in the south .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
