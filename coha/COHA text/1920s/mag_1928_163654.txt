The morning after the night before ( according to one story ) , Senator Borah was taking his ursine way through the Hotel Muehlebach lobby when he encountered tall Senator Smoot , who had sat up late discussing the vice presidency with other party wise men . <P> Senator Borah smiled his crinkly smile and asked : " Who 's going to be nominated for Vice President ? " <P> Senator Smoot wearily replied : " Cox of Massachusetts . " -* <P> Then ( so the story goes ) , Senator Borah 's smile vanished . " What the hell is the matter with you ? " he cried . " Have you all gone crazy ? I do n't know much about politics , but evidently I know a thousand times more than Hoover ! What do you want to do , crucify us all in November ? " <P> " Why , what 's the trouble ? " asked startled Senator Smoot . <P> " Trouble ! None , excepting that nobody outside of Massachusetts ever heard of Cox . This convention has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall know the reason why ! Let me warn you now , Senator , you can tell the Hoover crowd that Curtis has got to be nominated to keep the western states in line and if anybody else is put up I shall go before the convention and present his name and make a fight for it , and I think I can put him across ! " <P> " Oh , do n't do that , " said Senator Smoot . " Just hold off and I 'll see about it . " <P> Another more likely story is as follows : The party chieftains sat up late , all night in fact . They telephoned to Vice President Dawes in Evanston , Ill . He was most agreeable to running again if drafted . His chief proponent , Mrs. Ruth Hanna Mc-Cormick went to bed believing the matter was settled . She was awakened about 6 a. m. and asked to go back to Secretary Mellon 's room . The conference had decided that Mr. Dawes had been too anti-administration . Who else would please Illinois ? Senator Borah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris Cox of Massachusetts had been blocked by Governor Alvan Tufts Fuller , who wanted the nomination himself and would let no other Massachusetts man get ahead . The Curtis compromise resulted between 7 and 8 a. m. in a hotel room full of sleep-starved men . <P> Senator Curtis sat in his hotel room all morning answering telephone calls . Surprised delegation leaders were inquiring if it was true that he would consent to be the " tail of the ticket " after announcing he would be the head and nothing else . Senator Curtis reiterated that he would not consent . But the political prairies were afire . <P> When the convention went into session , Connecticut 's John Quillin Tilson , Massachusetts ' Governor Alvan Tufts Fuller , Michigan 's Chase Salmon Osborn and Missouri 's Governor Sam A. Baker were all placed in nomination . But up got Senator Borah , out boomed the great Borah voice , up jumped the Kansans in a repetition of their Curtis demonstration the night before . The four other nominees withdrew .
