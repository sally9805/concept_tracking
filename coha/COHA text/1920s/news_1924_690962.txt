Text of General Wood 's Letter . The text of the letter from Major Gen. Leonard Wood which was read in tribute to Theodore Roosevelt at the ceremony attending the dedication of the Roosevelt memorial at Santiago de Cuba yesterday was given out here last night . The letter reads : Office of the Governor General of the Philippine Islands . Manila , Sept. 27 , 1924 . To the Officers and Men of the First United States Volunteer Cavalry , Rough Riders : I deeply regret that I can not be with you today at San Juan Hill and unite with you in paying the regiment 's tribute of respect and honor to our comrade Colonel Theodore Roosevelt . It has been my misfortune to have seen very little of the regiment since those strenuous days when we were organizing and undergcing our training in Texas and the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service abroad has prevented my being at any of the regimental reunions held since the war . all of which deepens my regret dnd disappointment at not being with YOU on this occasion . The regiment has always had a warm place in my heart , and I have taken the greatest pride in its record and accomplishments and have followed the career of its members since the war with keen interest . The regiment 's record of service was a short but brilliant one . It never failed to do effectively whatever it was called upon to do . Its objectives were always taken and it established a high record for efficiency . No one took more pride - in the record and accomplishments of the regiment and in his associations with it than the man whose memory we are here today to honor . Theodore Roosevelt was one of that trinity of great Presidents  --  Washington , Lincoln and Roosevelt ; a man , who did his duty fearlessly as he saw it , whose sympathies were as broad as the lands over which our flag flies ; a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither race , color or creed , but dealt justly with all alike : a citizen of the world in the best sense , a man- - with deep human sympathy , and , with it all . an intensely loyal American who stood ready to ? give everything for his country , even life itself . His sons went to the war with his blessing and all rendered gallant , service . One gave his life to the cause . I believe the keenest disappointment of Theodore Roosevelt 's life was that he was denied-an opportunity to serve his country in France : He was as keen to enter the World War as he was the Spanish War , realizing that it was a war for free institutions , a. war to make the world safe for the smaller and weaker nations , a war to limit and control self-determination on the part of unscrupulous nations heedless of the rights of others . Denied the opportunity to serve in France , he devoted his entire energy and did everything possible to aid in carrying on the war to a successful termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching every portion of our land , calling on the people to perform their clear duty without further delay ; lie was largely instrumental In bringing America whole- ' heartedly into the war . His life was an inspiration for service , service of the most lofty and unselfish kind , service for country , for mankind and for God . He has gone on before , but his principles , his policies and his deed mil/ be with us always , a priceles heritage and an inspiration to us to make the world a better place to live in and safer for free institutions . He loved the regiment as it loved and loves him . He was a gallant soldier and leader , always thoughtful of his men , their comfort and welfare . We do well to honor his memory by erecting this memorial . Let us unite in paying him even greater honor by doing our best to keep alive his ideals and to serve the nation as he served it .
