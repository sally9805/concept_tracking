Comrade Leon Trotzky wasted no time on deploring the evils of good drink . Instead he cried to the municipal brewers : " Your beer is a disgrace ! It is made with wild hops and rotten malt , and has been contaminated by the overflow from a dye factory . The Government has turned over to you the best breweries in Moscow . In them you make poison , while the breweries rented to private enterprises turn out good beer . You know I am fighting home-brewed vodka , and yet you produce worse than homebrewed beer . But you sha n't fool the public . I shall tell them not to buy your bad beer !
