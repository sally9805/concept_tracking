Out of a State , War &; Navy building office labelled " Assistant Secretary of War " strode a tall , straight , handsome man from Tulsa , Okla . Briskly he paced a hundred feet along the stone-flagged corridor , turned sharply into another office labelled " Secretary of War . " There , surrounded by flowers , furled flags , miniature airplanes , trench equipment , antique cannon and the portraits of former War Secretaries , many hands wrung his , many voices babbled congratulations . <P> Such last week was the promotion of Patrick Jay Hurley from the sub-Cabinet to the Cabinet , to replace Iowa 's James William Good , deceased . His appointment by President Hoover approximated cabinet recognition for the no longer Solid-South , First Oklahoman to sit in a cabinet , Secretary Hurley is a Roman Catholic . Washington , familiar with him for less than a year , predicted two things of his incumbency at the War Department : 1 ) Though the youngest of the Cabinet ( 46 ) , he will not be a mere Yes-Man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief busier considering suggestions than issuing orders . 2 ) Not for many a year will the rank &; file of the Army have known a Secretary so much of their own kind . <P> Friday is the prime day of the Hurley week . He was born on Friday in Choctaw Nation , Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) . He denies having Indian blood. * At 11 he was driving " Kicking Pete , " a mule , in shaft 6 of the Atoka Coal &; Mining Co . At 15 he was punching cows on " Lazy S " ranch and feeling aggrieved that Theodore Roosevelt had rejected him as a rough rider . At 19 he was a captain of the Indian Territorial Militia warring against Chief Crazy Snake . On a Friday he was graduated from law school , and on a Friday became a practicing attorney in Tulsa , making money and a reputation . In the War he joined the Army on Friday , was commissioned a Major and sent over seas as a staff officer ( Judge Advocate Sixth Army ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to salute General Pershing . The A. E. F. commander ordered him back , berated him . Six years later Mr. Hurley , civilian , burst jovially in upon General Pershing in his Washington office , defied being made to salute again . Gen eral Pershing was amused . <P> On Armistice Day Major Hurley did some voluntary reconnaissance near Louppy under heavy enemy fire which won him a silver star citation . <P> Before going off to War , Major Hurley asked the beauteous and accomplished Ruth Wilson to marry him . She sent him to her father , Rear Admiral Henry B. Wilson , commander of the Atlantic fleet , then lying in the Hudson River . Thither the love-struck Major hastened . He says life 's greatest thrill came when the Admiral 's barge took him off to the flagship where he was ceremoniously piped over the rail . Formally , as one U. S. officer to another , he presented his compliments to the Admiral , requested his daughter 's hand in marriage . After the War they were married , on a Friday ; became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of War , on another Friday Secretary of War . <P> As a lawyer-businessman Secretary Hurley has made money . He pulled the wildcatting Gililland Oil Co. out of bankruptcy , sold it to Standard Oil for a $3,500,000 profit . He is part owner of the Hurley-Wright Building ( U. S. Railroad Administration ) in Washington , of apartment houses in Tulsa.
