In the House last week arose many a member to debate legislation entitled H. R. 2667 : a BILL to provide revenue , to regulate commerce with foreign countries , to encourage the industries of the United States and for other purposes . By Representative Willis C. Hawley . This was the Tariff Bill , now officially before the House . But behind the debate was no conviction , no electrifying enthusiasm . The debaters well knew that their words beat empty air , that the real fate of this measure was being settled elsewhere . <P> Ways &; Means . In a back-room political conference , the G. O. P. members of the House Ways &; Means Committee met the revolt against the Tariff Bill by holding additional secret hearings last week . Before them appeared Congressmen from farm states to state the price ( i.e. , upward revision on pet commodities ) they would demand to support the measure on the House floor . Patiently the committee heard them ask for greater duties on casein , canned tomatoes , potatoes , live cattle , hides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these hearings was to evolve a common political denominator on which sufficient Republican strength could be massed to insure the farm bill against serious revision on the House floor . The committee was ready to compromise , to grant increased agricultural rates to win solid party support for the bill as a whole against all Democratic amendments . <P> Hoover Increases . President Hoover sought to ease the tension by exercising the flexible provision of the present tariff law and raising the duty on three farm commodities . He raised : 1 ) Milk from 2 cents to 3 cents per gallon ( the new bill-5 cents per gallon ) ; 2 ) Cream from 20 cents to 30 cents per gallon ( the new bill-48 cents per gallon ) ; 3 ) Flaxseed from 40 cents to 56 cents per bushel ( the new bill-56 cents per bushel ) . At the same time , not for the benefit of the farmer , President Hoover made increases in the duty on window glass varying from ? cent to 1 cents per pound . <P> These presidential actions were based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that in each case foreign production costs were less than U. S. costs . The President said : " The farmers and others should have the benefit of the Tariff Commission 's determination at once . " <P> Great was the psychological effect of these increases at the Capitol . <P> Senate on Sugar . In 1924 the Tariff Commission made an investigation of sugar , prepared a report recommending tariff changes , submitted it to President Coolidge . This report , at the time , was supposed to favor a substantial reduction of the sugar duty . A candidate for reelection , President Coolidge pigeonholed the report , delayed action . After he was elected , he refused to make any cut . <P> Last week the Senate adopted a resolution by Senator Walsh ( Massachusetts ) calling upon the Tariff Commission to submit to it a copy of this sugar report . Utah 's Senator Smoot , Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , great and good friend of the domestic beet sugar industry , declared that " nobody except the President has a right to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forthcoming sugar tariff battle .
