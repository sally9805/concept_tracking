txt // Kant taught , that the mind in its own right contributes unsensational elements or forms , and these , as taking up sensation as concrete matter , constitute our actual experience at t he level of reflection . These unsensational elements which the mind contributes are the categories . The problem which Kant raised is , as we have suggested , one for psychology and logic to solve . Do we ever begin with atomic sensations ? Or are not sensations rather distinctions in a presentational continuum ? Are not relations and meanings present in our experience from the first ? It is along this line of emphasis on continuity and synthetic motor response that modern bio-psychology is working . The organism is stimulated , but the stimulus may be complex and patterned as in vision ; and the response of the organism expresses the synthesis of past experience . There is internal organization , and this organization is brought to bear functionally upon the stimulus . The field of experience reflects this basic process . We shall have more to say of this point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional , genetic way of approach . For him , the supplementary elements over and above the specific sense-content must conic from a fixed source in reason . They must be contributed by the Transcendental Ego . Space , time , permanence , quantity , causality , all these structural forms of knowledge are injected , as it were , into the sense-manifold . And Kant struggles to bring the two ingredients together . The Categories Are Subjective. ? For Kant , the categories are subjective in a double sense . They are innate and contributed by the Ego ; and they have no significance for the realm of things-in-themselves . The second position follows from the first . It would be by the merest accident that forms and relations thus produced by an independent self would have cognitive , ' significance for a separate realm of things-inthemselves whose sole function is to cause an inchoate manifold of sense . Kant shuts himself into agnosticism with // respect to this postulated realm by his very approach . He taught that the categories exist only in the mind and have significance only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to misuse them . We might paraphrase Berkeley 's argument and say that Kant 's view was that a category could be like nothing but a category . Subjective spatial order could not in any way correspond to an external spatial order . And the same with temporal order and causal connection . It is obvious why Kant drew again the skeptical conclusion already drawn by IIume . Knowledge can be only the presentation to the knowing self of constructs within experience . It is an awareness of law among phenomenal bodies . And if the world of things-in-themselves is neither spatial nor temporal , it would seem the veriest nonsense to speak of it as the physical world . The true physical world , that with which science deals , is the world of interconnected phenomenal bodies . And it is because the structure of this world is given by mind that we find our understanding at home in it . Let us for a moment compare his position with that of Descartes . Both accept much the same discontinuity between sense and reason . Descartes , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading . Yet he wants knowledge of an external physical world . Being confined to his concepts and being unable to compare them with this world , he finds his criterion in the faith that God would not deceive us and that , therefore , all our clear and distinct ideas are true , that is , reveal to us the essential nature of this otherwise hidden material realm . Kant has much in common with Descartes but does not seek to know an external world . In the realm of experience , made by the confluence of sense and reason , the only significant knowledge exists . The spiritualism of Leibniz had intervened for him , much as the spiritualism of Berkeley had intervened for IIume . He worked within a set of assumptions which hardly exist for us to-day . But Are the Categories Subjective ? ? Recent thought is // strongly inclined to challenge the position that the categories are subjective in either of the senses mentioned above as holding for Kantianism . The categories , I would say , are not emitted by a peculiar Ego as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an external world transcending the field of experience . These points we shall develop in detail later and we can only call attention to them here . In the first place , we must begin with experience as it presents itself and not with a hypothetical chaos of sensations and a hypothetical group of forms . Are not both of these artificial abstractions due to a misunderstanding of the actual flow and development of experience ? We must press deeper and seek to understand the content of experience by means of a study of mental operations and results . Modern logic and psychology will help us much in this endeavor though we must keep our own eyes open . We shall find that experience has a pattern from the beginning and that , as the mind grows in response to the world and its problems , this pattern acquires meanings and passes to the interpreted thought of bodies in relations to one another . In short , the categories are implicit in perceptual experience and are elicited and developed by thought rather than secreted by a mysterious internal self . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up in response to the external world , may they not be patterned after it and revelatory of it ? If so , the categories would not be subjective in any invidious sense ; they would have cognitive significance for external things . And these should no longer be spoken of as things-in-themselves . This basic re-construction of Kantianism which seeks to remove its false subjectivism , its inherited opposition between sense and reason , and its agnosticism indicates to us at the same time the re-construction of Cartesianism which is necessary . Here , again , we must not begin with a metaphysical dualism between mind and matter . It was this separation which , together with the separation between sense // and reason , gave the artificial twist to the problem of knowl-edge which led philosophical thought astray . Instead of categories growing up in experience under the control of the external world and therefore inevitably significant for it , we have ideas of reason produced by the mind out of itself and not in cooperation with the external world to which they are to apply . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preestablished harmony , as it were , to be guaranteed by God , or a mystery which we humbly accept because God would surely not deceive us and implant in us clear and distinct ideas which were not true ! It is obvious that we are to-day largely free from these sets of assumptions and approach the problems of philosophy in a more empirical and inductive spirit and in the light of the biological setting and function of mind . This much in the way of anticipation and suggeston . The Period after Kant . ? It has not been our purpose to go into the history of philosophy for its own sake ; we have desired only to grasp Kant was remarkable chiefly for the rise in Germany of a romantic idealism called variously absolute and objective idealism , and for its spread to other countries including England and the United States . It must not be denied , however , that the older empirical tradition persisted and found able advocates in such thinkers as Mill1 and Sidgwick , ' and that , after the fervor of absolute idealism had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the front . In the meantime , advances made in mathe-matics , logic and psychology , together with the success of the sciences , gave a new orientation to philosophy . Since these later developments will appear in detail in the constructive part of this book , they can be neglected at this point . A few // words about the rise and general character of absolute idealism will finish our brief historical sketch . We must admit that Kant 's position , for all its suggestiveness , was a rather mechanical compromise between sensationalism and rationalism . All order is contributed by the mind from its own resources . And this mind is still thought of as something essentially beyond the scope of science . Later we shall argue for the naturalization of mind ; so this point must be carefully noted . Furthermore , Kant 's position was a half-way house between realism and idealism . While dominated by the problems he had inherited ? we might almost call them puzzles ? he sought to maintain a balance between extremes . IIe was neither quite a realist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realist , it must be as an agnostic realist , a believer in unknowable things-in-themselves . And he speaks in terms of condescension of the " good Berkeley . " But his successors took the bit between their teeth and entered on a career of speculative construction . There is no reason to belittle their ability . In social , ethical and political matters they made genuine contributions . But it is doubtful whether they did justice to the natural sciences and to the problems connected with perception and the relation between mind and body . In their hands , Experience became a sort of autonomous reality . We can easily see why this was , and , because the assumption has been so important in its continued influence on philosophy until the recent rise of realism , it is well to get the basis of it clearly in mind . It was the thing-initself as a cause of sensations which was attacked . Are not the categories forms contributed by the mind for the ordering of sense according to Kant ? If so , are they not limited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If so , we can not use the category of causation outside of experience and speak of things-in-themselves as causing the manifold of sense . Causation is only a relation within experience and it is really quite meaningless to refer to realities outside of experience . // Let me raise a query here . Psychology and logic have seen good reason to doubt that we ever begin with a chaos of mere qualities like color and sound . There is pattern , order , correlation from the first . Spatial and temporal relations are experientially primitive even though they develop and deepen as the organism continues to function . We shall argue that the categories grow in a natural way from the cues and suggestions given in experience and that they are not contributed by a transcendental mind . But , if so , they are assigned to things just as colors and sounds are . It is things which are in spatial relations and it is external events which are in temporal relations . In short , the content of experience is from the first directed to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting itself . Experience is not substantive , as idealists tend to hold , but a phase of the functioning of the organism . We perceive and think things in terms of discriminated characters among which are relations . But philosophy had not yet grasped this functional view . The Cartesian dualism had prevented it . It is only recently with the growth of biology and psychology of a biological setting that this more functional type of realism could arise . Man has a complex world to master and it is not surprising that assumptions hold his eyes from what seems to later generations the obvious outlook . It is all a matter of growth , the greater part of which we owe to the steady , cooperative advance of science . As we would expect , the idealists of this period were weakest in their philosophy of nature . In the social and political fields they attacked extreme individualism and appreciated the idea of development . It would be absurd to deny their keenness and speculative fertility . Fichte - was an ethical genius and emphasized the will ; Schelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intuitive and creative type , thus moving in the direction of pantheism ; Hegel was a rationalist and tried to work out the inner logic // of an absolute reason . All of them believed that intense speculation could by itself lead the thinker into the heart of reality . They had gotten rid of an independent physical world and were convinced that reality was akin to that in themselves which seemed to them central and important . Unfortunately there was not enough cooperation with science in this romantic wave of speculation . This movement exhausted itself and , as time passed , the more empirical and realistic traditions which had always kept more closely in touch with science began to regain attention . Toward the end of the nineteenth century , we hear of prag-matism and realism . It is in these movements that the most hopeful recent philosophical work has been done . Yet the idealistic tradition may be said to have exercised a steadying influence upon both of these rather emphatic novelties . We shall now endeavor to do definitely constructive work in theory of knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present situation in philosophy . It will be our aim to bring out problems and to suggest analyses and solutions . In this way , it is hoped , the student will learn to philosophize because he will see that the problems are at once unavoidable and tremendously important . CHAPTER IX REFERENCES AND DISTINCTIONS WITHIN CONSCIOUSNESS Significant Points Learned. ? As a result of the careful studies made in the preceding chapters we should now be ready to make a constructive advance in epistemology . We are at one and the same time acquainted with the difficulties confronting natural realism and with the dangers which threaten any attempt to pass beyond it . And in this case to be forewarned is to be forearmed . We know what mistakes to avoid . It is also clear that there has been an historical growth in these matters , a gaining of insight . Through many centuries philosophy has been feeling out possibilities and acquiring a competent knowledge of the human situation in knowing . There is good reason to believe that all this information is at last beginning to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take stock of the points we have learned . On the whole , the following three seem to be the most important : ( 1 ) the error of separating sense and reason into two domains having distinct sources ; ( 2 ) the error of the assumption that mind and matter are two distinct substances isolated from each other ; and ( 3 ) the theory , connected historically with this two-substance view , that knowledge is directed at ideas rather than at objects . In our historical sketch we saw that these assumptions controlled the outlook and problems of Descartes , Locke , Berkeley , Hume and Kant . A few words about each of these points may be of assistance . In place of the contrast between sense and reason , the modern thinker puts the recognition of levels in experience . Suppose that we take sense-perception as the first level of prime interest to the epistemologist . We soon discover that 107 // ( 1 ) there is structure , or pattern , in what is presented in sense-perception and ( 2 ) that there is interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for methods , operations and processes which build upon and add to this level . It is a term for analysis , the discovery of relations , the seeking of more facts , the development of concepts , the application of experimental methods , etc . Thus reasoning is a term for operations , methods and capacities which carry our experience farther and deeper than sense-perception alone can . But it is not a term for a special faculty . We may say , then , that the old dualistic , faculty psychology and logic have been replaced by a keener and more empirical sense of the gradual growth and complication of experience and of the processes upon which this complication and conceptualization rests . However far down we go , there is a form , or pattern , to the content of consciousness . It was this form which Hume with his atomic sensationalism neglected and which Kant artificially brought in . May it not be that this pattern of experience reflects the pattern of the world to which the conscious organism is adjusting itself ? To take the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . Thus we are led to the second point . The two-substance theory of Descartes set problems which could not easily be answered and gave a bias to epistemology which it has found it hard to overcome . Locke 's inability to carry through a representative realism led to idealism and phenomenalism . If there are substances , how can we know them , was the seemingly unanswerable query . What do we mean by a substance ? Berkeley 's arguments have seemed to many convincing . We shall find that , even in contemporary philosophy , there is a strong bias against the belief in any kind of stuff . If we know only our ideas we can not know substance . Hence this second point leads to the third assumption which confused philosophy for so long a time . Are we confined to ideas of a subjective sort ? Let us remember that , on the // two-substance theory , the mind is confined to its own ideas which are , as it were , a part of its substance . This was what was meant for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not we say that ideas are subjective in the sense that they are bound up with the individual organic knower and those operations which we call mental . In this sense , to say that ideas are mental has nothing to do with the twosubstance theory . It is to localize them and the operations which go with them . It is just to admit the fact of consciousness . What consciousness is and how it is bound up with the organism becomes a specific question which metaphysics must busy itself with . Lastly , it is now recognized that our attention and our cognition are from the first directed toward things . It is things , and not ideas , which we perceive and know . It is things which we seek to interpret and pass judgment upon . In this regard , consciousness would seem to reflect the activities of the organism . It would seem to be empirically correct to say that we look out through ideas at objects . We mean , act toward , adjust ourselves to things as these are presented or appear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind did not do justice to this sense of direction in consciousness . It isolated presentational contents , like color and shape , from the perceptual situation and attitude . What we shall now undertake in the remainder of this chapter is a study of knowing as an empirical kind of experience . We want to get acquainted with our own minds , with their references , structures and claims . Of late years much attention has been given to this kind of preparation for a theory of knowledge . All schools of philosophy have made their contributions . Recent movements in logic and psychology have also helped . There is good reason to believe that a sufficient foundation for theory of knowledge is thus being achieved , and , sooner or later , this will lead to general agreement in philosophy . 110 1'IRIl'Il'hES AND PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY Descriptive Empiricism. ? With this preparation , let us begin our constructive exposition by a survey of consciousness . We shall note its distinctions and claims . Instead of beginning with a hasty view of what knowledge is , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of beginning with a fixed notion of mind and matter , we shall work up to a critical view of both . And our point of departure must be the field of conscious experience as light is thrown upon it by the sciences . First of all , be it noted that we shall try to study the field of the individual 's consciousness as a working complex with its structures and processes and meanings and claims . We began this task in the third chapter ; we should now be able to carry it through systematically and without bewilderment . A structure which immediately attracts our attention is the contrast between the knower and the known , a contrast bridged by what is usually spoken of as the cognitive relation . There are , quite obviously , levels of this structure . The first level is perception ; a higher level is a conceptual theory of an object . In our study of natural realism we became acquainted with the structure and meanings characteristic of perception . We were later to conclude that , while there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation was not completely understood by common sense . On the knower side of this contrast , we can discover the empirical self with its interests and its sense of bodily set and attitude . Thus a short time ago when I was trying to catch a hen whose cackling was disturbing me , I had a very definite sense of myself and of my bodily attitude toward the hen . To speak in a technical way , my self-experience was flooded by motor sensations and dominated by a purpose . Over against me was the changing complex of characters which meant hen to me , that is , a thing as real as myself which was dodging around and trying to escape my clutches . The reader 's imagination can surely work out in detail the meanREFERENCES // ings which illuminate the individual 's field of consciousness . It is the possession of these structures and meanings which makes consciousness what it is to the epistemologist . It would seem that consciousness is a kind of complex which can mould itself upon the situation in which the individual is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance means to me " hen " depends upon what the psychologist calls the acquirement of meaning through association . A whole grows up in an interpreted way . We must never forget this interpretative richness of consciousness . To neglect it is to make knowledge an insoluble riddle . On the known , or object , pole of consciousness there develops in the above described fashion the category of thinghood . The essential meanings , or elements , of this category are not difficult to discover . A thing is a continuant , something which endures much as we do and which is spatial and resistant . It moves as a unit and can be pointed at . Now there is nothing mysterious in any of these elements , nothing which can not arise in consciousness in our constant dealings with things . It would seem that in these meanings consciousness develops a valid interpretation of the organism 's surroundings . Since these traits are general , or generic , they apply to all the objects to which the organism is responding . Within this framework arise and are assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into the study of the generic development of this structure and these meanings we need not enter . That would carry us too far into detail in both psychology and logic . As epistemologists , we have a right to recognize their presence and their empirical character . We should also note that this structure and these meanings are used in perception by everyone . The result is what we have called natural realism . We are outward-looking and interested in things which we appear to apprehend . The underlying processes and developments are hidden or not known . Upon this structural foundation within consciousness more // complex meanings and distinctions are reared . Things form together the spatial-temporal-causal system of the external world which the knower seeks to comprehend under the guidance of sense-perception abetted by experimentation and reflection . Here we enter upon the scientific level of knowledge . It is interesting to note that the knower , as an organism , is considered a part of this physical system . But there is a certain ambiguity about the knower . The individual 's field of consciousness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or explicit , knowing . And it has been one of the problems of philosophy to relate it to the organism or , rather , to understand its relation to the organism . As natural realism breaks down under reflection , consciousness grows to include the whole field which we have been examining with its structures , claims and meanings . Each man 's consciousness is a centre of experience and cognition . While the physical world forms a unitary system , this other domain does not . Of it , pluralism is characteristic . In the one domain we seem to have a large measure of continuity ; in the other , discontinuity is the feature . Communication between person 's minds is by means of the organism as in speech , gesture and writing . The results of what I have called descriptive empiricism must not be confused with Berkeleian idealism . Berkeley ignored the significance of what I have called thinghood and discarded as illusions those meanings of independence and commonness on which I have laid stress . IIence he could not think of perception as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Descriptive empiricism finds that the individual 's consciousness has two dimensions which may be called the co-existential and the temporal respectively . We have already indicated a characteristic contrast in the co-extential dimension , viz. ? that between the percipient and the objects perceived . And we have noted that this // concrete contrast lends itself to the introduction of meanings . Thus the objects perceived are interpreted as substantial and independent realities in definite relations with one another , while the percipient is similarly interpreted . The adult , certainly , lives at this level of outlook . But the field of consciousness has not only a co-existential structure but also a temporal growth . Objects acquire meanings and absorb new data . We learn more about things and they change for us accordingly , although we are convinced that we now interpret them and know them better than we did before . Thus the sun is perceived as a round disk in the heavens but careful study has persuaded us that it is actually tremendously large and millions of miles away from us . We have good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the sun is this large and at this distance , we should perceive it the way we do . The temporal dimension of consciousness brings home to us the fact that adequate knowledge is something slowly acquired . It introduces us to the part played by wider experience , by comparison , by reasoning . From this point of view we realize that knowledge is not an immediate and simple affair but a resultant of effort . It is a matter of accumulation and of increased interpretative insight . The philosophical movement called pragmatism has laid decided stress upon this temporal dimension of consciousness . It has pointed out that knowing is an enterprise of a concrete sort arising as an attempt to solve a problem and that it involves instruments like perception and ideas . The value of ideas lies in the fact that they are substitutes for immediate experience . By them we can mean things not present and we can condense and select our experience . In this fashion our experience deepens and accumulates until we become masters of a wide range and are able to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also occurred for the race . As our experience enlarges , we know more about things . // In like manner , we can compare by means of history the ideas of things held in the past with those held at present . How little was known of the chemical constitution of objects even a few centuries ago ! Again , how ignorant people were of the causes of disease ! Each generation can inherit what has been learned and add to it something new . It is interesting to point out that the co-existential dimension of consciousness favors realism because it is pervaded by realistic meanings and attitudes . Until we reflect a little , it even favors natural realism for we seem to ourselves to see , or become aware of , things in a sort of immediate way . There they are ; we can refer to them denotatively , this book , that table , this person , that vase , etc . But attention given to the temporal dimension soon makes us aware that knowledge is genetically not the immediate sort of thing it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of things . We become conscious of the silent processes which condition our knowledge of the world . A mediate realism tends quickly to take the place of the immediate realism of common sense . Knowledge is now considered an affair of ideas and concepts . We know by means of , and in terms of , ideas . But knowledge is just as direct as ever in its references to objects and in its claim . A Closer Study of the Cognitive Relation. ? We have called attention to the structure within consciousness at the level of perception in which the knowing self is set over against the object perceived . Because , at this level , the content of perception is not distinguished from the object of perception , it seems as though there were a compresence of a literal sort between knower and known . This compresence has been called the cognitive relation . Recent thinkers have used such terms as awareness , consciousness of , contemplation , minding , perceiving , for this compresence of knower and object . Thus I am aware of this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able contemporary thinker who inclines to a restatement of natural // realism , speaks of enjoying the self and contemplating the object . Lloyd Morgan talks of the ing and the ed sides of experience . The subject side is minding and the object side is minded . Thus perceiving implies something perceived ; remembering something remembered , etc . In this structure and distinction we obviously have something very important for epistemology . We must ask ourselves , however , whether we have here a literal relation between the knower and the object or an interpretative reference to the object . We shall speak of the first as involving an apprehensional view of knowledge . I mean that this view implies that the object itself is literally present to the knower in much the same way as a table is present to those who are sitting at it . The opposed view maintains that cognition is a selective interpretation of an object which is not literally given in consciousness . We intend , or mean , an object , this intention being at the perceptual level bound up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " look at " this tree before me . Others can note what I am doing . Thinking of an object in its absence from the neighborhood of my organism is an act reared upon the tendencies and structure of perception ; it is simply more complicated . We can readily distinguish three possibilities at least with regard to the cognitive relation . The first is the idealistic position and holds that to be is to be known . For this view , cognition implies a relation which makes the object known dependent on the knowing . The customary formulation of this view of the cognitive relation is that it is internal and makes the object in some sense an adjective of the knowing mind . Both terms of the relation are mental for this philosophical tradition . The second position maintains that the cognitive relation is external and that the object in no sense depends upon its being known . This is the theory held by what is called the new realism , which is clearly a revival of the essentials of natural realism in opposition to idealism . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself favor and which is called critical realism , which denies the literalness of the cognitive relation and makes the distinction between the content of knowledge and the object of knowledge . The knower selects and means the object , and knows it in terms of a cognitive content , but such an act of knowing does not involve the literal presence of the object known . It will be noted that these two kinds of realism have much in common and yet that they differ profoundly in their views of cognition and the cognitive relation . We shall have more to say of this contrast when we examine in a later chapter the epistemological positions of the present . The Distinction between Things and Ideas. ? Since this chapter is devoted to the distinctions within the individual 's consciousness , it will be worth our while to devote some time to a contrast which has developed within consciousness as a result of knowledge . We know physical things and , in another fashion , we know our consciousness . It would seem that we intuit , or experience , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are open to our inspection ; while we know objects by means of , and in terms of , such features . There is a givenness about the one domain that does not hold for the other . At least , this is the conclusion to which we must come if natural realism breaks down and we do not resign ourselves to idealism . Each individual is seemingly confined to his own consciousness in an existential sense . He can not share the feelings , emotions and thoughts of another in any literal fashion . Sometimes this has been denied , especially by those whose epistemology would make such existential isolation involve the denial of knowledge of that which lies outside consciousness . Thus the new realists in America deny the existential exclusiveness of minds . For them , two people can literally share the same idea . But , in spite of their asseverations , the older tradition and the tradition of psychology on this point - seem the better founded . Thus I agree with Miss Washburn , // " That the mind of each human being forms a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This position must not be misunderstood . There is no denial that we can know and appreciate the thoughts and feelings of others but only that we can existentially possess those thoughts and feelings . Perhaps Miss Washburn 's term , inaccessible , was ill-advised . I do not think that another 's consciousness is hidden from my knowledge but only that it can not be a part of my consciousness . Let me , again , call attention to the fact that I am distin-guishing consciousness from mind . Consciousness is a part of mind but not the whole of mind . And by consciousness I mean the empirical field which one experiences at any one time , a field which has a unity and an openness to awareness . Knowledge resides in this field so far as it is actual and not merely potential , but the object of knowledge is not in this field except in introspection . It is well , once more , to note that the term , consciousness , is somewhat ambiguous , especially in the English language . To be conscious of means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive significance . It is very natural that many epistemologists ? especially those who are trying to carry through some form of natural realism ? should identify consciousness with these acts of awareness . My own thinking has compelled me to consider these acts of awareness very complex and inclusive of perceptual and conceptual content . In short , it seems to me preferable to keep the term consciousness for the whole field with its structure and contents and to recognize that " to be conscious of " is a function within that field . Once the distinction is made and under-stood , there should be little difficulty about it . We are now prepared to appreciate the existential contrast // bet wren the realm of consciousness and the realm of physical things . It has become a commonplace that the elements of consciousness do not have the same properties and characteristics as physical things . Thus physical things have size and weight and offer resistance . These same statements can not be made of the contents which we can discriminate . Weight as a meaning does not itself have weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply interpretatively to objects . It is to objects that they are directed from the first . And it is absurd to direct these meanings upon themselves and to say that a meaning , or content , has size , locus , causal efficacy , etc . This distinction will have considerable significance for our own theory of knowledge , for it will lead us to assert that science is right in believing in a stuff which , through organization , constitutes the physical world . In consciousness , itself , we assert traits of physical things which we do not assert of consciousness . It would seem to follow that we apprehend , or understand , ideas in consciousness by means of which we know things outside of consciousness . Ideas must be distinguished from things . The distinction between thing and idea has been very definitely developed by psychology . Consciousness comes to be a term which covers all contents which are experienced or which are capable of being experienced such as feelings , sense-data , meanings , concepts , etc . And opposed to this varied class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The psychologist does not bother his head very much over the problem of how the physical scientist can know his realm . He is , himself , a specialist and simply follows the logic of his own field . But it is obvious that the epistemologist has this task assigned to him . Existence versus Cognition. ? We are now in a position to call attention to a contrast whose full significance has often been neglected . We have maintained that for psychology // consciousness is a realm of existents of a peculiar sort which it is its duty to study . For the physical sciences , physical things also constitute another kind of realm of existents . As to the relation between these two realms we shall say nothing at present , only declaring that we shall give good reasons for rejecting Cartesian dualism . We shall , in fact , find many excellent reasons for holding that the organism includes these contents which are really qualitative events in it . Now the sciences have laid so much stress upon existence that they have ignored cognition . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted and concentrates on its objects . But psychology , unfortunately , followed this example . It had to , in one sense , for that was a part of its duty . But it should have seen that cognition was a peculiar function of consciousness ; that it had to deal with something which was unique and had a special task to perform . Cognition is built up around reference to an object . This reference to an object rests upon a structure in consciousness and upon activities of the organism accompanying and finding expression in this structure . In the present chapter we called attention to this structure in the contrast between percipient and object perceived , subject and object , knower and known . We sought to point out the growth of this structure and the meanings which qualify both poles . Thus I look at this apple tree and estimate what limbs must be lopped off in order to let the sun into it . The capacity to develop meanings and to apply these meanings is the gift of consciousness upon which cognition depends . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object ; and it is within consciousness that we interpret such an independent object by means of , and in terms of , discriminated characters . We shall see that one of the weaknesses of much of epistemology has been its timidity in regard to consciousness . It has not studied its structures and meanings empirically and carefully enough . Berkeley 's attack upon Locke impressed 12 0 PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY it too much . IIume , for example , studies consciousness almost entirely from the existential standpoint as consisting of impressions and images . But I do not hesitate to assert that the important fact for the philosopher is that the organism uses and develops these impressions and images for the sake of cognition . The suggestion which we shall put forward is that , in consciousness , we can mean and know objects which transcend consciousness . To those who stress only the existential aspect of consciousness and think of it as only so many sensations and images , this view is nonsense . To them we must reply that they have completely ignored consciousness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that psychology is beginning to see that isolated sensations and images of the IIumian type are artificial entities . The field of consciousness at any one time is a complex structure expressive of the functioning of the organism . In the next chapter we shall try to explain the nature of knowledge on the basis of the empirical analyses we have made in this one . We shall seek to show that cognition involves its own peculiar kind of transcendence of consciousness , a transcendence which is in no sense existential . To know objects which are outside our consciousness existentially , we do not need to get outside our consciousness in any but a cognitive way . That is , we make a reference and a knowledge-claim . Thus to think truly of Paris I do not need to travel in some mysterious mental fashion to Paris . It is enough that Paris is the object of my thought and reference . It is very necessary to bear the above points in mind and to appreciate how these distinctions appear in some fashion even at the level of practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like books and trees . There is a structure here which we must acknowledge and try to analyze . To call it animal faith , as Santayana does , is very poetic but misleading . There does not seem to me to be any mysterious leap to a transcendent object but a contrast and // a development of that contrast by meanings . Nor is there a mysterious inference from the content of perception to the object of perception . In fact , the distinction between the content of perception and the object of perception is a later development due to the application of reflection to the stand-point of naive realism . As soon as we have perception we have the interpretation of objects . CHAPTER X THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE Perception an Affair of the Organism. ? We have good reason to believe that we now have our material fairly well in hand . Let us attempt to get as clear an idea as possible of the nature of knowledge . In order to free ourselves completely from the misleading associations of Cartesian dualism , it may be well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can pass to the kind of knowledge we have in judgment . Perception is an affair of the organism . The organism cooperates with the influences coming from surrounding things so that stimulus meets with a directed response . The percipient organism attends to , turns toward , selects , behaves in relation to , things , and thus makes them its objects . Hence , we should not speak of things as though they were objects in their own right . They are existents in their own right , but they are objects of the organism 's behavior and conscious attention . " Object " is thus a relative term and implies an activity focussed upon a thing . It is for this reason that we can speak of a thing as an object of perception or of thought . The following diagram indicates the double relation between a thing and a percipient organism : Figure The lower , continuous line represents the causal relation from the thing to the organism , while the upper , discontinuous line represents the cognitive , perceptual relation . The directions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the other is to the thing . The cognitive perceptual relation is one of behavior and conscious attention directed to the thing . 122 // We have sought to examine this situation both externally and within consciousness and to see how a proper view blends these two in an intelligible manner . Is it not true that this position rises above the historical controversy between naive realism and subjective idealism ? As against subjective idealism , it stresses the active reference to an object which is believed to be external , independent and lasting , and it holds that this object is interpreted in consciousness rather than given in consciousness . As against naive realism , it maintains that the apparent givenness of the object of perception in consciousness is an illusion due to the structure of consciousness in perception and the lack of reflection upon the conditions of perception . In other words , the content of perception is identified with the object of perception because they are , as yet , not distinguished . In consciousness , cognitive reference and interpretation dominates over the existential situation . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . Only reflection brings the whole situation clearly into view . It is interesting to note that recent psychology is increasingly inclined to regard consciousness with its structure and references as an expression of organic activities in actual situations . Perceiving and thinking are activities . What is active ? Evidently the organism , the conscious person . We must , therefore , think of the field of consciousness as sustained by the brain-mind of the organism in its response to external things . To the empirical self within consciousness it would be as though it saw things or as though things appeared to it . The Synthetic vs . Both the External and the Introspective View of Perception .  --  A good beginning in these matters is so important that we shall run the danger of some repetition . It is very essential , as we said , to free ourselves from the tradition that perception is merely the apprehension of a mental state . The separation emphasized by Descartes between mind and matter led to this notion that the mind was in // perception brooding on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects of the understanding when a man thinks . Berkeley continued the same tradition and dropped what seemed to him the useless realm of matter . Hume wrote of impressions and Kant of phenomena . In every case , the total situation was ignored or misunderstood . Philosophy started off on a non-realistic tangent , and it is only recently that it has been able to make a fresh start . If our own analysis is correct , these contents , or ideas , are elements in perception rather than objects of perception . They constitute the way in which the object is characterized in perception instead of being the object of perception . Or , to put it in another way , they are the appearance of the object of perception . We must get rid of the purely introspective tradition that the idea is the object of perception . If , as in introspection , we break loose from the natural interests and direction of behavior of the organism in perception and swing our attention to the characters like color and shape , which we can note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they are not objects of perception . When we consider these characters for their own sake and do not perceive through them , we are not perceiving in the strict sense . We are neglecting meanings , beliefs and interests which constitute the affirmation of a physical object . It is difficult to get a good terminology which is at once expressive and simple . With the above suggestions in mind , the distinction we have used between the object of perception and the process of perception with its use of discriminated characters of perception is satisfactory . It is the object which we mean and select and which we characterize in terms of the content of perception . The synthetic view enables us to harmonize both the behavioristic observation that an organism responds to an object and the internal experience of meaning , noting and interpreting an object . // Perception Is Usually Practical. ? The content of perception or the appearance of the object serves usually as a guide to conduct . It is not surprising that this complex absorbs all the meanings which arise as relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . An apple is something to eat . All the information which we acquire joins itself to the sensory nucleus and interprets the object we seem to ourselves to be apprehending and which we are certainly in some sense knowing . As both psychologist and logician point out , judgment enters into perception . We think the object by all that we come to know about it , what it does to ourselves and to other things , its spatial relations , structure , etc . Thus thinking supplements perception . It is only as science replaces our usually practical attitude and interpretation of things that an effort is made to get data which will enable us to penetrate more deeply into the nature of the object . Analysis , comparison , experimentation and theory are operations used under the control of the desire to know ; and everyone is aware how much additional knowledge is thus gained . What , Then , Is Knowledge ? ? We must now press on to a determination of what knowledge is when it is made explicit as regards both its conditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sensory data are corrected and interpreted in relation to an object . But we must pass to explicit , judgmental knowledge as we find it in science before the actual situation is understood . Let me offer a verbal description of knowledge . Knowledge of the physical world is an interpretative comprehension of the characteristics of things by means of , and in terms of , characters within consciousness . Here we have the factors in knowledge distinguished and the peculiar claim involved in knowing made explicit . When I claim to know a thing , I make an assertion , backed up by belief , that an idea of mine reveals the actual characteristics and relations of the thing . 1 ' G PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY I assume therein that the real world has a structure which I ran think or intellectually grasp . Whence do we get this idea ? Clearly from perception . The external world seems to us there to be revealed or to appear , and we gain the notion that it has a nature and structure of an intrinsic sort which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done is to confirm us in this view by the detail which has been worked out and tested . There is nothing in science which , when properly understood , condemns perception . We should see the sun round , and things should look small to us at a distance , and a stick should look bent in water . Why ? Because perception involves a personal , biocentric perspective . It is this perspective which science seeks to overcome by measurement and axes of reference . Descartes did not appreciate this relation between perception and thought as it has been worked out by modern logic and psychology . The thesis is , then , that the very nature and claim of knowledge is derived from what seems to be the situation in perception . We interpret things and assign meanings to them at that stage . We but carry this further in thought . To put the situation very succinctly , it is by knowing that we learn that we know and what knowledge is . It is by reflection on the conditions of knowledge that we san learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . This is but another way of saying that epistemology works upon the fact of knowledge . I wish now to point out that there is a development of our idea of knowing . At the level of natural realism , while there has still been little , if any , reflection upon knowledge , knowing appears to be an apprehension of an object . The object seems to be given in a literal way . This fact is very important , for both subjective idealism and the new realism build upon it after their own fashion . But we have argued that the breakdown of natural realism forces us to rise to a more mediate view of knowledge . Knowledge is then seen to be a grasping // of the nature of the object by means of and in terms of a content . The claim remains , however , the same . There are , of course , many cases of knowledge besides perception , and , in these other cases , this instrumentality of contents comes out quite obviously , so obviously , in fact , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in knowledge of the past , say of the deeds of Lincoln , we are at once inclined to reject the notion that these deeds are themselves given to us in an existential way . We feel that they are given cognitively and by means of ideas which we have secured by reading history . In the same fashion , knowledge of distant objects which can not be perceived is thought of as being mediated by our ideas . We were once there , or people have told us about them . Again , the knowledge of the chemical and physical structure of things , as worked out by science , far surpasses the reach of perception alone . Yet it is knowledge . The essential thing about knowledge comes to be the revelation of the object . Whether this is due to the literal entrance of the object into our consciousness , as seemed at first the case , or whether it is a revelation in terms of a content is a secondary matter which the facts must decide . In neither case can knowledge be more or less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same in the one case as in the other . The structure of perceptual knowing is developed and carried over into what is often called representative knowing , that is , the knowing of objects in their absence . In this connection , I might call attention to a mistake which many philosophers have made . It is the idea that representative knowing , or thinking , is just an effort to reinstate the original experience . It may be this , as in memory , but it is often an attempt to penetrate by more data and reflection very deeply into the nature of the object . It is really nonsense to assert that scientific knowledge is merely a summary of perception . The tradition of Hume has encouraged this former notion // among scientists as , for instance , with such a writer as Karl Pearson . Empiricism was seldom entirely free from this error , which is characteristic of phenomenalism . Whether presentative or representative in mode , knowledge is direct in its aim . The Mechanism of Knowing. ? We can readily distinguish three factors in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object , ( 2 ) the assigned idea , and ( 3 ) the belief . In the background of all this is the self as knower . These three factors play different roles in the one complex experience . As we have suggested , the best way to appreciate them is to begin with the level of perception and work upward . We have laid so much stress upon the structure and meanings of consciousness in perception and its harmony with the situation and behavior of the percipient organism that we need say nothing more about it now . As conception replaces perception , we build up a construction of an external world the parts of which can be measured and located with reference to each other and not merely with reference to a particular percipient . Such a system of reference is used in social intercourse . Thus I speak to another person of a house located on a certain street in a certain city . The technique of such systems of reference is familiar to all these days . And we know how it has been developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted in terms of certain predicates which are now consciously assigned to it . In this way I think the object . We may say that knowing an object at this level is thinking it in terms of predicates . These predicates are supposed to give the actual characteristics and relations of the object . The impulse , which we noted at the level of perception , to assign characters to objects continues even though the assignment is made more critically . In an act of knowing , then , these three factors , selection of an object , assigned characters , and belief , work organically together . Just as we perceive an object in terms of its appearTHE // ance , so we conceive it in terms of its corrected appearance , which may be called the predicates of judgment . There is no doubt , then , that I am capable of distinguishing an external realm from my thoughts and beliefs . It is the constant aim of the scientist to apply the proper predicates to the object of his thought ? What are the proper predicates ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behavior . We are convinced that , when we think objects in certain ways , we think them as they are . We are trying to do in a sophisticated way what perception has suggested to us . The Ambiguity of the Term Idea. ? But we are not through with our difficulties . Philosophy found that it must make a distinction between two standpoints , and it became confused . Probably the Cartesian dualism with its assumptions to which we have already frequently referred aided in this confusion . The difficulty concerns the distinction between the use of the term idea as a discriminated character , predicate , or universal which we use in the interpretation of objects , and idea as a psychological existent or event . In critical knowing we are quite aware that our minds are working and that these characters arise as elements in the total complex of consciousness but we are not concerned at the time with the question of their existential status . They are ingredients in the total act of interpreting the object . We think the object in terms of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this total act of interpreting an object and to study it as an event in the history of the organism . In so doing , psychology will take logical ideas and make them parts of psychological ideas or conscious events . But , clearly , this is a task which can not modify the nature of the act of knowledge and its claim . It is a supplementary , scientific problem . But the whole setting of epistemology in the seventeenth century forced this problem into the foreground . Logical ideas , that is , discriminated predicates , were flatly taken to be simple mental entities , that is , immaterial realities . Also , // it was supposed that these mental entities were the first objects of knowledge . It was a bad epistemology plus a very hasty ontology . We have , on the contrary , emphasized the actual situation in the complex act of knowing and have brought out the fact that these characters , universals or predicates are instruments of knowledge and not objects of primary knowing . In short , the characters which we discriminate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they appear . The existential question is additional . But we are not to-day inclined to begin with the assumption of an immaterial substance . The organism seems , instead , to be the unit . At present , I can only assume that all characters used in cognition have a natural origin and locus in the brain-mind of the knower . Many of these predicates involve a large amount of construction and discrimination . They arise only at a high level of what we call mental activity . It is to logic that we usually go for a study of the reflective level of thinking and knowing . The logician sees that the direction of cognition is objective and that the knower seeks to be under the control of things so that his thinking may not be arbitrary but moulded and conditioned by things as they are . It would seem to be the business of philosophy and psychology , working together , to determine the existential status of ideas . That we know by means of their internally apprehended content seems undeniable . And that cognition does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between idea and object but , rather , an identity of character which comes out in our claim to think objects in terms of this apprehended content of ideas follows from this . In short , the existential nature of consciousness becomes an additional problem which can never justify a denial of knowledge . It is really not at all surprising that a philosophy which began with a dualism of two kinds of substances and thought of mental entities as the first natural objects of thought mixed existential and cognitional problems . We , on the contrary , // realize that we think objects in terms of specific contents and that such thinking does not imply an affirmation of existential likeness . This assertion is directed against Berkeley 's belief that , because an idea as psychical event can be existentially like nothing but an idea , we can not know objects in terms of the characters of which we are aware . How important our stand against Berkeley 's position is will be realized when we remember that the cognitive value of ideas was relinquished as a result of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would seem to follow from all this that consciousness is a peculiar kind of reality whose very function it is to mould itself upon the world and to develop distinctions and references of a cognitive kind . The spiritual substance notion of the seventeenth century obscured this intrinsic nature of consciousness because it ignored the peculiar and basic relation consciousness has to the organism . A more bio-centric approach was needed . We shall see that a contemporary movement , called pragmatism , has aided here . Unfortunately pragmatism was weak in epistemology and was not able to make the final epistemological synthesis . It moved toward it , but was so engrossed in its controversy with objective idealism that it did not re-examine the possibilities of realism . In these matters ? as in all others seemingly ? the inevitable development is one step at a time . The Reach and Precise Character of Knowledge. ? Certain fascinating questions remain which quickly lead us to the borders of ontology . What is the reach of knowledge ? And how should we distinguish knowledge from existence ? We have argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of contents or characters which may be called logical ideas . We assign predicates to things ; we conceive them in certain ways ; we make propositions about them . All these expressions stand for essentially the same kind of act whose first stage we noted in perception . The significant fact is that we hold before our attention an understood eon // tent which we regard as revealing the characteristics and relations of the object . And the object is presented , or grasped , in no other way than this . To put the situation concisely , the object is not existentially given in consciousness but is known . When , in what follows , I assert that we do not apprehend the object in the act of knowledge , it is this contrast which I have in mind . It is not cognitive apprehension that I deny but existential apprehension . But I must not harp on this point . The reader should brood over it and seek to comprehend its exact meaning . This critical view makes explicit the precise situation in which the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use bemoaning the fact any more than it is worth while rebelling against any other ultimate fact which is beyond our control and a part of the ultimate structure of the world . But , in truth , it seems to me admirable and remarkable that the organism has been able to evolve this mechanism of knowing and has been successful in achieving and using data of significance for things around it . And , of course , the basis of this achievement must be the functional relation between the organism and the environment and the evolved abilities and mechanism of the organism . It follows from our analysis that the object of knowledge is one thing and the knowledge of it another . Suppose that I gather all the knowledge about this table before me that I can glean from physics , chemistry and botany ; still this systematic knowledge is not the table . Because it is knowledge , it is a revelation of the characteristics of the object but it is not existentially the object . It has taken the human mind a very long time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to carry it through systematically . When it was only half carried through , as in early representative realism , confusion resulted which threw the mind back into phenomenalism and idealism . It was then maintained that knowledge does not involve a peculiar kind of transcendence. // What is it about the object which is revealed in the logical contents which arise in our consciousness and are used in cognition ? The only way to get an answer to this question is to interrogate the actual knowledge-claims made by science . Roughly speaking , we seem to know the structure , the relative quantity , the relations and the behavior of things . We shall go into this question in more detail in our treatment of cosmology . We shall there call the basic distinctions of knowledge the categories and regard them as corresponding to , or revealing , the structure or form of physical existence . We are now prepared to broach a second question which , as we said , takes us to the borders of ontology . Have we empirical reasons to maintain that this cognitive revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is affirmative . Let me explain . If knowledge is a grasping of the temporal order of events , the relative sizes of things , their causal and spatial relations , their internal structure and their behavior , it is seemingly only these characteristics of the physical world which can be reproduced and mentally grasped . We might say that these characteristics constitute the form of the physical world and the form , alone , can be reproduced and thus revealed . Here , again , we are skirting the edge of ontology . But is the world merely form ? Is it not formed stuff ? The empiricist tradition has led many thinkers to look askance at this idea of stuff in spite of all that science says about matter and energy . What can we say to justify it and interpret it ? First of all , we know things by means of contents which reflection informs us arise in consciousness . Thus when I assert that dynamite explodes and blows rock to pieces , it is the rock as an external reality which I am thinking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the meanings for their own sake and make them objects of thought . It is clear that they are not themselves physical objects and make no claim to be . Thus it is nonsense to say // that a meaning explodes . Empiricists have never done justice to this distinction which falls in line with the objective reference of knowledge of physical things . To assert that a body is active involves the meaning , activity , as an interpretative predicate ; but this does not imply that the meaning must be active . So to hold ignores the distinction between the content of knowledge and the object of knowledge . It is this recognized difference between characters and the physical object which lies at the foundation of the belief in substantial existence . Stuff is but another term for existence . The physical world is a conserved realm in which all sorts of executive changes arise and which is differentiated into an infinite variety of things . Now we have sought to demonstrate that to know is not to be , that cognitive apprehension is not existential apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall short of being the things . Things are formed stuff , and it is the form which we cognitively apprehend or which is revealed . Nevertheless , we must recognize that knowledge is not an existential givenness , or intuition , of the object . It is a cognitive apprehension , if you will , but not a literal apprehension of the sort natural realism gives the human mind at first the illusion of . Knowledge of Other Persons. ? The problem of the nature of knowledge of external things is so basic that we have devoted our chief attention to it , believing that many associated problems would be less difficult to handle once we saw our way clear in regard to this primary one . Now that we have the essential distinctions in hand , let us examine the question of the nature of our knowledge of other persons . It is far better to speak of other persons than of other minds , for the simple reason that we know nothing of disembodied minds , and " persons " is a far more realistic and localizable term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intangible influence of Cartesian , or traditional , dualism . The exact nature of mind is an ontological problem which // must be taken up in its own place . We may mention the fact that the drift in psychology is to regard mind as a term for operations and capacities intimately bound up with the nervous system of organisms and directly expressed in consciousness . When we come to the treatment of the mind-body problem , one of the points we shall need to make is the vagueness and inaccuracy of the general use of the term mind . A warning in this place will , I hope , be of some avail . Before the student can make any advance he must be ready to brush aside the cobwebs which have accumulated through the ages and look at the facts in the light of science and epistemology . When we say that persons have minds , we should not mean that they carry around with them a peculiar kind of thing called a mind . We mean , rather , that persons have thoughts and act intelligently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consciousness and intelligent action rest upon a foundation intrinsic to the person . And a person is a developed , trained , human organism . How do we know other persons ? . In part , just as we know other physical things , by observation . Hence our rejection of idealism has relevance for this special domain . We can study the behavior of persons just as we study the behavior of sticks , stones and animals . In all these cases , there is objective reference and the need to distinguish between content and object . But there is another way to gain knowledge of persons ; and that is by communication , by language , that is , by understood signs . It is absurd either to deny or to belittle the importance and significance , of this condition of additional knowledge . It interacts with the more primitive condition , that of observation , in determining our complex knowledge of other persons . We can learn what people think by their own confession . We can ignore the cases of lying as not bearing on epistemology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our thought . This correlation we early learn to note . As a // matter of fact , intentions and actions are noted together in other persons probably sooner than in ourselves . This genetic question is interesting but need not be taken up now . The main point is that we interpret other people all the time in a sort of complex way . You can notice a baby looking at its mother or nurse in this interpretative fashion . In short , we know persons , not minds and bodies as separate entities . But while communication is a condition of additional knowledge of the plans and attitudes of other persons , it is of special interest to us here because it suggests to us that we have a right to believe that other people have experiences similar to our own when they use the same words . When a youth asks a girl whether she loves him after confessing his own love , and she replies affirmatively , he believes that the tender passion is holding her in thrall as it is him , that similar emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new kind of knowledge which we must add to knowledge of things . We may call it knowledge of experiences . It is only in the case of things having consciousness , and those nearly like our own ? all this being a matter of knowledge-claim or belief ? that we make this new claim . It is not a knowledge of things in terms of a few abstract characters , but a knowledge of contents in terms of contents or a believed similarity of experiences in two consciousnesses . Persons are richer objects for human knowledge than are inorganic things . This distinction connects up with the one we have already made between things and consciousness . We find that we are common knowers knowing the same world in the same way by the same means . But here , also , there is objective reference . In this knowledge , likewise , we transcend our own mind cognitively , though not existentially . All this means , let us remember , is that we know objects by means of contents and a structural mechanism in ourselves . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have these contents and this mechanism can not know what is outside them . And this structure and this // mechanism is intimately bound up with sense-organs and motor responses , in short , with the structure of the organism . It is probable , for example , that something analogous to per-ceptual knowledge exists in other animals in descending degrees . There are many fascinating questions along these lines of enquiry but we can not linger upon them . Our purpose has been to indicate the general nature of knowledge and its kinds . Our conclusion has been that , without consciousness , knowledge would be impossible , but that we know objects outside our own consciousness . CHAPTER XI PRESENT EPISTEMOLOGICAL TENDENCIES The Value of a Summary. ? In the preceding chapters we have been engaged in the effort to gain perspective in epistemology . By means of history and by aid of an analysis of the structure and references characteristic of consciousness , we gradually attained a definite view of the nature and conditions of knowledge . This view is the one commonly called critical realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginner with the other positions currently held . Two reasons for this policy can be advanced : ( 1 ) without such a statement of contemporary positions the student can not appreciate the references contained in other books and in the remarks of people educated in philosophy , and ( 2 ) he can not make an intelligent choice between positions until he has an idea of all of them . Moreover , a summary should bring the whole subject together and make it more definite . Let us not forget that the learning of philosophy is a matter of growth . Epistemological positions have little meaning for a person until he has felt the force of epistemological problems . What meaning can idealism have to one who has no knowledge of its rise ? To an American impressed by modern . industry , it would seem , surely , the veriest nonsense to assert that the physical world is but an idea . Does he not see the firm and stable world around him , and does he not know from sad experience how brutally real it is ? Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their natural outlook . However that may be ? and probably mood and training have much to do with first plausibilities ? the student who has carefully followed the steps of our argument and 138 // has done some thinking for himself will , I am sure , be now ready to compare epistemological positions understandingly . The Nature of Epistemology Restated. ? Epistemology has been such a perplexing subject that even philosophers have at times been discouraged . Some few have even gone to the extreme of crying out against epistemology . We feel it necessary , therefore , to give some space to a brief statement of its exact nature . This science has nothing to do with the determination of the facts or results of the particular special sciences . It is , instead , a reflective science which takes for its domain a study of the nature and conditions of actual , human knowledge . It moves within an already complex experience and seeks to answer specific questions about knowledge in the light of the actual knowledge already gained by the physical , mental and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them but is , like philosophy as a whole , a reflective examination of their general results in the attempt to answer inevitable questions about the nature , locus , development , conditions and reach of knowledge . And the more we know about nature and man , the more we are able to answer these questions . I do think that the recent advances in biology and psychology have aided the epistemologist very much . A corresponding improvement in logic which has brought it more in line with modern science has also been of great assistance . Knowing is clearly a natural event which somehow takes place in the human organism . And the various sciences take the fact and possibility of knowing for granted and go on with their particular investigations . And they are quite right in so doing . Nevertheless , when the final interpretation of it all is to be made , decision as to the nature of knowledge is imperative . When we come to ontology and cosmology , we shall constantly see the light which epistemology throws upon ultimate questions . One who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ontology , for example . // We have stressed the question of the nature and reach of knowledge . Other thinkers have at various times stressed the conditions and development of knowledge . In the follow-ing presentation of contemporary theories we shall be obliged to give some indications of the general texture of the phi-losophy with whose epistemology we are concerned for this very reason . And it must be remembered that epistemology , though a pivotal part of philosophy , is only a small part of the whole . A Working Division. ? Just because there has been no settled opinion in epistemology and historical tendencies have been influential , it is really difficult to contrast positions in a clear-cut way . Fortunately , we have an unambiguous outlook to guide us . Taking our departure from this and noting deviations and denials , we can secure the following broad division : From the strictly logical standpoint , idealism and realism are in the sharpest opposition ; hence I have placed them at the extremes . Experientialism represents a blurring of this opposition and a hesitation with respect to epistemology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it may there meet with , and adjust itself to , a realistic tendency . Thus phenomenalism is in certain regards an agnostic realism ; in others , a form of idealism . Something very similar holds of pragmatism , which has constantly swung between idealism and realism . In what I have called experientialism the epistemology is seldom clear-cut . The emphasis in pragmatism , for instance , has been upon the // office of ideas in human thinking and its dearest enemy has been objective idealism . Let us begin with idealism . Two Kinds of Idealism. ? We have had occasion to refer to idealism in two connections : first , while discussing Berkeley and , second , while indicating the speculative systems reared by the successors of Kant . It is really quite difficult to find a common denominator for the two . The chief one is opposition to a frank physical realism . In all idealism the object of knowledge is regarded as dependent on the knowing of it . The claim to know an object which transcends experience is considered inadmissible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more admitted followers than subjective idealism . Since we already have the historical background of subjective idealism or mentalism , we can now aim to bring out the logical structure and implications of the position . We have noted the fact that it is directed against physical realism of the kind defended in the first stage of representative realism . Since Berkeley was glad to destroy physical realism because he thought it led to atheism , he did not seek to improve upon Lockian realism . If we take the basic principle of subjective idealism to be this , to be is to be perceived , we find that it asserts an internal relation between subject and object . In ordinary language , this means that we can know only the states of our own mind . We can put the position even more sharply by saying that it involves the denial that an individual can refer to , or know , anything outside of his own mind . But , then , how can I know that there are other persons even l It would seem that the social world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solipsism , that is , the position that an individual can know only his own ideas and that he has no good logical reason to believe in other individuals . He is confined , as we say , to his own consciousness . The difficulty which confronts the subjective idealist is of interest to us because it brings out the importance of the // organism . Deny a physical world , and you deny the organism . Now our means of communication , to say the least , seems to rest upon the organism and the senses . By destroying the organism , Berkeley left the self a homeless ghost , a mere spiritual substance . And since the physical world and senseorgans do not exist Berkeley was forced to postulate a supreme self to arouse ideas in us . Leibniz , a contemporary idealist , had the self produce all its own ideas in a sort of pre-established harmony with other selves . If we relinquish physical realism , we seem forced to such daring hypotheses as these . But it would be foolish to take subjective idealism lightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall see that the new realism was a protest against subjective idealism . The question it asked was , Are these ideas really subjective and bound up with a knower ? It tried to re-analyze experience in such a way as to leave out the traditional , mental interpretation . Objective Idealism. ? Objective idealism is a form of idealism which , as we saw , arose after Kant . The assumptions which determine it are not difficult to formulate . Kant accepted the position that we know only phenomena , that is , constructs which our thought in large measure constitutes . But he still retained a belief in things-in-themselves as sources of a sense-manifold . To hold such a position is self-contradictory because it involves the application of categories outside of experience or , as it is expressed technically , it involves the transcendence of experience . Causality is an a priori concept whose critical significance is its use in experience . And we must remember that Kant makes the Ego the source of the categories . The Ego is creative , basic . What more natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Ego of which Kant spoke tended to be universal . It is certainly not the organism . And it tended to have the same universality as the laws of science have in which he was interested . The chief problem was now the relation between the finite and the infinite self . // We may say that objective idealism was a position dominated 1 ) y the thought of a universal or absolute mind . In my opinion , then , objective idealism was founded on two things : Kant 's assumption of a universal consciousness , and the inability to solve the problem of knowledge in a truly realistic way , common to Hume and Kant . The basic thesis of objective idealism is , then , that thought is reality . To study thought is to study the very structure and stuff of reality . But thought seems to exist at different levels of adequacy . At the lower levels we deal with appearance rather than with reality at its best and truest . The task of the philosopher is to pass by a sort of inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less real and true to the more real and true , and so to attain at least a partial comprehension of what reality is like from the standpoint of the whole . Hegel was , perhaps , the most influential thinker of this movement . For him the basic philosophical discipline is logic ; and logic consists of the intensive study of the dialectical development of the categories from the simplest and emptiest to the richest and most inclusive . This internal relation of the categories is logical and timeless . In fact , time is essentially appearance and without deep significance . The Hegelian movement spread to England and America , as well as elsewhere , and attracted some of the ablest minds . Usually , however , the form which it took represented a modification by other traditions and emphases . To-day , we usually associate Anglo-Hegelian idealism with the names of Caird , Green , Bradley , Bosanquet and Royce . A similar movement in Italy is led by Croce and Gentile . From the standpoint of epistemology , the principles of objective idealism to note are ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to transcend experience , ( 2 ) the treatment of the problem of perception as essentially a question of the interpretative supplementation of a partial datum by perceptual judgment until it fits in with a system of knowl144 1 ' 1i , I NCH'LES AND PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY edge , and ( 3 ) the doctrine of internal , or modifying relations , which brings it about that the part is transformed in the whole . Truth and reality are identical , and anything short of the whole truth is partially error and illusion . In short , experience is the ultimate term ; and the really real is the absolute , or comprehensive , experience . It is clear that the emphasis in such an outlook is upon the whole , upon the infinite and complete . Our finite experience is shot through with contradictions . Change is appearance , moral distinctions are significant for our human level of existence only , time is unreal . The real is the harmonious , the perfect , the all-inclusive . It was against this interpretation of the inner logic of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a return to the older tradition of empiricism , but a return with a difference due to the intervening development of the biological , psychological and social sciences . Experientialism. ? There are many philosophical movements afoot to-day and for many years back which it is practically impossible to classify in terms of the contract between idealism and realism . Some of these positions are more sympathetic with idealistic traditions , others with realistic traditions ; and even in the same movement we find one wing nearer to idealism and another wing nearer to realism . What they do have in common is the belief that it is impossible , if not meaningless , to try to transcend experience . The influence of Hume and Kant is still at work in a very effective manner . Under experientialism can be brought such movements as positivism , phenomenalism , neo-Kantianism , and pragmatism . None of these movements are sympathetic with speculative idealism . Positivism is a form of empiricism in which there is a confident acceptance of the methods and results of science . Here , alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In contrast to science are set the earlier stages of theological and metaphysical speculation , which sought to explain events // in terms of spirits and essences . Thus positivism is an outlook dominated by the movement of the special sciences and averse to speculation . It is skeptical of the significance of the search for anything which can be called transsubjective or metempirical . It does not want to raise the question of whether anything lies beyond experience ; and it uses experience as a sort of blanket-term for that within which scientific method can work to give tested knowledge . It is clear that we have in positivism an outlook which reflects ( 1 ) the prestige of science , and ( 2 ) a skepticism of the aims and achievements of traditional philosophy . While philosophy is partially to blame for the rise of such an outlook there can , I think , be little doubt that positivism represents a hasty conclusion rather than a systematic position . Positivism may best be associated with the name of Comte . A good English representative of the outlook is G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from positivism . In fact , positivism is virtually a form of phenomenalism . In both , there is the desire to keep within experience . It is usual to speak of Hume 's position as phenomenalism ; and Kant 's emphasis is of the same sort . We can not transcend experience for only in relation to it does knowledge have any significance . This point of view should be very familiar to us now . And we should not be surprised to find phenomenalism swinging between the extremes of sensationalism and logical construction of a very abstract sort . A good example of modern sensationalism is the position of Karl Pearson in his Grammar of Science . He asserts that objects are combinations of immediate sense-impressions and past , stored impressions . And the laws of nature are resumes in mental shorthand of the sequences of our sense-impressions . Pearson 's work is full of self-contradictions on the epistemological side . The logical and experimental side of science was more fully considered by Ilenri Poincare . His knowledge of science was first-hand for he was one of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially Kantian . Crude // facts must be worked up before they become scientific facts . And what we finally discover are persistent relations or laws between phenomena . Phenomenalism is attractive to thinkers because it invites a logical analysis of the data and conclusions of science and contains no appeal to anything more substantial than the elements given . Hence we find that an ingenious logician like Bertrand Russell is fascinated by its apparent logical economy and devotes his talents to a construction of reality in terms of sense-data , actual and possible . Objects are classes of perspectives of this sort . The ideal which Russell at times seems to hold in mind is a logically ordered solipsism . Neo-Kantianism is a reaction against speculative or abso-lute idealism . It stresses the critical , or logical , aspect of Kant 's thought . Because it agrees with the anti-realistic tra-dition which we have spent so much time in tracing it is fre-quently called critical idealism . The texture of critical ideal-ism and its close connection with Kant 's thesis of **25;221;TOOLONG appear in the following quotation from Cas-sirer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not as an absolute substance beyond all knowledge , but as the object shaped in progressing experience , we find that there is no epistemological gap ' to be laboriously spanned by some authoritative decree of thought , by a transsubjective com-mand . ' For this object may be called transcendent ' from the standpoint of a psychological individual ; from the stand-point of logic and its supreme principles , nevertheless , it is to be characterized as purely immanent . It remains strictly within the sphere , which these principles determine and limit , especially the universal principles of mathematical and scien-tific knowledge . This simple thought alone constitutes the kernel of critical idealism . " There can be no doubt that neo-Kantianism has done excel-lent work in the study of the logic of the sciences . But is there any necessity for this opposition between tested knowlPRESENT // edge and the psychological individual ? Is it not the individuals who do the thinking in a cooperative way by understanding one another and reaching tested conclusions ? German thinkers have found it very difficult to keep logic in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they call psychologism . We have tried to show how epistemology supplements ordinary scientific psychology by raising the question of the nature and reach of knowledge . Pragmatism. ? Pragmatism is the name of a movement in contemporary philosophy which seems to link truth with what is useful and verifiable in human experience . Because it is a tendency hard to define , its opponents often do it injustice while its advocates do it more than justice . Like all new movements , it has a negative , or critical , side and a positive side . In the space at our disposal , all we can try to do is to show its general drift , chief doctrines and obvious assumptions . First , a word about its history . In 1878 , Mr. Charles S. Peirce wrote an article for the Popular Science Monthly in which he proposed a test for ideas : " Consider what effects , which might conceivably have practical bearings , we conceive the object of our conception to have . Then our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly twenty years when it was at last referred to by William James and woven into his criticism of what he considered to be a disregard of concrete human life in both science and philosophy . As we have already pointed out , it was objective idealism of the absolutistic type to which James objected . James 's gift as a writer and his standing as a suggestive thinker soon made the term pragmatism widely known both in America and in Europe . From an attitude , pragmatism became a fairly definite body of doctrine arranged around a theory of truth as its point of departure . Its most distinguished advocate in America to-day , now that James is dead , is Professor John // Dewey ; in England , its chief advocate is Dr. F. C. S. Schiller . The critical side of pragmatism is an attack upon what it variously calls absolutism and intellectualism . There can be no purely formal and logically internal criterion of truth that is adequate . There must also be practical , empirically appli ? cable , experimental , non-logical criteria . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of pragmatism . But there was at times vague thinking from the standpoint of modern realism . To do it justice we must take it in its period . Pragmatism makes a healthy advance when it calls attention to situations in which human thinking takes place and refuses to ignore purposes . It stresses psychology rather than abstract logic and calls attention to thought as an empirical process aiming at the successful accomplishment of purposes . In this regard , it reflects the growth of biology , psychology and the social sciences and stands for what may be called temparalism . There is nothing in all this which is strictly epistemological , and the majority of realists would be quite willing to admit much of what pragmatism stands for . James and Dewey in America worked along the same line in an attack upon Bradley and Bosanquet . They identified themselves with the empirical tradition of Hume and Mill brought up to date in its biology , psychology and logic . The categories in terms of which they chiefly thought are biological and psychological categories . Dewey admittedly thinks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seek to trace the epistemology which crops to the surface now and then , we find that it is distinctly of the experiential type . Schiller suggests that our thought makes reality . It is not our thought of reality which changes but reality itself , for he seems not to admit that these are separable . Realty is plastic and thought modifies it . And so far as Schiller has recognized epistemology , he has inclined to the idealistic tradition that a transcendent object // is unthinkable . The object known is a part of experience . William James distinguished between pragmatism , as a method of interpretation of thought and truth , and a general theory of reality which he called radical empiricism . And when we come to examine his theory of knowledge , we find it stresses transitions within experience . An idea means a thing when it leads up to it and enables us to get in touch with it . His treatment is detailed and complex , and it is impossible to do justice to it in the present specialized survey . The point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an object as we have analyzed it because he is an experientialist . Dewey puts the main stress upon the future . Ideas are instruments of adjustment and creative interpretation . It is the social , guiding function of ideas which now interests him , and he is even bitter in his attacks upon the futility of the traditional problems of philosophy . Dewey claims that his outlook is realistic , and I think that there is no doubt that it is . But it is a realism akin to that of common sense . It is a sort of denotative experiential empiricism very much like positivism . The influence and suggestiveness of the pragmatists can not be denied . They have done much good in stressing the nature and conditions of human thinking . It is knowing as an event which they have investigated . Thus they have demonstrated the close connection between psychology and logic . Nevertheless , it is to my mind doubtful whether they have much aided ? except indirectly ? the solution of the basic problem of epistemology which arose in the seventeenth and eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have been strangely perverse here . Perhaps the fact that most of them were brought up philosophically under the influence of the great experientialist , idealistic movement may account for this . And we must remember that the centre of gravity of their attack was absolute or objective idealism . Perhaps the fact that they were interested in biology and psychology rather than in physics and chemistry had something to do with // it . As we shall see later , pragmatists have concerned themselves little with cosmology . Realism. ? The axiom of realism has been stated as follows : " Knowledge unconditionally presupposes that the reality known exists independently of the knowledge of it , and that we know it as it exists in this independence . " The opposition between idealism and realism is thus a sharp one . It must be admitted that objective idealists deny this , but that is because they shift their standpoint between an absolute knower and a human knower . The modern realist is always thinking of a human knower . He is suspicious of a consciousness-in-general and of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine , much older than strict idealism . The recent development of it ? with which , alone , we shall be here concerned ? began as a reaction against idealism . Idealism was ego-centric and stressed the self and its thoughts . In itself , this was not a bad thing , but for the historical reasons we have indicated , it went to an extreme . The reaction was certain to manifest itself . It is my opinion that this reaction over-reached itself in neorealism and that critical realism is a more balanced outlook . Nevertheless , these last two movements have much in common . There are two species of neo-realism , the one more characteristic of Great Britain , the other of the United States . We can speak of them both as apprehensional realisms . I mean by this that both hold that non-mental entities are literally given in what we may call the field of consciousness . We have already become acquainted with this outlook in our reference to S. Alexander in the ninth chapter . It may be called an analytic development of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one but , as we shall see , swung in the direction of behaviorism and the denial of the traditional , empiricist conception of consciousness as a subjective realm connected with the organism . The English movement is historically associated with the names of G. E. Moore , Bertrand Russell , Prichard , Laird and // S. Alexander ; and , farther back , with Reid , Hamilton and others . It is a curious fact that representative realism was discarded as incapable of redemption . For Alexander , primary knowledge consists of an act of awareness directed upon an object which is contemplated . This act , alone , is mental , the object of the act being non-mental . Thus all characters , such as colors , shapes , sizes , which we described as elements of the content of perception , are qualities and relations of things . We have here , he be-lieves , an ultimate compresence which has analogies all through nature . Using a term of R. B. Perry 's we may call this position epis-temological monism . This means that idea and object are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the idea of a tulip are for this position identical element for element . Our seeing the tulip is an event which is external to the tulip . We have here the doctrine of external relations applied to cognition . That we are aware of non-mental realities is a fact which , for these thinkers , we must simply accept . But how is this position going to meet the objections which we regarded as sufficient to break down natural realism ? That is its chief difficulty . It is hard to see how it can dis-tinguish between appearance and reality and make allowance for perceptual perspective and error . The realistic faith is strong in these thinkers ; they are convinced ? and I think rightly  --  that we in some sense perceive and think objects existent in their own right and not mental states . Suffice it to say that if I were persuaded , as they are , that the choice lay between some form of apprehensional realism and sub-jective idealism , I , also , would seek to carry through such a position and might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition that , if cognition implies the existential givenness of the object to a simple , mental act of awareness ? the English position ? or the givenness of the ob-ject in the field of consciousness ? the American position ? cer-tain startling results follow . Thus in knowledge of a past // event the past event itself must be compresent with the present act . My mind must be capable of leaping in a truly remarkable fashion across space and time . Thus when I think of Napoleon that person , himself , must be given . When I perceive the moon , the moon itself must be compresent with my act of awareness or be a member of that collection of objects I call my consciousness . Cognition would seem to be a miraculous power which enables the knower to penetrate the vasty deep and to explore the past . And in a sense this is true . But may we not conceive knowledge in such a way as to remove the literalness of this mental journeying ? But before we proceed any farther , let us examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with biology and behavioristic psychology and were , from the first , skeptical of this act of awareness of a mental sort of which the English neo-realists spoke . They were influenced in this by Hume 's analysis of the self , by Mach 's attempt to change sensationalism into realism with neutral elements , and by William James 's later teaching called radical empiricism which worked along the same lines as Mach 's attempt . The logical doctrine of external relations , that is , relations which do not modify their terms , also influenced them . It can not be denied that the whole movement was a very daring one . It broke completely with the traditional conception of consciousness . It is best to give quotations in order to avoid the dangers of misinterpretation . " It is important , therefore , " writes Perry , " in expounding the general realistic theory of knowledge , to distinguish two component theories . The first I shall call the theory of ' immanence ! ' This is the same theory as that which I have in another connection termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , a , is known , a itself enters into a relation which constitutes it the idea , or content of a mind . The second I shall call the theory of independence , ' and it means that although a may thus enter into mind , and assume the status of content , it is not dependent on // this status for its being , or nature . " 1 Notice the word enter . This means that the independent existent itself enters consciousness . A man 's consciousness is an aggregate of en-tities selected by the reaction of his organism . The position which we have been developing in this book is variously called non-apprehensional realism , epistemological dualism , transcendence , and critical realism . The first few expressions are descriptions which differentiate critical real-ism from neo-realism . The difference between it and neo-realism lies in this that it holds that the human organism can select and mean physical objects by means of consciousness which can never literally enter consciousness but only appear there in terms of a con-tent . The object is transcendent but the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is through what may be called the cognitional identity of characters in consciousness and the characteristics of the object that knowl-edge is possible . In short , we think objects outside our consciousness in terms of discriminated characters in our consciousness , a process beginning with perception . Critical realism represents the clear recognition of the dif-ference between the cognitional presence of an object and the existential presence of an object . It is also the realization that knowledge is a unique kind of event involving the logical identity of the characteristics of an object and the content held before the mind and is not the asserted Likeness of two kinds of entities the one psychical and the other physical . It was Berkeley who saw the inadequacy of this latter view of knowledge built upon Cartesian dualism . The question of psychical existence is not directly raised in knowledge . Just what psychical existence is and how it is related to the organ-ism we shall examine in our cosmology . One more point remains . Critical realism maintains that objects are more than their characteristics and believes in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY realist identifies objects with logical contents and does not be-lieve in an existential stuff . The world is transparent or given for the neo-realist in a way that it is not for the critical real-ist . This difference will likewise be influential in our ontology . In conclusion , let me remark that , in spite of superficial ap-pearances to the contrary , there has been a gradual and re-markable growth in epistemology . These distinctions were not easy for the human mind . It is , I think , not difficult to see that the range and character of the human mind was slowly discovered . Critical realism owes much to English empiri-cism , Kantianism , pragmatism and neo-realism . It is my persuasion that it includes , and does justice to , the valid ele-ments of these movements . CHAPTER XII TRUTH AND ERROR Knowledge and Truth. ? Having carefully studied the typical epistemological positions of the present , we are now in a position to discuss a question which has been one of perennial interest . , The problem of truth logically follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . Without a theory of knowledge it would be hardly possible to have a theory of truth . That there is a very intimate connection between our notions of truth and of knowledge is apparent in the fact that the expression , " true knowledge , " is felt to be a tautology . It is like speaking of a round circle . ' e should not be surprised , therefore , to discover that the various views of knowledge which we have been examining have their corresponding theories .. 4 truth , , We must get clearly before our minds the exact type of experience which is connected with the question of truth . As long ago as Aristotle 's time , lit was seen that truth and error are . relative to judgment ? , Presentations of all sorts are neither true nor false ; they are simply experiences or contents . Thus I can have a feeling , be aware of a pain , allow a plan to engross my consciousness , entertain an idea . But wherever , and to the extent that , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters . Assertions , or knowledge-claims , involve a risk of error for they are interpretations of objects . " In the actual felt toothache knowing and being are not only inseparable ? they are indistinguishable . If , however , I think of my toothache as part of an independent order of reality , my knowledge of it may be true or false . I am then thinking of it as the effect 155 // of an exposed nerve , or of an abscess or of an inflammation ? as something , that is to say , that is conditioned independently of my consciousness and that will cease to exist when the con-ditions are altered . " 1 It has been customary to speak of non-assertive experience as feeling . All the elements of the field of consciousness that are merely experienced as present , such as emotions and ideas , are neither true nor false . They simply are after their own kind . For our present purpose , there is no need to be over-subtle and to study border-line cases . We can be satisfied with the distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are more often willing and dream-ing and experiencing than explicitly judging . Pragmatism has , in fact , made much of this difference between immediate experience and reflective experienc . The question of truth has , then , to do with the type of ex-perience which we speak of as belief , assertion , interpretation , judgment . In all such experiences , there is a sense of con-trast . We are all more or less aware that what we are judg-ing about has a nature independent of our judging . We seem to assert some sort of identity between the content of our judgment and the characteristics of the object . We are assured that the content reveals the object . The act of judg-ing takes place at a certain time and in a certain knower , but we think of the content as not concerned with this fact , but with its revelation of the object of thought . The Distinction between the Meaning and the Criteria of Truth. ? The problem as to the exact nature of truth came to the front with the controversy between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor for a decade or so . The objective idealists identified truth with reality and laid stress upon purely logical criteria , the chief one being coherence . The pragmatists rejoined by stressing human utility and even satisfaction . This debate turned around general philosophical differences as much as anything , // for the pragmatists believed in the basic importance and reality of time while the idealists held that time is essentially appearance . These differences will be taken up later in some detail . It can not be denied that the pragmatists put their chief stress upon the verification of ideas which claimed to be true . They saw truth as a human achievement . This way of approach led them to regard verification as an essential element in the very meaning of truth . They were aided in this identification by the tendency to regard ideas as plans of action or as instruments for adjustment . This tendency went with their interest in human achievement and their emphasis upon living as a process . There can be little doubt , I believe , that , for a while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to know the world apart from the use such knowledge could have or , to put the same thing in another way , they did not see that knowledge was different from action even though it aided action . Let us admit the value of their revolution while calling attention to the extreme to which it went . They were just oversimplifying human life by thinking of it as a ceaseless movement with no time for , or interest in , contemplation . This first stage of the controversy was followed by the growth of realism . It was not long before the distinction was made and enforced between the criteria of truth and the meaning of truth . By truth we mean a definite thing , but we must have tests before we can be certain that an idea is true . On the whole , both objective idealists and pragmatists rejected the belief in an independent object with which an idea must somehow agree if it is to be true . Realism tended to bring this principle in and make agreement with an object the essential element in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism makes a sharp distinction between the criteria used to determine whether an idea is true and the precise meaning of the statement that an idea is true . // To summarize , objective idealists thought in terms of logical systems of a self-sustaining sort ; pragmatists rebelled and treated ideas as instruments for human adjustment and achievement ; and realists moved in the direction of the distinction between idea and object and the stress upon the difference between the meaning of truth and the criteria of truth . It is undeniable , then , that theories of truth reflected systems of philosophy . The Coherence Theory of Truth. ? It will be remembered that for objective idealism experience is the ultimate term . On the whole , it is characterized by what is called a monistic outlook . The whole includes and swallows up the parts . Everything finite is more or less illusory and unreal , for its meaning can be seen only in its total relations to all else . Thus reality is regarded as a highly organized whole . To separate anything is to see it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time are looked upon as not really valid and as full of contradictions . Instead of these categories , so characteristic of physical realism , we find such terms as " organic " and " individual . " The whole is an allinclusive individual . But , it may be said , this is a theory of reality and not of truth . To which it must be replied that the idealist refuses to make such a distinction . Truth in the strict sense is reality ; it is a coherent system of meanings . Partial truth is something incomplete and more or less incoherent . Let us remember that the idealist does not admit a transcendent object existentially distinct from our thought of it . It follows that that which characterizes truth must be something internal to experience . And , from the logical standpoint , what is more conspicuous than system and coherence l The objective idealist has before him , then , the standard of a timeless and complete system of meanings . Everything short of this is a mixture of truth and error . Unfortunately , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our truth // is more or less error . But , of course , there are degrees even here . The coherence theory of truth rests upon two principles : ( 1 ) the epistemological one above mentioned , and ( 2 ) a logical one called " internal relations . " This logical doctrine is interesting but it can not be said to be generally accepted . It is to the effect that no proposition taken by itself is completely true . Thus the proposition that Charles I was beheaded is not completely true . Truth is an affair of systems and demands all the knowledge relevant to an event , and this involves everything else . But surely we are not claiming in a proposition , such as the one about Charles I , to state all we know about this person . We are merely stating one fact about him . Yet herein lies the difference . For the idealist no fact is complete by itself . Hence , every fact leads to every other fact , and so implies the whole universe . Personally , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would make a sharp distinction between'the relations of objects and the logical relations of my propositions . Thus the relations of objects seem to me largely spatial , temporal and causal , while the relations between my propositions are those of indifference , identity and contradiction . For instance , the two propositions , " Charles I was beheaded " and " Washington was the leader of the American troops " seem to me to have no logical relations . They do not even have reference to the same subject . Nevertheless , I can quite understand how the idealist is led to his position . He is thinking of the growth of human experience and of how one proposition supplements another in throwing light upon complex subjects of discourse ; and he takes this supplementation to be a modification . This outlook has enthusiastic advocates and has been very inflential . It therefore deserves careful consideration . The Verification , or Pragmatist , Theory of Truth. ? We have already pointed out that the pragmatist view of truth expressed a rebellion against objective idealism and the co-  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
