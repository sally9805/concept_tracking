HANGING JOHNNY-Myrtle Johnston-Appleton ( $2 ) . For a handful of silver , Johnny the Hangman hangs his friend , knowing him innocent . The horror of it clings , though Johnny escapes the indignant mob to a distant Irish village . He foreswears his occupation , and , a lover of love and beauty , falls in love with an affectionate but unimaginative woman . Practical , ambitious , Anna persuades her moonraking Johnny to earn occasional hangman 's fees , and bring home the dead man 's things , now a decent coat , now a stout pair of boots . Tortured by this necessity , Johnny broods over his ropes and ring , croons the ugly details to a fascinated small son , demonstrating with a grotesque rag doll on a miniature scaffold . In a drunken brawl at the inn Johnny champions a slattern , more unfortunate even than himself , befriends her , loves her , kills her jealous brute of a husband . She is convicted of the murder , and Johnny hangs her , dooming himself to tragedy . <P> Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tells with relentless force , compassion , and restraint . She is 18.
