THE scene is a room in the Evans home . A door at the center back opens into a narrow hall , and to the left of this is a battered iron cot with a clock above it on a rude shelf . A fireplace is at the right front , and a window near , before which are several splint-bottomed chairs . At the left front is a washstand made of a pine goods-box , unpainted and partly covered with newspapers , on top of which are a pail of water and a drinking-gourd . A pair of dirty overalls , a shirt or two , and a ragged hat hang on nails in the joists at the right . It is near the noon hour . SALLY EVANS , a plump , neatly dressed chocolate-colored girl , is sitting in a chair near the center of the room sewing . She sings as she sews .

SALLY Now you slip in de entry and shet de do ' and doll up . We gwine have a sober man on our hands in a few minutes . Hurry , hurry , dere he is coming by de woodpile . She pushes the costume into his hand and hurries him out at the rear , quickly picks up the loose scraps of her sewing and hides them under the mattress ; after which she sits down in her chair and bows her head in her hands . Old January is heard singing outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a moment he is heard grunting and stumbling in the hall . He creeps in at the rear and stands clinging to the door-facing with long , skinny hands . He is just drunk enough to be quarrelsome and fearful . He is dressed in an old shirt , open at the front , and a pair of overalls too short for him , below which stick out his enormous black , horny feet . His hat is gone , and his hair flares up in a white tangle around his shrunken ebony face . As he comes in , he looks at SALLY and carries on his song. p. 12 JANUARY I tells you once  --  I  --  tells you  --  twice , Niggers in hell foh shooting dice  --  Pharyoh 's army got drowned , Oh , Mary do n't you weep . Waving his hand gaily . Heah I is , drunk and r'aring to go ! SALLY pays no attention to him . Staggering forward , he sits down on the cot and moves his head around in a circle , mouthing and letting out deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ! Is dat you , Sally ? Whah 's dat dog of a Charlie ? Making an effort to get to his feet . Unh  --  hunh , I knows . His head swaying in drowsiness . I  --  know , I 's gwine shoot his lights out . Dat 's whut I come foh . SALLY Looking at him sadly .

Tell him if he 's heah when I git over my good time I 's coming foh him wid a gun .  --  I 's a-coming foh  --  His voice trails off . He lays his head back with a great sigh and closes his eyes . SALLY Do n't you lay down lak dat . Wake up , wake up ! p. 13 JANUARY Mumbling .

Hyuh , hyuh , I gut to rise him out'n dat liquor . She looks apprehensively at the clock , which lacks twenty-five minutes till twelve . Bedder fix dat clock ' bout right to suit me . She goes to the clock and moves it up ten minutes . Reckon dat 'll give me egzactly time enough . UNCLE JANUARY is puffing steadily away , at every third or fourth breath making a sort of whistling sound through his lips . She stands watching him closely , thinking . Now I gits ready to sail on him . She goes over to a broom in the corner and gets a long straw , returns to the cot , and begins to tickle his nose . JANUARY In a faraway voice , smacking his lips . Lemme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tickles his nose again , and he falls to sneezing , his grizzled head and calloused feet being jerked violently upward with each movement of his diaphragm . Every convulsion is followed by a combined wheeze and shout. p. 14 SALLY Angrily . Ai n't he a sight on earf ! I 'll wake him yit . She bends down and begins blowing a heavy blast in his nostrils . He rears and bucks and beats the air as if fighting flies . Then as she blows a heavier blast than ever , he begins champing like a horse and suddenly spits in her face . She starts back with a smothered exclamation of wrath . You nasty , stinking rascal , you done spet raght kuh-dab on me ! She wipes her face and tweaks him by the nose , calling loudly . Grandpap , Grandpap ! As he groans and crawls up to a crouching position in bed she slumps down in her chair and begins sobbing in seemingly heartbroken grief . Presently he slides his thin legs out on the floor and sits on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JANUARY Who dat bothering me so ? Lawd , I 's perished foh water . Cai n't sleep , cai n't rest . He blinks uncomprehendingly around him . Slapping his forehead with his hand , he quavers childishly . Oh , my haid hurt ! He gets to his feet and makes his way across the room to the bucket . SALLY carries on her moaning and rocking , watching him out of the corner of her eye as he drinks several gourdfuls of water and gives his head a drenching . SALLY With a sudden shriek . O Lawd have mercy on us ! p. 15 JANUARY Turning and staring at her in amazement . Who dat ! Heigh ! Whut de name o ' Gohd ails you ! SALLY Oh , do n't go away and leave us , do n't you go !

JANUARY Growing more and more sober , patting his foot nervously against the floor . Mebbe dat do n't mean me , sho ' it do n't mean me . SALLY Shaking her head sadly , and wiping the tears from her eyes . Cai n't be nobody else , cai n't be , and you done had a vision ' bout it . And listen to dis  --  listen now to de turble warning . Early in de pink o ' de mawning I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . JANUARY Horror-stricken . Lawd-a-muhcy , did you ? He locks his arms around one knee and stares at her with wide eyes . SALLY I did dat . Thought den I would n't tell you , but now you come home drunk I gut to do all I kin to save you . Twisting her hands together and lifting up her eyes . O Lawd up dere in Heaben , help save him ' fo ' de devil come foh his soul . p. 18 JANUARY Stretching his hand towards her in supplication . Sally , Sally , do n't you squall lak dat . SALLY And when dem hounds passed over dis heah house dey des ' swooped down and moaned and howled louder'n ever . Den dey passed out'n heahing ' crost de creek . UNCLE JANUARY snaps his head around and looks at the clock which now lacks five till twelve . With a groan he slumps down on the cot . SALLY continues her moaning and praying . Presently he raises his head and pipes feebly . JANUARY Was dey  --  was dey any mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all you seed . SALLY Shivering and crouching down in her chair . Oh , but I cai n't tell you de last and most awfullest one of all , I cai n't  --  sobbing loudly . I cai n't tell you ! JANUARY Putting his hand weakly to his heart and gasping for breath . Whut was it ? Lemme know  --  know de wust . She waits , without replying . He stares at the clock , his tongue lolling in his mouth . When it clicks preparatory to striking , she turns wildly upon him and shouts . SALLY I was out dere at de pig-pen feeding de pigs raght adder you went to de bottom , and I seed a devil 's hole by a pine stump , and I bent down and listened  --  and whut did I heah , oh , whut did I heah ?

SALLY One of ' em said de devil was a-coming foh you today at twelve o'clock . Screaming . And it 's twelve raght dis minute . Pray ! Pray ! She springs out of her chair and rushes wildly from the room . JANUARY Falling on his knees by the cot and crying out in a high , slobbering voice . Gohd ha ' muhcy , Gohd ha ' muhcy ! The clock begins to strike . He backs across the room from it , watching it as if hypnotized . Dere you go  --  dere you go hurrying off de pass of time ! He wags his finger and almost chants in the extremity of his fear . One  --  two  --  th'ee  --  fo '  --  five  --  ha'f gone  --  ha'f gone  --  six  --  seven  --  and eight  --  and nine  --  now it 's ten  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands closing and unclosing his hands in stupefaction , shivering as if with an ague . He waits , swaying with weakness , but nothing happens . The clock goes on ticking merrily . He opens his eyes and stares around , slaps his body , listens , then cackles hysterically . Glory  --  glory to Gohd , it 's all a mistake ! I 's safe  --  safe as a dollar  --  hooray ! As he starts towards the door , it opens and the devil , horned , tailed and hoofed , slides in . With a squeak UNCLE JANUARY falls like a log on the bed and lies looking at the approaching horror with piteous eyes . A moaning sound comes through his lips and he clutches blindly at his throat . A whine that gradually rises into words bursts from him . Ha ' muhcy ! Ha ' muhcy ! A speck o ' time . Gim me one minnit  --  one . The DEVIL comes nearer and stares down at him. p. 20 MACFARLAND In a hollow voice . January Evans , two weeks ago you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you would n't heed it , and you went a-tempting Gohd ag'in today . Now it 's too late  --  too late  --  yo ' time 's up .

Why we ever want to do dat foolishness nohow ? UNCLE JANUARY begins to sputter and cough . SALLY cries out joyously . Thank Gohd , he 's coming back ! Hyuh , you run git dem clothes off'n you .
