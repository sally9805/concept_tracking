Colorado 's I. W. W. coal strike , current since October , ended last week . Wobbly Tom Connors , strike chief , announced that a statewide ballot ( the second one cast within a month ) was 88% in favor of returning to work . Another Wobbly leader gave the reason : " The slack season is upon us . It is foolish to strike when the bosses can meet the demand for coal by keeping a few scabs at work . " <P> Both sides claimed victory , though the specific points at issue during the strike still awaited judgment by the Industrial Commission . The I. W. W. pointed to the perfection of an organization through which Colorado miners can exact higher wages when the slack season ends . Also , a Federal court decision in the strike 's closing days restored to the strikers the right of habeas corpus , unconstitutionally denied them when Governor William H. Adams declared parts of Colorado to be in a " state of insurrection " ( TIME , Dec. 5 ) <P> Colorado operators maintained that the strikers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of many new workers unsympathetic towards the I. W. W. But the largest operator , President J. F. Welborn of the Colorado Fuel &; Iron Co. , frankly admitted the injury done his own interests when he estimated that the four-month disturbance had cost Labor $3,000,000 , railroads $4,000,000 , affiliated industries $1,000,000 and Colorado 's operators $10,000,000 , not to mention markets which it would take years to recapture .
