As readers of the New York World know well , the cartoons by Will B. Johnstone are always absurd , usually funny . His method is to take a news item , carry it pictorially to a ludicrous conclusion . A fortnight ago , he came upon " Chicago offers prize for poster boosting its World 's Fair in 1933 , " as his news item . His cartoon in the form of a poster , showed a dog-faced gunman leaning on a World 's Fair building which was labeled " 100% American-Thompson Hall . " * The smoke of the gunman 's gun spelled : CHICAGO WELCOMES YOU ! Other gangsters , disguised as fountains , were at play . In the background , the British Empire Exhibits were burning down . <P> On seeing Mr. Johnstone 's cartoon , Managing Editor Henry Justin Smith of the Chicago Daily News telegraphed the World asking whether the cartoon was representative of New York " sentiment . " <P> The World replied that it had made no canvass of public sentiment , that the cartoon expressed only the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World asked the News to wire 1,000 words on the " public excitement in Chicago " over it . The News obliged with quotes : <P> From Reuben H. Donnelley , potent publisher : " The only difference between gangsters in New York and in Chicago is that here we ostracize them , while in New York they make them club members . " <P> From Robert E. Peacock , distinguished jeweler : " Ungentlemanly cartoon . " <P> From Stuyvesant Peabody , coal tycoon : <P> " Sensible folk everywhere will not be influenced by this mean attack upon a great community . " <P> And from many another Chicagoan . <P> The World printed the words of the Chicagoans as news , and then laughed editorially : " Now it would be idle to deny that when we sent our telegram asking for the 1,000 words , we did so in a very facetious humor . We did not believe that the cartoon had actually caused any excitement . . . . For we have been in this business a long time . We were established May 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things ; and as we visualize the scene in the Chicago Daily News office when our telegram was received , it went something like this : <P> City Editor : Hey , Charlie ! <P> Reporter : Give it to somebody else . I 'm busy on this murder . <P> City Editor : I 'll put Joe on the murder . Get on this . The New York World wants a thousand words on the excitement here about that poster cartoon . . . . <P> Reporter : Sure , I know who to call up . All right . . . Operator . Get me J. Chester Goofus , will you ? You 've got his number , I think . . . . Hello , I want Mr. Goofus . Mr. Goofus ? <P> This is the News . We 're getting up a little story on that New York World cartoon , Mr. Goofus , and we want to know what you think about it . No , not that one . The one we reprinted the other day , with the two yeggs shooting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . You have n't thought about it ? Well , we 're very anxious to have a statement from you , Mr. Goofus . <P> What 's that ? " Outrageous ? " Oh . Not outrageous . " Discourteous ? " Got you . " Affront to Chicago . " Got you again . Yeah . Yeah . All right , Mr. Goofus , that 's just what we wanted . <P> Much obliged . Thanks . Same to you . <P> " That , we imagine , is about how it went .
