If weather conditions are favorable , they will W start for America at sunrise-on Wednesday . Their final preparations will be made tomorrow . Captain Koehl will act as pilot during the flight , and Baron von Huenefeld , who is financing the venture , will navigate the machine .

Irish Help to Maintain Secrecy . By The Associated Press . DUBLIN , March ** out in secrecy on the first stage of the perilous flight to America , the single motored Junkers monoplane Bremen landed at Baldonnell Airdrome , near Dublin , this evening , where its occupants immediately took refuge behind another wall of silence . Piloted by Captain Hermann Koehl , the Bremen came humming over Dublin to find Commander Fitzmaurice aloft in a Free State plane , waiting to greet the arrival of the Germans and furnish an escort to guide them to the air station . As soon as Captain Koehl and his two companions , Baron von Huenefeld and Sergeant Spindler , alighted , they began to stretch themselves . The Free State authorities closed the gates to newspapermen and declined to give information of the German airmen 's intention . It was learned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe weather conditions and launch out when these are favorable on . their adventurous journey over waters where numerous daring spirits , including two women , have found unmarked ocean graves . The plane was left in position , ready for a quick resumption of its flight . While the Free State officials professed surprise today when informed that the Germans were on their way to Baldonnell , there are indications that they were acquainted with the Junkers plans and had agreed to respect the request of the Germans for secrecy . It is said several German mechanics arrived in Dublin several days ago and have been awaiting at the airdrome the coming of the Bremen to regroom the heavily laden ship for the strain of the great adventure over the Atlantic . Plane Circles Over Dublin . Owing to the extreme secrecy attending the flight of the Bremen , its arrival at Baldonnell was practically unnoticed . Knowledge of its arrival was confined to a very few persons , and even those who should have had information were disinclined to admit that they knew anything whatever of the coming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ideal as the Bremen circled over the city and took a southerly course for the Baldonnell field . There it made a perfect landing . Later Captain Koehl and his associates said they had a fine flight from Germany and they are confident of the ability of their machine to accomplish the east-to-west crossing , which has resulted so tragically for all who have attempted it hitherto . While the fliers are reticent to the point of dumbness so far as their plans are concerned , it was learned unofficially that the flight proper probably will start Wednesday morning and that the hop-off will take place about 5 A. M. " We had 1. o struggle against head winds on our flight today from Berlin , but our machine behaved splendidly , " said Captain Koehl . He and his companions were very tired , having been up all night Sunday preparing for the flight .

It was fairly well established that one of the advance guards of the present flight was a qualified pilot , The Start From Berlin . By LINCOLN EYRE . Copyright , 1928 , by The New York Times Company . By Wireless to THE NEW Yong Tams . BERLIN , March ** first attempt initiated this year to win for Germany the fame of making the pioneer flight from Europe to America in a heavier-than-air machine started this morning with the departure of the Junkers monoplane Bremen from Tempelhof Field . Baldonnell Military Airdrome in Ireland was the first objective of the Bremen 's pilot , Captain Hermann Koehl , and Berlin thrilled tonight with the news of his safe landing there . Not far from the same place the same German machine , with Captain Koehl as its navigator , was forced to turn back last August , thus ending in failure the initial German transatlantic effort . On that occasion Professor Junkers , head of the great aircraft construction concern , stood behind his fliers . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most eminent aviation authority strongly opposes non-stop air voyages over the ocean . His opposition , coupled with the possibility of an official prohibition on the part of the German Government , led the three men who soared away on the first lap of their hazardous enterprise today to veil their departure in the deepest secrecy . Besides Captain Koehl , the Bremen carried the Baron Gunther von Huenefeld , financial ? backer of the flight , and Arthur Spindler , a pilotmechanician . As the trio glided smoothly aloft at 8:20 o'clock this morning only the Baron Huenefeld 's brother and one newspaper man among the hundreds of onlookers were aware that the Bremen was America-bound . Others  --  the pilots , mechanicians and passengers clustered about the big Lufthansa planes preparing for the day 's regular flying schedule  --  gave the smaller machine only casual attention . If they noticed his ascent at all they supposed Captain Koehl to be making another of the many trial trips he has been engaged on during the past few days . Take-off Lacks Drama . The Bremen 's start was wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed his brother good-bye , Captain Koehl smilingly shook hands with his journalistic friend , who last Summer had been a passenger on the other Junkers plane that undertook the Atlantic hop and was driven to earth by engine trouble six hours later . Then the Bremen took the air . The man who has made her second attempt at the aerial passage from the Old to the New World possible was aboard the trim craft when she went down to defeat the first time . The Baron Huenefeld , a high official of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company , sank all his spare cash in that undertaking . Undismayed by the ill-fate and determined , to try again , he passed the hat among a dozen personal friends and collected sufficient funds to buy the Bremen outright from the Junkers concern . Then he and Captain Koehl went to Ireland , arranged to land and reascend to Baldonnell Field and shipped enough benzol fuel there to carry their plane overseas . They kept their movements as secret as possible , not only to forestall all official interference with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions from his mother . Tonight the aged Baroness , whose supreme fear has been his possible participation in another transatlantic flight , believes her son to be safely in his home at Bremen instead of on the way to the United States in that city 's namesake . Members of the family are conspiring to prevent her reading the newspapers tomorrow . Captain Koehl told nobody except his young wife of his ultimate goal , which is Mitchel Field . She bravely approved his venture , and her confidence in his ability to make good is unshakable . Even Captain Koehl 's Lufthansa employers , whose star night flier he has become , were left in ignorance of his sudden departure . Spindler Replaces Loose . Weather permitting , the pilot means to continue his journey tomorrow with the same two companions . Originally it was understood his flying mate would be Herr Loose , who handled the Bremen 's sticks on her hapless flight last August . Captain Koehl preferred Spindler , however . Spindler , a silent , nerveless man , was chief sergeant in the bombing squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on absolutely by his erstwhile chief . Save that one of her reserve fuel tanks has been removed , the Bremen , technically known as D-1197 , is exactly as she was when she undertook the American hop seven months ago . Her instruments have been readjusted and improved , so that Captain Koehl now boasts she can " fly herself " without his hand on the controls . He will navigate the monoplane as well as pilot her himself . The route Captain Koehl proposes to follow from Ireland lies some 300 miles south of Lindbergh 's great circle . The southerly course was adopted owing to the warmer temperature and the lesser danger of ice crusting on the plane 's wings , which , since they are made of metal , might prove disastrous . The craft will carry fuel enough to cover 4,500 miles , or about 1,000 miles more than she must traverse from Baldonnell to New York . Captain Koehl intends to skirt Newfoundland , and land there if necessary . His intimates here seem confident , however , that he will achieve his ultimate goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the North German Lloyd . He and Von Huenefeld , the Tageblatt declares , obtained permission to start from Baldonnell through the British Embassy here on that basis . An intimate friend of the Baron denies this , however . If the Vossische Zeitung is any criterion , the German press is far from favorable to the proposed nonstop jaunt . That paper 's provincial edition deprecates the " attempt to fly over the ocean in a single motor land machine , " and begs Von Huenefeld not to repeat the unhappy event of last Summer . 11 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? German Public Is Critical . BERLIN , March 26 Vil. ? The flight of the Bremen for America is not viewed with great enthusiasm in Germany , because aviation experts are fully convinced that an airplane with one motor is inadequate for a transocean journey . The Vossische Zeitung sends an unTimes Wide World Photo Baron Gunther von Huenefeld , Backer of the Flight and a Passenger on the Bremen . kind criticism after the departing aviators , saying : " After Captain Koehl has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one can only hope that he will not repeat the example of last Summer . " Friends of the trio on the plane are predicting success for them . They state that the Bremen was equipped with a set of four compasses and also carried a wireless receiving set , with which Captain Koehl expects to pick up weather reports . They also say that Spindler , while listed as mechanic , is a good pilot and can handle the Bremen , although he has not been very active in aviation since he was flying partner of Captain Koehl in the war . It was confirmed here tonight that two mechanics from the Junkers Works have been at Baldonnell since last Saturday and that they are fully qualified to give the Bremen a thorough overhauling before the hop-off is made for America . Friends of Captain Koehl believe he will make his start from Ireland late in the afternoon in order to have daylight when he reaches the Newfoundland Banks . They predict that he will try to get away late Tuesday , but that if conditions then are unfavorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its supreme test , he will postpone the start until late Wednesday . The successful non-stop flight to Baldonnell represents a distance , as estimated here , of 992 miles , which was accomplished in about 91 , A. : hours , or an average of nearly 106 miles an 4911rPLANE WELL FITTED FOR HOP . Captain Kochi Has Experience of Attempted Start Last Year . The Junkers monoplane Bremen , which is in Ireland making ready for a flight over the Atlantic to America , is the same plane which last August was one of two Junkers craft to take off from Dessau , Germany , on an attempted transatlantic flight , only to be turned back by bad weather . At that time the Breman was piloted by Hermann Koehl and Friederich Loose . The plane is a low-wing , singlemotored machine similar to the Junkers used in passenger and freight service in Germany on the Lufthansa lines . It has a wing spread of 58 feet 3 inches , with an over-all length of 34 feet 5 inches and a height of 9 feet 6 inches . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Junkers planes are all metal , made of duralumin . The Bremen in ordinary service weighs 2,640 pounds unloaded , carries a useful load of 1,990 pounds and weighs 4,630 pounds with full load . For the ocean flight it will weigh 8,140 pounds . The high speed of the plane is 123 miles an hour , with a cruising speed of ninety-seven miles an hour , which will vary , however , according to load . It has a ceiling of 19,000 feet . The pilots sit side by side directly in back of the engine , separated from the passenger compartment , which houses the reserve fuel tanks . The Junkers has tanks in the wings , but to provide sufficient fuel for the transatlantic flight other tanks have been installed in the freight and passenger compartment . There were four of these when the flight was attempted last year , but one has been removed . The plane still has a cruising radius of 4,500 miles , the motor using between fifteen and eighteen gallons of gasoline an hour , The Junkers planes are the most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have a thick wing , giving high lift . The duralumin corrugated sheeting with which the wings and fuselage are covered are riveted almost watertight . The wings are of full cantilever type and there is no outside bracing to offer wind resistance and cut down the speed . Sister Ship Holds Endurance Mark . A sister ship of the Bremen , the Europa , holds the present world 's endurance record , having remained aloft for fifty-two hours . The Bremen , it is estimated , should be able to stay aloft for forty-five to fifty hours , which is much more than enough for it to reach New York even allowing for adverse head winds . On the former attempt of the Bremen to reach America , the plane ran into a strong head wind and storm which cut down the @peed to sixty miles an hour . In ten hours it covered only 600 miles ; and after reaching the west coast of Ireland , Loose and Koehl decided that the only safe measure was to turn back , as they did not have sufficient fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could have reached Newfoundland . The pilot and navigator of the Bremen is Captain Hermann Koehl , who was born at TJlm , Germany in 1888 . He was a Captain of Engineers in the German Army when the war began in 1914 , and later entered the aviation service . In 1917 , he was shot down twice while piloting a bomber over the French lines and on the second occasion was taken prisoner . He escaped from the prison camp and returned to Germany . After the war he served for a time with the Reichmirehr , " and later be Underwood &; Underwood Photo . Captain Hermann Koehl , Former German Army Aviator , Pilot of the Bremen . came a pilot for Junkers and the Lufthansa . He has done a great deal of night flying , and made ' s. study of flying blind , which is so essential to a transatlantic pilot . He is married , but has no children . Baron von Huenefeld , who was a passenger on the former flight of the Bremen , was seriously wounded during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Consul . He is a close friend of the former Crown Prince , and spent some time with the Prince during the first days of his exile . Baron von Huenefeld was born at Konigsberg in 1892 , and is married . The Baron is connected with the North German Lloyd Line , but officials of that line here disclaimed yesterday any backing of the flight and said it was purely a private venture . So did the Junkers Company , as Professor Junkers and the German Government are said to frown upon transatlantic flights at present because of the many fatalities which have occurred . FLIERS FACE STORMY OCEAN . Weather Bureau Chief Says Successful Crossing Would Be a " Miracle . " Stormy weather conditions , exactly the reverse of what should prevail for flying from- Europe to the United States , existed last night and will continue today over the Northern Atlantic in the path chosen for the German Junkers plane Bremen to follow from Dublin to New York , according to Dr. , .. , James H. Scarr , chief of the local United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland might tempt the German aviators to take off if they considered merely the local conditions there , Dr. Scarr said . Successful navigation by a plane of disturbances to be found in the Atlantic , however , would be nothing short of a miracle , he declared . Even if the plane rode through the vast area of storms in the low barometric trough now over the North Atlantic , it would have to face on arrival at Newfoundland a rain storm that was coming into New York last night from the Middle West , Dr. Scarr predicted . Then it would be " tough sledding " all the way down from Newfoundland to New York , he added . Generally speaking , head winds would prevail most of the way against the plane , according to Dr. Scarr , although at certain altitudes and in certain localities , he said , there might be helpful following winds generated between the expansive low barometer zone to the north of the route and the extensive high barometer region to the south . Dr. Scarr explained that he was speaking from meager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Practically no reports from ships are received from the great stretch of ocean over which the Atlantic fliers would pass , he said , and weather maps for that region generally have to be constructed on the basis of reports from the Azores , Bermuda , the British Isles , Europe and Newfoundland . " When we really get to navigating the North Atlantic Ocean by airplane , " said Dr. Scarr , " we will develop planes that can make flights in conditions which those of today can not endure . The time may come when conditions as indicated on the weather map today can be navigated by airplane , but if it is done tomorrow it will be a miracle . " If the German aviators take off tonight from Dublin , " he continued , " they will have to cross a very wide area of storm over the Atlantic . And if they should arrive on this side they will get to Newfoundland just in time to meet a storm that is coming here tonight . " The map shows fairly good conditions for flying from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Captain Hinchliffe took off with recently . It must be remembered that this is the stormy , time of the year over the Atlantic . CURTISS FIELD PREPARES . Searchlights Will Flood It if Junkers Plane Is Sighted . Special to The New York Times . CURTIS FIELD , L. I. , March 26 . ? Preparations for the reception of the German Junkers monoplane Bremen are being made here . The great same/Melts which flood the field will be in readiness to be turned on if the plane is sighted . A large number of planes are planning to go out to meet the Bremen and escort it to the field should it be successful in its venture . The flight ? is being followed with great interest here . The aviators will be welcomed if they land here by representatives of the Junkers corporation situated at this field . Germans Plan to Greet Fliers Here . The United German Societies of America , which met at Turn Hall , Lexington Avenue and Eighty-fifth Street , last nightt , will Send delegation of fifty members , representing all German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bremen when she lands . They also will ask the city officials to extend an appropriate welcome , and a radio message will be sent to the fliers at Baldonnel Field in Ireland , wishing them good luck on their trip .
