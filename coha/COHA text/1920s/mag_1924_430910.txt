IT is now late September and nearly three weeks since I came to Akureyri , the little capital of the North Country . I have taken temporary lodgings at the hotel , a two-story frame building which stands on a strip of land extending far into the fjord . The windows of my room look to the southward over the lower reaches of the fjord and the level valley-land to the mountains , whose peaks are already white with the first snows of autumn . Here I have spent many hours watching the cloud reflections on the water , the changing lights on the vast wall of mountain to the eastward and the shadows which gather in ravines and hollows , depth beyond depth of blue , each day a little earlier as the season advances . No doubt I should be more profitably employed . I have letters of introduction to people in the town which should have been presented long ago ; and instead of seeking out a language teacher , I have been struggling alone and hopelessly with the intricacies of Icelandic grammar . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exquisite feeling of loneliness which is among the first and best of the rewards of traveling in a strange countr.y . Thus far I have but two acquaintances in the whole of Iceland , my landlady , and the woman who keeps the tobacco shop at the end of the street . From without , the hotel has the deserted appearance of a seaside inn at the close of the season . The blinds are drawn in all windows but mine , for there are no other guests , nor will there be others , my landlady says , before next summer . Travelers do not come to Iceland so late in the year , and since the war there have been very few even during the summer months . It is - evident that I shall have the country to myself for purposes of winter exploration . My landlady is a grave , silent woman . Although she has an excellent knowledge of English , she rarely speaks except in reply to a question . At mealtime when she has placed the food on the table , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I hear the click of the needle against her thimble and am ashamed of the clatter I seem to be making with the dishes at my solitary meal . When I have finished she dismisses me with a slight nod and I pass through the empty dagstofa and up the stairway to my room as noiselessly a possible lest I should disturb ? I scarcely know whom or what . The silence is not of the room only . or of the house , but of the street , the town , the land itself . I have been conscious of it from the day of my arrival in Iceland . It is like a presence . something one half expects to see awell as to feel and hear , if one may s , speak . Sometimes when reading in my room I stop in the midst of a paragraph to listen , or during a solitary ramble I am aroused of a sudden by the croaking of a raven far out on the heath above the town , or the bleating of sheep on the mountain side across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarking them particularly . Here they seem , somehow , to demand attention , and one measures the silence by them as one measures the immensity of a plain by the minute figure of a horseman crossing it . What a trifling impression man has  | made on this great lonely land despite more than a thousand years of occupation ! The reason for this is largely , of course , the nature of the land itself . Only a small part of its forty-two thousand square miles is habitable . The interior is as barren of life , either brute or human , as it has always been . Th ' re , among the fastnesses of the glaciers , great rivers rise , flowing out of the very heart of solitude and emptying into lonely seas ; rivers " unknown to song " and almost without history in the sense of man 's relationship to them . The population even of the fertile valley lands has increased but slowly . Early in the tenth century , but sixty years after the first settlement of the country , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys leading away from it . Today there are but ninety-five thousand and a fifth part of this number live at Reykjavik , the capital . During past centuries famine and recurring pestilence wrought great havoc , and in recent years many Icelanders have gone abroad in search of larger opportunities . There is no immigration : ' It may be said to have stopped at the close of the Viking period . Iceland has never had attraction as a place to live for men from more favored parts of the earth . So it remains a land of silence and of vast empty spaces , such solitudes as were found by the handful of Celtic monks who were the first to view them . A thousand years hence it will still be so , and men who love the wild , rugged , more melancholy aspects of Nature will always find them here . For it seems likely that if Iceland were destined to be developed , exploited in the manner of other countries , the process would now be well under way , and this is not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern methods of fishing and the increased importation of commodities from the outside world , life goes on very much as it did a century , two centuries ago . The land is still remote from the thought and interests of the rest of the world and altered scarcely at all by the industrial revolution of the past hundred years . Iceland spar is the only  | mineral resource of commercial interest , and the supply of this is almost exhausted . There is neither coal nor timber , no factories , no railroads ( all overland travel is on horseback ) , no cities unless Reykjavik may be called one . Akureyri , the second largest town , has twenty-four hundred inhabitants . Away from the coast there are no villages of any sort , only isolated farming communities lying in the valleys and separated from one another by great mountain walls , high tablelands , and vast stretches of desert country . One may travel from north to south or from east to west , when not following the customary trails , and cross the whole of Iceland without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Reykjavik I followed the great highway connecting the south and west country with the north . " The Great Highway " I had heard it called , and it is , in fact , one of the most frequently traveled routes in Iceland ; but it would be hard to find anywhere a road which is less a highway in the modern sense . A few miles beyond Reykjavik it becomes the roughest of cart tracks , then , for the most part , merely a pony trail leading over moorland and mountain , across innumerable rivers and small streams and along valleys where , in many places , the paths have been worn through the turf to the depth of the horses ' flanks . Sometimes after hours of riding over desolate ways , I came unexpectedly upon a valley , secluded , silent , filled with mellow sunshine , with a river winding by various channels through the meadowlands . The whistling call of the golden plover seemed the greengold of the valley made articulate , and the faint honking of wild geese ? the perfect voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue the mountains were and how solitary . Dismounting to stretch my legs , I would sit for a time with the whole of the valley outspread below . The turfroofed houses were hardly to be seen against the meadowlands , ' and the brighter greens of the tuns ? the home fields around them were like patches of velvet not so broad as one 's thumbnail . I would try to fix the scene in mind , being sure there could be no other valley so beautiful as this , but there was always another and yet another , and for one that beckoned forward . there was one that called back ; and at the high threshold of each of them the wind over the mountain pass blew cold and keen , reminding one how brief a time remained for the enjoyment of this late summer loveliness . There is an element in the landscape here which satisfies more than the demand of the senses for beauty , a spiritual element for lack of a better word . But perhaps I imagine this . It may be merely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . the lack of trees and of dense vegetation in such contrast to the overwhelming luxuriance of the vegetation on the islands of the South Seas which I had left so recently . It may be that I was weary , without having realized it , of tropical color and light and shade , and of man 's never-ending , hopeless struggle with tropical Nature . Here too there is struggle , but against frugality , not prodigality ? the sort of contest which will always appeal most to men of northern blood ; and in Iceland the blood of the people is still the old Norse blood , unmixed with other strains since the Celtic fusion made during the ninth and tenth centuries , and their speech is that of a thousand years ago . A remnant at least , of what Madison Grant has called " The Great Race " is not passing in this environment , but holding its own under the stern natural conditions peculiarly suited to its survival . What a sense of continuity in the national life the modern Icelander must have ; what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroic period in his country 's history ! That they do have it , even the most superficial obser- vation makes plain . The farms are still called by the names given them a thousand years ago ? pleasant , homely names , and rich with the accumulated associations of centuries : Hjardarholt , Herdholt , Hlidarendi , Reykholt , Oddi , Miklibaer , Olafsvellir ? there is music in them even to a stranger 's ears . One can understand their appeal to a countryman to whom they are so much more than mere names . The ancient literature of the country is still universally known and loved . At every farmhouse where I stopped for afternoon coffee or to spend the night , I was sure to find in the badstofa ? the living room ? two or three shelves of wellthumbed books , for the most part the older sagas : Njala , The Laxdaela , Skallagrim 's Saga , The Grettir , The Erebiggja Saga , and many others I did not know even by name . And so little as the old speech altered- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written down in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ? as they were told in the great halls on winter nights at a yet earlier period . There is no need for the lexicons and explanatory texts which make the reading of ancient lore so tedious a task for the children of other lands . It is hard to realize that more than forty generations of men have lived and died since these farms were first occupied , for there has been little change . The old halls have gone , of course , and what forests there once were have been destroyed ; but if its earliest inhabitants could return to Iceland now they would find the meadows they mowed still meadowland , and the rivers where they bathed or fished on summer evenings still running clear sweet water . They would recognize superficial details of the landscape which in most countries are obliterated or completely altered in a decade . How pleased the men and women of Viking days would be could they look down , as I have during this journey , over the places where they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doubtless , to find that the land itself has no memory of them , no more than of the birds which flew across the moorlands a thousand years ago ? but no , this is not quite true . Some faint memory remains :  | here and there a fragment of wall , the barely discernible outline of a temple site , a depression in the ground marking the spot where a booth once stood and trading was done when the ships had returned from Norway or the coasts of Britain . But the snows of centuries have fallen on these places , and the winds and rains have filled and leveled , so that a stranger , unless they were pointed out , would hardly suspect the faint outlines or the few scattered boulders to be evidence of the work of human hands . Mine was not wholly , or for the most part , a fair-weather journey . All the valleys were not filled with mellow sunshine . Often they were overhung with clouds , which seemed only less solid than the mountain walls themselves . Sometimes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rain . Then , in all truth , I seemed to be passing through an empty land , or one peopled , if the word may be used , only by ghosts long bereft of their bodies , uttering forlorn foreboding cries with the voice of the raven . When the rain lifted and the gloom lightened a little , solitary figures were to be seen here and there , bent toward the earth , walking slowly , painfully , their legs stretched widely apart , swinging their arms across their bodies in curious fashion . I could only imagine them to be what they were : Iceland farmers mowing the last of the precious hay crop . The eye pictured them quite differently . Dwarfed by distance grotesqued by the mist , they seemed misshapen earth-spirits going about some business which had no concern with human kind . Upon passing one close to the trail , it was always something of a shock to see him straighten up , to observe the friendly welcome in his smile as he leaned on his scythe , to hear his cheery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on those dark days , had no doubt of seeing evidence of it on every hand , but if I may judge , after so brief an acquaintanceship with them , Icelanderare quite as cheerful as people in other - lands . Certainly , they seem far less dependent upon sunshine for healthiness of spirits . Those who have written so much of Icelandic melancholy have , I believe , allowed the character of climate and country and their own sober thoughts while traveling these solitary ways , to color their conception of the people . But it is easy to believe that melancholy must be a predominant characteristic of the Icelanders . They a of Norse-Celtic blood . They are thinly scattered over a lonely northern land which is surrounded by a gray northe sea . Both land and sea give them am evidence of the mindless indifference Nature to human concerns . As for the farmers , whether living inland or on the coast , their lives are very lonely , an they have no distractions except such as they are able to devise for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dark , and for all their labor , they gain what most men would consider a scant livelihood In the face of all this how can they be otherwise than sober , silent , morose in character ? So I wondered often , whi sitting in the badstofa of some isolat farmhouse , listening to the wind swee ing over the moorlands and the ram beating against the window panes . Silent many of them are , in fact , a their hospitality is of the least obtrusive kind . Indeed , I sometimes thought ' t too unobtrusive . I came almost t dread the polite Gerid svo vel ( If you please ) with which , at the end of the day 's journey , I was ushered into the badstofa , or the guest-room , but it came as inevitably as night and the door was shut as discreetly behind me . Then I would hear the muffled sound of retreating footsteps in the long dark passageway leading to the other living and working quarters of the family at the rear of the house ; then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | silence , a solid block of it , enclosed by the walls of the empty room ? empty save for my presence , silent save for the stentorian ticking of the clock . One gets curiously distorted pictures of a strange country through reading books of travel . I have read many narratives of life in Iceland , and from these I was led to believe that the stranger is taken immediately into the bosom of the Icelandic family ; that all doors , not that leading to the badstofa alone , flew and remained open at his approach . This has not been my experience . Thus far I have seen no more of the household life of the country than may be viewed through one closed door . If I were to leave Iceland now , what could I say to my friends who might ask of life in this remote country ? " Well , the badstofa , " I would begin ; and " This I assure you , is a really accurate description of the badstofa " I would end . The reiteration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the badstofa itself in my experience . Before I reached the end of my journey I realized that my loneliness was evidence of the most thoughtful courtesy . I am a stranger in a land where , with the exception of a few seacoast towns and villages , there are neither hotels nor inns . When traveling it is necessary for me to stop at farmhouses , where entertainment is always willingly provided . But since I am both a stranger and a guest , my host for the night quite naturally assumes that I would like the same seclusion at his house I would require at an inn . Furthermore , thus far I know little or nothing of the language , and what could be more embarrassing than for two men , in the relationship of host and guest , to sit in silence , face to face , throughout a long evening ? There is yet another reason why my hosts were rarely to be seen . The summer was far advanced and every man , woman , and child who could be spared for the work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields from early dawn until the last light had left  | the sky , In summer , when the weather is at all favorable , it is not unusual for the farmers to work at their haymaking from sixteen to eighteen hours a day . I was often in bed before my host had returned from the fields . Some writers have called the Icelanders lazy . Sabine Baring-Gould , writing in 1863 , says of them : " In character , the Icelander is phlegmatic , conservative to a fault , and desperately indolent . " I do not believe that the people have changed greatly , in character or habits , in the space of sixty years . If they have not ; if the Icelanders I have seen are as desperately indolent as those of 1863 , then it would have been a pleasure indeed to have seen some of Baring-Gould 's industrious Englishmen . Meanwhile I spent my solitary evenings studying grammar and phrasebook , eager to have done as quickly as possible with some of the essential spade work on the language . The Englishman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " made me suspicious at the time I purchased the book . Evidently it had not been prepared by an Englishman . " Contains all that is necessary in conversation with the public " the presumptuous sub-title reads . It is of little value ? what phrasebook could be ? The Englishman or American on Iceland must content himself with asking such questions as , " Hve oft gys stori Geysir ? " ( Hew often does the great geyser spout ? ) and with receiving such irrelevant replies as , " A hinum bjortu sIemarnottum er ekki lcveikt a vitunum " ( On the bright summer nights the beacon fires are not lighted . ) I have also a French-Icelandic phrasebook , somewhat more useful , but giving it seems to me , far too much space to the exchange of mere verbal courtesies . Translations of typical examples of the more useful phrases are , " I am beside myself with chagrin at discommoding you thus " and " A refusal on your part would cause me infinite pain . " My dictionary was a more interesting companion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was encouraged at finding so many words with a close resemblance to their English equivalents . Fiskur ? fish ; hagl ? hail ; ol ?  | ale ; Jol ? Yule ; iss ? ice ; foolk ? folk ; qie ; ; ? to shout or yell ; kalla ? to call ? there were scores of them whose meanings were apparent even to a novice , many which I recognized at once as old friends : for example , a eggja ? to urge on , to exhort . To egg on of course ! had no idea that this is good ancient Norse , but had always supposed it a enerable slang expression , originating 1 the theater , very likely , in the old barnstorming days , and that , originally it must have been " to egg off . " For all my language studies , I had ample leisure for a careful examination of the contents of the badstofa , beginning with the library , passing then to the colored lithographs on the walls , the old painted chests for bed and table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers . The photographs , each in a small wooden frame , were arranged in rows . I enjoyed their silent companionship , and talked with them in the soundless , universal language which all portraits understand . There were grave faces and gav : fair-haired blue-eyed girls of the finest type of northern loveliness ; young men quite as handsome with well-shaped heads and well-knit bodies which their homely ill-cut clothing could not conceal ; fathers and mothers in the midst of healthy broods of children ; grandmothers with kindly faces , their white hair braided and looped up under their tasseled blackvelvet caps ; grandfathers , hale old men with many years of active life still before them ; aunts , uncles , cousins ? and all of this silent company with the heritage of good blood and the history of their simple wholesome way of living written plain on their faces . I searched in vain through many groups of family portraits for one crafty face , ' for one I should not like to meet in the flesh . Then I would walk up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more intimately . How had they managed to escape the blessings of modern civilization ? Climate and geographical position were partly responsible , no doubt , but there was more to the matter than this . Baring- reality . One feels that nothing can shake it down . Here machines have not dictated the terms of life . One never sees that sub-human type of individual more and more in evidence in other lands , particularly in large industrial towns and cities ; and there seem to be few , if any , of those world weary , soul-sick folk who find life such a burden and . make themselves so burdensome to others . America during the colonial period of its history must have been something like the Iceland of to-day . " Then , without anything having occurred to suggest them unless it was the crisp cold weather , these lines came into mind : When icicles hang by the wall And Dick the shepherd blows his nail , And Tom bears logs into the hall And milk conies frozen home in pail That was it precisely ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of although there are neither halls , in the strict sense of the word , nor logs to bear into them . But there remains here a sound , healthy spirit , something akin to the Elizabethan joy of life , and this good health is general , widely distributed , so that one ca n't help catching it . But in the midst of my agreeable musings a motor car , of the ubiquitous type , came chugging briskly along the street as though it had been the familiar of the place since Viking days ; as though Iceland ? any land ? had been created for no other purpose than to turn wheels over . I winced . Motor cars in Iceland ! It was the first one I remembered having seen . But where are they not in these days ? One meets them in the heart of Africa , mingling their odors with the smell of primeval mud ; crossing the midmost deserts of Arabia ; parked before the skin tents of the Laplander ; lurching in and out of crab holes , under the coconut trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown-skinned men whose knees are still calloused with kneeling before outlandish gods of wood and stone . Ye assuredly , one should have been pr pared to find motor cars in Iceland although the winds of change blow but moderately here . To forget for the moment that they blow at all , I start conjugating the old Icelandic verb , Adgveilcja : to light , to kindle , to arouse quicken , and this reminded me that no language studies had been wholly ; neglected during the week 's orgy of reading . Even the pleasant conning of the dictionary had been discontinued . It was important that there should be further delay . I would begin work at once with Mr. Thorsteinsson , the language teacher . My landlady was sitting by the window as I passed through the dagstofe on my way to the street . She replied t my greeting in Icelandic and the most important word I did not understand " You will have to translate , as usual " I said , a little ruefully . " I 'm afraid I have n't made much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , to see Mr. Thorsteinsson . " " I am glad , " she replied gravely . " It is time you were beginning , and you really should make a serious effort t o learn what you can of our speech sing you are to be here all winter . What I just said was , It is very calm this morning . ' " " Dunalogn ' ? does that mean calm ? " Something more than calm . How " . shall I say it ? ? so calm that the plucked down of the eider duck would not stir in the air . " I shall always be grateful for that chance remark . There was magic in it . and I saw with the senses of the spirit how still it was and how beautiful the little town could be on such a day . Had I really been thinking a moment before that it looked like a mining settlement or a nondescript pioneer town ? The street was empty and the shops closed as always on Monday mornings until nearly midday ; and shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those in a toy-shop window  | waiting for some child to set the inhabi-tants about their picturesque affairs . Far down the fjord a fisherman leaned over the side of his dory in an attitude dreamy content , and the dory hung in midair , or so it seemed , for not a ripple disturbed the surface of the water and a luminous golden haze concealed the mountains . Two ravens looking blacker than their wont were flying westward like last lost remnants of the night which the sun had shattered and dispersed . I watched them till they too melted into pure sunlight , and " dunalohn " sounded in the air like the music of a bell that has just ceased to ring . I walked slowly on , thinking of the beauty of this and other Icelandic words , and when I next thought of their grammatical constructions and conjugations I was far beyond the town . It seemed foolish to go back then , almost criminal to waste such weather indoors ; I went on till I came to a sheltered low high among the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent the remainder of to brief day there , watching flocks of wild geese breasting the clear sunlight of the upper air , and listening to the silence of the land flowing out in a great tide to meet the silence of the sea . The sun having no more than risen , disappeared behind the mountains and the sky gathered to itself fold after fold of filmy cloud that seemed to come from nowhere . The first stars shone dimly through , but before I was half-way back to town snow began to fall ? the first snow of the autumn on the lowlandssmall damp flakes , and still not a breath of air to blow them slantwise . They came faster and faster , whitening the ground , covering it to the depth of an inch or so ; then the sky lightened again , and the last diaphanous veil of snowy dew floated gently down all tattered at the edges . It was a glorious sight to see the peaks of the mountains emerge through the rents of it , clearly outlined against an apple-green sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the north . Dusk had deepened to night before I reached the crest of the hill above the town . From there I looked down on a splendid  | transformation . Every house was ablaze with light ; not a window square , up stairs or down , but patterned itself it the snow . I remembered then : this wa : the evening for the opening of the elec. trical station . There had been talk o1 it for weeks . My landlady , the barber , the book-seller , the postmaster ? everyone in the course of every conversation was sure to say , " But when we have the new lights ? " and I had not realized what it would mean , a little regretful that there would be no more yellow lamplight . But lamps require oil , and oil is costly and must be frugally used . Now , it was plain , everyone was to share in a universal alms of light , the gracious gift of a stream of water flowing down from the mountains . " And to think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived so darkly all these years of winter nights ! " Her little shop was flooded with light , and she almost garrulous in her excitement . " You see , " she said , " one has only to turn this button ! " and she showed me how it worked . All the children in town were gathered before the window of the hardware store , where lighted chandeliers of many varieties and colors were displayed for sale . Fathers and mothers walked up and down in front of their houses , seeming to doubt them their own . Even before the bookshop window the light sparkled with diamond points in the snow . This was a little disappointing , for I liked the dim oil lamp which had hung there for so long . Nevertheless , I stopped to note the list of volumes displayed . Beside the volumes in Icelandic ? history , biography , and poetry ? there was a copy of Saxo Grammaticus , a German Social and Industrial History , an Esperanto grammar , Dickens ' L'leak House , in Danish , several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danish ; and in English , an edition of Swinburne 's Poems and Francis Bacon 's Essays Civill and Morall . This last in particular aroused my interest , for it was one of three books have been promising myself for yearread . Curious being reminded of ti old promise in Iceland ! " Neverthele I thought , " I had better not buy it . have been reading too much this I week , to the neglect of my langu studies . " But it was just the size for pocket , so I did buy it , and stopp under one of the new street lamps glance through my purchase , I came a moment to the following passage in eighteenth essay , " Of Travel " : " If you will have a young man put his travel into a little room , and in show time to gather much , this you must . . . Let him not stay long in one or town , more or less as the place serveth but not long ; nay , when stayeth in one city or town let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to another , which is great adamant of acquaintance .

Thus he may abridge his travel with much profit . " Standing under the lamppost , I to the end of the essay which is full sound advice , as pertinent to the tn. eler of to-day , in Iceland , as to the you of the sixteenth century , touring the capitals of Europe " under some tutor grave servant . " A slight itching sensation in the soles of my feet may ha been caused by standing motionless the snow , but it seemed more like warning of an approaching attack wanderlust .
