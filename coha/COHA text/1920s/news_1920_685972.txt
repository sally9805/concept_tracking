These plans were discovered apparently just in the nick of time . The Hungarian National Assembly passed a bill today for the ratification of the Peace Treaty of Trianon , but this secret political society was prepared , according to the documents discovered , to prevent by force the meeting of the Assembly and to proclaim a new Government . A list of members of the proposed new Cabinet was seized . Among the names are those of several anti-Semitic leaders . If this political revolt had succeeded it would have inevitably led to the immediate restoration of the Hapsburg monarchy , this being one of the articles in the creed of the secret society .

Meanwhile , however , a bill has been introduced into the Assembly for the proclamation of martial law . All public meetings have already been forbidden , with the exception of those of members of the National Assembly , while indefinite leave has beets granted the military commandant of Budapest , since he is thought to be compromised . The Government , after all , seems to be vigorously pursuing its inquiries . Some ROO arrests have been made in or connected with the Hotel Britannia . The ratification of the Treaty by the Assembly was marked by a certain solemnity , as the long time which has elapsed between the signing and the ratification , has by no means reconciled the Hungarians to the peace terms . All the members of , the Assembly attended in mourning garb , and the closing speeches were delivered in tones appropriate to the sombre dress of the Assembly . The Prime Minister , Count Teleky , announced that he would take the responsibility for the making of peace , and urged all members of the Cabinet to make a declaration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an onus from which , after all . there was no escape failed to impress certain intransigeants in the Assembly , who rose and walked out , wishing to take no part in what they considered the final humiliation .
