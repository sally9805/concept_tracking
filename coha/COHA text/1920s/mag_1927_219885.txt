" Miller is convicted . Whatever time you gentlemen take on the Daugherty case , I do not anticipate that you will spend over 15 minutes on Miller , " said U. S. District Attorney Emory R. Buckner to the jury last week as he summed up the conspiracy charges against two members of the Harding Administration . Mr. Buckner , who is going to retire from office in two months , was no mean prophet . <P> Three days later , the twelve jurors , with news in their weary eyes , returned to Judge John C. Knox 's Federal courtroom in Manhattan . They had decided without much trouble that onetime ( 1921-25 ) Alien Property Custodian Thomas Woodnutt Miller was guilty of conspiracy to defraud the U. S. Government . But 70* hours of argument and sleep under lock and key had failed to produce a verdict on onetime ( 1921-24 ) Attorney General Harry Micajah Daugherty , who was closely linked with the alien property fraud . The final vote of the jurors was eleven to one for conviction of Mr. Daugherty . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so moved that he made a speech thanking everybody , broke down and wept . He , 67 , blind in one eye , prepared to leave for Washington Court House , Ohio , to visit his 90-year-old mother and " make a living at law practice . " <P> Mr. Miller , 40 , with his wife at his side , heard the jury 's verdict without wincing , without emotion . " I am not through fighting yet , " said he . He faces a maximum penalty of two years in prison plus a $10,000 fine . But his attorney , Aaron Sapiro , who is suing Henry Ford for $1,000,000 , immediately announced that he would carry Mr. Miller 's case to a higher court . " Colonel Miller does not take the attitude of being the ' goat , ' " said Mr. Sapiro . " As you know , Colonel Miller did not take the stand or call any witnesses in his defense . This course was decided upon in view of our conviction that the Government haa failed to prove a conspiracy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the possession of bonds , not denied by Colonel Miller , but from which inferences good or bad could be drawn . " <P> As Alien Property Custodian , Mr. Miller returned $7,000,000 worth of stock in the American Metal Co. , which had been seized by the U. S. during the World War , to the original German owners . This transaction was speeded up with a $441,000 bribe , of which Mr. Miller received $50,000 . Mr. Daugherty , John T. King and Jesse W. Smith were supposed to have shared the remaining $391,000 . Messrs . King and Smith are now dead ; Mr. Daugherty is free . Notwithstanding Lawyer Sapiro , many say that Mr. Miller is the " goat . " <P> <P> *It had taken 66 hours last October for another jury to fail reach a verdict on the Miller-Daugherty case ( TiME , Oct. 18 ) .
