CHRIstmas this year brings us new social alignments . There is a large class of the nouveau poor ? people who have lost their money and are in the throes of adjustment to another condition of life . We have noted a tendency on the part of this class to ape the shabby genteel , and this is most distressing . We feel that there 's a certain obligation which goes with newly acquired poverty ; threadbare folks should wear their diminished estate sullenly . We deplore the vulgarity of the new poor who pretend that they are out at the elbows because of some ancestral grandeur  --  who have no hate in their secret eye , no smirk at their mouth , none of the disgruntled attitude of the working class to which they now belong . Nobody is going to high-hat us just because he happens not to have a cent . ? - rHE fallacy of public debates , such as the Bertrand Russell-John Powys debate on marriage last week , is that the public speakers do n't get down to business . Syntax gets them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced sentence . Thousands of eager people milled their way into Mecca Temple hoping to learn whether marriage works , but neither Mr. Russell nor Mr. Powys got at the subject . Mr. Heywood Broun , the chairman , skulking about from chair to chair like a husband , made easily the best speech of the evening and the shortest . The alleged frailty of mar riage in New York , as almost anybody in the audience could have informed the speakers , derives from the burden it imposes on two persons to reach jointly some conclusion , in advance , about whether , on a given evening , they-will attend , together or separately or not at all , a public entertainment  --  such as a debate cm marriage . Neither of the speakers monkeyed with that phase of life at all , the quitters ! IT would be a good bargain to force Ford 's hand in his declaration that if booze comes back he 's through . Ford is more responsible for the motor than any other individual . The automobile serves much the same end as booze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both make one think one is somebody , both give the effect of getting somewhere , no matter where  --  they are an escape from reality . The auto , however , is more of a vice than booze ever was ; it has more addicts of both sexes . It very likely kills and maims more people and mortgages more futures to the installment man . It harbors more necking than all the old-time hack rooms ever did . It does not yield taxes , or not much , but instead creates them , for road building , and it needs a bigger police force than the saloons ever required . Moreover , the best of autos often makes a worse smell than the worst of rum holes . Anyhow , there are twenty-four million cars now , almost enough to give one to every family in the land . It would be a good idea to call Ford and bring in a new period of legal and potable liquor . A NARROW dingy flight of steps leads down into the Round Table Restaurant , in Third Street just cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , or dreaming . In a small chair near the door sits a policeman from the Mercer Street station house . He looks straight ahead . No one pays any attention to him . After he has sat there eight hours , another policeman enters and relieves him . After he has sat eight hours , a third comes . Twenty-four hours of the day this quiet vigil goes on . It has been kept for some months now , as a lesson to the proprietor of the place , who has been arrested two or three times fur maintaining a disorderly establishment . We were figuring out the cost of such a service  --  three policemen , at about forty-five dollars a week per policeman ; this comes to one hundred and thirty-.five dollars a week , or about seven thousand dollars a year that it costs the taxpayers to keep watch over the Round Table . We are not complaining about this , and pay our share gladly . It keeps three policemen out of trouble and out of danger , and insures them a cultural background . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for on Tuesday evening the poets become very active , and read their things . Eli Seigal usually comes in and reads " Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana , " which won the Nation 's poetry prize many years ago . Cops earn their salt , all right . Purist RTDY VALLEE sings a male version of " Ca n't We Be Friends ? " ? that is , instead of saying " Re 's going to turn me down , " he makes it " She 's . " As you go along through the lyric , this shifting of sex presents problems . For instance , Rudy was singing the song one night last week at the Villa Vall6e and he sang the middle part so that it went " Never again , through with girls , all of them . " The rhyme of " again " and " them " grated on the ears of a gentleman who , emboldened by some spiced wine he had been drinking earlier , went up to Rudy at the close of the song and talked the thing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way you sing that , it does n't rhyme ? again ' and ' them , ' I mean . Now I 've worked out another version , like this : Though it pains , through with love , done with Janes . ' " Rudy was very decent about it . " I could n't use that , thanks just the same , " he said , " because , you see , ' Janes ' is slang , and I never use slang . " He went even deeper into the matter . " Take , " said Rudy , " Have you got a yesterday 's World ' ? " " No . What d' you want to know ? " politely , " take that song ' You Want Luvin ' , but I Want Love . ' If you have heard me sing that , you may have noticed that I never sing it lovin ' ; I am always careful to say ' loving . ' " He held the " g " tightly between his teeth . For exactness , for musical effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a dog , and are interested , we can tell you how much it will cost to have its eyebrows plucked  --  one dollar . It used to be three dollars , but prices are down . A permanent wave , however , still costs fifteen dollars , shampoos from four to fifteen , depending on the size of the dog and how much trouble it makes , and brushing the teeth comes to two dollars . All prices quoted are from Mr. and Mrs. King , who own the Variety Dog &; Cat Beauty Parlor in Fiftieth Street , and make a specialty of such matters . They have a steady trade , they say . Gloria Swanson 's big sheep dog comes in regularly , six times a year , for shampooing , paying the maximum price , fifteen dollars , because his hair is so long that it touches the ground , and it takes hours to do anything with it . Peggy Joyce owns twenty-two griffons and Evelyn Thaw three , all of whom are customers . One of Evelyn Thaw 's dogs is fourteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it gets the violet-ray treatment ( ten dollars ) besides . Cats , too , come in for attention . Cats , of course , can not be washed : they get rheumatism sure . The Kings are in possession of a formula for dry-cleaning cats which is used elsewhere only for the Sacred Cats of the Royal Household of Siam , whose cats arc envied by all crowned heads of Asia . Mr. King got the formula ( it 's a secret ) from Mr. Sall Staymuai , Head Keeper of the Sacred Cats , whom he met one time in Paris . Colonel William Hayward , Assistant United States Attorney-General , has a white Persian cat worth two thousand dollars , which is cleaned by the Siamese method regularly . The Kings estimate that you can spend about three times as much on a cat or a dog for beauty treatments as you can on a woman , which is a lot . The Kings themselves own , between them , twenty-five cats , and two hundred and fifty dogs . The cats Mrs. King takes care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kings ' country house at Croton-on-Hudson . City dugs are sometimes sent out there , too , for a bit of fresh air and a change of diet . They spend their time exercising on a specially constructed treadmill , to get back in condition again . Mr. King , who is in charge of all this , more or less grew up in the dog business , starting in Los Angeles , where he was born . AM , in all , we guess , the most inter- esting bit of information we have picked up in weeks is this : Mr. Al Capone , from his cell in the Eastern Penitentiary at Philadelphia , has entered his subscription to the magazine , Country Life . Eligible TN one of the department stores last 1 . week a large , sullen man tried to get on the elevator reserved for employees . The operator told him he could n't get on . He got on anyhow and the elevator man told him to get off . When he did n't , the elevator man pushed him . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea ? " " Employees only , " said the operator firmly . " Get next to yourself , scout , get next to yourself , " said the other . " I been Santa Claus here for six years . " Eremite AVERY nice office looking out over Fifth Avenue is that of Mr. E. H. Anderson . The name means little to the bulk of people who pass his window , and not much more to most of those who enter the building . Edwin Hatfield Anderson is director of the Public Library , but keeps it as quiet as possible . He lets colleagues and underlings take credit for whatever there is to take credit for around a library . He almost never gives out a statement of any kind . His dislike of publicity amounts to a phobia . He leads a very quiet life , as becomes a librarian . He belongs to the Century Club , has a house in Dorset , Vermont , winters at the Shelton , is married , and after the war adopted not one little French girl , but two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a year he will be seventy , but he does n't look it . He has attacks of dyspepsia which come and go , and during which he attains a very high level of sardonic humor . He also has a mustache which comes and goes  --  keeps shaving it off and letting it grow again . Except for one year when he suddenly went out to Missouri to mine lead and zinc , he has always been a librarian . He has been director of the Library here for sixteen years . Before that he was in Pittsburgh , director of the first library Carnegie ever built . Mr. Anderson was born in a small town in Indiana and went to Wabash College . A number of eminent people , including the Queens of Belgium and Rumania , have honored his office with their presence , but his proudest hour was when an obscure country doctor , who had been a football star at Wabash when Anderson was an admiring freshman , came into the library and asked if he might watch the Lindbergh parade from his window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor , and patience , in all of which Mr. Anderson is gifted . Once he gave an audience at the same time to two glaring ladies , one of whom found the main reading-room stuffy and the other of whom felt a draft . He has to solve problems like that . Last year a great hullabaloo was created when a man insisted on sitting in the reading-room in his shirtsleeves , in de fiance of an old Library rule . The fuss got into the papers . Mr. Anderson finally yielded to the man because he was a scholar , a real scholar . Discriminating between serious students and idlers who merely want to keep warm is the big winter problem . The biggest bother the year around , however , are puzzle-solvers . The director wo n't let anyone have a book or a periodical purely for puzzle purposes . When , some time ago , the manufacturers of a certain article offered prizes for the longest list of words made from the name of their product , there was such a run on the dictionaries that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction of an attendant that you were n't a puzzle-worker in order to get at one . The same thing happened when there was a contest for the identification of a set of pictures of dogs someone got up . The Library withdrew from general circulation every book and periodical in the place which contained pictures of dogs . Mr. Anderson 's own reading is largely classical . Last year he went through Gibbon 's " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . " This re minded him to make inquiry among the branch libraries as to the popularity of this famous work . He was dashed to find that the immortal volumes had been supplied to but one sub-library , and that this set had n't been disturbed for three years . Short Story , Sad RECENDECENTLY , at a ball in marble TLY , a young lady who had been sitting out several dances in a row was pleased , yea , surprised , to see one of the handsomest men in the room approaching . He halted before her . He bowed . " May I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepared to tread a mazy measure . " All , thank you , " said the gentleman , and picked up a Spanish shawl upon which she had been sitting and went off with it . 20 DECEMBER 2I , , 19 Z ? originally announced for it ? I Vould you change the subject to bridge ? You need not . It was postponed because she found out that the theatre selected for it did n't have a bath attached to the star 's dressing-room and the management had to wait until they could get a theatre with a star 's dressing-room with bath . Ziegfeld stars have been spoiled that way . There are showers for them at the New Amsterdam ( William Gillette bathed there recently ) and all the dressing-rooms of the principals at the Ziegfeld Theatre have showers . Incidentally , Ethel Barry-more has a two-room suite at her theatre , with bath , which nobody else uses . When she goes away on tour , she locks it and takes the key . ? THURSDAY night , at the hockey game , one gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just bought a Bellows , and he 's paid a terrific price for it .

" Roof Club ONE of the few have ever heard and-suit district  --  the ties  --  is the Sky High Country Club . It occupies the roof of the Powers Engraving Plant in Thirty-ninth Street west of Broadway , and boasts a putting green , places to play handball , quoits , deck tennis , and basketball , a running track , a rowing machine , a prize ring like the one at Madison Square Garden , and  --  but is n't that enough ? Mr. A. J. Powers started it as a gym for himself , but now he shares it with his employees . Some of them who have never handled a driver are excellent putters  --  all you can do on a roof is putt . There is a locker-room with beds for rubdowns and light-baths , and a physical , director is always present . At night , parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place has a tradition , like Jack 's or the old Delmonico . Grover Whalen and Roxy have been there . Adjoining Mr. Powers ' office on the top floor ( just below the putting green ) is a conference room with a fireplace , and a negro butler . Mr. Powers has friends in to lunch there . Food is prepared in a kitchen elaborate with gadgets of the engraver 's own invention  --  built-in drawers , a special coffee-grinder , and newfangled ice-making machine . The table service , for six , is of heavy gold , modelled after one the Kaiser owned . At one end of the conference room " Does this one say ' ma-nla ' too ? " stands a large filing cabinet . " What do you think that is ? " Mr. Powers asks his guests . " A filing cabinet , " they reply . He then goes over and removes the filing cabinet , which is merely a shell-like cover concealing a piano . Mr. Powers can live , work , play , sleep ( there 's a bedroom , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without ever having to go out into the Thirties . Gesture A WHILE ago the New York 1 Central refurbished the Sedgwick Avenue terminal of the Putnam Division . One thing they did was take out some old flat benches in the waiting-room and substitute others of the park-bench type , having iron arms at intervals . Nobody seemed to take much interest in the whole project , except one gentleman , a commuter of long standing , who weighs a good two hundred and sixty . He was made unhappy because he was too wide to fit between the iron arms . He simply could n't squeeze himself in and had to walk around while waiting for his train , or lean against a wall . He wrote to the company about it finally , asking that one , just one , of the old benches be put back . Promptly he got a polite note in reply . It explained that it would be impossible to restore one of the old benches ? they had been destroyed or made into railroad ties , or something ? but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm from one of the new benches , thus providing a seat with the usual area of two . Happy to do it , glad to accommodate a. customer . History C. AN : interesting inhabitant of Brooklyn is an elderly woman whose ancestors came there a century ago from ? Holland . She still grimly spells the name of the town " Breuckelen " in her letters . Once she thought Breuckelen a pretty place , but she does n't any longer because of the skyscrapers . When she goes on her round of calls and errands , she does so in a closed car with the shades drawn . The blinds of her fine old house on Brooklyn Heights are often drawn against the Manhattan skyscrapers , too . She comes to Manhattan but once a year , on the way to the steamer which takes her to Holland on an annual visit . The last activity she ever actually watched in Manhattan streets was the parade in honor of Admiral Dewey . rhea asked what she likes best about her home , she says the tulips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland . Revised WHILE one of the gentlemen of the entertaining some friends , a maid came in and announced : " Former Governor Alfred E. Smith wants to talk to you on the phone . " Thinking this formal designation nut of character on the part of an old friend , the gentleman asked the girl , " Did he really call himself all ? that ? " " No , " she said . " What he said was ' Al Smith . ' " Marionettes AS a boy , the chief ambition of Remo Bufano , whose marionettes perform every Saturday morning at the Garrick Theatre , was to be an actor . He never grew tall , however , and he soon discovered that an actor whose height is hardly more than five feet is seriously handicapped in getting parts . As a matter of fact , he has appeared in several productions , mainly those of the Provincetown Players , but for the past ten years his place on the stage has been mostly behind the scenes , directing and operating the puppets in l &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can move more quickly and expertly in the narrow space than a larger man . Although still in his thirties , he is generally considered to be the greatest authority on marionettes in the country . He has published two books of plays for puppets . A year ago he went abroad on a fellowship of the Guggenheim Foundation to collect material for an exhaustive history of marionettes . His plays are chiefly drawn from old fairy tales , and are done with whimsical humor . He is fond of modernizing his material ; thus , in his version of Hans Andersen 's " Tinder Box , " the soldier appears as a doughboy and all the settings are contemporary . His idea is that this treatment makes the story for easier for the children to understand . As a matter of fact , though the plays at the Garrick are intended primarily for children , there are often more than a majority of grown-ups at the performances . In the spring Bufano plans to do " A Mid-summer Night 's Dream . " This will be an elabor-ate production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ; some of his shows require as many as ten persons to manipulate the puppets . In Paris , some three years ago , he directed the production of a modernistic puppet ballet in which eleven operators were required . Just now , he is working on plans for a drama , partly mystical , in which human actors will minale with life-size marl- .. onettes on the stage . He says the size of the puppets will present no difficulties of operation : in other plays hr has already used some that were nine feet tall . Plum and Rum THE United States Government had finally to meet the **30;536;TOOLONG situation . It tried to meet it squarely , but tripped up . Announcement was made , in the government 's worst literary style , that importation of " half a pint of brandy or stout would he permitted with each pudding . " Of course , they meant in it , not with it . If you think such a mistake has n't any repercussions ask your fancy grocer . Several of them , after advising their clientele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now facing angry patrons who opened their puddings to find no brandy or stout . Last week one man sent an order to Aste &; Company , which imports puddings from Buszard 's of London , stipulating that half a pint of both brandy and stout accompany his puddings . He ordered fifty .
