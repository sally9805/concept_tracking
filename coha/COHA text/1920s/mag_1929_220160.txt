In old prints of lower Manhattan Island , the outstanding feature is a slim spire rising high above the shops , residences and counting houses around it-the spire of Trinity Church . Nowadays the only distant prospect of Trinity spire is up that chasm of counting houses from which residences long ago departed , Wall Street . <P> But the growing magnificence of the money-changers has by no means smothered religion in the Wall Street district . Only last week a new orthodox Jewish synagog opened its doors there for the first time . The synagog is merely an office building room given by Benjamin E. Greenspan , a lawyer . Some day he hopes to build a fitting edifice on the roof of one of the skyscrapers . Once indifferent to religion , Lawyer Greenspan found fresh faith two years ago when his eldest daughter miraculously escaped Death . Thereafter he prayed during every office day . Last week more than 100 Jews went to his synagog 's first service . When the skyscraper synagog is built , it will doubtless contain many a rich memorial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bronze doors memorialize John Jacob Astor , and its reredos and altar , William Backhouse Astor . <P> Wall Street used , of course , to be the centre of New York City and near it stand the oldest landmarks . St. Paul 's Chapel ( Manhattan 's oldest ) where George Washington and New York 's first Governor , George Clinton , worshipped , is five blocks from Wall Street . St. Peter 's , Manhattan 's oldest Catholic church , rises in the shadow of the Woolworth Building . In 1766 , in John Street , the first U. S. Methodist-Episcopal society opened its first chapel . Daily services are still held in John Street .
