txt " With the testimony of Commissioner LeRoy T. Harkness before Justice John V. the members of the Transit Commission completed yesterday an answer , at least in part , . to each of the charges made against them by the Board of Estimate . Mr. Harkness testified at the transit investigation being held in the New - York City Bar Association building , 42 West Forty-fourth Street His testimony was in reply to the charges made against the commissioners in conrmetion. with the reorganization of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company into the **25;472;TOOLONG Corpora- ? tion . It was alleged that the commission failed to compel the B. M. T. and the Interborough Rapid Transit companies , operators of the . city-owned subways , to set aside a proper amount of money for depreciation as provided for by the dual contracts . John H. Delaney , Chairman of the city Board of Transportation and formerly Transit Construction Commissioner . was another witness yesterday . He charged " misrepresentation " by the Transit Commission concerning the Board of Estimate 's action in refusing to approve an arrangement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the contract price t complete a section of the Fourteenth treet-F.stern subway , when that corn , any became financially embarrassed because of mounting construction costs under ' war-time conditions . George , Chairman of the Transit Commission , had testified the Preceding day that the board 's refusal to approve the arrangement had caused a loss to the city of $1,500,000 in addition to two years ' delay when a new contract for the section was awarded after the Degnon Company had abandoned the work , and Mr. Delaney 's remark about " misrepresentation " was understood to apply to this testimony , Mr. Delaney testified that he had submitted the proposed arrangement with the Degnon Company to the Board of Estimate by prearrangement as a sort of a test case to determine the board 's policy . He declared that this policy , if adopted , would have meant an increased cost to the city of $8,000,000 on rapid transit contracts and an increased cost of $30,000,000 on all city construction contracts . Discounts Lack of Yards Plea . Mr. Delaney disputed the testimony of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a lack of yards arid declared it was not necessary to furnish " bedrooms " for all the cars . He added that the companies had pleaded lack of yard facilities in reply to orders to improve service but that he never had taken this defense very seriously . Mr. Delaney , who indicated throughout his testimony that he intended to stand in defense of the City Administration , pleaded lack of memoranda in reply to questions concerning alleged failure of the city to supply shop facilities and as to what he had done as Transit Construction Commissioner to press the construction of subways and was excused until Monday morning . He said , however , that he considered adequate shop facilities " very essential " and that he had pressed for them and other transit matters under his jurisdiction with all possible diligence . Mr. was the first witness of the day . His testimony dealt largely frith what had been done to build the Nassau Street subway , failure to construct which as part of the dual contract obligations constitutes one of the main points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . He testified that nothing had been done to award a construction contract until the Transit Commission submitted one to the Board of Estimate in March , 1922 , and that the Board of Estimate rejected the contract . The testimony of Mr. Harkness was largely technical in nature . He told of conferences in which he had participated with Julius M. Mayer , then Judge of the United States Circuit Court , and representatives of various committees representing security holders to effect a reorganization of the B. R. T. and its removal from a receivership . Mr. Harkness explained that the commission was interested in lifting the receivership because its experience had shown that the commission had much more difficulty in compelling good service from a bankrupt company than one that was solvent . Mr. Harkness testified as to the details of the reorganization of the B. R. T. into - the present Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation . The total indebtedness of the B. R. T. , including stock and outstanding securities , was $271,447,435 , with annual carrying charges of $10,242,721 at the time of the reorganization , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . was $164,250,423 with interest charges of $7,679,402 . In addition the reorganization provided the company with $26 , - 000,000 in new money provided , by assessment of $35 a share on the company 's stock . Mr. Harkness said that the reorganization took the unusual course in providing that the claims for accidents , including those arising from the Malbone Street disaster , and amounting to between two and three isillion dollars , be paid in full . " Judge Mayer and the Transit Commissioners took the position that tort creditors ( those with Or : ins arising from accidents ) ought to be paid in cash in full , " he said , " and I might say that the various committees took a very splendid view of that and co-operated with us throughout . " The witness said the company approved the reorganization after a lengthy hearing in which the city was represented through the Corporation Counsel . He expressed surprise that its approval had been made the subject of a charge . " If there had been ground for objection to the decision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal ' remedy of the city was to apply for a review by certiorari and take the matter up , to the Appellate Division . But not a move was made in that direction . " Mr. Harkness declared that the commission did not have the slightest jurisdiction over the declaration of dividends by the E. M. T. or over the price at which the stock was sold , allegations that the commission had failed to act or had acted improperly in these connections being part of the charges . - The declaration of dividends is a matter that the law confines to the discretion of the board of directors , " he said . " with the single qualification that they must he paid out of earnings . That is true of all corporations . " I might point out , in view of the charges , that there were two elements In the reorganization , that might raise the price of securities on the Stock Exchange . In the first place , the company is taken out of the hands of a receiver . That is a solvent company as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of securities ? would go up . Secondly . 526.000.000 of new money was put into this company , and naturally again this would tend to raise the price of a stock . " " What was done with this $226,000. - 000 ? " asked Henry L. Sherman , counsel to Justice . " Did your commis'used take steps to see to it that it was ' used for the service of the road ? " Had No Jurisdiction , Harkness Says , " No , " replied Mr. Harkness . " I think I can dispose of that , by stating the same legal proposition . The assets of the company  --  and this $26,003,000 came under the assets of the new company  --  are under the complete power of the Board of Directors to use for proper corporate purposes . The Transit Commission had absolutely no jurisdiction over it . " air , Harkness added that $5,000.000 went to the New York Rapid Transit Company , operating the subways , for improvements , and that other amounts for accrued maintenance had been spent by the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another charge here in connection with the B. ' M. T. matter , " Mr. Harkness continued . " They attempted to hold the Transit Commission responsible for alleged incorrect statements made by officials of tit B. M. T. I am at a loss to know on what possible the , ory the commission can be charged with jurisdiction-of that . " Mr. Harkness discussed in detail the charge that the commission had failed to require the Interborough and the B. M. T. to set aside proper amounts for depreelation funds as provided ? in the depreelation sections of the dual subway con ' tracts . He explained that there were two theories of calculating depreciation . The Two Theories Explained . One , which he said was instituted by Mr. Delaney , was known as " straight line " depreciation . He said that meant that calculations were made of the probable life of the material things that went to make up a railroadand setting aside a proportionate amount for a depreciation fund each year . The other method , which he said was put forward by the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The claim of the companies was that the money expended to keep the properties and equipment in first-class condition always kept it at 100 per cent . and that there was no depreciation . The contention of the Interbot ough had been , he said , that the 12 per cent . of the receipts required Hy the contracts for a maintenance fund , together with any amount over that amount that might be spent for maintenance any year , was " Sufficient and that , there being no ? depreciation  --  accordins to the " 100 per cent . " theory , there was no need for setting aside any of the receipts for a depreciation fund . Mr. Harkness said that the question of depreciation was delicate and intricate and a matter of conflict all over the country in the interpretation of contracts . Mr. Harkness said that the question of depreciation came before the corns mission at the time it was trying to keep the Interborough from bankruptcy . He said all persons concerned had agreed to help and that the Manhattan stockholders had consented to waive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Interborough stockholders had agreed to raise $10,500,000 in new money , and the 5 per cent . bondholders had agreed to waive sinking fund allotments for five years . It was at this time , he said , that it would have been necessary to set aside $12,000,000 if the commission had insisted on payments to a depreciation fund by the " straight line " method . " The only result would have been to throw the Interborough-'Company into the hands of receivers , " he said . " The Commissioners did not hesitate for any length of time considering that proposition . They thought it would be atrocious morally and unsound from a business standpoint to insist on that payment at that time , when all of the city 's rights could be scrupulously preserved and the claim in whole or in part be enforced later on , as conditions developed . " So that I may say that the attitude of the commission represents one potent bit of help that it gave in connection with the Interborough reorganization . That would be the main reason I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of why the commission had not forced that condition . There is this further reason . As I say , this was referred to Judge Shearn as special counsel . Judge Shearn made a very careful study of it and he advised me that it was a very close and delicate question , and he thought it would be very unwise . from a legal standpoint to force this question too quickly to an issue . I may say that since the Interborough reorganization has taken effect and since the company is in somewhat easier financial position , counsel for the company has been in conference with Judge Shearn and has made a proposition looking to an adjustment of this question . Sought a Sane Middle Ground . " I may say of this as a business proposition you have these two extremes ? your 100 per cent . theory , that I do not believe can be sustained in full , and your straight line depreciation theory . You find them as subjects for conflict in valuation cases throughout the country : You fins them in conflict here . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle ground . " As I said in the B. T. reorganization case , you can ride a theory like a hobby today . There is a middle ground somewhere that business men in the usual adjustment of business affairs recognize and are guided by . We might call it by the name of business common sense . The Commissioners told the officials of the Interborough Company that they believed that there  --  was a businesslike adjustment that ought to be possible here , that there ought to be some reasonable fund , not worked out by riding a hobby to death , but some reasonable fund that would mount up as the years went on to reasonable proportions that would take care of any marked withdrawals of equipment . " Mr. Harkness added that the B. M. T. had agreed to pay $300,000 a year into a depreciation fund which now amounted to between two and three million dollars . He said he expected to get the road 's payment increased to $420,000 a year as a result of a discussion of possible withdrawal of old equipment . In discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make improper charges to operating accounts , Mr. Harkness said that the commission 's auditors made . a rigid check and had brought the quarterly determinations between the city and the companies to a - much more Satisfactory condition that existed when the commission took office . At that time , he said , the commission 's predecessor was five years behind on the Interborough determinations and two and three-quarter years behind ' on those with the B. M. T. He said that in addition items that had been in dispute had been adjusted for the ' most part . Mr. Harkness said that the question of pooling certain items of company . income , referred to in the charges . involved a legal question and that he had been advised that the city . could not bring an action ' until the returns from subway operation reached a point where the city would begin to share in the pooled revenues . Mr. Delaney was questioned concerning the transit situation when he took office as Transit Construction Commissioner in 1919. ' but soon said that he had not known along what line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data from his office , lie said that1 a large . proportion of the construction called for under the dual subway contracts was unfinished . at that time-and that a general condition of delay had been caused by the World War . - - you- - regards-  as  - -  important-  - the completion of the railroad yards and shops referred to in contracts 3 and 4 in order that existing facilities might be used to the utmost ? " asked Mr. Sherman . " There is no doubt that storage yards , to some extent , and inspection sheds and repair shops are necessary , " Mr. Delaney replied . Q. ? Did you cause a survey to be made of that situation ? A. ? Yes . I would like to add that storage yards are " not needed for the full capacity of all the cars on the line , because that would imply a , cessation of operation . Q. ? We all realize that , Mr. , Commissioner , but they are needed to a certain extent ,  - -  are they not ? A. ? The record of the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the preceding witness , would create the opposite impression  --  that storage yard provision should be made for all of the cars on the system ; which means that there would be a bedroom for the cars when they ought to be in operation . However , Mr. Chairman , I apologize for Interrupting you . Q. ? But certain storage yards were surely needed ? You could not get along without any , could you ? A. ? We have provided for six storage yards , of a capacity sufficient , when all completed . Q. ? Do you regard the having of adequate inspection yards or shops and repair shops as being matters of great importance to the sate and successful operation of rapid transit lines in this city ? A. ? Absolutely essential . Says Storage Facilities Are Ample . Q. ? You know , do you not , that It has been ! claimed by the railroad companies that the absence of these yards has prevented them ifrom using the facilities to the full extent ' that they might have been used , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you not ? A. ? Yes , 1 know the railroad companies have made that defense to the order to improve their service , but I ? never believed their defense was well founded . Q. ? You thought they ought to do the full service without the shops A. ? I think they have ample storage facilities . Q. ? Have you any engineer 's report on , that that you can bring to me ? . A. ? Perhaps go ; probably not . Q. ? Since you say you acted upon engineering reports , why did you not act upon the engineer 's report upon ' that Important subject ? A. ? I claim the right to direct the engineers in their work . when I ant their superior . My own experience , I think , qualities me to form an opinion . Q. ? But you stated a moment ago that you acted upon engineer 's advice with respect to this service . Why did n't you act upon engineer 's advice with respect to so important a matter as the adequate provision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having proper means of inspection ? A. ? I claim there arc proper means of inspection , but Mr. ShermanQ. ? But why did n't you put it to the engineers , that is my question , sir ? A. ? Because I ant now uttering in response to your question my own individual judgment , and there have been no engineers at my elbow since you asked that question . In objecting to testimony by Mr. Mc : Aneny that made it appear that the Board of Estimate had overruled him in rejecting the proposed ' arrangements with the Degnon Company to enable it to complete its contract on a section of the Fourteenth Street-Eastern subway , Mr. Delaney said that he had been in harmony with the Board of Estimate at all times . Tells of Contractors ' Plea . " The Contractors ' Association , representing all the contractors , had made a petition to the Board of Estimate that the amount of compensation that they were to receive under their contracts be increased , " Mr. Delaney said . " In response to the efforts of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized communities and State authorities to cancel contracts on public work and to substitute for them new contracts . " The Controller of the city questioned the constitutionality of the law . There was much discussion about it ' with me as well as with the contractors. , The President of the Borough of Manhattan , who was then Frank Dowling , was particularly opposed to the city entering into any cancellation or modification of these contracts . But the only way that it could come - up for formal decision as to the policy was to submit some definite proposal to the board for my guidance , I having supervision as Transit Construction Commissioner over most of - these contracts . " And in a letter and by arrangement , I submitted this formula for the determination of the policy . The board considered it . The contractors stated that it would cost to put this policy into effect on all ' of the subway work an additional amount of about $8,000S00 . Estimates were made , as to other V utstanding municipal contracts , and the compilation was made that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount that was stated in these contracts if that policy had been adopted , and in view of all such considerations , particularly in view of Frank Dowling 's outspoken statement that the press of this city would declare it was done merely for the purpose of increasing the profits of contractors , the board decided , after an open , full discussion on this test case , to reject that policy and to hold the contractors to their contract obligations . " ' At the beginning of the ? day 's ' was examined con .. corning forty requests for appropriations on subway construction contracts which had been sent to the Board of Estimate before April 5 , 1922 , only three of which had been approved . Mr. reiterated that lie was informed by John P. O'Brien , then Corporation Counsel , that the board questioned the validity of the law creating the commission and would not act on matters It presented . Mr. added that the board apparently did not accept the decision of the Court of Appeals in favor of the commission as final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expenses , which required the commission to go to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for orders three times after the Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the law , $9,000 Job Held Up a Whole Line . Mr. said it was a " notorious state of public information " that the board continued to hold up all matters which came from the commission during this period . He mentioned specifically twelve contracts for the Livonia Avenue line and declared that the Interborough Company refused to operate this line on the ground that it would endanger the safety of the passengers until a signal tower , for which an appropriation of only $9,000 was asked , had been constructed . In reply to a question , Mr. said that the commission was represented at board meetings by William ( 1 Fuller , then its assistant counsel and now counsel of the Board of Transportation . " He was there to answer or to argue , " Mr. said , " except in one case , when he attempted to argue and was told that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out . " In his testimony concerning the Nassau Street line , Mr. said that the commission considered its construction very important , as it would not only help to eliminate congestion at Canal Street but also would facilitate the operation of trains through the De Kalb Avenue station in Brooklyn and permit the use of the pair of tracka now practically idle on Manhattan Bridge by the completion of the " loop " system between Manhattan and Brooklyn contemplated by the B. M. T. contract . He said that construction of the line under a narrow thoroughfare presented great engineering difficulties and that lie found that , when the commission took office , nothing definite had been done toward letting a contract . He said that Mayor Hylan had included this route in his original subway plan and that Mr. Delaney. when Transit Construction Commissioner , had written to the cornt-any that the Nassau Street line was rreeiving consideration . Mr. added that the question of this line had received little consideration In the conferences with a Board ' of Estimate Committee and that it was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awarded a contract to Patrick for the first section for $5,976,085 . A $10,500,000-asafile Subway . Mr. testified that the board 's committee , to which the contract was referred , said that the total cost of the subway , a mile in length , estimated at $10,500,000 , was too great , while not unreasonable at existing prices . The committee 's report , he added , expressed the opinion that the money might be spent more advantageously on other subway construction and that the city was not bound to build it by the-contract. - What action was taken by the Board of Estimate ? " asked Mr : Sherman . " They rejected the award of the contract , " Mr. replied . Mr. Sherman asked if he concurred in the view that the city was not obligated to build the line . " No , " he replied , " I have'never been able to accept that as a proper construction of the contract , though it involves a question of law . " Mr. was excused at the end of his testimony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hearing will be resumed this morning at 10 o'clock . with Mr. Harkness expected to continue as a witness . CONTRACT LET FOR YARDS . Estimate Board Provides for Corona Subway Storage Facilities . The Board of Transportation awarded yesterday to the Lustbader Construction Company , Inc. , the contract for the foundations , retaining walls and embankment for the.Corona storage yards on the Flushing subway , at Hewitt Avenue and Riverside Avenue . The contract was for $235,934.19 , the lowest bid received . The yards will accommodate 200 cars of either the Interborough or B. M. T. type . They will have capacity for 700 cars in addition to inspection sheds . Under the terms of the contract they must be ready , for use within a year .
