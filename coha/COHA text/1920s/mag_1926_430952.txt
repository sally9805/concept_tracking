 | I SAT at the edge of a sunny glade in Tiger Swamp while Didel the Ancient , Didel the Wonderful , showed me something new . Didel did not know that I was watching him . By waiting silent and motionless for half an hour or more at the base of an oak with which my stained , brown corduroys harmonized perfectly , I had made myself a part of the swamp and had become invisible to most of its inhabitants . Didel was probably sleeping in his house when I arrived ; and when he emerged and looked about him , his small black eyes detected no movement anywhere . So , mounting a low stump near by , he proceeded with the business which had brought him from his safe refuge out into the full light of day . I watched him eagerly because I had never before seen him do what he was doing then ; and while I watched , another inhabitant of Tiger Swamp ? a big , black-headed , gray-and-russet fox squirrel , as handsome as Didel was ugly ? came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied me Illustrated by Charles Livingston Bull in my turn . For perhaps a minute we two gazed at each other curiously , while Didel , thinking himself all alone in the wood , continued his queer performance in the slow , lazy way which is part of his very nature . Then suddenly a swift shadow slid past us , and , glancing upward , I saw the king of the air sailing a hundred feet above the tree-tops . Didel did not see the eagle 's shadow . One of the reasons why I think of him as Didel the Wonderful , is the fact that he sees so little of what goes on around him and yet manages to survive . But the fox squirrel , sitting upright on the stump in front of me , saw that shadow even before I saw it . He did not stop to investigate its nature . He knew that shadows often have claws ? long , needle-pointed , cruel claws that stab to the heart ; and he did not know that this shadow was made by a bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furry inhabitants of the woods . Sometimes the great horned owl grows hungry long before nightfall and glides noiselessly on velvet wings amid the tree-trunks , searching for a victim . Beauty means nothing to him . He knows that fox squirrels are much larger than their little gray cousins and are therefore doubly desirable . Probably it was the thought of a horned owl 's talons that sent this fox squirrel leaping headlong to safety when the shadow of the eagle 's wide wings swept swiftly across the sundappled floor of the swamp . In one long bound he vanished , and I thought it unlikely that I would see him again that day ; but for at least a minute he had sat on his haunches in front of me , and that had been an experience worth while . For the fox squirrel , largest and handsomest of its race and altogether one of the most attractive animals of the American woods , is vanishing with the great virgin pines which it loves and which Out of that winding water lane , into the pool , a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rich bronze-green and iridescent purple and white and blue and chestnut . This was a great adventure ? not because anything startling happened , but because it was a moment of lustrous loveliness  | seem to be almost necessary for its existence . For months I had seen not one in woods where formerly many were to be seen , and I had begun to wonder whether I should ever see one there again . Hence this fox squirrel of Tiger Swamp ? a fine male in splendid pelage , his coal-black head contrasting sharply with the silvery gray and rich russet of his body ? made an auspicious beginning for my morning . He was not , however , really the beginning of that day 's adventures . From Wappaoolah plantation house to the edge of Tiger Swamp is a scant half-mile across country , and the lumbermen have spread their blight along the way , so that one passes no longer through a forest of noble pines , but through an almost treeless waste of tall grass and rotting stumps . Yet there are birds in this waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer the grass-lands to the woods ; and when you have come to the edge of the - 'vamp and have begun to walk the old bank which extends along its margin , you are likely to find tracks and signs it your eyes are sharpened for such things . Walking the bank that morning . I had noticed the slim , clean-cut tracks of three deer which had come out of the swamp in the night , and a hundred yards farther along I had found the sign of a big bay lynx or wildcat . Then , turning into the swamp and sitting down to wait and watch with my back against a stalwart young oak , I had become suddenly aware of Didel the Lazy , Didel the Wonderful . I call him Didel " for short . " The scientists know him as Didelphi : virginiana and respect him as a being far more ancient than the socalled " missing link " and in many ways vastly more interesting . Most people call him simply " the possum " and think of him rather contemptuously as a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped into the book of the past , that marvelous past to which Didel belongs . They do not know the romance of his I career , the epic of his long race history . They never realize , when they see Didel , the possum , ambling through the woods at that slow , leisurely gait which has brought him safely down through ages and eons strewn with the bones of the swift and the strong , that this small , sluggish , insignificant , gray beast is the most wonderful of all the four-footed inhabitants of our forests . Didel , the possum , is the sole survivor on this continent of a very ancient race , the race of the Marsupials or pouched mammals . Once the Marsupials were numerous and great , but eons ago they fell upon evil days . Little by little they were crowded out by other types better fitted to survive , and one by one they perished , species after species , and the newer types took their places and possessed the earth . Although in Australia and in South America other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possum , is the only Marsupial that has come down through all the changes of the ever-changing world of the past to roam our North American woods today and remind us of the marvels that have been . @# WHAT a picture , what a pageant , his lifehistory reveals ! What a panorama of the measureless , marching years ! What a vision of the endless precession of life in a million infinitely varied forms through the ages that have gone before ! No other wild four-foot of our woods is half so ancient as he , for his history ? the history of Didel 's tribe ? goes hack almost to that incredible , far-off time when the gigantic reptiles of the Dinosaur clan were rulers of the land , and those amazing flying dragons , the Pterodactyls. were lords of the air . Didel was here when the world was young . It has changed under his feet , but he still flourishes , though all that were his companions on the earth have perished and been forgotten . He saw the hills rise and grow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the level of the plain . He was here when much of what is now the continent of North America lay under a waste of waters . He saw the solid lands emerge from the primal ocean ; he saw the waters come slowly back and claim their own and keep it for centuries andrecede again . " There rolls the deep where grew the tree . O earth , what changes hast thou seen ! There where the long street roars , hath been The stillness of the central sea ? " and Didel roamed along the shores of that vanished sea and dined on the dead fish cast up by its waves , fish of many strange kinds , the like of which can not be found in any waters now . He was old when the Mammoth and the Mastodon were born , but he has outlived them both . He saw the rise and fall of the huge , horned Brontotherium ; of Aphelops , the shortlegged rhinocerus of the Middle West ; of Alticamelus , the " high camel " of America , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castoroides , the giant , beaver-like rodent of Ohio and New York ; of Latifrons , the widefronted bison , whose horns stretched eight feet from tip to tip and who ranged from Kentucky to Florida and Texas ; of Megatherium and Mylodon and Megalonyx , those mighty ground sloths , which had the bulk of elephants , and some of which roamed the ancient American forests as far north as the Ohio River . Many and many a time Didel , the possum , crouched in some hollow amid the roots of a tree while the terrible sabre-toothed tiger , known today only from its fossilized bones , sniffed and clawed at the entrance of his refuge . But all this is an old story , though familiar to few outside the ranks of the naturalists . You may find the facts set forth in books and treatises which geologists and paleontologists have written about the animal life of the past : books which frighten most people because they are ponderously written and are full of long , forbidding Latin names , but fascinating books , nevertheless . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these old and wonderful things , because the sight of him always brings them back . But I thought of them dimly and vaguely , in my subconscious rather than my conscious mind ; for Didel that morning was doing something that I had never seen him do before . He was showing me something new ; something which was new to me , at least , though I had known Didel all my life . He was half-sitting , half-lying on a rounded shoulder of an oak stump , in plain view , about a hundred feet distant from me. so that with my field glasses I could see every move that he made , almost every hair on his hairy body . He was washing himself all over with the greatest care , and he was using his right hind foot as a sponge . At frequent intervals he would thrust this hind foot forward , the toes widely spread , and lick its under surface again and again with his long , limber tongue . Then , having moistened it sufficiently , he would apply the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to his neck or to his chest or side and , moving it slowly backward and forward , brush himself with it , grinning broadly the while as though he found the sensation enormously enjoyable . For a long time he used the right hind foot only . Then he shifted his position slightly and brought the left foot into play . With one or the other of these two feet he could reach every part of his person , and I think that every hair of that hairy body was washed and brushed down while I watched him through my glass . At last , his toilet complete , he rose lazily and stood looking about him for several moments . Then he turned slowly and dropped out of sight behind the stump . I wished him good hunting as he went on his way . For the first time in my life , I had seen a possum washing himself in the woods ; and , though I can not be sure about it ? for the possum has figured extensively in the literature of natural history ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black and white that Didel phis VirginialSP in his native wilds brushes his hair with his moistened hind feet and is probably as foppish a fellow as the coon . Now , that was a small discovery and nothing to grow excited over ; yet it was ? to me , at any rate ? a pew thing in the life of an old and wellknown animal , and it pleased and interested me even more than the coming of the fox squirrel , which for a minute or two had interrupted my observation of Didel 's ablutions . I lit my pipe to celebrate the incident , and waited contentedly , feeling already well requited for my vigilJin the woods . A TOWHEE 'S contralto came from a thicket near by , and away to my left a brown thrasher was scratching amid the dead leaves , making more noise than a ten-point buck . Straight in front of me , about twenty yards distant , a hermit thrush perched on a horizontal twig , flirting his tail in that odd , nervous way so characteristic of the hermit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and a pair of white-breasted nuthatches high up in a pine conversed in low , nasal , matter-of-fact tones . Somewhere behind me a red-shouldered hawk was screaming , his wild , shrill cries ringing through the swamp , and once for an instant I thought I heard the low , querulous call of a wild turkey , only to realize at once that a redbellied woodpecker was responsible for the sound . This was a disappointment , but it carried my thoughts back to another morning in Tiger Swamp ? a morning some months earlier , when we left the plantation house at crack of day and stole silently along a winding trail @#  | through the dim misty woods , sweet with the fragrances of early spring , hoping to surprise a big wild gobbler who had been making himself at home in that part of the swamp . We did not find him . Perhaps that morning he was foraging elsewhere . But suddenly , ahead of us , like gray ghosts gliding noiselessly amid the trees , four deer crossed our path . Three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vanishing almost at once in a thicket to our right ; but the fourth , a young eke , had been feeding a little apart from her companions and was evidently ignorant of what had startled them . She followed the others , but she moved more slowly , halting once or twice to look around her , turning her small , shapely head this way and that , testing the wind with her nose . For a minute or more we had her in full view , the slimmest and lithest wild creature of these woods , the wildest and shyest with the exception of the bay lynx : and by shutting my eyes I can see her still , one of the most beautiful of many beautiful woods-pictures in which deer have figured ? a slender , delicate , elusive daughter of the forest , fairy-like in her lissomeness and lightness ; a dawn-phantom of perfect symmetry and grace , gliding with birdlike airiness through the tenuous , bluish morning mist of which she seemed almost a part . FIFTY feet to my right , a loggerhead shrike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck viciously with his strong , hooked bill at something amid the fallen leaves . Presently he flew to a thorny bush near by and , impaling a big black beetle on one of the thorns , began patiently to pick it to piece discarding the hard , horny parts . A troop of chickadees and tufted titmice appeared , and in their train followed pine warblers , myrtle warblers , and a brown creeper . Meanwhile a wind had risen and made music all around me in the trees ; as I sat half-drowsing in the sun ; and , riding the wind , rising and falling in undulating flight , a big pileated woodpecker or logcock came plunging through the air , laughing as he came . He is one of the sights of these woods , this greatest of the woodpeckers , and my drowsiness fell from me as he lit on the trunk of a young oak forty feet to my left . I see him often , for he is still fairly abundant here , however rare he may be in most parts of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at , the wildest as well as the largest ( since the disappearance of the giant ivory-bill ) of all the numerous woodpecker clan . Seen in full sunlight , when the brilliant red of his long , slanting , rakish crest gleams like flame and the black and white of his long neck and powerfully built body stand out in sharpest contrast , he is a sight to be remembered ; while of all the sounds of the woods there is no other , I think . except the scream of the red-shouldered hawk , that has the carrying power of the logcock 's bold , resonant , oft-repeated cry , which to my ear sounds always like mad , exultant laughter . Every feather of that scarlet crest stood erect as this Tiger Swamp logcock , sharp-eyed like all his kind , caught the slow , cautious movement of my head . With another laugh ? a laugh of derision , I thought ? he flung himself backward into the air and , spreading his wings , sped swiftly away towards the recesses of the swamp where I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thoughts rode with him . The sight of him had recalled a story told to me a short time before by a correspondent of mine who is not only a veteran hunter but also a keen observer of wild creatures . While hunting deer , he said , about sunrise one morning , he heard two pileated woodpeckers coming through the woods , making the air ring with their clamor . They finally came into view , and he stood in admiration of their swift , powerful flight as they moved from tree to tree , all the while keeping up their loud conversation , apparently talking to each other . Just then the hounds began to trail , and the hunter 's attention was diverted from the birds ; but suddenly there rang out on the still morning air a cry so loud and so distressing that for the moment the fierce music of the pack was forgotten . " A large fowl hawk , " wrote my friend in describing the incident , " had caught one of the woodpeckers . Like a bullet out of a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments the bird was free , and they went back in the direction whence they had come , expressing their indignation by a constant clamor . I wish I could have seen this rescue and how the birds managed it , but it happened in a live-oak with dense foliage , which prevented my seeing it . The hawk , as he perched in a pine after the woodpeckers had departed , looked considerably dishevelled and showed that he had been in a fight . " Perhaps that hawk had learned a lesson , one which he would never forget : namely , that the logcock is a bird to be let alone . These great woodpeckers travel nearly always in couples . When you see one , you will see or hear another not far away ; and wherever they go they keep in constant communication with each other , their loud calls ringing and echoing through the woods . Probably , as in the instance just related , this serves as an effective safeguard against the danger of hawks , for the logcock is so large and able-bodied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put even the hungriest hawk to flight . All around me in Tiger Swamp life was breathing ; but , except the familiar small birds of the woods , it was life that made no sound , that gave no sign , that kept itself invisible . Yet it was there , lurking in its secret coverts , waiting perhaps for night to spread her friendly shadows when man , the universal enemy , grows strangely blind . If I had shouted aloud , deer would have heard me ; probably a gray fox would have pricked up his ears ; perhaps some pale-eyed , bearded lynx or wildcat , dozing away the daylight hours in his safe retreat , would have bared his long , white fangs as the hated sound interrupted his dreams . All these wild and wary woods folk are inhabitants of Tiger Swamp , and you may find their tracks and their sign if you will search for them in the right places , though only by luck or by long and patient watching will you see the animals themselves . That day I watched long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shyer woods dwellers would show himself . But no buck or doe came out to me . No sleek-haired fox trotted along the shadowy vistas under the trees . No tawny , velvet-footed lynx slunk out of the thickets to thrill me with a glimpse of the fiercest and most mysterious of all the I four-footed wild killers , now that the puma or " tyger , " as the early settlers called the great American forest cat , has vanished forever from Tiger Swamp where formerly it held undisputed sway . For an hour or more I had to be content with little things , with small birds of various kinds , most of them silent since it was not the season of song . YET there were some among these little folk whom I would not willingly have missed : a company of brown-headed nuthatches ; a troop of kinglets , both ruby-crowned and goldencrowned ; best of all , a blue-gray gnatcatcher , who seemed unable to make up his mind whether I was a live thing of some outlandish sort or a harmless stump . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and when he first saw me , and no sooner had his eyes lit upon me than his curiosity was aroused . Down he came from branch to branch until he had approached within ten feet , flitting from twig to twig of the low , bare bushes in front of me , peering sharply at me out of his alert beady eyes , his long tail jerking and waving incessantly . But for that tail , which was almost or quite as long as his body , he would have appeared scarcely larger than a hummingbird ; but , tiny as he was , a mere feathered atom , he was a personality not  | to be ignored . Like his close cousins , the kinglets , Polioptila , the gnatcatcher , is a strongly marked individuality , a bird of character ; and , though on this occasion he uttered no sound , he made it plain that he disapproved of me as emphatically as I approved of him . I could not help approving of him , for this was a gnatcatcher more obliging than most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . As a rule , he keeps to the upper branches , and so small is he and so amazingly active that it is difficult to obtain a good view of him there , while his rather quiet tintsgray-blue and white and dark brown and black ? do not advertise his presence . Hence the bird , though widely distributed and fairly abundant , is comparatively little known and is not celebrated as he should be for his sprightliness and shapeliness . To appreciate his distinctive beauty you must see him close at hand . Then the gnatcatcher reveals himself instantly as perhaps the most perfectly formed of all American birds ? a tiny , slender , spirit-like being , so gracefully proportioned and so delicately modeled that , in spite of his sober plumage , he takes rank at once among the masterpieces of the avian world . I shall never forget my first good view of a blue-gray gnatcatcher in those days before the beauty of birds had dawned upon me ? those far-off days when my eyes had not yet been opened to the almost celestial loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know his name then , or anything about him . I did not know that there existed in America a bird so exquisite as that diminutive feathered fairy who came to an elm outside my window one April afternoon long ago . I can see him now as clearly as I saw him then ; and my thoughts leaped back to him when in Tiger Swamp that morning another gnatcatcher was kind enough to parade his slim , ethereal elegance within a dozen feet of my admiring eyes . " WE WHO write about nature , " says John Burroughs , " pick out , I suspect , only the rare moments when we have had glimpses of her and make much of them . " Yet if the great adventures come seldom , the small adventures , too , are worth while . Tiger Swamp had shown me nothing great that morning , nothing dramatic or spectacular ; but it had shown me a fine fox squirrel ; Didel the Ancient One washing and brushing his hair ; a logcock whose crest was even redder and more rakish than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree-top hunting ground to delight me with his fragile symmetry . That was a fair reward for a half-mile walk and three hours or so of watching . Until nearly noon I waited . I saw flickers , downy and hairy woodpeckers , a yellow-bellied sapsucker , brown thrashers , towhee buntings , chickadees and titmice , a sharp-shinned hawk , and another hermit thrush . But now my mood demanded bigger and wilder things , and the visit of the logcock had given me an idea . After a while I left my comfortable seat at the foot of the oak , and presently I sat down again to wait and watch in another spot where fortune had been kind to me in the past . There are two ways of studying the wild creatures . You may walk through the woods and see many small birds , which , almost alone among the wild things , have comparatively little fear of man ; or you may find a good place in the woods and sit there quietly , making yourself a part of your surroundings . Each method has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently in one spot that you are most likely to see the larger inhabitants of the woods as they are best worth seeing ? unafraid , unaware that human eyes are fixed upon them . Even to the most ardent of her worshipers Nature is a capricious goddess . You may sit all day and see nothing out of the ordinary . But when you have thus made yourself a part of the forest , when there is neither sound nor movement to betray your  | presence to sharp ears and eyes , there is always the possibility of a great adventure . In front of me lay a little woods-encircled pool , beautifully blue in the light of the high sun , as placid as a sheet of glass . It might have been in the heart of the virgin wilderness . Within two hundred yards passed a road ; but it was little traveled , and I could not see it from where I sat screened by tall rushes , the trees at my back and on either side , the water in front . It was a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deer and wild turkeys , of otters also , and of raccoons and foxes . y But while all these visited it from time to time , the peculiar attraction which the place had for me lay in the fact that it was a favorite resort of the wood duck , the most beautiful of all the numerous wild duck family and to me the most interesting of all , because it is the only duck which is essentially a dweller in the forests . It was the logcock which had put the thought of wood ducks in my head and had brought me from Tiger Swamp to this tiny hidden lake . Though having little in common , these two birds are associated in my mind because the wood duck often lays her eggs in the deserted nesting- and sleeping-holes of the pileated woodpecker . I had found the ducks often in the past on this little blue pool where they were fairly safe from gunners and most other enemies ; and I hoped that , some time during the afternoon , a pair or perhaps three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend an hour or so resting on the water so that I might watch them at close range from my ambush near the pool 's margin . I SAT motionless , watching and listening . Song sparrows chirped in the reeds around me ; behind me phoebes and towhees were calling ; a red-shouldered hawk screamed in the distance , and his mate answered him . In the wet . soil at my feet were the queer , hand-like prints of a raccoon 's paws ; high overhead a great blue heron passed with measured , deliberate wing-beats toward the river marshes miles to the eastward . For a minute or two my eyes followed the big bird 's stately flight ; then they returned to the still surface of the pool before me . To the right a narrow stream , winding through a dense growth of young sweet gums , connected the small pool which I was watching with a larger one of which it was a tributary , Suddenly , at the mouth of this waterway , two male wood ducks appeared , swimming slowly . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their brilliant colors were almost invisible ; but I knew that soon , if they held their course , they would reach the open sunny center of the pool , and I waited eagerly for that moment . The moment came , but my eyes no longer followed the two ducks . Instead , they were fixed upon the entrance of the stream ; for out of that winding water-lane into the pool a whole company of wood ducks was advancing , a company which filled the narrow passage from bank to bank . I tried to count them as they debouched into the pool ? there were some twenty-five of them in all , including two female mallards ; and at least eighteen of the twentyfive were adult wood duck drakes in all their glory of rich bronze-green and iridescent purple and shining white and blue and warm redchestnut . I watched them , wide-eyed and wondering . I had hoped for no such spectacle as this , no such display of beauty as I was soon to witness . I could not really see their colors until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wider central portion in the full flood of the sunlight . But there they all gathered , as though to reveal their beauty to the utmost ; and there for a long time they remained , swimming slowly around and around , all heading in the same direction , so that the whole center of the pool became a slowly re-@#  | volving wheel or disc of many colors glowing and glittering in the sun . It was almost as though a great circular flower had bloomed suddenly in the pool , a flower of innumerable hues , flashing and gleaming and changing incessantly as it turned gradually on its stem ; and even more beautiful was the spectacle when the . birds , still swimming slowly around and around , drew farther apart from one another , so that the flower seemed to expand and the brilliant blue water of the pool was visible between the flower 's petals . For several minutes this flower-like effect lasted . Then , gradually , the revolving disc disintegrated as the birds , spreading outward in all directions but continuing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they occupied all the central sunny part of the tiny lake . It was then that the scene before me reached its climax of loveliness ; for now that the flock formed a compact mass no longer , but had resolved itself into a company of graceful , gorgeously attired , many-colored waterfowl , the beauty of each bird ? its beauty of form as well as its beauty of color ? was sharply and brilliantly revealed . WE DO not ordinarily think of ducks as graceful birds . That is because the duck that most of us know is the domestic Pekin or Muscovy , and because we see it generally on land where no duck is at its best . The much smaller and slenderer wood duck ? the " bridal duck , " as Linnieus called it ? a true child of the wild and second only to the Mandarin duck of China in the richness of its plumage is a marvelously graceful creature when it is seen swimming slowly on the calm , woods-encircled waters which it loves ; and I have seen among birds few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a group excel all other wild things than this company of wood duck drakes , plumed and crested and illumined by the sun , so that all their many colors shone with amazing brilliancy . Minute after minute I watched them . Not only the loveliness of the sight , but also its rarity , made those minutes memorable . Over most of its range the wood duck is now so rare that a Federal law protects it at all seasons ; and although it has held its own here far better than in most other parts of the country , I see it usually only in small flocks , while the gentle trustfulness which formerly distinguished it has been supplanted by a wariness which renders observation at close quarters extremely difficult . Never before had I seen so large a company of male wood ducks so close at hand in a setting so perfectly suited to the picture ; and the thought came to me , as I watched , that in all likelihood I would never see that spectacle again . So while it lasted I made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of which John Burroughs speaks . This was a great adventure ? not because anything startling happened , not because there was drama in it , or because some hidden secret of nature was revealed . but because it was a moment of great beauty , a moment of lustrous , indescribable loveliness . " Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye ; " but no mountain sunrise glows as vividly in my mind as this wildwood picture painted upon a smaller canvas , this little picture of a flock of wood ducks floating upon a sunlit blue pool in the midst of the woods . This was beauty of another kind , a different order . There was life in it ; it was the beauty of living things , of richly colored , crested , graceful wild birds of a species world-famed for its beauty ; and to my mind the beauty of birds exceeds that of all other wild creatures and represents the high tide of nature 's striving toward the goal of absolute and perfect loveliness in the animate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic of this adventure ? the element of silence , even more important in this instance than the wildness and seclusion of the spot where the adventure befell . From beginning to end I heard no sound . If the song sparrows in the reeds still chirped , or the soaring hawks still uttered their shrill cries , I did not hear them . In fact , I am sure that there was no voice or noise of any sort to be heard , for while I watched I was aware of a profound , almost unnatural stillness , and that sense of stillness remains in my memory an essential part of the experience . To it was mainly due a certain impression of mystery , even of unreality , which grew more and more definite as the moments passed . It was as though I were witnessing some secret incredible ceremonial of the wild , some mystic rite performed in this hidden place in honor of the invisible deities of the woods . The strange , slow coming of the procession out of the narrow waterway leading into the pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds , first in a compact mass like a great circular flower , and then as individual units of the flock , swam round and round , all in the same direction ; most of all , the deep hush which brooded over the pool and all the surrounding woods , as though to utter sound were to commit sacrilege ? all these things contributed to that sense of unreality which grew and deepened as the resemblance of the spectacle to a mysterious woodland rite took firmer and firmer hold upon my mind . And this effect was never lost ; the sense of mystery endured and grew stronger till the end . I do not know how long the birds continued to swim slowly in circles round and round the pool ? it is hard to keep track of minutes at such a time . But at last two of them , swimming side by side , left the circle and headed toward the entrance of the waterway at the pool 's lower end ; and those immediately behind followed them , to be followed in turn by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed out of the sunlight into the shadow . The rich , iridescent colors faded ; the outlines of each graceful form grew dim . Soon the head of the column vanished around a curve of the narrow stream . In a few moments the last of them passed from view , and the little blue pool ? which somehow seemed no longer of quite so brilliant a blue , now that its beautiful occupants had departed ? lay still and vacant before my eyes . For a long while I sat listening . No sound came back from them , and though I waited for half an hour or more by the pool 's margin , they did not return . I dreamed of them that night , and by day I have dreamed of them often , seeing them again with that eye of the mind which can look back across months and years to the beautiful things of the woods . For an experience like this one never ends ; a picture like this one never fades . Once seen , it is a possession forever .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
