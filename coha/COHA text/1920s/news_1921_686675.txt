txt If President Harding should instruct the DirectorGeneral of Railroads to fund for ten years the total expenditure made by the Government for additions and betterments during Federal control , as it is creditibly reported he contemplates doing , it would make a difference of about $300,000,000 in the amounts presently payable to the carriers . To make possible prompt payment of balances then due . however . Concrraus would have to make another appropriation for winding up Federal control accounts , as the Director-General recently requested , and probably a much larger one than the $400,000,000 he suggested . It is possibly the question of ways and means that causes the President to hesitate . Under the Transportation Act , the President may either fund the whole of the Government expenditures for additions and betterments ( capital expenditures ) or he may within certain limitations apply against such debts amounts due the carriers from the Government on compensation account and fund the balance . Aside from allocated equipment , cost of which has been funded in the form of equipment trust certificates given the Government by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is estimated that about $300,000,000 is deductible from compensation under the terms of the act and so applicable to reduce the capital debt , leaving $500,000,000 which would have been funded in any case . If the carriers had been able to collect promptly the net operating income guaranteed them for the six months ended Aug. 31 , 1920 , which was one-half of the annual standard return in each case , their cash position since the close of the guaranty period would not have been as bad as it has been . Half of the standard return for the Class 1 carriers is approximately $450,000,000 and in addition they incurred a deficit for the period , largely due to an increase in wages effective as of May 1 , whereas the increases in rates and fares were not effective until Aug. 26 o ; thereaftetyof $207,000,000. or a total , of $657,000,000 to be paid the carriers for that period . accounting for which is entirely separate from that . for the federal control period . The latest Treasury Department statement shows payments on this account to June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Winslow act , aggregating $417,300.000 and leaving a balance of $239,000,000 still due on the guaranty . A maze of accounting is involved in settlement : : for the guaranty period , however , because the transportation net charges the Commerce Commission with the duty of scrutinizing all operating accounts , and particularly those on maintenance , for the six months ' period , before certifying payments . Aside from either the funding of the capital expenditures or settlements on the six months ' guaranty , are claims of the carriers for under-maintenance during federal control . Director General Davis recently advised committees of Congress that if all the carriers filed claims in proportion to those which had already been filed , the total of such claims would run between $700,000,000 and $800,000,000.
