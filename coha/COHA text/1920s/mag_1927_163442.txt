ARMY &; NAVY <P> Some 5,500,000 soldiers , sailors &; marines who served the U. S. at home or abroad in the War , were voted an honorarium by Congress three years ago , over the veto of President Coolidge . Some 3,100,000 of the soldiers - or their relicts or dependents-have collected this " bonus , " as it was called in the press , this World War Adjusted Compensation , as it was called in the Act . Some 40,000 soldiers filled out their applications incorrectly , got them back again , and have since failed to return corrected applications to the Adjutant General 's Office . Some 500 , - 000 soldiers have failed to make any application at all . <P> Last week , Adjutant General Lutz Wahl of the Army reminded the 40,000 incorrect applicants , and the 500,000 non-applicants , that no bonus will be paid to any one-or his relict or dependents-who fails to apply before Jan. 1 , 1928 . The reminder was intended also for many a onetime sailor , many a onetime marine. * <P> Procrastinating non-applicants wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the next five weeks . The simplest way would be to take the following steps : <P> 1 ) Obtain from the nearest post office an application blank . <P> 2 ) Read the instruction leaflet and note : a ) that discharge papers should accompany applications ; b ) that , if discharge papers are lost , memory may serve in filling out the blank but that the War &; Navy Departments and the Marine Corps will dislike it if you ask them to tell you when , where or how you served . <P> 3 ) Fill out the blank legibly , honestly , correctly , not forgetting fingerprints and two signatures . <P> 4 ) Address the envelope which comes with the blank to that branch of the service to which you were last assigned-to the Adjutant General , Bureau of Navigation , or Marine Corps , in Washington , D. C. <P> Non-applicants wondered how much money they might get if they took the above steps . <P> The Bonus Bill provided : <P> 1 ) Compensation at the rate of $1 a day for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first 60 days of service . <P> 2 ) Payment in cash to those whose credits will be not over $50 and to the wives , children or parents of veterans who have died since the armistice . <P> 3 ) Payment to other veterans in the form of a 20-year endowment insurance policy based on their adjusted service credit . On this policy they may borrow , after two years , up to 90% of its value . <P> <P> *Also , many a female Yeoman of the Navy , many a female Marine , many a Philippine scout , Philippine infantryman-all of whom are eligible .
