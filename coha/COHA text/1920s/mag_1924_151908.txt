While the National Negro Business League sought to teach Negroes thrift at its session in Chicago , in Manhattan , Marcus Garvey and his associates ( TIME , Aug. 11 ) made Negroes " noble . " A procession marched into Liberty Hall , which was formerly a garage . First came a beadle , then an archdeacon , then a priest in red biretta , then Bishop McGuire of Africa in a purple cape and mitre of gold cloth , carrying a crook and wearing his bishop 's ring of amethyst over a pair of white gloves . At the rear came Marcus Garvey in a feathered hat and George O. Marke , Royal Potentate , who came from Sierra Leone for the ceremony . <P> A Negro knelt ; Potentate Marke bared his sword , tapped him on the head , exclaiming : " Arise , Sir E. Elliot ! Arise ! " The Bishop then blessed the Knight , who shook hands all around ; and the performance was repeated . Among those honored , one woman was made a Lady . Twenty gold crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyasa was to have been created , but the prospective Duke failed to appear . <P> Afterward everybody enjoyed a roast-chicken dinner and a ragtime ball .
