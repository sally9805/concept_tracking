There was a rapid sequence of events this past week in the financial and trade world . Accompanied by feverish speculation , cotton surged forward almost to the frequently predicted price of 30 cents . Although the volume of transactions in stocks decreased , prices were irregularly strong . Bonds in general turned downward under advancing money rates . In Germany the printing presses rendered colorless previous superlatives of financial writers by adding in the single week 450 billion new Reichsbank marks ! ! Some ingenious mathematician has computed that at this rate 1923 would see outstanding marks break into the quadrillions-an achievement beyond the power of even the Bolsheviki . <P> Finally , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced an advance of its rediscount rates from 4 to 4% . This occurrence provided a live topic of conversation both in Wall and Lombard Streets . Certain features attending it , because of their fundamental connection with the future course of American business , deserve close attention .                   @ @
