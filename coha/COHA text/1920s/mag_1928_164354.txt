In the play , Paris Bound , a suave gentleman boasts that he once stroked the Vassar crew . He was wrong in more ways than one . Vassar , famed female college though it is , has no crew . In fact , the only U. S. female college where crew is a major sport is Wellesley , at Wellesley , Mass . Last week Wellesley rowing came into the public eye and the public eye was pleased , for pretty little Maimie Sze , daughter of the Chinese Minister to the U. S. , was appointed captain of the freshman crew . No muscled oarswoman she , but the coxswain who steers the boat and shouts out the rhythm loud and strong . Popular , she is also custodian of the Wellesley Athletic Association . <P> Wellesley 's crew activity is as old as the college itself ( 1875 ) . In the early days no great speed was attained , for the oars-women wore long , swishing skirts , full sleeves , sailor collars , sailor hats cocked at perilous angles , and used large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing on the lake . About 1900 a uniform crew costume of bloomers and white sweaters was adopted ; racing shells were purchased . Crew became the prime sport . <P> A big night at Wellesley is Float Night , late in May , when the four class crews race across the lake , while the girls on the banks sing . After that , the varsity crew is chosen - the greatest athletic honor at Wellesley . <P> Until a few years ago , oarswomen were required to weigh more than 120 pounds . But today , says Coach Eleanor Clifton , " the girls all seem to be growing thinner , and we can not keep that regulation . Our only definite stipulation is that a girl have ' B ' posture to qualify for crew , the rest depends on her natural ability . " For three weeks before the class races , the oarswomen keep strict training : to bed at 10:30 p. m. , a 15-minute nap each day , no eating between meals , no coffee , only one helping of wholesome food at meals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
