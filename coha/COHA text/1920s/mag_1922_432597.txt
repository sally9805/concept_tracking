I OPENED my eyes . On the white lake above my head , silver fish were swimming , in curious geometric designs that elaborated the forms of their bodies . Now there were five ; now , at the close of a bewildering interweaving of flashing bodies , there were six . The curves grew wider ; they opened ; a seventh entered . The mystic number was complete . I looked at my nurse . Without raising her eyes , she took up a piece of linen upon which she was embroidering strange scrolls . Even as I looked , a curve began to crawl . I turned hur ? iedly back to the pure white lake above my head , fearful lest I had ' lost some movement in the intricate puzzle of silver light ; distressed lest , through the relaxing of my will , the wandering of my attention , those mystic symbols of my faith might cease to be . One by one they were extinguished on that cold hard lake of white . I had failed them . ' The fishing boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you want to look at them ? How many can you see . ' Why was my nurse trying to test me out in this hateful calculating way ? She could read my every thought . That was one of her cruel advantages , for on her forehead , as on the forehead of my doctor , was pricked in smudgy red the sign of souls that were lost ? the cross of the hypocrite , that was no true cross , strong in its uprightness , but a crooked slanting ugly scar . In spite of my deplorable weakness , I was still permitted to struggle against such spirits of darkness as these . And those boats . She saw , and she knew that I saw , against the cold light of a winter sunset , four ; and now there were six . Soon perhaps would come the mystic seventh , upon whose presence their safety hung . They were making valiant headway against a strongly ebbing tide . Their sails were furled , their engines silenced by distance ; but there was no magic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as usual . She knew , too , that I saw , though perhaps she did not see herself , ? she was fortunately sometimes blinded ; or was she only oblivious from sheer stupidity and obstinacy , ? the dark hulks that shadowed them . Red lights were breaking out upon them as they swung idly to and fro , casting no anchor within the breakwater , held by desires stronger than wind or tide . Their leader was long and low , and her masts shot skyward at bow and stern . The green of her starboard light was as full of malignant life as the eyes of a hungry brute ; the red was cruel as blood . The short winter twilight was almost gone . While I could still trace the serpent-like outline of the craft , I must act . By the absolute concentration of the power for good still left in me , by a supreme act of self-forgetting will , I might make it burst into flames . I set my mind to the task . The flames burst forth . They died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The next day I was called upon to pay the penalty for my defiance of the powers of evil . At my head stood a strange woman . In a smooth French voice , from which the nasality had been wiped out by the broken English she was talking , she read aloud my thoughts as they jumped from one estimate to another of my husband 's ability to pay for the boat which I had burned . It would beggar him , if my thoughts betrayed the truth ; it would worse than beggar him , if I thought too high a figure . Seven hundred , a million , nine hundred and ninety-nine ? the sums tore through my mind with a recklessness that was betraying their falsity , was numbing my hope of concealment . Her smile was as faultless as the arrangement of her hair . It never left her lips as my figures rose and fell in breathless irregularity , but always , in spite of my frantic effort , toward higher levels . And always , in mockery of my misery , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Ca n't you make them stop that noise ? ' I asked my nurse . They will stop soon , ' she said . ' It is almost dinner-time . Have you ever been in the shipyard ? And seen the subchasers they built during the war ? ' ' Yes , ' I replied , as casually as I could ; ' their designer was so good as to take us over one , and I have met them outside on their speed tests . ' So answering , I thought bitterly of the speed for evil that the boat which those fiends had already started rebuilding at my husband 's expense would have . She would rush down the open lane of water that her own fires burned clear of ice , loaded with the souls of the despairing , of those responsible for their despair . Would soy own daughter be among them ? Her father imprisoned for debt , who would save her ? As hostage for the payment , they would claim her . That night they took her . But before they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ploughing bow , I had followed her in her flight through darkness that was seared with flames . When I came to the crossing under the turbulent current of the channel , choosing my way blindly among caverns where whispered the voices of many waters , I lost her . Yet twice already I bad threaded those caverns ? twice , naked of body . Now I had failed , because it was my soul that was perishing of the cold . I threw what was left of me upon the darkness . A num stood before me with a kindly wrinkled face and mild blue eyes . There is one sacrifice for her salvation that you have not yet made . It lacks but this test . Will you dare it ? ' He laid his gnarled leased gently upon my shoulder . Only tell me , ' I gasped . ' We are making the sacrificial bread , ' he said . ' For the kneading of it , human strength , human hands are required . The heat of it is as white as is the bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking on you . Will you ? ' I fell upon the task . With the flesh crackling from my hands , I tore at that surging mountain of bread . It engulfed me ; I was lost in pain . The light grew more intense . I saw as in a mirror against its glowing side the seared horror that was my face . I fell into nothingness . I found myself . I was in pursuit of that ship . I rushed from land to land , from shore to shore , and knew only that now I was in a harbor , searching wildly , now on the docks , hunting among staunch ocean-going steamers for a phantom ship . At last I reached the far edge of the world , where a forest clothed its last and most awful of precipices , the trees clinging to which had been turned to stone . The light of the forest was cold as stone is cold , and of a gray such as the sky in its mercy never makes known to men . It was the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch which , even as it bent before the blast , had been turned to stone , was a bird . It sang , and I knew it for the soul of the singer whose voice , my mother said , had made women weep . I , too , must soon take my place upon those granite boughs . Would it he granted to me once and again in the empty months to sing ? Probably not . I had not consciously added to the flood of women 's tears . But even now the precious moments of my freedom were slipping by me in selfish speculation . I looked wildly about me , and there , casting anchor on the sea at the mountain 's inner rim , was the ship . Into an opening in her bow , I slipped all that was left me of what I had brought ? a pair of waterproofed shoes . Seeing those , would my child know that I had done what I could ? At least she would be spared the sight of my face . Perhaps when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow together . But now I was grateful that she would never have to see me as I was . You must eat . II See , I have here the lamb chop which you yourself askedfor . Nothing can cure you but eating . Why , then , will you not eat ? ' I looked at my nurse in amazement , and then realized that the muddy red sign had slipped from her forehead . In her human stupidity she had asked the question , for her power to read my thoughts was for the moment gone . It was a Iamb chop which she offered me . How could I , who had kneaded the sacrificial bread , eat of the symbol which the world 's Saviour had made his own ? I refused to cat . Some fish , then ? ' Did the woman 's blasphemy know no bounds ? They were the reincarnation of the crew of that phantom ship ? evil spirits whom I had sunk , but not annihilated . Eat them , and by coalescing their spirits with mine , weaken my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power for evil ? It was unthinkable . At the end of countless repetitions of her foolish formula : ' If you eat , you will get well , ' she took the temptation from me , saying reproachfully , ' You can not realize , perhaps , that for an hour and a half , three times each day , I stand here by your side , trying in the only way we know to make you well ? through food . You are making it hard , not only for me but for the maids in the kitchen , who are not through with their work till your tray returns . ' I took a spoonful of the fruit in great haste . That amount of poison I could , no doubt , assimilate . I was sorry for her when she was human and tired , and for the maids . It did seem strange , 1101101.10r , that all my food could be poisoned without their cooperation . That night , my daughter came to nie . It was very cold , and the windows , heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one beside my nurse . Instantly I felt the sudden current of cold air that always warned me of danger . The nurse turned on her cot in the corner . I saw my child change before my eyes into a big black slimy creature , with a broad flat head . She passed round and round the cot of my nurse in ever-narrowing curves , and front her body fell glistening ropes that lay on the bed like taut drawn snakes , holding my nurse fast in unconsciousness . Then , from the window , she drew in her coils a boat of curving prow and stern , lined with soft white fur , its rails filagreed in silver . ' I have come to fetch you , mother , ' she said , and her clear young voice never faltered . ' You never cry , mother . Your eyes arc too hard and bright . You must plunge into the sea . Do n't shrink away like that , mother . It is cold , but see the fur in my boat . I thought even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be soft with water that will look like tears . 0 mother , ' ? her poor voice broke pitifully , she was my child again , ? ' tell me quick ? you are not afraid ? ' ' I can not cry , child , ' I said . ' My eyes are parched with pain . ' But all she answered wag , ' Are you coming , mother ? ' I sprang from my bed . Of course I was going where she went . My nurse clutched me as I fell . She had been sleeping with the eye that her evil spirit controlled toward me . So I had failed . The night wore on . I could not sleep . I was watching the window . Over and over again in my mind was tossed the ugly doubt : did my child think that it was fear which had held use back ? Poor little soul , she despised fear so cruelly . And I had n't been really afraid at all , only inexplicably slow . ' Why did you try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have not strength to take safely one step unsupported ? If you should fall , before I could reach you , you might break your hip . ' My nurse 's tones were insistent with worry . Because she had been asleep , it was obvious that she had not been able to read my mind . The advantage was mine . I would not yield it . So I turned my face to the wall . ' If you have any wish , you have only to mention it , ' she continued more kindly . That is your husband 's order . Of course , you do not realize that I ant on double duty now , because nurses are so scarce on account of the influenza . I am doing my best . Usually , when you stir , I waken ; but last night , on account of the awful storm , I found it hard to go to sleep at first . I was glad to see that you were sleeping peacefully . ' ' I did not want to waken you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long have you been nursing ? ' And she answered as clearly and distinctly as before : ' Since the Middle Ages I have been in his service . Four hundred and twenty-one years it is that I have worked for him . Nurses have ever been the handmaidens most favored of the devil , the instruments best adapted to work the more subtle of his purposes . ' ' Wo n't you come to my bedside ? ' I asked . While she was honest , I need not be afraid of her . ' Yet your eyes , ' ? I looked long and questioningly into them but without understanding , ? ' your eyes are as blue as God 's own skies . But your face ? it is so strange that they did not more cleverly blend your face and his . That upward curve on your cheek is so blatantly characteristic , is n't it ? One gets so tired of seeing it on the stage . That was why I liked that last Mephistopheles I saw . He was in that haunting shade of faun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits ? ' I shut my lips firmly . Ignorance was never power ; it behooved me to guard her ignorance . - ' And yet you can talk so logically , ' was all she said . The petty logic of everyday life , of course , I thought impatiently ; but when it came to an understanding of the deeper problems of life , I was becoming more and more hopelessly incompetent . If only in my wanderings I might run across Royce . He Would n't be like Seneca and Epictetus , and even Marcus Aurelius , who never looked up , only drew closer together beneath the pale shadows of the aspen trees when I passed by . He must surely remember me . Besides , he was the only one that James had thought really believed in his own philosophical theories , even in summer . ' Even in summer . ' Professor James had told me so himself . And it was cold now ; it was n't summer , it was winter , and he would be spared the extreme test . So Royce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me just to be comforting his doubts with the wealth of Words that his imagination loved . If only I had not been too young and timid to insist on his telling me just what it was that he actually could call true ! It might help me now , it might , it might ? And yet , an immortality that was not of time . What could that mean , anyway ? And the ditty-nit-sick ? one must n't talk German any more ; that , at least , was true . Across my misgivings , broke a clear voice , sweet as the honey that orange-blossoms yield . ' It is I , mother . Ask what you will . Only this time you must be quick , mother , quick ! ' ' Teach me something , child , ' I faltered , ' something ? ' 0 mother , mother , you have lost me ! You should have asked for something to cat . I have brought the apple with me . And now you can not even look on it . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that night When the moon had dropped from out the sky and was hanging just above the cypresses ? ' ' But how can you remember that when you were not there ? ' I questioned her . ' I missed you so ! And coming up the coast , when I he ship lurched and the oranges dropped in showers front the trees in her hold , I used to wait for you to come running to pick hem up . But you never came . The air in the hold was close and sweet . ' Would you like t he windows opened , madam ? The room seems fresh to me . ' The child was gone , and that cloying odor of exquisite sweetness under a dewy night l-its gone with her . That night she returned again , but not to me . Though I pressed my head against the door beside my bed , the door that opened into the superintendent 's room , and though I stopped breathing that . I might hear , I caught only the sound of gold and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . At last their voices rose : ' I have given you all that I have , and yet you will not tell me what to do . Everything is so strange , so different here ; but you ' ve seen so many people die , sonic of them must have come back to tell you all about it . They have , have n't : they ? And you ' II tell me all you know ? ' The child 's voice dropped to a caressing cuddling tone . ' What have I done already ? Why , I have been to see mother , of course . Poor mother , she is so serious , she wants to know what no one ever knows . I 'd have more gold to give you if this is n't enough , only ? ' Well , you see , I could n't help it . He was walking without legs , and he had medals on his breast . I 'm afraid he was a German . Oh , do n't look at me like that ! I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ou think that is why I 've lost the way ? to punish me , I mean ; and so I ca n't get back to mother ? ' You know , and you ' ve got to tell me . If you do n't , make you wish you had : I 'll choose to change into you ! You think I can't. ? But that is what we do here all the time . Everybody changes into everybody else , and people get so diluted and thin and queer , that they do n't know themselves . That is the way it will be with you . Only I wo n't let you be cruel , then , and I 'll know what you know ? the way to mother . ' Do n't worry about me , dear , ' I cried as loudly as I could . ' But tell me , is it a moral as well as a physical confusion ? ' ' How did you know , mother ? ' she questioned eagerly . ' That is just the trouble . This hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is no where , and where the - when is not . Oh , why did men dream such foolish dreams about reality ? because , what man , dreaming , wills , that becomes reality itself . ' It is awful , mother . We are always bumping into each other , and we never know ourselves at that . Oh , that 's our house I smell burning ! And father ? mother ! mother ! ' The child 's voice rose to a shriek of more than mortal terror . She snatched me up , and we flew together down the wind toward that long white line of smoke . Her father lay on the narrow couch he always loved . The cool white sheet was folded close about his neck , the blankets turned back about his hips . One of the blankets had a tear in it . The flames entered the room , first in one corner and then in another . The smile deepened on his dear face . But even as I stood in an agony of helplessness , the flames fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Of course I would not , when they were thick with gluey poison . Poison and quicksilver ? how could the devil expect to catch me by such childish tricks as these ! ' C ' est. a rim , ' I murmured wearily . You will not drink , you will not cat . What shall I do ? Can you suggest anything that you would eat or drink ? ' An egg , ' I said at last , ' boiled four minutes . And please be sure that it is brought to or in the shell , unbroken . ' In ten minutes , by my wrist watch , it was brought to me . I broke it . The yolk was lying against one side of the shell . In that short time the devil had acted . I did not explain my refusal to eat the tainted thing . Of course not . She could read , when her attention was focused upon me , my most fleeting thought . In the night , I awoke . I was alone , alive , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone was pressing a warm cup against my lips . I took it . I had to ; for in me alone remained the source of life of all the generations of men still waiting to be born . The bitter edge of the cold blunted . I began in trembling haste to pick up those scattered bones , and to arrange them one by one in the decent pattern they had had before their coffins had rotted away . It was getting bleaker and colder , but the light was changing . Suddenly I saw my nurse . She looked so frail , and yet so pretty , in her flimsy night-robe . Have you anything on your feet ? ' asked quite crossly ; for I could riot but be anxious about her . She breathed a sigh of relief as I drained the last drop , and for answer pattered off to bed . I spent the rest of the night on whirling spheres , and found each sphere a life nearer to the perfect life , a sphere nearer to the perfect sphere . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfection . A voice broke over me : ' You have failed and yet you have not failed . It was written that they should sacrifice a mother , too . ' But I was too poor and weak to choose , ' I faltered . There is no choice , ' was the sad answer . ' Of the primary atom you were the only direct living descendant . The time had come . You have never failed to struggle ; that was all that we could expect or demand . ' And now ? ' " The world which you know is in ruins behind you . ' And yet ? ' I strained my eyes into the dark distance . Gradually , far below me 1 made out a long slide of white thrown across the confusion . All that science has taught men has been swallowed in the abyss of their cruelty , of their barbarity . ' The voice became almost a wail . And that which you see is the only attempt at antisepsis which it has occurred to their bewildered minds to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Of a sudden , the barrenness was swarming with swarthy , leering black men . In their midst a father was trying to cover with his own body his son . But that is hell , ' I gasped . The hell that your rarefied New England atmosphere has never suffered you to consider except as an intellectual absurdity , an age-worn bugaboo for children and simpletons . But here you see it in all its loathsome crudity . Curious it is that , in spite of your idealism , you have never properly evaluated the creative power of fear , the ? ' " They 're pinching the child ! ' I shrieked . ' Why should n't they ? ' he demanded . Your world destroyed , there is nothing else for them to do . ' I woke to hear an infant crying . The nurse said that a nice lusty little fellow had just been born . I thought of my child in the hold of that ship of iniquity , and stifled a groan . If he disturbs you ? ' I was wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had need of mothers now . Just why , I could not seem to remember . Oh , yes , it was the war , and France 's decadent mother-spirit that was not responding to the strain . Iv The nest morning I wondered why it was that , on waking , I could not always remember what I had agonized over the day before . And if I could not remember , was it really worth the agon-izing ? This , in spite of what they tell me was the curiously precise logic of my conversation , was , I believe , my first rational drought , the opening wedge that forced the gate of the barrier . I tried to turn over . I hunted for my body , and when I found it , it was nothing but a shell , with fold on fold of burning flesh clinging to it . I tried to crawl into it , but first -I had to tear away the flesh . I could not find the shell . Yet there was nowhere else that I could go ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light was very dim . In one awful moment I knew why . A monstrous black bird was covering it . His eyes were white as hot iron is white , they were brilliant as sun striking on ice , yet they were cut like diamonds , and sparkled maliciously as he turned his heavy head from side to side . In his claws he held a bird whose breast was as blue as the sea , whose wings were as white as its foam . His hooked beak plunged into the tender flesh , his black head was hidden in the drift of feathers falling from her breast . And the feathers were all red with blood . I struggledimpotently . He looked at me and jabbed again . It is nothing , I do not mind ? ' It was my child 's voice I heard , in stifled agony . If only mother need not know ! She is sick , she is dying ? ' I lay as one paralyzed , frozen with horror . If I moved , he would murder her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , with body all relaxed , inviting the attack . He fixed his blinding eyes on me , made as if to launch himself , and then I saw her fall across his pathWay , and heard her cry : ? ' I an young . You shall stay with me . She is ? mother ! ' Was it only my own shriek I heard ? I was staggering across the floor . You have had an unusually good night 's sleep . You have not moaned at all . See , I have fixed the grape-fruit a new tray this morning . If you eat , you will get well , you know . And you will eat ? You must not forget that es-cry day I have to write clown exactly what you have eaten . You really can not imagine how eagerly your husband hopes each day ? ' I will try , ' I said , ' though why I should have the luxury of grape-fruit at this season of the year , when they are starving in Europe , I do not understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said kindly . ' Only eat . That is all you have to do . ' I took the grape-fruit , determined by the broken cells the two sections in which my medicine was hidden , and then courageously ate all but that . Only the day before I had caught on the arm of the chair in which my husband had sat a glimmering of that hateful red symbol of evil . Somehow they must have succeeded in corrupting his staunch integrity . And so I could n't take his medicine . I did n't mind starving my body , of course , if I could save my soul . When I awoke , I was really afraid to breathe . I ordered my nurse to rush for sheets and to stuff them against the cracks beneath the doors . Yet she hesiated when I insisted peremptorily on her throwing wide open the windows . ' It is very cold outside , ' she said , ' but I am going to do what you ask . Please do n't make me do things that are either too dangerous or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not foolish , ' I answered , not stopping , of course , to go into needless explanations . She knew as well as I that the night before , my poor husband in desperation had transmuted his spirit 's essence into a marvelous white light , which in brilliancy had exceeded his extreme calculations , but in curative power had not only failed utterly , but had been followed by a poisonous gas . It was strange that he had not realized that the forces of evil would of necessity rush into the vacuum created by the defeat of the positive forces of good . On the window-ledges were standing pools of queerly colored snow that was not snow at all , but the chemical which , through its constant evaporation , was filling the room with floating discs of poisonous matter . I tried accurately to gauge the curious of air . Close to the southeastern window , where the air seemed to be moving most rapidly , I had her place my chair . Her eyes were so very blue . I told her so . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she smiled cheerily , ' will you ? What shall it be ? ' I could only turn my head away sadly , even bitterly . Her hypocrisy was so commonplace , so crude . From the well of the centuries she had drawn no subtlety ; yet in experience she had found a superficial sort of sympathy . And the conscientious attention she gave me night and day was duty well clone , if only it were not done in the service of such a master ! My thoughts were rudely diverted by the sounds which I dreaded above all others to hear . They told me that my husband and , perhaps , my daughter were yet once again undergoing the tortures that , bravely borne , suffered them to come before me . I could hear the wild singing of the screws , the creak of the steel ropes , the heavy descent of the wailers that crushed and crushed yet once again their outstretched bodies . For the first time , I heard them force my husband to complain . He was growing older with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might hear him . ' I can ? not . ' Had he failed of strength to say the ' not ' ? Had I imagined it ? The rollers began to rise And then the door opened and they stood before me , rosy-checked , slapping off the snow . But the ice of torture that had bound their spirits no human warmth could melt . Their eyes told me that . ' You never saw anything like it , mother ! It 's up to your neck , and such fun ! The oldest inhabitant and that is old Doctor ? Why , mother , what is the matter ? Do you - want something ? ' Held close in a chair of cunningly wrought silver , I IN-as rising as gently as if in a dream toward a sky veiled in shining light . Behind me , another day was breaking for mortals , and the low hills glowed purple against crimson clouds . I floated higher . Below them stretched the sea , its foam shimmering like stars fallen from a brightening sky . A marvelous sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very truth , I stood free , alone in the presence of a beauty which through its impersonality , could know no cruelty , could be neither vicious nor false . And then , in a flash , I saw my loved ones , and they were searching for me . Yet where I had gone , they would not know ; where I was , they could not foliose , not though they strained their eyes to blindness , and emptied their hearts with grief . From the marvelous glory above me I turned my eyes . I dropped through the waiting air . With infinite anguish I again took possession of my body . It was dead . And then , upon the pane of the window that . looked out upon the hills I had seen against the dawn , I watched in bitter sorrow , but not in indecision , the bright bubble of silver that was my chair grow smaller and smaller , until the moments for its recall by the exercise of my will , of my desire , had passed , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see when the light was willing . V Because of the indisputable evidence which was accumulating from day to day as to the poisoning of my food , I , of course , found it more and more necessary to refrain from both food and drink . In this , I found my determination lamentably weak . The parched condition of my mouth seas so insistently disagreeable , that I yielded too often to the pleading in the sweet blue eyes of my nurse ; I permitted myself to be beguiled by the clarity of her arguments . When these failed her , she would turn to me and say very slowly , very distinctly , If you care for your husband , you will eat . ' This argument . unnerved use sometimes , but not always . I grew rather more and more easily to see through its wicked speciousness . My husband and daughter stood in the door . Striding into the room , my husband gathered me into his arms . They had come to take me home ! But my nurse scar to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , myself . Thee insisted on dressing me , and she scent with me . She ( lid not stay over the night , however . At last they realized t he profound antagonism between us , which militated against any hope of my-ultimate victory . The drive home was frightful ? not because of physical discomfort , though my hones seemed to puncture my skin as the automobile jounced through the snowdrifts , but rather because of the way in which the inner secrets of men 's minds , the hisser significance of nature , were revealed to me . We passed some young women at a crossing . I heard the very disparaging remarks which they made as to my nurse 's past , although I could see from the passivity of her face that she remained in agreeable ignorance of them . ' Hi , there , you 've done your work well , you have ! ' some teamsters yelled . She ignored their remarks so creditably , that I was again quite sure that she had not heard them . At the station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the most unfortunate incident in an unfortunate ride . It enabled a number of homeless , but pettily malignant spirits from the city to fitsten themselves upon our can I fought against their entrance into my home and into my room , and finally lost them through ignoring them in the stress of more important struggles . As my silver chair had left its impress upon my window , so they left the scars of their presence on the framework of the doors of our car . At home , I found the field of conflict broadened . The entire daily life of my husband , and more especially of my daughter , centred for good or ill upon the strength of my faith , the power of my will . When , for example , my husband scent for the mail , there was a certain shadowy bend in the road where evil spirits lay in wait for him . They hid in the body of a dog , in the trunk of a tree , in the heart of a hillock ; and %%then they felt him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my faith in denying their power to injure him , he returned to me in safety day after day , his hand at the steering-wheel of his car held true in spite of their malevolence . ' Fite fact that in my constant companionship my family lost the ability to read my thoughts at critical moments , greatly increased the difficulty of my Position . My daughter would start down to the barn for her saddle-horse . Of course , I at once took up my station at an open door . With fixed gone , with set attention , I watched her safely past the straying forms that lurked among the trees , down to the stable door . Eagerly I looked for the first sight of her horse as she opened the door that led directly into his stall ? eagerly but not in doubt . Though he died in the early morning hours , yet , praying for the return of his spirit , I had never failed to be rewarded by those sounds of life which close in so abruptly upon the silence made by death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , that his spirit would not leave him until another morning . But the moment that my daughter entered into the shadowy stall , beside the white figure of her horse I saw her wrapped in a garment of glistening white . I saw it dissolve into waves of light . And I knew that the last wave would sweep her forever beyond my reach . At the instant of its passing , it was vouchsafed to me , through an agony of willing , to bring her back to the earthly body that rode forth so jauntily , quite as if no miracle of reincarnation had supervened . ' You can not sit in that open door . You will get your death of cold . ' My poor , poor husband ! In the evening , and especially during the small hours of the night , my faith was at its lowest ebb , my struggles were sorest because most despairing . Just before daylight , the air became so crowded with all sorts and conditions of spirits , that the confusion of the conflict was maddening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to follow the struggle , when the air grew slimmer and thinner , and the spirits began to fade away like ghosts , I would hear my husband walking about the room , would see him flashing his light into its farthest corners , would catch , as from a great distance , the sound of his gentle voice bidding me watch how easily he could make the shadows shift . But in the end I would feel so sorry for him , so cruel in my forced negligence of his patient effort , that I would open my- eyes . Then , because of the look in his eyes , he would seem to me to belong for an appreciable time to the world beyond the barrier , and in his strength to be about to dominate its wickedness . But soon upon my attention would be focused the room in which he moved . It was without sub ; stance or depth , flat and empty as a house of cards . Just as my body had no feeling , so it had no meaning . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room moved , too , flauntbig their grotesque shapes quite shamelessly around him . He called them shadows . Ile said that the chairs and the tables were casting them . One day , I was lying on my couch , feverishly studying on my wall the diagrams of the world 1 had known , pondering the full fatality of the interlocking of the two lower spheres . For this partial union , this interaction of planets and of lives , I was responsible . A mortal , I had walked among spirits . My world was trying to cast me forth , in fear of my knowledge . Their world was locked with it in the refusal to receive me . Homeless , a wanderer between worlds for all eternity , I raised my eyes in desperation . Across my room I suddenly saw wafted the most intricate insignia of the Roman Cat holic Church ? the replica in silver and gold and age-old ivory of the designs which I had seen on vestment and on altar-cloth , in marble on mosaic floors , in wrought iron on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisitely scented than those which had soothed my doubts , bad stimulated my imagination on her feast-days . Closing my eyes , I heard her choirs chant , resistlessly because monotonously , their voices blending and swelling for the drowning of my questionings . But I was born of Puritan stock ; I had been trained in metaphysic . Their subtleties , their crudities , their emotional artistry , their superstitions , made as little fundamental impression upon me as did their flaming gold , their purple that was crimson as their pride . And so , in discouragement , the care of my soul was entrusted to lesser , meaner souls . Instead of twisted gold and frosted silver , of carved and stained ivory , of leather tooled in gold , the mystic symbols of the Church accepted for their fashioning straw clumsily braided by peasant hands . They came to me , not on clouds of sweet incense , but among the wet clinging fumes of suds which , for spirits of such low estate as these , must serve for godliness . Sometimes the fumes were soggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as theirs had been . Instead of chanting , I heard voices that were toil-worn and thin , yet honest and earnest withal . I failed them both . The sadness in the Pope 's voice made me realize the depths of human experience which he must have sounded in his prison of the Vatican , although all that he said was , We have clone what we could . ' The others simply frittered away their lesser powers of concentration , too easily discouraged even to recognize defeat . But I was grateful for their willingness to help me . The road which my soul must travel was not theirs , that was all . Around me the old legends now began to weave their spells . I was sitting alone in the library . The house was strangely still . In a panic of horror , I realized that I was forever shut off from the living . Perhaps , once in a hundred years , some traveler , sensitive to suggestion , would be permitted to come upon my home and me , sitting , as now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body , but not lifeless because living in a world of sinister shades , of menacing shadows . There was a sudden sharp sound . It was the wind blowing a broken shutter loose from the clutches of overgrown ivy . The house , as a matter of fact , had no shutters . The next day I remarked that , examined with pride my luxuriant but carefully pruned ivy , and welcomed effusively a delivery man whom I chanced to meet coming up our walk . I smiled when I saw his apparent pleasure . I laughed when I thought that he was the traveler permitted to discover my haunted house at the and of a hundred ? or was it a thousand ? dead years . At last , one day , I suddenly found myself standing as it were without the confines of my own mind , , and watching in quiet happiness a complete shifting of its scenes . And yet , that is not what I saw . Among the mountains I have watched dark shadows chase across their valleys , and , disappearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with me . I saw the shadows pass . I turned my face to the wall where had been the diagram of my clashing worlds  --  for I was lying on my couch . There were only a few imperfections on its surface ! Gone from out my life was the bitter tragedy of those vanished spheres . Ah , no , it had never been . I looked at my hands . They were white and thin ; they were n't disfigured at all . And all that curious pattern that malicious spirits had pricked upon them when I was weak and cowardly ? it was absurd . Or , rather , it was pellagra ! If only I could have known what pellagra was ! If only I might have had something comfortable and understandable , like typhoid fever ! I ran to a window . In the sunshine the sea was breaking and the wings of white gulls were flashing above its foam . Among the woods that rimmed the blue inlet of its waters , where , in the late winter , on a white glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ages had mocked me with the mystery of their presence , the shadows of tall trees were lying soft upon the grass . The dead had been but the deeper shadows that the light had cast . Beneath my windows , in my garden , the wallflowers had survived the winter , my sturdy pansies were blossoming in the friendly shade of cool gray walls , and tulips were spreading their glowing cups to the sun . The birds were twittering in the lilac hedges . In the stable I heard the impatient whinny of a hungry horse and my daughter 's cheery answering call . I Was home again !
