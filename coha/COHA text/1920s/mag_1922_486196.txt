T O judge from the size and contents of the volume of " American Book Prices Current " for 1921 , just issued by Dutton and Company , there would seem to be as little likelihood of an end to the collecting of books as there is to the making of them . Indeed , book-collecting has taken on a new lease of life in these days of ampler means for indulging in the more agreeable exercitations of the human spirit . Bibliomama is on the increase , however , not because of a more widespread compulsion of the passion , but because of a method imparted to the madness by commercialism . Its symptoms , so far from indicating a pathological condition in the victim , are accepted as the signs of sanity in a fresh enterprise . There are now no amateurs , for all are connoisseurs . The bibliophile of a generation ago is the bibliopole of today , and the book-lover has disappeared in the book-seller Hence the eager interest in book prices , and hence also the necessity for such a record for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this record precipitates some interesting conclusions which deserve the attention of the cognoscenti : ( 1 ) The rare books of the Elizabethan writers are increasing in price to an astonishing degree . The first editions of the two volumes of Spenser 's " Faerie Queene " ( 1590-96 ) which , twenty years ago , sold at auction for $375 , brought last year $1,200 . Ten years ago the same author 's " Cohn Clouts Come Home Again " ( 1595 ) sold for $50 ; last year it fetched $300 . In 1910 a copy of Shakespeare 's " Poems " ( 1640 ) brought $530 ; last year a copy realized $3,000. ( 2 ) The first editions of the works of Dickens and Thackeray are still in great demand , especially those issued in the monthly parts and the rarer small volumesnot generally read . " Pickwick Papers " ( 1836 ) , in the original parts , sold for $2,800 , and " Vanity Fair " ( 1848 ) , also in the original parts , brought $750 . Thackeray 's " King Glumpus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon " ( 1841 ) at $910 , and his " The Snob " ( 1829 ) at $1,575 point to the lengths to which speculators will go . ( 3 ) Rare Americana are increasing in prices , as are also the accounts of the early voyagers and travelers . Hakluyt 's " Divers Voyages " ( 1582 ) , lacking one of the maps , realized $4,350 , and Linschoten 's " Discours of Voyages " ( 1598 ) brought $500 . Twenty years ago the former could have been bought for $1,000 and the latter for $50 . A fresh interest is being evinced in the books and pamphlets relating to the settlement and foundation of the different States of the Union . New England , however , is still in the lead , but California and Oregon are coming to the front . Penhallow 's " History of the Wars of New England " ( 1726 ) , a little octavo volume of 138 pages , which Henry Stevens , the Green Mountain Boy , sold for fifteen guineas a generation ago , found a purchaser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fruits " ( 1643 ) , which the same bookseller catalogued for $17.50 , brought last year $435 , a stained copy at that , and lacking the leaf of " errata. " ( 4 ) Books printed in England in the first quarter of the nineteenth century with the colored illustrations by the macaronic artists of the day have greatly increased in price , as have also the " Sporting Books " of the same period with colored plates by Alken. ( 5 ) " Association " books have gone up enormously in prices . A first edition , rare in itself , will bring ten and twenty times its regular price if it is a presentation copy from the author or is in any way associated with him or with some famous writer or personality . The present record of auction prices affords some interesting comparisons in this respect . A first edition of Dickens 's " American Notes " sold for $16 , but an inscribed presentation copy to C. C. Felton sold for $700 . " Bleak House , " in the original parts , sold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A copy of " Hard Times " presented by Dickens to Frank Stone brought $650 , and a " Martin Chuzzlewit , " worth about $20 in its ordinary form , realized $500 in the presentation copy to Thomas Chapman . The half-bound copy of " Vanity Fair , " worth about $15 without Dickens 's book-plate and his letter , found a purchaser at $1,550 because it contained the book-plate and letter . ( 6 ) A remarkable competition for the first editions of the books by modern writers , both English and American . This , no doubt , is due to a reaction from the difficulty experienced in obtaining the rarities of past generations . It is thus that the collector and trader open up fresh fields for their diversion and profitable enterprise . Joseph Conrad 's " Chance , " published in 1913 for $1.50 , sold last year for $97.50 , and his " The Nigger of the Narcissus " ( 1898 ) for $55 . Dreiser 's " Sister Carrie , " a dollar and a half novel of 1906 , is now worth $55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed for him in 1915 , entitled " The Oxen , " brought $100 , and the Lovell 's Library edition of his " Romantic Adventures of a Milkmaid , " published in New York in 1883 for 25 cents , sold for $40 . George Moore 's " Memoirs of My Dead Life , " published in 1906 for $1.50 , sold for $47.50 in 1921 . And the tale of such prices is not yet told , for since the occurrence of these sales the prices of these books have gone up still further . Whether these prices will be maintained or not is a question for the next generation to answer , but during the coming few years they are certain to increase . Apart from these tendencies , a few unusual prices recorded in this volume deserve special attention . The possessor of a copy of B. F. Kendall 's " Doleful Tragedy of the Raising of Jo Burnham , " printed at Woodstock , Vt. , in 1832 , will be glad to learn that this little book sold for $301 , and that a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Printer , " also printed at Woodstock , Vt. , but in 1836 , is also worth $301 . Thomas Jefferson 's " Appendix to the Notes of Virginia relative to the Murder of Logan 's Family , " printed at Philadelphia in 1800 , sold for $380 . Thirty-six numbers of the " California Star , " issued in 1847-8 , brought $400 . A copy of Surtees 's " Analysis of the Hunting Field " ( 1846 ) brought the high price of $415 . The original manuscript of Byron 's " Sardanapalus , " consisting of 12 pages quarto and 1441/2 pages folio , sold for $3,300 , but the original manuscripts of the five long De Morgan novels , consisting of 4,439 sheets , brought only $1,675 . Poe 's manuscript of " Annabel Lee " of two pages sold for $1,200 , and the complete manuscript of Holmes 's " The Professor at the Breakfast Table " for $2,300 . TEMPLE SCOTT The Quality of Mercy Neighbors Henceforth . By Owen Wister . The Macmillan Company . $2 . T HIS is the last volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the glorious and sloppy idealism generated by the war should still keep its plumage even if we have to glue the feathers to the eagle 's back . A grand finale to " The Pentecost of Calamity " and " A Straight Deal , " it outcreels Creel in making the world safe for Hun-haters and pleasant old gentlemen who dislike having their breakfasts spoiled by distressing accounts that persist in finding their way into the morning newspapers . It is depressing and amusing . Between the first and second parts of the book the curtain is run down for the space of two years . Shortly after the war was over , Mr. Wister hit the trail " In the Footsteps of the Hun , " went here and there like Diogenes trying , however , not so much to find an honest man as any man who would give him a piece of silver remnant with which to line his dark cloud . And he found them , a Tommy here , a Doughboy there , a Poilu in a third place , a major , a peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to make the loveliest of quilts to cover the nakedness of ten thousand lies . He found a " malign , putrescent Germany , " a land teeming with men whom , to quote a sailor acquaintance of Mr. Wister 's , " we just looks at like scum or vomit or some other narsty mess to be swabbed up . " That does not prevent him from sentimentalizing before the cathedral of Amiens about the glorious virtue of Pity . " Pity has come into the world and has grown great . " Of course , that has no reference to your enemy , for we must first make sure that " when she is up she will not promptly knock us all down again . " The quality of mercy must not be strained . There is one chapter , By Their Fruits , which should be reprinted in the textbooks of the nation 's schools . It is a masterpiece of how to quote Scripture with the devil , that process handled so inartistically by our propagandists during the war , but here at last managed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tacitus , Goethe , Heine , Schopenhauer , and others to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Germans are as scoundrelly a collection of liars and cheats as you could wish to find . It is a remarkable chapter , but the one entitled Uplift takes the prize . In the mouth of a whey-face hypocrite Mr. Wister puts some of the most heartfelt ideals of a broken humanity . For instance this : " Then you are quite against universal disarmament ? " asks the Uplifter . " Universal ? " rejoins Mr. Wister . " How do you know that everybody will come into that game , or keep the rules of the game if they do come in . . . . There are compensations for war . War makes more men than it kills . " " Do you not think we should forgive our enemies , " asks the Uplifter . " We are , " replies Mr. Wister . " I do n't , however , remember that we 're anywhere told to forgive other people 's enemies . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less gracious , a little sadder , a little more doubtful of a new heaven and a new earth . He lays the blame  --  and not without considerable truth  --  on the makers of the treaty . He even wishes that " Mr. Wilson had not kept us out of the league of nations " ( sic ) . But when he accuses the Germans of falsification in refusing to pay their indemnity , one feels like turning wearily to the financial page of any newspaper , reminding Mr. Wisterthat even his denunciation will not make the mark behave as a Christian piece of exchange should behave , even for France . Mr. Wister is thoroughly disgusted with the English workingmen . " Every one in England seemed to be hard at work except the laboring classes whose aim , apparently , was to make a second Russia out of Great Britain . " A consummation hardly to be wished , although we know of other classes who are not perishing from overwork . One thing Mr. Wister is certain of , that the war ended too soon . Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid her prone we foolishly forebore to deliver . We did not bring her to her knees , devastate some of her territory just to show her how it feels , and so we are faced today with a Germany unrepentant , a Germany seeking only to right herself when the time is ripe . But as far as we had the privilege of going into the war we did our bit gloriously , and Mr. Wister finds no little consolation in the fact that we can boast of four cemeteries in France . Britain has thirty-three hundred ; " but we have four . " Watchman , what then of the night ? " To believe that wars will ever wholly cease while man is here is hard ; but if that is to be war , if nothing but more means for destruction have been learned . . . then may annihilation be complete . " Mr. Wister wraps the mantle of Elijah about him and grows rhapsodical , prophetic . " War and peace are merely different processes of self-preservation , different means by which nations control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But for goodness ' sake , if we fight let us fight like men and not like creatures even worse than animals , " polluting streams , felling forests , despoiling the caves of the planet of their coal and gold . " Otherwise , says Mr. Wister with a sigh of resignation , " Better a world without men , if that is to be the end . "
