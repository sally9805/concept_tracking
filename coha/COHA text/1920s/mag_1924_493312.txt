EVERYONE now realizes the folly of waiting a year after a now Congress has been elected before seating its members , and permitting the old one to reassemble and pass legislation during the interim . It is equally agreed that the new President ought to be inaugurated as s0011 as possible after the election at which he was chosen . Senator Nor ? a has proposed a constitutional amendment which would bring the new Congress into existence in Jan ? uary , and inaugurate the President in the same month . But there are other questions in connection with the Presidency , of which much was heard dur ? ing the late campaign . If there were no majority in the Electoral College , and the House and Senate should fail ? as they easily might ? to elect a Presi ? dent or Vice-President , what happens next ? And what should we do if a President-elect were to die between the election and the meeting of the Elec ? toral College ? Or between the meeting of the Col ? lege and the counting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expire automat ? ically on March 4 , and would this prevent the suc ? cession of the Secretary of State , the Secretary of the Treasury , etc. , in case no President had been tlected ? These are all matters as to which existing law makes no provision ; and clearly , such possible emergencies ought to be taken into account- Rep ? resentative John L. Cable , of Ohio , has introduced a joint resolution providing for a Constitutional Amendment Commission of nine members , three to be appointed from the House , three from the Sen ? ate and three by the President , to draw up pro ? posals for needed legislation . Such a commission we regard as highly desirable ; and in view of the necessarily slow process of reform , the sooner it is created and goes to work , the better . ' pm Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating the charge , made in an editorial printed by the Hearst newspapers , that acceptance of the Under ? wood proposal for leasing Muscle Shoals to private individuals would saddle on the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wekome the in ? vestigation , as we do every proceeding which will throw more light on the barefaced attempt which is being made to give away to private interests gov ? ernment property worth hundreds of millions of dollars and an almost inconceivable degree of con ? trol over the destinies of the South through this im ? portant sourer of her future hydroelectric power , The Ford offer was about as bad , from the govern ? ment 's point of view , as could be imagined ; but the terms of the Underwood bill arc little better , if they are not indeed sooner . Property worth $150 , ? 0 ( 10,000 would he turned over to private interests if the latter would pay tour percent annually on the investment in the Wilson Dam , which is about one-third that sum . The alleged reason for this one paralleled gift is that the lessee would seek to de ? velop new and cheaper methods of producing nitrates from the air , so tint an industry - can be built - up which will ' compete successfagy with Chilean nitrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Germany apparently knows the secret . It is just as reasonable , however , to suppose that government chemists would develop the neces ? sary new processes . The extraordinary haste with which , both at the time of the Ford offer and now , members of Congress have sought to rush through laws giving away Muscle Shoals , is painfid to con ? template . Senators Wadsworth and Jones have both urged that final decision be postponed until a careful survey can be made and the facts deters 10.1 THE NEW mined . Nearly a year ago the New Republic urged that this be done ; and it remains as desirable today as it was then . AS we go to press , the bill providing for an in ? crease in postal employes ' pay seems likely to be repassed over the President 's veto . If it is , it will add to the department 's expense an item of $63 , - 000,000 a year ; and in order to meet this , Post ? master General New has prepared a bill which would increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surplus of $80 , - 000,000 a year , according to the department , would not be increased , except that postal cards would he sold for one and a half cents each . On second-class matter , newspapers and magazines , which now causes a deficit of $74,000,000 , there is an increase . of $10,000,000 . The rate on editorial contents ( scientific , agricultural , religious and fraternal pa ? pers being turnips ) would be increased from one and a half to two cents a pound . The rate on ad- vertising /natter would be increased in the first , sec ? ond and third zones by two cents a pound and in the fourth , fifth and sixth zones by one cent . in- creases would also be made in third-class mail , $18 , - 000,000 , and parcels post , $12,000,000 . If the postmaster 's figur are correct , the increased cost to periodicals will es still leave them enjoying a gov ernment subsidy of $64,000,000 a year , which would seem large enough to satisfy anybody not in- ordinately greedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing subsidy by ono- seventh will be met by an almost universal roar of pretest from publishers , who will fight it as they have fought every similar suggestion in the past . AT last we are beginning to get authentic informa ? tion as to the state of Gen-flan finances . According to our Trade Commissioner at Berlin , Mr. Douglas Miller , the receipts for the fiscal half year ending-September 30 show a surplus of 149,000,00 ( 1 gold marks . The total revenues for the half year amounted to 3,494,000,000 gold marks ; for the year they are likely to exceed six billions . These are large figures , and arc calculated to stir Ameri ? can interest in German investments . But there is another side to the story . The entire German nat ? ional incense can not he much over 24,000,000,000 gold marks . The imperial taxes therefore absorb one-quarter of it ; state and local taxes are supposed to absorb almost another quarter . The average German is paying about one-half his income in taxes . Americans who are moved by Mr. Mellon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their income of hundreds of thousands , ought to ask themselves about the probable mental condition of the German workman , who is taxed out of half of his miserable income of three hundred dollars . How long will a whole people stand taxes equal to one-half of its income ? How long would We stand taxes that would pay off our whole national debt in // one year leaving plenty besides for governmental running expenses ? The Germans are being taxed to death . They are not likely to thrive under such a regime . AN income of six billion dollars is low far an In- , dustrious and energetic people of sixty millions . But for the war the German income would be at least twelve billions , perhaps eighteen . The way out , it may appear , is for Germany to raise her in ? come by extra effort , then the burden of taxation would be lightened . The Germans are stilling . But before they can do it , they must be permitted to double and quadruple their foreign trade , exports as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accepting four tissues the present volume of German imports ? This is not to be expected of France , Italy and the new states created at Ver ? sailles . They have their own industries to look after . Russia would take all the German imports she would get , but might omit the item of payment . England and the British colonies could increase their purchases of German goods , but not four-fold . The United States could easily take four times its present imports irons Germany , or eight times . It has the markets and the money . The world waits to see us do it . IF the Council of the League did anything of im ? portance at its Rome meeting , just concluded , it managed to conceal that fact from the correspond ? ents . The reports of the latter justify the assump ? tion that the Council marked time , not being al ? lowed to do anything else . The British govern ? ment , on the plea that it could not take action on the Protocol without ainpler time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that document , the only major subject before the Council . Needless to say , Anglo-Egyptian rela tions Worn not discussed . The French offer to establish in Paris an International Institute for In ? tellect . ' Cooperation was accepted , the offer of a financial subsidy apparently outweighing the ob ? vious desirability of making Geneva the seat of the Institute . Work was speeded up on the codifica ? tion of private last , by the appointment of an in terim committee . The Council resolved that it NV uld meet in the future only in Geneva ; and it took action of greater or less importance on a num ? ber of routine toasters perpetually on its agenda . The next real test of the League 's strength will come not earlier than this spring , when the Pro ? tocol must be faced and Great Britain will need to decide whether she intends to fish or cut bait . 9'I IF French government 's proposal to the League of Nations Council is to establish in Paris an " autonomous foundation " for intellectual coopera ? tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? propriation , France will provide suitable housing for this institute together with an endowment of hits : million francs a year for seven years renew ? able at the discretion of the Chamber . The repre ? sentatives of France are very careful to specify that they have no wish to control the administration of the institute . That will be , in any event , the responsibility of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League . Moreover , since the functions of the institute remain to be defined , there is no , cleae.expectation that the French would profit as a nation in any way from the presence in Paris of the intellectual foundation . Nevertheless Nye feel that the French proposal is an improper one . Hospitality is one thing ; subsidy is another . The expenses of this institute will be trifling as national expenses go . If the League can not shoulder them , then it is , indeed , completely bankrupt . And any institute for intellectual co ration must be wholly free not only from the fact , but Oven from the sus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the functions of this institute may come to be , the pres ? ervation of their strictly international character is peculiarly important . THE stormy scenes which have marked the prog ? ress of the two opium conferences at Geneva have engendered more pessimism as to the final outcome than is warranted by the facts . As we go to press it is too early to say whether the other nations will again sidestep the American demand for an effective each on the opium traffic , as they have done in the past . The first conference was of opium-producing nations only , and the United States therefore did not participate . Two projects were before it . The first was to make the production and distribution of smoking opium , used by the natives of Eastern countries , strictly a government monopoly , and an agreement to this effect was reached . It has not yet been signed , but the chances are that it will be . The second project was that the whole traffic should he brought to an end witl .. n men years , by reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posal , strongly endorsed by the American represen ? tatives , was rejected by the nations involved , on the ground that it moved too rapidly . With this point of view we have no sympathy whatever . If the world is ever to be rid of the curse of 1 , bn-forming drugs , ten years is not too short a time in which to rescue oriental peoples from opium smoking . It is difficult to believe that the old school diplomats who represented the European countries with Asiatic colonies , conscious as these diplomats are of the opium traffic 's political and economic advan. tages to their governments , have any real desire to see it abolished at all ON the other hand , the forces which are working for suppression of the evil in the long run are likely to defeat the diplomats . The American program , as is well known , demands that the world produc ? tion of habit-forming drugs should be limited to the world 's actual medicinal and scientific needs ? only an infinitesimal fraction of the present production . Public opinion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroin is growing so alarmingly , is solidly behind this proposal . It is also gaining ad ? herents in the Western European countries among those persons who have not been misled by the vicious propaganda which argues that for natives of tropical countries opium is a food , or at least is not harmful as it-is to white men . The truth about the traffic is gradually becoming known ; time is on the side of the angels , whose emissaries in this case are almost exclusively American . THE United States has taken an important step toward a closer relationship with the League of Nations , by accepting the invitation to join an inter ? national conference on the traffic in arms , munitions and implements of war which will he held in Geneva , on May 4 , 1925 . This meeting of course has nothing to do with limitation of armament , as to which a conference has been called for June . The May meeting will deal with the sale of arms and ammunition across frontiers , a business which has more to do with encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle in China , to take only the freshest example , was fought almost entirely with guns and ammunition sold to the rival ' ructions by European munition makers . Both be ? cause the coming conference is likely to make this traffic increasingly difficult , and because it affords fresh proof of a more intelligent attitmle toward the League of Nations on the part of our State Department , the news of America 's participation is welcome . ATE hear much distressed comment on the growth of state and local indebtedness . While the federal government is paying off its debt at the rate of $800,000,000 a year , state and local indebtedness is increasing at the rate of a billion a year . That sounds worse than it is . There is , no doubt , some extravagance in state and local finance , but by far the greater part of the billion dollars raised through loans is laid out on improments of permanent value , roads , bridges , municipal subways , water ? works , gas . d electric lighting plants , hospitals , schools , university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , there is a fair amount in private enterprises also , we have a billion dollars in tangible assets for the billion dollar increase in state and local indebtedness . The federal debt which we are paying off is represented by no tangible asset now in our possession . It is a part of the price of glory . We should have real reason for concern if instead of paying off such a debt we were increasing it ; Or even if we let it stand at its original maximum fig ? ure . As for the increase in state and local debts , the only important question is whether the property they secure for public use is worth the cost . Sta. tistics of the grass amount of the debt and of its rate of increase do not answer this question . FUNDING the French debt appears to he a ques ? tion We shall always have with m . President Cool- idge gravely proclaims that this debt must be paid in full ; every consideratimi of national honor and of international financial expediency demands it . Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her debt to England as well . The sad fact persists that France ca n't pay either of these debts . For ten years the most she is likely to do is to balance her inter. / budget , and with inter ? est accumulating and compounding , the richt will at the end of ten years he about twelve billions of dol ? lars , with annual interest charges of half a billion . Is it likely that France can ever produce an export surplus sufficient to pay sods an interest charge ? She can not , sinless she develops a huge export trade , which would cause our own exporters grave concern and drive the Republican successors of President Coolidge to elahoigte sehedies for an even higher tariff than row Billets us . And to assume that France can settle through German reparations ems is simply to chase the devil around the payments stump . Germany would have to develop the im ? possible surplus of exports . UNDOUBTEDLY the best way out of the mess would he either to cancel the greater part of the French debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint such a settlement wrtuld be obviously unfair to England , from whom we are exacting in ? terest and amortization just as if she were not groaning under the buidens of the war . The Bdtish would have every right to protest our leniency to the French . In the game of power Its and France are rivals . France , released from her obli ? gations to pay , could spend money more freely on airplanes and sulanarines with which to threaten England . Our aloofness to European politics ought not to lend itself to a loasiing of tile dice against England . Plainly it isour duty to treat France exactly as we treat England hr the matter of the debt . If ? ? . c gram a moratorium orreduced interest to France , we ought to revise our agree- ment with Effitiand , to place heron an even heel with France . We could do better than that , it we were gowithesi intelligently . We could call a con ? ference and wipe the slate cican of uncollecriltie debts and reparations that are merely a menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is too much to expect of an administration whose chief quality is its lack of imagination . HE organization that was a few years later to become the American Federation of Labor began in 1881 . In the autumn of 1885 the New York Sun delegated a reporter to " pet up a story on the strength and purposes of the Knights of Labor . " The Knights were at the height of their power and influence . They possessed what many . would regard , now as then , as the ingredients es- sential to a satisfactory labor movement . Their social program was broad and attractive ; toward the unskilled of industry they took a democratic and sympathetic attitude ; and they were ready to throw down the gauntlet of battle as frequently in the political , as in the economic arena . But in the next year the Haymarket bomb was thrown ; and by the close of the decade the career of the Knights was ended . What there was of a labor movement was inherited by the American Federation of ; La ? bor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its legacy a handful of mem ? bers , a few in the skilled crafts , an undisciplined and impermanent residue elsewhere ; internal suspicion and dissensions and a hostile public potion . It is not such a labor movement that Samuel Gompers left when he died last week . Imperfect as it often seems in conception and in performance , it still has all of the appearance of solidity and per- manence . When every allowance is made for the industries into which it has so far failed to pene ? trate , the sheer magnitude of the movement remains impressive . Disputes between and within unions occur only tro frequently , but they no longer shake the movement to its foundations . Nate it is the exceptional and backward community in this country which does not grant its labor organizations a status and a place in its counsels and life . Changes so profound as these do not as a rule gw out of the conscious and deliberate policy of are single 171m . They were , however , in large meas. tire due to the sensitiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ? tansling of the requirements of an organized labor movement .

At its close the steel industry is not yet organized and unions are Weak in other basic industries . But in a wide range of industries , like coal , railroads , printind , and clothing , large and powerful unions arc Iirrhip established . From less than 250,000 menders in 1890 the Federation has groans more than ten fold to its present membership of nearly 3,000,000 . At the same iliac the unions have COO , it more and more to assume the character of institutions .
