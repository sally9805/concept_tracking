There were nearly 100 dead , the Marquis said , and more than 200 in hospitals . <P> His Majesty who was returning to Spain from Scotland via London , immediately ordered a special requiem mass at St. James 's Church , and had his condolences telephoned to his people in Spain . <P> Later King Alfonso went to Paris and stayed incognito at a hotel in the Rue de Rivoli-not at the Ritz as is Queen Victoria Eugnie 's wont . His Majesty heard of another disaster on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 persons were reported killed last week and some 200 injured , when a Spanish arsenal exploded . For the killed or injured Moroccans , however , the King of Spain was not reported to have shed tears . <P> Meanwhile Spain 's Dictator General Don Miguel Primo de Rivera gave quaint testimony to present turbulent conditions in Spain . Said he , " I feel no disquietude . . . . Not more than four per cent of the subjects of His Majesty are disposed to rebellion , so there is no need for apprehension .
