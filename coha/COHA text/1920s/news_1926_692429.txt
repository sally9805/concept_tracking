txt People who , besides reading PREeiceer 's " Conquest of Peru " and " Conquest of Mexico , " have followed most carefully the changing judgme ; ts of later historians on those books will be least likely to expect that material changes in them will be compelled by the new documents relating to that period and those ocountries recently acquired by that indefatigable collector of Americana , HENRY E. HuteenecTON . THE TINES 'S dispatch from London on the subject said that they would necessitate a " revision " of Peescores work . The chances are that , however interesting and valuable the new documents may be , they only will provide additional material and new details . Toward the close of the last century there was a disposition to question Paescorr 's accuracy  --  to suspect that he I exaggerated the height of civilization to which the Incas and the Aztecs had attained at the time of the conquests . More recent investigations , however , have tended ' to confirm I nearly all his statements and most of ' his conclusions . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the then known sources of information . That he used it all intelligently and honestly hardly needs saying , and while in his day the extreme rigors and severities of modern historians I were rarely exercised , PsEscorr showed no Inclination to join the company of the myth-makers . His circumstances and resources II were such that his failing eyesight was not such a hindrance to him as it would have been to most other students . He was free , too , from what on some of Momsy 's pages seems to be traces of a religious and racial prejudice that did not tend toward absolute impartiality . It would be well Our Historians if Americans re Stand alized better than With the Best . they do that their country has produced at least its share of really great historians . At the head of them , probably : stands MOTLEY , with PARKMAN a close second . Both were magnificent writers , at once lucid and elegant , and their books have stood the test of time and modern research better than most like works of their day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that he collected an enormous amount of highly valuable and trustworthy material for the use of others . Of style , he and his co-workers had next to none , and many of their pages are hard reading . That is not trud of any of either Passcow 's or Money 's , and of course JOHN FISKE was an excellent and veracious writer . These are only leading lights among our historians , and there are a dozen or more deserving of praise for the conscientiousness with which they have sought the truth about the past of their own and other countries , and the ability with which they set it down . There was another school of textbook writers who met , or created , a demand for pretty stories that would feed national pride and give to people who would have recoiled from calling themselves great a chance to do the same thing indirectly by proclaiming themselves members of a nation that always was right , founded by men who all were saints and heroes . Our patriotic societies , unfortunately , remain violently opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our school children , and they have the help , as regards Revolutionary history , of England 's professional enemies ; but the triumphs of suppression won by these groups are not many , and of late a better and wiser spirit has manifested itself . It is to be regretted that in reaction from the myth-makers a little group of historians like JAMES TRUMAN ' ? ADAMS have arisen that go as far the other way and try to make out that the colonists had all the yices and none of the virtues . Commander RAThey Say He MON FRANco , the Has eminent Spanish Done E aviator who re . nough cently made the magnificent flight across the Atlantic and down the South American coast to Argentina , desired , naturally enough , to continue his triumphant progress up the West coast , across Panama , up to New York and Newfoundland , and so back across the Atlantic and down again to Spain and home , That would have been an achievement indeed , nearly equaling the complete circling of the globe . With luck continuing to supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Commander could have done it . He is a soldier , however , and though so fdr away from his superiors , he obeys their orders . And they have told him that he has done enough . Just why they thus have put a limit to high ambition is not revealed . Perhaps their idea was that to risk turning triumph into failure at last would be unwise . The risk would have been there , and while crossing the South Atlantic is no mean feat , crossing that ocean 's northern end is a far harder task . If the Commander did come to grief on the homeward journey , that , and not ' his first successful exploit , would have been the most prominent episode in his career . Obeying his new orders , his glory and his country 's are safe . None ' the less , one can imagine the Commander 's disappointment , and probably he is saying things in carefully subdued tones about his superiors that would not look well in print . " Danger , " in the vocabulary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction . Agreement with Joule E. ANDRUS In Professional the belief that Giving " charity " needs reIs the Safer . organizing , or rather disorganizing , the Rev. E. C. Rums. of St. Anne 's Episcopal Church in the Bronx complained in the sermon preached by him on Sunday that " in these days we have so professionallzed our giving that we largely have robbed the giver of the joy that comes from giving . " There is an element of truth is that1 Extension Is Not Revision . but to balance it is the more enlightened giver 's joy in the thought that what he gives will be more intern ' gently and carefully bestowed than he could do it , and that the recipients will be really helped , not pauperized or turned into professional beggars . Such ill effects all too often followed the old-fashioned distributing of aims . With a little thought the wiser giver can get back his precious sense of merit earned if he must have it .                 @ @ @ @
