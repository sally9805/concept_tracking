A slight , blonde English girl with long legs and pale , wistful eyes , moved quickly around a tennis court in Auteuil trying to return the shots that Helen Wills sent at her . The English girl 's name was Eileen Bennett and she was steady and careful and did well though it was clear to her and to everyone that she had no chance . They were playing on a hard court for the championship of France and it was well known that Helen Wills wanted to win since she had come to Auteuil for that purpose . Once the English girl broke through her serve ; twice the English girl won her own serve ; the rest of the games and the match were won by Helen Wills , 6-1 , 6-2.
