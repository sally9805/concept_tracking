Tattletale British railway officials revealed last week that George V , who has a tendency toward bronchitis , is extremely particular when he travels in winter that all cars of the Royal Train are kept at exactly the same temperature . <P> A thermostat in each car maintains the precise heat which His Majesty , hardy , deems healthiest-namely 60 degrees . <P> Generally speaking , Britons maintain their dining and living rooms at irregular temperatures , often much below 60 , and millions cf British bedrooms are never heated . Hence warming pans full of hot coals are slipped up and down between glacial sheets before the sleeper snuggles in.
