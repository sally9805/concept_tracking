Gimbel Bros. , with busy department stores in Manhattan , Milwaukee , Philadelphia and Pittsburgh , might well be renamed Gimbel Cousins , with last week 's election of one of the founder 's grandsons to command of the stores . <P> The Gimbel family is like an artichoke . Its stalk was Adam Gimbel who immigrated from Bavaria in 1840 and opened a store at Vincennes , Ind . He raised seven sons who huddled together in department store ownership , first at Milwaukee , later in Philadelphia , in Manhattan , and lastly Pittsburgh ( TiME , Dec. 14 , 1925 ) . The sons raised their many sons , and kept them snugly in the family enterprises . <P> Until last week Charles Gimbel , son of Adam , was chairman of the company ; his brother Isaac , president . Other brothers , their sons &; nephews were vice presidents . Richard Gimbel , one of the third generation , was secretary . None of the Gimbels are sloths . But 28-year-old Richard Gimbel , nimble &; active as a monkey on a swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week there was an election . Charles Gimbel wanted to retire . The apposite successor to his post of chairman was his brother Isaac . For new president there might be anyone of a score grandsons . The family chose the oldest of them , potent Bernard F. , active socially and prominent in sports . Richard Gimbel must remain as secretary . He said that he could also carry the duties of treasurer , and the family put him in both positions . <P> <P> on Jan. 1 , 1928 Gimbel Bros. , Inc. , will displace the sign of Kaufmann &; Baer of Pitts burgh which Gimbel 's own &; operate now . <P> TIME , November 21 , 1937
