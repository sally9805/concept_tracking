txt TUMULTY 'S STORY . Various Comment From Friends and Enemies of Ex-President Wilson . To the Editor of The New York Times : The first ' three instalments of extracts from Mr. . Tumulty 's book , printed in THE Tams , supply a very adequate key to the character , as a public man , of ex-President Wilson , and sustain the estiznates.previously formed by many of his adherents and the great mass of his opponents of his character as shown in. his public career . First  --  These articles confirm and illustrate his ability , high character , courage and devotion to what he considered to be his duty as a man and citizen , as well as a personality and egotism so highly developed that he regarded and trusted his own judgments , largely regardless of the opinions of others . Second ? He . lacked that quality of frankness ' and rightful fairness desirable , if not absolutely requisite , in the character of a public man . He did not always " play fair " in the game . This was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made clear that the political " bosses " who forced his nomination were wholly Ignorant of his true character and what might be expected of him if elected . Mr. Wilson , according to Mr. Tumulty , was fully aware of the character of the old line politicians who forced his nomination , and knew what would be expected of him if elected . And yet he permitted them to nominate him and accepted the nomination , and not until he was forced , near the end of the . campaign , to disclose his real sentiments and policy , did he make it plain that they were " tricked " in their man . All honor lo him for the policy he then outlined . and attempted to carry out . But was it quite fair or . right for him to allow these bosses to nominate him and to accept the nomination under these circum- , stances ? Other like instances of lack of frankness occurred subsequently , and will doubtless be narrated later by Mr. Tumulty . Third  --  That his mind was autocratic , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the whole public , was early . evidenced and illustrated by his remark to his secretary : " I am sorry , but I do n't care a. damn for the criticism of the country . " Fourth  --  That he lacked the ability to correctly appraise the character and ability of men , or disregarded his knowledge and better judgment in ' his appointments to public places , was well shown and illustrated by the McCombs incident , when ho offered the Ambassadorship to France to a man whom he well knew from his own experience and conceded to be wholly unfit for such a very important place . Subsequent events confirmed and emphasized these cardinal faults or weaknesses in his character as a public man . New York , Nov. 2 , 1921 . A Minority Voice . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have enjoyed the Sunday Miss away up here in the Blue Mountains , but I shall read something else until Wilson passes from ' your grand paper . ONE READER . Branchville , N. J. , Oct. 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yerk The first instalment of Mr. Tumulty 's inside *story of Mr. Wilson must have amused a good many of the readers of your paper , and I doubt whether many will bother to read the continuance of same , as it is easy for any one to precomprehend the rest of Mr. Tumulty 's story in its entirety . It is just an endeavor to contradict Mr. McCombs 's inside story of Mr. Wilson . Do these gentlemen think that the people of this great country of ours , who have . had ' to experience eight years of Mr. Wilson 's rule , need be influenced to a conception of Mr. Wilson 's true character by the publishing of their respective books  --  one ' eulogizing and the *other criticising ? Mr. Wilson molded public opinion of himself during his terms as President , and the last election returns gave evidence of how he had molded this opinion . This is indelible history . Non* , that great majority that were responsible for the new Administration are patient , and appreciate the tasks that are before this Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be set aright at an early date , and that the machinery of all industries and business will be set in motion to maximum capacity , and ' once more bri abi-eat a stable prosperity . ALBERT STERN . Union Hill , N. J. , Oct. 30 , DM . Prom a Democrat . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your article today by Mr. ? Tumulty has inspired within me the desire to express to you , my admiration for and my appreciation of THE NEW YORK TIMES . We Democrats have few advocates in the seats of the : mighty : Certainly none other of the scope and influence of your paper . When I , think of the manner in which Mr. Wilson 's utterances were distorted by so much of the press , I remember the line by Kipling , " If you can bear to see the truth you 've spoken twisted by knaves to make atrap for fools .

Last week I received a letter from a university friend of mine , who is at pi esent a consulting chemist in Paris , and wha is an Alsatian of French descent like the writer , and in this letter my friend tells me that the accident in Oppau was due to the fact that the Bildische had 4,300 tons of nitrate of ammonia m:xed with sulphate of ammonia In stock . This mixture turned as hard . as stone and therefore the workmen blasted this material in order to be able to ship , it . My friend says he was surprised this accident did not happen a long time ago under those conditions . My friend in Paris is qualified to make such a statement because ho visited the factory at Oppau after the armistice and is associated with two Alsatians , who are at present consulting chemical engineers in Paris . These two Alsatian chemists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and were also connected with the large factory in Merseburg , and are now building a similar factory for an English syndicate ' and also have arrangements made for building a similar plant in France for a French syndicate . ? ? *:JOSEPF1 Derby , Conn. , Oct. 31 , 1021. -/ ?
