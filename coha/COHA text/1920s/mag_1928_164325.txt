While the securities of his company were soaring to unprecedented heights on the New York Stock Exchange last week ( see p. 38 ) , Major Gen. James G. Harbord , president of the Radio Corporation of America , made a speech to some women Republicans in Manhattan . Said he : " The change that will be wrought by radio lies in the fact that though one address goes to an audience of 30,000,000 the contagion of the crowd is gone . The magnetism of the orator cools when transmitted through the microphone . The impassioned gesture swings through unseeing space . The purple period fades in color ; the flashing eye meets no answering glance . . . . We sit in our library , in a room where we are accustomed to study and reflect , where all the surroundings are natural . When we there hear the same man speak we know him better than we could in the crowd . The very tones of his voice , quiet and deliberate , if he is to be heard by radio , proclaim his sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the varied contributions of science to mankind , it may well be that none has been quite so great as that of radio to the science of government , the exposure of the demagogue. . . . "
