On Fifth Ave . at 90th Street , Manhattan , Mrs. Andrew Carnegie has a home surrounded by a garden . Across 90th Street is land ( public tennis courts ) owned by her , which realtors have long sought in vain to purchase . <P> Last week , public announcement was made that the Church of the Heavenly Rest ( P. E. ) intended to dispose of its present building in the shopping district and would erect a magnificent edifice on land which Mrs. Carnegie was willing to sell . The church 's rector is Henry Darlington , son of the Bishop of Harrisburg . He was at Newport and could not be reached to confirm the reported change . <P> In any case it is necessary that Bishop William T. Manning , Cathedral-builder , give his consent . And at this point the situation becomes complicated by that admixture of spiritual and material interests to which the name of " churchmanship " is commonly given .
