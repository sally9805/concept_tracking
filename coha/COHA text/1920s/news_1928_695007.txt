txt A BETTER UNDERSTANDING , Bremen 's Flight Encourages- German-American Friendship . To the Editor of The New York Times : In August , 1926 , while traveling through the Austrian ' Tyrol I found myself seated in the same compartment with a man from Nuremberg , who seemingly had all the earmarks of a German Junker . His personality was impressive ; his spirit was compelling ; he was both haughty and humbled at the same time . Finding that I was from America he became voluble at once ; the chief subject was the war and its effects on Europe , and on Germany in particular . His interest in the United States was keen , and he was full of passion as he spoke of the apparent injustice that Germany had been subjected to at the hands of America . I here quote from my diary : * * * " Yet almost the first thing he said * * * in fact , his opening shot was ( in German ) ' Tell them in America that the Germans- are not so bad ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of little children ; the Germans were-one of the most educated people ; every farmer can write ; the war has destroyed Germany ! ' He kept up in this vein all the time , attempting to impress upon me the importance of this . truth . " * * * Three hours we spent together talking ; finally he reached his destination and he gathered up his things . Half way through the door he stopped , veered around and shaking his hand at me excitedly , admonished : " But do n't forget and tell them in America that the Germans are not such bad people ! " As I was being jostled between the police and the mob on Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue on Monday and watched the spirit of the people expressing itself in this friendly demonstration toward one of our former enemies , . I suddenly got a picture of the old German gentleman standing in the doorway of the train exhorting me to carry a message of better understanding across the seas . I could not help wondering how this man would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting . I wondered if he would have squared his chest , thrown out his shoulders and stroked his beard with a new sense of dignity . I wondered if he would have interpreted this to mean that the Americans are coming to realize that perhaps " the Germans are not such bad people " after all , and I tried to imagine what he would say . Perhaps his answer was expressed for him in the words of a quiet woman , who was standing next to me , viewing with amazement the ? passing spectacle . She seemed lost in a trance , hardly daring to credit her eyes . Her whole reaction was felt in the sole word she kept murmuring beneath her breath ? " Wonderful ! I Wonderful ! Wonderful ! " She was I German . ANNA LIEBERT . New York , May 1 , 1928 . Mix-Un in Traffic Rules . To the Editor of The New York Times : Passing through Croton-on-Hudson , one reads a sign attached to the traffic light : " No turn on red . " In New Rochelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Right turn on red permitted . " At West End Avenue and Seventy-second Street , New York , there is a traffic post operated by a policeman , who sometimes is assisted by another , who stands just south of the sign . Right turns on red are permitted at timee by both men , but even without the objection of the officer at the traffic sign one may at certain times proceed right on red and be received by another officer around the corner with a summons for having done so . By adopting a uniform system the Police Department could absolve itself of the suspicion of maintaining a trap for traffic violations . RONALD KOELLE Crestwood . N. Y. , Aprn 4e , Lazo INTEREST IN ARCHITECTURE . Good Results Are Hoped For From Aroused Public Attention . To the Editor of The New York Times : It is very noticeable that architecture is receiving public attention to a degree favorably to react upon those engaged in building . This can not but have a most salutary effect upon this phase of today 's developments . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so justify itself in many lasting results . This attention to architecture and its allied arts may be a sign of a human sympathy which too often is lost in large dimension operations . In a social organization directed chiefly toward the standardization of its products the tendency is for its machinery to drift away from the immediate human relationship . What may be read through the press notices , that art is receiving , is that there is a more perceptible return to the intimate and warm associations complementary to the esthetics of living . It would be an achievement if out of this publicity of the arts a situation developed , one that would bring a better understanding between the graphic and non-graphic , the phonetic and the technical arts . In fact this is happening to a very marked degree . But it would climax the fact if more public buildings stood out in their rightful place among the private ones . There are still too few if any of a public nature that represent the city of today in the way the City Hall , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made speed and quantity the important factor it is hoped is passing , justifying a better order . Private enterprise which stands for the minority has held sway , as is evident , against the majority , by the individual massive buildings against the public ones , which , in New York , seems not to have advanced in step equally . We do trust the future for a better condition , when we who can not see or act will learn to communicate with those values that welcome to help us improve our buildings , to make them read a better social organization . The museums are concrete literature of the past . Public , opera , bank buildings read the present . We can only hope that these may interpret and indicate the sought for light to the future HYMAN N. WEINBERf &; Great Neck . N. Y. , May 3 , 1928 . Criticizing Professor Burness . To the Editor of The New York Times : 1 read in Tue TIMES of May 1 an account of the new book by my old teacher and colleague of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under these circumstances to criticize a man for whom I have the greatest respect personally , and whose place among scholars of the highest rank is assured . However , as I was in Germany just prior to the declaration of war , and crossed the Belgian frontier only a few hours before the Germans , I know the preparations that the latter had made to be the dominating factor , not only in Europe , but in the whole world . It was for this reason that : upon my return to this country , I took so active a part in presenting the facts in their proper light , and tried to make clear to the American people the position in which France had suddenly found herself . I was of the opinion that the United States should have entered the war much sooner than she did , and that for her own sake , not in order to " meddle in the international affairs of Europe . " The Balkan States have been Balkan for many years and will remain so  --  a seat of trouble because various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sorry that Professor Burgess has called forth this criticism by the bias which seems to color all his writing on this subject , and I feel sure that I am voicing the sentiments of many who think as I do . RICHARD GOTTHEIL . Columbia University . May 2. 1928 . Mr. Ryan of Kansas and 1-lia " Ree. ' 1 To the Editor of The New York Times : A couple of months ago the writer became afflicted with a " buzzing " in one of his ears ( he . of course , having two ears ) . so he called on an ear specialist in the beautiful capital city of Kansas and asked the doctor to investigate and see if the " buzzing " was a political bee . The doctor placed a looking-glass equipped with a small electric light on his forehead . Then placing a ' small funnel in our ear he grabbed a stick and poked around in there for several minutes and then he announced , " No , Mr. Ryan . It is n't the political bee you hear buzzing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee is SG . " We paid the doctor his fee , but not being entirely satisfied , we went out into the wide open spaces and along the highways and byways of our native State to see if we could not fathom the mysterious buzzing which has since begun'to form a word that sounds much like " Governor " or at least we can make it out as " Gov . " When we read the article from the pen of our good friend William Allen White , and we consider him one of our good friends , we are constrained to think that if William , who is our exact age , will consult the same specialist and afterward place his ear to the same grass roots , he might be able to hear better ' and even distinguish the exact word . FRANK J. RYAN . Topeka . Kan .. Anril 25 1925 ? Municipal Court Employes . To rite Editor of The New York Times : Tian TIMES editorial today carries an implication which I think is unfair to Municipal Court employes . After over twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have found a high degree of courtesy and good-will present there at all times ? Myself no admirer of Tammany , I must concede that were all Tammany employes as efficient and affable as are the Municipal Court employes , one would not grudge even the high Tammany taxes . Were the Municipal Court put in charge of the great Pennsylvania Railroad or any other efficient civil organization , the foresight which guides private affairs , as contrasted with the hindsight , which prevails in public affairs , would have provided not only more clerks to handle the greatly increased business but that hall-mark of civilian sanity , higher wages , for the additional work uncomplainingly performed . GEORGE HIRAM MANN . New York . May 1 , 1928 . Political- Expenditures . To the Editor of The New York Times : I hate like everything to criticize a measure that has received unanimous congressional support . At the same- time ; I would like to know what sense , there is in attempting to curtail expenditures in political campaigns . If the public has enough intelligence to discriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' candidates , then great expenditures of money in bad causes will be futile . If the public does not have this intelligence , then it deserves what it gets . Let 's have more money spent in political caniPaigns and not less . ' Given a wise and discAiminating pliblic and there is nothing which deserves expenditure to a greater extent . FLOYD M. CROSGRAVEI " DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA . " Has Alexis de Tocqueville 's Propels ecy About Us Been Fulfilled ? . I To the Editor of The New York Times : I have observed with interest your , editorial in today 's issue entitled " California and After . " I wonder if that " heavy hand of Government meddling in matters with which it has no true warrant to interfere , " and the hope which you describe as being in the citizen that such hand may be lifted , is not a fulfillment of the prophecy written almost ninety years ago by that distinguished French philosopher . Alexis de Tocqueville , in his " De . mocracy in America . " You will recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations Have to Fear , " that in referring to the people of this country he says : " I have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers , but rather guardians . " He points out that democratic nations are menaced by a species of oppression for which he has no accurate word with which to convey the idea , and hence he attempts to describe a condition which he foresaw and which unhappily appears to have fully materialized in the United States . He says : " The first thing that strikes the observation is an in. numerable multitude of men , all equal and alike , incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives . * * * Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their fated That power is absolute , minute , regular , provident and mild . It would be like the authority of a parent if , like that authority , its object was to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them in perpetual childhood ; it is well content that the people should re . joice , provided they think of nothing but rejoicing . For their happiness such a ' Government willingly labors , . but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happi. ness ; it provides for their security , ' foresees and supplies their necessi. ties , facilitates their pleasures , man ? ages their principal concerns , directs their industry , regulates the descent of property and subdivides their inheritance  --  what remains but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living ? * * * It covers the surface of society with a network of small , complicated rules , minute and uniform , through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters can not penetrate to rise above the crowd . The will of man is not shattered , but softened , bent and guided ; men are seldom forced by it to act , but they are constantly restrained from acting ; such a power does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannize , but it compresses , enervates , extinguishes and stupefies a people until each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid , and industrious animals of which the Government is the shepherd . " After pointing out that our people by their form of government strive to satisfy the wish to be led and the desire to remain free by cornbining the principle of centralization and that of popular sovereignty , he points out that : " They console themselves for being in tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians . " Further along he says : " It is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representative of that power ; this rare and brief exercise of their free choice , however important it may be , will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking , feeling and acting for . themselves and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity. , * * * It is indeed difficult to conceive how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-government should succeed in making a proper choice of those by whom they are to be governed ; and no one will ever believe that a liberal , wise and energetic Government can spring from the suffrage of a subservient people . " In continuation of the mentioned chapter , this great philosopher points out that one of the correctives is the liberty of the press , which he describes as being " infinitely more valuable among democratic nations than among all others , " and says " the press is the chiefest democratic instrument of freedom . " He warns " that the true friends of liberty and the greatness of man ought constantly to be on the alert to prevent the power of Government from lightly sacrificing the private rights of individuals to the general execution of its designs . " He continues : " At such times no citizen is so obscure that it is not very dangerous to allow him to be oppressed  --  no private rights are so unimportant that ? they can be surrendered with impunity to the caprices of a Government . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten that it is especially dangerous to enslave men in the minor details of life . " Thus we see that the picture drawn almost one hundred years ago as respects this nation has in many respects materialized , but it also appears to be among the possibilities that the gentleman from the sidewalks of New York may be the focal point around which intelligent protest will so rally that the working out of the principle of the equality of mankind shall ? lead the nation to freedom , tolerance , knowledge and . nrnSneTif.V .
