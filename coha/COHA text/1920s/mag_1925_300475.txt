The money situation still holds the centre of the stage in American business . Yet , although it seems each week as if something important were just about to happen , nothing really does . <P> On Oct. 1 many millions of dollars have to be paid out by New York banks in cashing bond coupons due on that date , and also dividend checks issued on stocks . Very often this sudden though temporary demand for funds by New York banks , coupled with the need of sending funds west to move the crops , creates a temporary money shortage on and just before Oct. 1 . So it turned out this year , and call money on the Stock Exchange- ; - the most sensitive part of the American money market-rose to 6% quite suddenly . <P> But just as this development induced the speculative crowd to fear an advance in Federal Reserve rates , news from London announced a cut in the Bank of England rate from 4%% to 4% . The rates of the Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slightly higher and thus avoid heavy gold exports to this country . New York Reserve rate is now 3%% , and a rise to 4% would consequently threaten the British gold supply and the sterling gold standard . <P> Hence , after all these alarums and excursions , the money outlook in America is still for stable and relatively low rates . This in turn facilitates stable security prices and commercial prosperity .
