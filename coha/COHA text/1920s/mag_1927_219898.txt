A slow rain drizzled over some hundreds of workmen assembled in the great open courtyard of the Moscow Railway Shops . The men had come from lathe , forge and foundry to hear a campaign speech by Dictator Josef Stalin-for elections to the Moscow Committees or " Soviets " began last week . Soon the rain was trickling from Dictator Stalin 's hat and soddening his coat . Cried a worker : " Comrade Stalin , will there be war this year ? " <P> " No , " replied Dictator Stalin . " No , Comrade , there will be no war this year . A war danger does exist , but our enemies are as yet unprepared and the workers of the world do not wish to fight Russia . Because our policy is directed to peace , it is difficult to pick a quarrel with us . No breaking off of relations with England is likely , no war this year . "
