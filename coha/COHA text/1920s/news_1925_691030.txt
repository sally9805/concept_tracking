The right is abundantly secured under the Constitution , and its exercise is further necessitated by our treaty of 1909 with Great Britain regarding acts that affect - the natural level or flow of boundary waters . The diversion of ** cubic feet a day from Lake Michigan into the Illinois and Mississippi Valleys has been found to lower the level of all the Great Lakes , except from fol. = - to six inches , a serious , matter to the .. herhOrs . The effect on the navigation Of ; the St. Lawrence and on the - use. of its current for electric power , is proportionally great . The fact remains , of course , that suddenly to cease the , flushing of the sanitary canal would be disastrous to health in the Western metropolis .

Solicitor General BECK , who argued the case for the Government , lately cited it as evidence of the respect in which the world holds our Supreme Court and of its value as a safeguard to peace .

" Would such a question , " he asked , " be settled by any other resort than to " the sword ? " The analogy is somewhat strained ; yet we may question what . the result of Chicago 's stand would have been if our country , ' histead of uniting under a single jurisdiction , had split up into independent sectional confederacies , as it several times threatened to do .
