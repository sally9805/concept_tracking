txt Our Loyalty to France . To the Editor of The New York Times : L'tterly aside from any opinion of the ecenoml2 advisability of the present occupation of German territory upon the part of French and Belgian troops , it is inconceivable to me that a question of policy should influence our loyalty to our former allies . We have given our approval to the collection of an indemnity for the will ful destruction in Northern France and Belgium . Now , after four years of subterfuge and evasion on the part of the destroyers , our allies have been driven to the actual seizure of property . Why should any question arise as to our whole-hearted support ? I am confident that if Germany was today assured of our standing morally shoulder to shoulder with France , as we did in 1917 and 1918. she would again decide the game was up and pay for the destruction that she caused .
