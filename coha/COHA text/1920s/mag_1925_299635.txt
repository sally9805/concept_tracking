A newspaper 's environment is in the public which reads it . It goes without saying that the quality of a newspaper represents the quality of its readers . A great newspaper has often been known to scream in the headlines and grow purple in its editorials about an oil scandal , a Wall Street bomb , a colossal trust or other heinous calumnies . A fortnight ago , the New York Evening Bulletin , moron 's caviar , indulged in journalistic bathos . <P> Childs-the string of 108 restaurants which stretches across the country from Manhattan to San Francisco-recently boasted about its million-dollar maison at Coney Island , built of " rare marbles and mosaics . " The Bulletin became bitter , accused Childs of charging the public more for its bread , butter , toast , coffee , beans , ham-and-eggs than most other restaurants . <P> As regards calories , the Bulletin was irate : " Regarding the system of estimating calories , Childs should offer an explanation , for the bill-of-fare says that bacon contains 300 calories , while bacon and eggs contain 380 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone contains 400 calories , but add eggs and you have only 390 , so that eggs lose their calories when fried with ham but preserve them when fried with bacon . On the other hand , Childs tells you that fried eggs alone have 190 calories . Can you figure it out ? " <P> Then , undoubtedly unconscious of the one and a half million odd dollars net profit which Mr. Samuel S. Childs is able yearly to distribute to his common stockholders , the Bulletin suggested that " if Childs proposes to charge the people twice what food is worth , some of the excess profits should go to the people instead of being devoted to Coney Island palaces . " <P> From the latest national case of public corruption to an unimportant and allegedly profiteering string of restaurants is indeed a plunge from the supremely contemptible to the ridiculously insignificant . <P> Said editors of other journals : " If the public does not like Childs ' food , which is understandable enough , it does not have to go there . There are other restaurants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
