Missing a copy is a source of keen disappointment , and this prompts me to write and ask if you can not send the copies of my subscription in stronger wrappers . A journey of 14,000 or more miles , with frequent changes from steamer to rail to native porterage , demands a much stronger wrapper than that you have been using . I have missed several copies and had others arrive in wrappers practically torn off . I should appreciate attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall remit if you will advise me as to the amount . <P> I have subscribed for a friend , Rev. A. Hoyt Miller , A. P. C.

You help to establish the falsity of the notion that there is no royal road to learning . Your disregard of all known conventions of journalism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a julep . <P> <P> HENRY W.
