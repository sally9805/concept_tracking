Race* <P> " Spazzums " Tricycles , Deferential Dukes The Story . Despite his flat , black , curly beard , which gave him the appearance of an Assyrian bas-relief , Mr. Heath started out in life as headmaster of a typical English parish school at South Barnet . He invested in a tricycle , to facilitate his trips from home to school . And he might have tricycled himself and his numerous family right out of this story , had it not been for his " accident . " The tricycle hit a rock one day , gave him a nervous breakdown from which , according to himself , he never recovered . From the day of the accident he never did a stroke of work . <P> That is , hardly ever . When Mr. Heath gazed majestically around upon the seven daughters with whom , in course of time , he was blessed , he could be seen to expand with the proud air of one who has nobly done his duty . <P> The two elder daughters , Fanny and Kate , married off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of Kate 's choice , whose trousers are always so long that they adopt a " concertina effect " around his ankles . Lena , the fourth daughter , seems faintly reminiscent of Fannie Hurst 's Lummox ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) -a large , silent girl who moVes monosyllabically through the story and a length marries a rattle-brained young artist . <P> Hazel is of different stuff . Tall , scrawny , she has nevertheless a sort of elfin charm . She is afflicted with what she calls " spazzums in her mind , " and lives in a world of her own imaginings , populated by fairy princes and deferential dukes . Later in life she becomes " literary , " transfers the dukes and princes to foolscap , and eventually pours forth upon the English public a bewildering procession of sentimental books which win thousands of readers but never a reviewer 's tribute . <P> Dozens of other characters swarm through the story-so many others that one has the uneasy consciousness of turning a page and losing one of them , as though he had slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross-section of one type of British life , portrayed with an observation keenly penetrating but rich with understanding . It is not the best thing the author has done , but it is decidedly good . These people are so real that one is sure Mr. McFee has , for our benefit , graciously detained them be tween the book covers for an hour or so , but as soon as is polite , they will walk right off the last page , through the back cover , and on with their own all-absorbing concerns . The style is bewilderingly and fascinatingly reminiscent of Conrad , Dickens ( in the humorous passages especially ) , Flaubert , Tolstoi . Even through this land-story there throbs at times the surge of the sea and the pounding of his beloved ship-engines-for McFee is a seaman-author , ex-Chief Engineer of big passenger liners , and far too much in love with his surroundings ever to be wholly free from their touch .
