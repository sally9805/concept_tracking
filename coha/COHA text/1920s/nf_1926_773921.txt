txt // Greek , the Gothic could not have been attained , and the Gothic , once accomplished , had lost some of the abstract beauty that was in the Greek . The athlete and the enthusiast , man with every faculty trained to do exquisitely , and man with soul aspiring toward some great thing beyond himself , both are necessary in the world . It is not for us to decide that one is more worthy than the other , but here for once at least , in its perfect definition of naked form , the beauty of the athlete was supreme . CHAPTER VI ROME I T is a condition of complication that nothing shall remain fixed . The muscles of the athlete become flabby or bulge in exaggeration , the mind of the aspirant falls back to earthly things , the momentary perfection of adjustment is lost and only after a long struggle re-created under different conditions , by other men , with a changed emphasis . // Greece tried to isolate herself within her intellect and failed because both intellect and circumstance carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The intellect continued its definition further than the facts on which the ideal was founded , denied much of the fundamental Greek expression , fumbled with spirit . This was evident in the changing philosophic statement , in the drama , in the sculpture . Much of the old power over form remained , but the abstraction ? the ideal ? gave place to the more personal , verged on the sentimental . The boy 's almost cruel directness which had been the strength of Greece was already clouded by subtleties of feeling , drawn from within , when destiny flung the Greek influence broadcast by force of arms . The Macedonians , cultured by Greece , turned to possess her and flamed through her to the possession of Egypt and the east . The old instinctive Asian culture was subjected to the overlordship of the Greek mind , but the Greek mind was already weakened . The barriers were falling , complication was continuing its inevitable progress . For a short lifetime the balance hung ; the world was unified and the world was Greek . Then the unity collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at war again , but it was a changed world with new relationships , new foci . Greek blood was spread far beyond the Mediterranean shores ; suggestion from the Greek impulse reached to touch India and the further east , and the Greek impulse , in reaction , was easternized , was opened to all the instinctive emotional conceptions it had banished . The world was growing in the west . Greek colonies influenced new nations and found new races that had not yet grown to the consciousness of nationality . And , in a contradiction of position , Greek mind met eastern mind again . Carthage , the Phoenician city , held the key point on the coast of Africa . Eastern ideas and blood had jumped the Greek conquest and threatened to orientalize the west . // Communication was stimulated , ferment of action and idea was everywhere . All the possibilities of intellect and instinct were juxtaposed , combined locally in unity or conflict . Civilization had lost the Greek intensity of focus and awaited some new dominating emphasis to reshape life into different form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rome was the one nucleus harder in bone and brawn than all the rest , symbolized its birth by the harsh legend of deserted twins suckled by a she-wolf , who battled for supremacy to the death . Much of the wolf was always in Rome 's nature , and the hero who sucked in that wild strength was " an uncouth giant beside the Greek athlete , a giant sober-minded , persevering , mighty in his valor , colossal in weight of blow and tenacity of hold , but slow in intellect , lacking in imagination , ignorant of , and disdaining , the form that Greece had defined as essential both for body and for mind . He was a giant with the power for good , as he saw good , behind his strength , but he saw no good that he held sacred from his strength . He made the world his world , fitted nation against nation like the pieces of a gigantic puzzle . There is more in the comparison than the incongruity of the picture ; the empire that Rome built retained its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so by the power that could maintain physical order , that could live and prevail on others to live by law . Rome did not bring a new ideal to civilization , but her strength held the old world steady while the new ideal germinated from the complication of the old . Rome had too positive a nature , however , to be merely the crucible that held civilization suspended in solution , to be merely the filter through which the old ideals were concentrated for the benefit of the future . Certain things Rome added to the mixture so that , beyond the bias of her combination , civilization drew new qualities , new emphasis , from the Roman nucleus . Egypt had made images from // facts and lived in the shadow of their bulk ; Greece had related images from the truths behind facts and lived in a world of reason ; Rome ignored images altogether , plunged at facts themselves and lived in a world of action . In her life and in her culture it was the thing done which was insignificant , not the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , not to us in detail , but in the tendencies and in the national characteristics which urged their doing . Rome constructed her world into a fact of physical unity and she constructed physical daily living into facts of health and bodily luxury . The possibility of these things was Rome 's real gift to civilization . She was the first practical engineer amo ; lg the nations . RoiE 's action began in the tilling of the soil and in defense of the soil . IIcr very language was one of agriculture and of war . She was obliged to fight for her chance to live and , once the chance was sure , Rome had become the organized nucleus of her later empire . She had learned that the best defense was in aggression and that the power for aggression came only from unity at home . All her early national life was struggle ; struggle of adjustment within , struggle of subjugation without , and subjugation of clans and settlements so related to herself that the Roman conquest may be said to have fused with Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had complicated with them , had been controlled by them in her first weakness and their influence was important for her future because they brought her some culture , gave her some instruments that she found effective in her endeavor , as engineer , to erect a state and to create the healthful and matter of fact environment that she desired for the state . It is impossible to disentangle all the strands that made Rome 's point of view . Some of them were Latin , some Etruscan . Hints even came from Greece through the Etruscans and through the Greek cities in the south . Very much // of Greece was later to be grafted on the Roman trunk , but the Greek ideal never became Rome 's . Rome 's mind remained founded in the soul , founded in wealth , founded in war , founded in the state that had arisen on the soil from the exigencies of life . Unity of purpose in the state had grown through bitter striving for prerogative . Never before had there been the same complication of adjustment proceeding from struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its infancy , did not easily react to beauty , did not have room for imaginative impulses , was satisfied on the material plane without embellishment . All this is evident in the expression that we must recognize as truly Roman . We must reiterate that the vitality of this expression was in the action , was in the law which regulated action , was in that bent of language which argued action and applauded it , and which formulated law . Also it was in the comfort and sanity of living , in the draining of pestilential marshes , in the building of sewers and roads and aqueducts . It was tense , suppressed , somber ; overlaid life with a stern morality that denied the joy of life . History has taught us to acclaim whether fact or legend ? the father who killed his victorious son for infringement of his orders and the violated virgin who stabbed herself , demanding justice , and we acclaim , not real morality , but the hardness of Rome 's one-sided mind , her monomania for exact law and duty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their true significance . The inherent tragedy of Rome was that she could not see beyond facts , could not imagine and failed to find the deeper truths . All the expression that we call Roman and that does possess imaginative quality was borrowed , was overlaid on life . There was no greater virtue in the Roman laurels than the tolerance which accepted foreign ideas in those realms where Rome herself could not delve , so long as these ideas did not seem to interfere with Roman action ; and // there was no greater danger . All the virtue was in the tolerance ; the danger was in the fact that Rome could not discriminate , could not understand the ideas and their significance in the true relationship to action . The problem of Rome 's expression becomes diffuse ; it must seek , through various paths , differing significance . There was the fundamental strain of Rome ; there were all the waves of outside influence that Rome flavored rather than digested ; and there were , in all the floating combinations of ideas leading to action or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration into unity of motive or ideal , some factors on which the new ideal , when it did come , might seize , through which it might climb to dominance and which , from use , became incorporated into the mariner at least of the ideal itself . E Etruscan culture came so early in the development that we must count it Roman in the result , and the practical unity of Italy brought no further significant divergence than the seeping in of the Greek suggestion . Through these earlier centuries , Rome found herself and fixed herself , laid the foundations of her law and began the flexibility of her organization that permitted the self-rule of a city to spread a net wide and strong enough to enmesh and hold the world . During this time there was one issue in the action that had a negative cultural importance perhaps incalculably great . The northern shore of the Mediterranean has always progressed toward the complication of civilization which in our own perspective we designate as western ; the African shore has been the pathway by which the east has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Rome emerged , potentially a world power , she found the east , in Carthage , arrayed against her . In the bitter struggle Carthage was destroyed , her influence wiped out . Here was no tolerance , for Carthage had restricted the Roman action . Rome and the western progress controlled the west // and , for more than a thousand years , the east reacted on this progress only through the filtration of ideas that the later tolerance of Rome permitted . In a general way , the beginning of our era marked the turning in the changing combination . The world empire was established . The republican city had reached the limit of its power as a city and had passed it . The old cruelly moral population that had ruled itself and , through it-self , the world , had weakened under its contact with the world . The ferment which its hard-fisted power had brought to physical unity had entered the soul of Rome . Morality threatened to become a byword , the sanity of living had become the luxury of living , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the qualities , except the cowardice , of the bully , but he remained the engineer and , to his own undoing , he remained tolerant . In his indiscriminate toleration of things that at bottom he could not understand , he grasped the rottenness of the old instinctive east , made fashions of it and assumed it to be virtue . And in his reveling , the reins of government slipped from his hands . The hero , Rome , ceased to be the center in the engineering network , which was order , and the contra-diction of Rome 's original republican assumption , the emperor , ruled in his place . The transition was masked and gradual . Temporary dictators were followed by a dictator for life ; the early emperors governed through the machin ery of the republic and they were Romans , but the sepa ration was complete in possibility and soon became com plete in fact . Rome ceased to be the power in the empire and the Roman order , the Roman law , the Roman faculty for stability of structure , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east . All this was possible , much of it accomplished , when Christ was born , when the inspiration for the new ideal was given to civilization . It was in the irony of history that the mastering potentiality for decay should come from Greece , // from Greece , herself in the thrall of Asia , Greece with the ideal discarded but with all the old agility of mind present , if softened . The Rome that had grown fat on conquest swal-lowed Greece whole , to put it brutally , and the Greek mind and art became a Roman diet , a delicacy for the enjoy-ment of new wealth . Rome did not understand it , but it pleased the wealthy Romans to pose as patrons and collec-tors of intricate ideas and vices as well as of the statues and the great literary monuments which still stood as symbols of what had been the greatness and what already , to the Romans , had become the antiquity of Greece . And the influence toward the decay of that which at least had been the single-mindedness of Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further con-quest . The old frugal city , which had ceased to be regal in any practical sense , became the meeting place of all the luxury , all the ideas , all the extravagances both bodily and mental , that civilization had toyed with . Rome drew toward herself , through all the strands of the net which enmeshed her conquest , all the individual qualities ? and combined they were less strength than weakness ? of the nations she had juxtaposed . The result of her engineering resource reacted on her reaction from her old frugality and made her mind , which could not discriminate , which could not motivate into a unity , itself the toy of civilization . The city became a turbulent compendium of the empire , of the world . The opposite poles of thought and act were crowded within its limits , but there was a distinction in the interactions which is important because it forged the fu-ture . The separation between east and west was never welded , although the edges of the rift merged and shifted . The culture of the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broadly speaking , there had been no culture in the west . The east produced the wealth and gave , for good or ill , the impulses which blew across the Roman mind . The west received what Rome could formulate . Its // nationalities had been weaker before they had been sub jetted ; its Roman aspect was more truly Roman , its last reaction toward the future could throw aside some of the eastern influence and build into the future on the principles which we call engineering and which were the permanent gift of Rome . TutE expression , through form , in word or plastic material was the expression which Rome borrowed , definitely in man-ner , often also in the matter , and it was predominantly Greek because the Greeks were more than any other race articulate in form and because the Greek impulse was more sweeping in its power over Rome than any other . It was an expression which had little fundamental progressive influ-ence beyond Rome . It is an astonishing fact that when the dissolution of the empire in the west finally came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tern-poral power , leaving the potentiality of the new ideal which had been growing in spite of them , to reconquer the con-querors of Rome . The significance of Rome in the history of the world hardly can be exaggerated , but the signifi-cance of her mundane expression was overestimated ? and still is so because after many centuries men arbitrarily turned back to it and , seeking in it an ideal which never had existed , created much of the formula which restricts our own expression today . It is for this reason that the sculpture and the litera-ture of the heyday of the empire retain some pertinence for our present study . They became models for a later age and , whether or not that later age truly reflected Rome , a statement of the Roman point of view is needful for an understanding of the later position toward artistic expres-sion and of our own position . Sculpture is the more en-lightening to us because it deals with the same plastic , sensual form with which architecture covers its structure . The word covers becomes at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the surface and because the Roman art had done just that thing . Form had lost abstraction , had ceased to be inherent meaning , had ceased to symbolize ideal , had become mere shape . True , Rome , grown rich , loved symbols , but not in the Greek sense . Roman symbolism was allegory in its crudest statement , used for the glorification of Roman power and Roman virtue and Roman wealth . Characteristic costume or distinctive objects defined the meaning which was as external as was the significance of the form ; and form and meaning had lost all essential unity . Sculpture retained but the shell of the Greek expression and copied forms already , in the Greek , exaggerated , sentimentalized that is , become personal , drawn from individual observation . But since there was vigor in the individual Roman , there was often the semblance of vigor in the sculptured shapes , reflected from the actual and not proceeding from the intellectual power for definition in the artist . Greek sculpture in its weakening had tended toward the episodic , had suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct detail of a state report chronicling a campaign , wound them in relief around the towering columns that were set up to signalize a victory . There was all the gulf of mind that separated the two races between these marching Romans with their baggage and their prisoners , in their religious sacrifice and in their triumphs , between these intimate personal figures and the ideal , abstracted action of the frieze around the Parthenon ; all the difference between fact that may contain beauty and the essential beauty which is inherent in the balanced relationship of facts . Fact ? the true shape of fact regardless of beauty ? was injected into sculpture by the demand of Rome and it was Rome who may be said to have created portraiture as a conscious branch of sculpture . It was great portraiture . The lingering Greek power to fix the details of external // form was here applied in the direction that Rome best understood . Bronze and stone Romans were multiplied beside the living and many of them remain to show us , not the type , the idealized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was great portraiture , but it was not could not be ? the greatest art , for , as we have said , it minimized the abstracting , the imagining power of the artist and formulated mere observation . It had ceased to be a visioning and was become a commodity to be ordered , purchased , accepted or rejected by a discrimination other than the craftsman 's . To the old Greek the power over form had been an intellectual weapon and a racial weapon ; to the rich Roman ? and there is no evidence that the poor Roman regarded it at all ? it was a personal craftsmanship whose- results were bought to gratify the sense of wealth . This is not to disparage the Romans . They were great in many things and they were more as we have grown to be than ever the Greek was . The unity of living which was the Greek ideal was as foreign to the complexity of the Romans ' life as to our own . The expression of any art as a fundamental part of life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dominance of the world , was an external thing , a matter of personal statement , of individual pleasure , remained so even in the allegories which symbolized the magnificence of the emperor and the state . These same qualities ? of the actual , of the personal , of the pictorial in a certain sense , and frankly often of the superficial can be traced into the word forms of the literature . Here was also much dependence on the Greek , but there was here more that was truly Roman , for the real Roman matter was better expressed in words than in plastic form and the interpretations of Roman life and thought , the glorification of Roman deeds , the exposition of the engineering power of Rome , that influenced her action , made the writing more all-inclusive in its revelation than the sculpture , more illuminating of the fundamental things that ere152 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE ated her significance in history . But the illumination of even these fundamental things reacts to prove our present point . The departure of the sculpture from the ideal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman fashion , was not all in the decadence of that expression before Rome found it . Copy and decadence were operative in the large result ; can be felt not only in the ' sculpture but in the literature whenever it attempted imaginative'creation , but even had they not been present as restricting forces , the deeper interests of the literature show that the Roman spirit could never have risen to the abstract and the ideal because Rome had no inherent power over form , could not transcend facts , could not forget the individual , could not order her conception of life into the unity that can be expressed by art . RELIGION , even in the nucleus , was not the mainspring of Roman action , and was not a substantial power toward unity . Rome borrowed here as blatantly as in all things where imagination was required . To some presumptive primitive worship , Etruscan gods were added and then Greek deities . It has been said that Rome dignified the Greek gods , even that she more completely abstracted them . Certainly she forbade them many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks allowed , but the process was not abstraction , it was subtraction . Greece had made gods in the image of her ideal ? man . Some of them symbolized the forces of nature , some the powers and passions of men and all were abstracted into superhuman men and women . Greece , in her definition , passed on to relationships of forces and powers and passions , and she symbolized them by interactions between these superhumans who were so intensely human because of their very abstraction toward the Greek ideal . All the action of the Greek gods had symbolic meaning , was created by the imagination to show underlying truth . Rome was blind to this . Her stern // spirit saw in the conceptions but the inconsistency of the human side . She moralized the gods and stripped them of the deeper truths that imagination had abstracted . They became mere powcr , Nand faculties with names , and in their sculptured images they belonged to the allegories we have mentioned , recognizable by their defining dress or objects . Throughout this process we can trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination to push past the externals to the fundamentals . And as Rome gathered complication she deserted the gods she had devitalized ; left their worship to become a formula ? a ritual for official action ? and turned , in her tolerance , in her individual curiosity , to all the varied concepts which complication had juxtaposed within her limits . The empire and the city were full of sects , of contradicting beliefs and forms of worship , of cults from Egypt and from Asia , of philosophies that had created systems from all the intricate branches of Greek reasoning . Whatever the individual believed to be his own best guide to what he himself considered good , this he was privileged to accept and publish so long as it did not interfere with the Roman action , with the god-ship of the state in the person of the emperor . This condition became the crux in the events of history for the great power that was destined to formulate the ideal , to create new unity of progress from the static Roman combination , would not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical force so long as the new ideal and the physical power were in a position of possible conflict . Christianity made its appeal to man in the promise , if not the definition , of just those intangible and immortal things which the old Greek intellect had not been able to formulate and had therefore banished . In so far as the pagan Roman world stood firmly on the material level which the Greek ideal had established ? and official Rome still did so ? Christianity contradicted its foundation , threatened // its self-sufficiency . Here , of course , was the reason for the persecution of the Christians , for the almost unique denial by Rome of tolerance . She understood , and rightly , that if this sect grew there was danger to herself , but she did not understand that no power at her command could stop its growth ; she did not realize that all the process of complication had made it necessary , that even the complete fulfilment of ideals ? had this been possible ? which were founded in earthly things alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this new ideal whose promise minimized the constant worldly disappointments . The Greek intellect had touched spirit and retreated , but curiosity had continued and Greece had become more sympathetic toward the intuitive conceptions even before the conquest of the cast had carried her intellect to live in intimacy with instinct . Perforce there was some mingling ; mental processes gained flexibility as they lost distinctness ; instinct gained form and motive , gained almost the distinctness that the intellectual definition lost . Throughout the pagan world there came to be an undercurrent of spirit that was concentrated when Rome united the world and tolerated all its possibility of varied thinking under the assumption of Rome 's own material impregnability . There was not in all this any prediction of Christianity , but there was preparation for it . Men 's minds , particularly Greek minds , were ready to grasp this purest of all conceptions from the imaginative instinct , but they had not so far forgotten their own birthright of the reason that they could leave the conception in its purity . Christianity began as a socialism based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had conquered opposition , that it was tolerated and then recognized as the state religion , it had been formulated and defined by Greece and it had seized from Rome the very constructive weapons that had been the strength of Rome . The old distinction between the east and west remained // in operation . The empire was on the point of positive division . Almost within a century , the Roman power in the west was destined to be passed on to new races and the Roman power in the east to be relinquished to the Greeks . Christianity had been formulated for the empire by the Greek mind and while the empire lasted the Church remained superimposed on the manners of pagan life . It could control , could be intolerant in its own turn , but it could not eradicate all the habitual reactions of all the centuries of culture behind it . The new ideal had been stated for and accepted by the Roman world , but the new blood from the north was necessary before the ideal could be grasped without preconceptions . And even within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding that the Church , once established , had made itself coincident with the political organization of the empire . Organization , however , could not contradict heredity and the Greekish subtlety of definition which had overspread the east was contrasted against a more positive power of western faith . When the empire split , when the barbarians gripped the west , they were met there by a religion that possessed all the engineering power of Rome to press forward a faith spiritual enough to appeal to their imaginations and to become the driving power of their existence . In the east , where the old contradictions remained , the old material life continued , under the Roman name and under the assumption of the sovereignty of Christ , but driven by a new Greek impulse which could not altogether deny the ancient heritage . All the later expression of the empire became the expression of the Christian Church modified by the varying intensity of racial character in the different regions . The religion which in its essence was purely intuitive ? altogether drawn from the imagination ? reached toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings , it almost refused the intervention of any form to define // the objects of its aspiration . It could not pass through the Greek mind , however , and remain formless , either in its dogma or in its more physical expression which made use of art and which we shall find so vital in the latter archi-tectural growth . Christianity , in a sense , was paganized in its conquest of paganism and the pagan form was drafted into the service of the Church . The result of this might have been more far-reaching and restrictive than it was had not the process been transferred to the Roman center and had it not taken place during a period when the pagan expression had dropped to its lowest ebb . The apprecia-tion of form had withered amid the turbulence and the growing poverty of the weakening state and the produc-tions of the earlier Rome , external as they had been , had almost ceased . The very fact , that they had been external to the truly Roman powers partly accounts for this . Greece , even in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cease to formulate , where Rome , as her power lessened , soon lost the excess vitality which could find interest in what had been always fundamentally foreign , while she still retained some aspects of her con-structive faculties . Christianity , becoming potentially a universal expression , reflected all this . It had brought the deepest possibilities of the imagination to a world where the imagination was satiated in its material life , and its expression followed the same racial separation which had divided the underlying intuitive conception of the reli-gion itself . In the more Roman west it carried spirit into the future on a structural organization which finally achieved form ; in the east where Rome had never mate-rially influenced the ancient culture , form dominated spirit and the expression could not but remain material . THE history of Rome can be visualized into great suc-cessive impulses . There was the first period of growth when the fundamental Roman things were so fixed that they // could leave their mark on all time , when Rome , the engineer , was trained in a combative youth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the realization of inunense power , the rejection of old ideas and the readjustment to the empire where all the factors of complication were juxtaposed , when all that was to fill the rest of life was seething in a mind bewildered among the contrasts , but still holding to the practical power that was in the early training and was the one unifying strength throughout the turmoil . Lastly , the emergence , from the turmoil , of an ideal that realized the strength and used it , but which had come too late to restore the vigor , too late to complete the unity , too late to be altogether understood . The empire was divided at the moment when the ideal was recognized , and the new capital was established at Constantinople in the Greek lands . Of course there was a passing nominal unity , but the real political duality was the admission of a fact that had become physically operative immediately the unity of force had relaxed . The empire was two empires and had always tended so . Now the west , ceasing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east which turned to its own new center , could not withstand the repeated blows of the barbarians on the European frontiers , relaxed and was submerged . Rome was no more a living power , but what in its physical decay had brought contempt was to become the symbol of God-given sovereignty . Rome fell , but the Church did not even falter and the ideal passed on to new blood which had never known Rome 's pagan mundane life and which could state the ideal in the greatest of new expression . Barbarian Europe was to make the final definition ? if definition were possible at all ? of the Christian ideal , but that carries us beyond our immediate interest , beyond the living Roman impulse . And , in a sense , Rome did not fall when the west was lost , did not fall for a thousand years . We have accentu158 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE ated the Greek complexion of the east and the underlying orientalism which modified the Greek . We have found that the Christian ideal which Rome recognized and made universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complication of Greek and oriental . Our emphasis has been from the Roman point of view , has been to show that Rome could not submerge her eastern conquests ; but it was inevitable that she should affect them . She could not quench their national personalities and did not attempt to , but she did force them into paths that were the Roman order and held them there so long that when the force was gone the habit of the path remained . The Roman empire in the east became the Greek empire , became Byzantium , but it never altogether lost the name of Rome , never completely deserted the Roman law , endured partly because it had absorbed some engineering principles from Rome . Yet what was absorbed from Rome was reformulated by the Greeks and emotionalized by the more distant Asia . It was one of the contradictions of progressive time that Greece which had fought off Asia should turn to Asia ; that Greece whose first virile expression had set a standard by which the west might live and which the east never could understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east , and that in the end she should become more truly bound to east than west . The building of Constantinople had brought new strength , new commerce , new wealth . With the collapse of Rome the Greek spirit shook off its shackles , discovered new creative power , found the possibilities of new expression . In spite of the Christian ideal it was the expression of more than maturity , almost of disillusionment . The ideal became but another form , vaguer , emotional , tinctured with all the possibilities of the complication of centuries , but while the expression lasted it was surpassing in its interest , significant in its innate beauty and significant in its reaction on the younger , full-blooded , excited west . The Greek // empire was the Roman power , transplanted , diminished , formalized , but it remained the unbroken Roman power ; it had received the east and become almost a part of the east , but it remained the bulwark which protected Europe from the aggression of the east . It was a stronger force in his tory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great example from which the west might learn some craftsmanship of beauty . As we sum up the Roman possibilities for expression , we can find no steady progress in any direction , no climax , no unity of ideal . Rome nowhere reached a summit ; in-deed , if we should trace a curve , Rome 's place would be among the uncombined elements in the hollow between two summits . The intellectual definition of Greece had fixed the statement of form as an expression of the reason , that should endure for all time . The spiritual aspiration of Gothic Europe was destined to do as much for form as an expression of the intangible . Greece carried definition to the limits of the definite and , without her articulated struc ture in all manner of expression , the Gothic would have lacked the foundation which might be infused with spirit . Rome was the transition . Her manipulation so blunted the ideal of form as essential intellect that it lost completeness and was opened to the possibility of the new infusion . This was but a negative reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they might be rearticulated in combination with the new . And yet , when the new structure rose , something real from Rome was in it and , later , when even the new ideal had failed , men turned back to Rome again seeking relief from the tense strain of attempting the ideal . Greece and the Gothic Europe expressed two of the most immense struggles toward the best that humanity could argue or feel , and in the struggle all life was corre lated into a unity of desire for the best . Humanity could not have maintained the pressure . The first ideal could not // have moved forward to the second without the complexity that came with the relaxation . The physical collective power of Rome was necessary for the development of the future and the ineptness of Rome 's expression was a natural corollary of her physical point of view , was more human , on the average , than the concentration of either Greek or Gothic . There was a real , if minor , significance in the scattered Roman statement , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected all the pagan and drew from it everything that might appeal to wealth and power ? kept it external , did not let it interfere with life or action , did not strain to fathom what she knew was impossible to her nature . She was a connoisseur , lacking indeed discrimination , but avid in acquisition . And all she gathered was the embellishment of the Rome that melted with the failure of physical power . It was the most obvious and the least worthy of her phases of expression . Already there was decline and loss of interest when the Christian ideal demanded unity and foraged among the imperial trappings for forms that might symbolize itself . Almost immediately the Christian transmuted the significance of the pagan and the survival of Rome 's collections was but meager in the progress toward the future . Its vitality of interest for us was in the Renaissance revival , was in the imposition upon the present of the pagan incoherence as an ideal of statement , simply because it had once been Roman . The Christian expression separated with the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west while Rome lived , but reached one isolated summit of more than secondary excellence in the east before all culture stiffened there to a formula as rigid as that of Egypt . All the varying currents of necessity interacted . Christian had grown through pagan and both , so far as they were Roman , were founded on that real engineering faculty which Rome would not have classed among expression at all , which she hid as the l // rouge mechanics , as the unworthy support for the formu lated surfa'te she called art . Rome remained material , founded her conceptions on hard facts . ' She had no imagination that could create images , no sense that recognized essential beauty , no dis crimination that could separate beauty from ostentation . And yet , as she collected the elements of complication , she became ashamed of facts and clothed them with the bor rowed forms she could not motivate . She became splendid and she was satisfied , but it was the splendor that evapo rated and it was the fact of action in its strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future as the true significance of Rome 's existence . CHAPTER VII ROMAN ARCHITECTURE THE Roman fact of Roman architecture was in stability of structure dissociate from form and from any defined structural system . It was the stability of rigidity , of inertia ? of concrete . Rome realized the possibilities of this material and made its employment general throughout the empire . That she should do so was characteristic , and there - was nothing better for her engineering purposes . It was cheap in itself and in the unskilled labor which could lcandle. it ; it was flexible ? plastic ? and might-be turned to many uses ; above all , it was solid . Form was not inherent in it , but any form might be modeled from it by pouring it into the desired mould . It had the strength which Rome respected , a strength that might underlie any shaping that Rome fancied . To Rome herself it was not architecture ; it // was the core over which the architecture ? an external thing ? might be applied . In its very fundamental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form and structure , of form and meaning , ceased to exist . What was evident in the sculpture was here a blatant declaration of the superficiality of the Roman conception , of the inevitable duality of architectural purpose when the creative imagination , when even the simplest logic of form , had ceased to guide construction . Roman architecture was made in the manner of a picture ; was as much form for its own sake spread over a foreign groundwork as is the form wrought by pigment on a canvas , but what is necessary in the painting is not necessary and may be contradictory in the architecture . In the Roman usage it brought definite degradation . The essentially pictorial covering of a structural core by a more precious and decorative material , while it can never approach the intellectual unity of the Greek , may produce results of real significance so long as there is a relationship of meaning between core and surface , so long as the surface makes clear that it is superficial and declares the logic of the structure which it covers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman . Decorative form and fundamental structure were not related and did not stand together to state any unity of conception , but there was a form among those that Rome collected ? the arch ? which contained the possibilities of structural complication far more varied than had as yet existed and which was destined to free its thrusting powers from the inert Roman masses and , reacting on the Roman power for stability , to become the final structural weapon of the Christian ideal . The action of an arch on the rest of the structure which contains it is very different from the perpendicular deadweight of " a The pressure exerted on the center is transmitted downward , through the curves , toward the points from which the arch springs and there works side164 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE ways , so that , if sufficient strength is lacking above the points of spring , the ends of the arch will push away and the whole structure will collapse . The thrusts of an arch must be held in place by sufficient weight of wall to steady them , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the freedom of the form increases , an entire structure can become a framework of active forces mutually checking one another . The Roman scheme did not accomplish this , but it did suggest it to the future . The Roman builders evidently feared the disintegrating power of active thrusts and the solid masses in which the arched form usually was impressed , even when it was complicated into domes and vaults , produced little pressure that was not vertical . Yet the great vaulted ceilings which were set upon the walls certainly appeared to concentrate all their push at the four corners of the vault and , back of that appearance , the western future found its problem and finally , its solution . The plasticity of form in the inert concrete ceilings and the great spaces which they might be made to cover perWitted the development of a far more complicated plan . The Egyptians had stretched their temples along an in/definite central axis ; the Greeks had concentrated on the perfection , external and internal , of what was hardly more than a single room ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under one roof , of the most varied apartments and communications . Rome passed here from the simple fact of stability to the complex arrangement that was permitted by the means to gain stability , just as she had passed from the facts of simple action to the great patchwork of the empire which was controlled by the power over action . It is not a parable to say so , because both developments ? of plan through the stability of structure , of empire through the stability of action ? were the results of Rome 's innate engineering competence . We shall find these Roman things , or some of them , // underlying almost all the phases of her architecture . We shall see them complicating as the influences which swept across the Roman culture were complicated ; we shall find them put to comparatively noble uses and lo certainly de-graded ones . As we visualize the externals which Rome fashioned from her borrowing , we might be led to ignore these fundamentals as Rome desired to do , but in ignoring them we should lose the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was through the reaction of the truly Roman qualities in the architecture that . the Gothic gradually created a new order ? an architectural expression of the new ideal ? from the old elements of the Greek . The emergence of the active arch through the Ro-man stability and from among the gathered incoherence of forms , paralleled the emergence of the Christian ideal it-self through the Roman order and from among all the gathered incoherence of the pagan mind . IT is probable that the first conceptual architectural form came to Rome with the Etruscan culture and that Rome then , almost at the beginning of her growth , learned to use the arch . The old systems of Assyria and Babylon had employed it ; the Egyptians and the Greeks evidently had known it although they disregarded it in their work ; the Etruscans had developed it to a considerable extent , but it was Rome who made patent some of the real variety of its uses , in spite of the rigidity of the core material , which rigidity she increased as she complicated the struc-ture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical is evinced the ancient sewers that still remain , by the great arc des of the aqueducts , by the bridges . It was an engineering instrument with a flexi-bility beyond that of the lintel , with a far greater span and , under the Roman method , with as complete stability . It was seized upon by Rome as an engineering instrument rather than as an architectural one , but once incorporated // into the Roman structural vocabulary , it passed without discrimination into the architectural vocabulary and became a disturbing factor in the Roman attempt to graft Greek form over the Etruscan element and on the engineering cop . The so-called arch order was one of the most characteristic R manipulations of form and illustrated the indifference to any innate meaning of form . Versions of the Greek orders were among the stock-in-trade of the Roman architects ; the Etruscan arch was added to the collection . Rome considered them all on the same plane and did not visualize the essential structural distinction between arch and lintel . She desired to combine them and she set the arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which upheld the lintel . It was exactly the combination which we described in the first chapter to show what inconsistencies may develop when structural forms are used as ornament alone , and this Roman combination was so admired ? it has a rich pictorial effect ? that its use became extensive , that it was reproduced in the Renaissance acceptance of Roman combinations , that it was incorporated into the formula which is part of the architectural surface of today . Almost throughout the classical Roman epoch ? the earlier and more productive imperial period ? the arch , considered as a decorative form , was associated with the column as subservient to the lintel . Only where it was impressed into the great surfaces of the roofs and ceilings and where no decorative surface could hide the magnitude of its span , was it used in its logical relation to the evident supports ; and only very gradually , as the centuries dimmed the lingering incoherent classicism of the Greek suggestion , did the meaningless combination of the arch-order give place to a more reasoned relationship where the lintel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom from above the column ; where it began to assume ? perhaps with the new impulse that stirred with // the coming of the new ideal ? an ordered usage that connected its expression with the Christian future rather than with the past of Rome . And the definitely formulated inconsistency of the archorder was but one example of the all-pervading inconsistency throughout the architectural covering . Form which possessed structural meaning was constantly used with the meaning ignored or contradicted . Columns were set against walls for the mere sake of decoration , were built partly into walls , were flattened into the rectangular strips we c 11 pilasters . Such things again are not necessarily falsifications of structural truth for they may be proper symbols indicating increased strength at some crucial point of wa11 , but they are usually superficial and Rome 's employment of them was eminently so . Her point of view toward their structural indication is evident in a treatment she invented for the lintel . In the incongruous masses of detail which she spread over the concrete fundamentals , all forms ? columns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wall-surface and the lintels often became mere parts of wall , were broken into several stones in the single stretch from one apparent support to the next , were kept back of the column face and bent around , above the columns , in projecting blocks which were all that the columns upheld and which , in turn , upheld nothing . These structural instruments whose shapes had been evolved during centuries of experiment so that they should express their usage , became no more significant than the slabs of precious marble , than the modeled and painted stucco with which they were associated and into which they merged . From a point of view which arbitrarily disregards all architectural fitness there is often richness of pictorial effect in the conglomerations , even a certain sumptuous beauty of line and mass , but if we look upon them as things which fundamentally are structure , or at least expressions of structure , then immediately // their false " conception is apparent . The truth is not only covered , it is denied . The details of the forms themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with their Greek heritage whose historical development can be traced . We have noticed that the Greek Doric in its essential sig-nificance stopped with the relaxation of the intellectual ideal . The shaft became too slender and too straight , the capital hardly more than a flat bevel against the plinth , all strength had been defined away . Under Roman hands it regained some strength , but with a different bias , with none of the old interrelation , with but an echo of its in-tellectual expression . Perhaps it also came to Rome through the Etruscans as the name of its most simple off-shoot , the Tuscan order , suggests ; perhaps it grew into its new form when the direct Greek influence had begun to ? operate ; but by whatever paths it reached its final shape it continued a direct development of stone significance which might have begun in the Egyptian temple of the Sphinx . The column , now , was lifted from its relaxed grip on the floor and a moulded base , on a square plinth , was inserted ; the shaft was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part was cut off , by a semicircular moulding which surrounded it , to become part of the capital and to restore somewhat the diminished effectiveness of that feature . The flattened echinus was bulged into a quarter circle , the annu-lets under it were stiffened into one , or several , square projections , and a small crowning moulding was placed around the abacus . The entablature was reduced and sim-plified and , although triglyphs and metopes sometimes still formed the frieze , they had lost their old relationships , were no longer adjusted to stre Agthen the corners , and had become , in the Roman fashion , no more than surface deco-ration . The Greek Doric had been the symbol of articu-lated , organic life ; the Roman Doric was but a series of superposed details which , with considerable strength and ' 170 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE dignity , symbolized support . At this , the historic development of the form has stopped . As the Romans made it , after the Greek decline , it possessed the same weakness of adaptability as the Ionic , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , through the Renaissance , become ouj own . // The Ionic , as structure , remained essentially itself . Its forms survived without major alteration , but much of the grace and beauty which had been in the Greek was lost . What , to the Greek , had been he essential ? the idea ? was clouded and a Roman variant carried the sys tem back almost to be a stone replica of its an cient eastern ancestor where spiral scrolls had been fastened around a column . The most character istic Roman order was the Corinthian . This again was Greek in ori gin ' but late in date ; had been almost com pleted by Greek hands and on Greek soil after the intellectual demand for real fitness of form to structural use had slackened . It was the most ornate , the most unintellectual of the recognized classic sys tems and , as such , ap pealed to the ostenta tion of the Romans , who made it what we may call their national order and , in spite of the individuality in almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a formula . The shaft is taller in proportion even than that of the Ionic , the mouldings of the base are usually richer and more complicated , but the capital has the greatest divergence from the other or // ders for which the Greeks were primarily responsible . The echinus is replaced by a high inverted bell which supports the abacus and is not unlike the flower-shaped cap of Egypt in its arrangement of scrolls and leaves against a core , the lines of which continue those of the column . The sides of the abacus are hollowed into curves and the four blunt corners project like hornseo be upheld by small volutes and supporting leaf-forms . Below this , the two circlets of acanthus leaves around the bell spring from a moulding at the necking and are so spaced that the midribs of the taller and inner row show between the edges of the others , and so that one rib is on the central axis of the column . The leaves lie flat against the bell until , near their tops , they curve gracefully , bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft is continued through the capital , diminishing in its emphasis as the leaves , one row after the other , retard and then bend back the springing line until only the corner volutes under the horns of the abacus carry the final push against the horizontal block . There is here none of the fundamental stony quality of the Doric . The frank but conventional rendering of natural forms makes the expression less truly architectural . The superstructure is similar to that of the Ionic with the addition in many cases of another course of supporting blocks , projecting scroll-like forms ? modillions ? spaced evenly above the dentils to uphold the fascia of the cornice . There were other Roman orders , complications of these major systems , which exaggerated luxury , piled ostentation on ignorance and expressed the vulgarity that may lie in wealth . They were a far cry from the Greek adjustments . That what the Greek had made his own he had perfected , Rome could not understand and all the Roman forms which had generated from the Greek would have been disclaimed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehood and their inconsistency , but at the obvious mechanical preROMAN // cision and labored richness , as the blatant attempt to produce effects , which was present often in the Roman orders and in the Roman mouldings . The mechanical quality also controlled proportion . We saw , when we noted the subtle symmetry of the Greeks , // how Vitruvius , following the Roman tradition of their methods , mistakenly ascribed to them systems in which a simple line , usually the measure of the lower diameter of the column , was made to proportion all the combination into heights and widths which were multiplications or simple fractions of this one length . This was the Roman scheme and has become our own . Gone arCall the subtle ratios of the Parthenon and in their places an evident mathematical summation , an indefinite repetition . What the Greeks had realized as a fundamental aid to vision and had perfected in all its subtle responsiveness , the Romans hardened and , in their practical minds , congratulated themselves on their achievement . Indeed , the Romans , no matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best work of the Greeks and in spite of the contempt which the old Greeks would have had for them , vastly preferred their own interpretations to the masterpieces they purported to resemble . The Parthenon would have been completely out of place in Rome and , likely , would have been rebuilt and " modernized . " WE can not linger to detail all the types of structure which Rome devised to fill the needs of her complication . The temples which contained her gods , the triumphal arches which celebrated the victories of her emperors , the immense palaces which housed their splendor , the circuses and amphitheatres within which were staged the spectacles to keep the populace amused , all were expressions of the pagan Rome that was to die ; their realization had little place in the development which continued after the physical power had succumbed and they would have ceased to function for the future , except as curiosities amid their ruin , just as did the towering tenements and squalid narrow streets , had not the excited imaginations of a later age seen in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting fact and one which later we shall find significant , // that it was , in part , the influence scattered by the final fall of Roman power ? by the late crumbling of the empire in the east ? which turned back men 's minds to copy the pagan monuments in the west where , for a thousand years , building on what was fundamentally great in Rome 's accomplishment ? on the hints from her structural stability ? architecture had advanced very far beyond the lessons Rome had taught . The ghosts of these pagan Roman buildings were destined to stunt some continued flower of the Christian development which Rome 's best influence had started . Because of this it has been necessary that we , should understand the point of view of their creation , which has been handed on to us . There were , however , among them , types which from the predominance of the Roman engineering power , from some real fitness to their use ? to their direct expression ? or from some accident of history which carried their usage into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlived the inconsistency of their original conceptions , became germs of architectural accomplishment beyond themselves . More than this , there were in the pagan combinations some principles which were worthy to continue but which the contradiction of events decreed should cease to operate , should fall into oblivion with the orders and should only reappear in the distant future when , with the Renaissance , the complication and luxury of living became again comparable to the life of Rome . Such was the case with the complex and articulated plans that we have mentioned . The actual uses which had made them necessary to the Romans , arfi had therefore led to their invention , did not continue into the barbarian existence which followed the fall of Rome . Society had taken a new complexion , had neither the power nor the wealth immediately for great constructions , had not the education to make use of them in the Roman manner . The // huge public baths are perhaps the best example of the thing we mean . As life had become luxurious , these had grown to be centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions of the bath itself ? hot rooms and cold rooms and steam rooms and broad pools for swimming ? many other allurements to attract the citizens . There were halls for conversation , libraries and exercising grounds , together with all the minor functions of a pam pered daily living . Now if these many things were to be combined into one building and if they were to be so placed that they could be easily accessible one from an-other , as well as so obvious in their position that they could be found , in all their intricacy , without confusion , a great deal of practical thinking was necessary . The plans of these vast groups of chambers and passages show remarkable ingenuity and balance ; the manner in which the importance of one feature or another is emphasized indiROMAN // cates an appreciation of values , a constructive skill in de-sign , where the utilitarian necessity of convenience was predominant , that was far more worthy than the archi tectural inconsistency which covered the elevations . These plans and the engineering cores which soared above them contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue and only reappeared with the ' recrudescence of the architectural inconsistency , but on a smaller scale and on a different plane the power which invented them re mained in operation . Rome developed buildings to house the functioning of her law and included in them the facilities for more gen eral congregation . These were the basilicas . The word was Greek but the type in its completion was due to Rome and it was the legal use which reacted on the Roman power to plan and fixed the form so that it became of service to the future . The characteristic basilica of the empire was a great hall divided into three aisles by colonnades or ar cades , the central aisle being both wider and higher than those which flanked it so that its walls might project above their roofs and might be pierced by windows . This is a feature which is called the clerestory and which be-came of importance in the later development from this type . At one end of the building , sometimes at both ends , there was a semicircular projection roofed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also carried forward to structural discovery . In the Roman buildings its floor was raised somewhat above the general floor and was shut away by low screens called , in Latin , " cancelli . " Here was the sitting of the Roman court . An altar occupied the center and around the curved outer wall were seats for the lesser officials on either side of the thronelike chair for the magistrate himself . Whatever of extravagance the en-closing walls displayed ? and they were characteristically Roman in their detail ? there was in this arrangement a simple and dignified adaptation to the conventions of I // legal practice . Even so , it could not attract our special interest had it not been that the Christian Church in its new-found power , in its new-found coincidence with the mechanics of the empire , found here the arrangement it desired for its own ritual , settled itself into the actual ancient buildings and carried their scheme forward to be the basis of the expression of the new ideal . The development of Christian architecture in the west ? beyond the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the east it followed , without the gap , the suggestion from another Roman type that had been long in use . Rome not only put the semicircle in the air , but she made use of the circle on the ground , and buildingstemples ? round in plan seem to have been as traditional with her as were those which were rectangular . Examples still exist at Rome and at Tivoli , near by , circular walls surrounded by Corinthian colonnades . The upper parts are gone , but whether these were domed or not , the dome became the recognized roof for such constructions . The Roman method of casting a dome in concrete made possible its use without essential thickening of the lower wall which supported it and the most complete survivor of imperial glory in the city itself , the Pantheon , belongs to this class , although it has no peristyle and although the construction of its dome was unusual in that it contained a frame of interacting arches . There has been much discussion as to the function of this building ; perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baths , but we have nothing finer that pagan Rome accomplished and , in its present isolation , there is a simplicity of mass which dwarfs the inconsistency of applied detail . A deep Corinthian portico , crowned by a pediment , opens into the single rounded hall where the heavy walls are lightened in effect by niches and screen colonnades . Above , the great dome ? a flattened curve against the sky , a semicircle on the inside where its full sweep is made evident ? continues the walls and rises // unbroken to an open eye at the summit , through which light is shed into the building . During the centuries , much of the decoration has vanished and it may be that we see the building now more dignified , more the expression of the underlying Roman genius than Rome intended or desired . Certainly , to us , it is a landmark in her architectural accomplishment and was worthy to stand midway in the development from which the eastern Church created an even greater worthiness . So far we have considered only the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength of fact and will that was in the , Roman power to build . The situation was very different from anything preceding it , could not have been otherwise . Greece had reached perfection in the architectural ideal she had made her own . Rome , without an architectural ideal , tried her // hand at almost all the problems which the future was to solve and , where her own constructive ability could act , she made real progress , helped the future on its way , but nowhere brought complete solution . In the many types of building which filled the city and were scattered in profusion throughout the empire , no one type stands out predominant . There was no rival , no possible successor to the Parthenon . Nowhere do we find a combined working actuated by clear purpose . Style fluctuated with the changing desires and the history of what Rome herself considered the Roman architecture followed the steady decline of the physical pagan power . And the architecture , as Rome saw it , was not in the Roman fundamentals of its instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never subtle ; rested its case with a brutal frankness on the ostentation which Rome considered art . There would be no gain for our analysis in reiteration of these qualities except to point out that in Rome 's case they were inevitable , were founded on all the past and on the conditions of Rome 's existence which her character had concentrated , while in their reestablishment by the Renaissance no such inevitability was present . What was a natural growth for Rome was an arbitrary imposition by the later age . For Rome , the historical expression was true , was built on fact and remained consistent in its inconsistency ; for the Renaissance the expression was invented and remained a pose , no matter how great the enthusiasm which directed it . These things we must remember because of their final application to ourselves . Rome built upon the ability of others than herself ; her legacy to the future from her pagan embellishment was founded in the will to copy without the power to discriminate between her models and without the imagination to mould copy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era the luxury of this pagan expression ran out its course and had alROMAN // most ceased among the turmoil of the political confusion when the Emperor Constantine brought a new physical unity to the empire , acknowledged the sovereignty of Christianity , and predicated the final separation between east and west . Roman expression , almost from this moment , merged into Christian expression or , more accurately , was supplanted by Christian expression . There was no startling break in form , but it was the Church now which made decision of what was worthy or useful and wrought the combinations it desired from the viewpoint of the spiritual unity it proclaimed . It is significant that as the pagan forms had become ever more degraded and confused , as they had lost even the external beauty of workmanship , some logic had pervaded the combinations . The arch ac182 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE tually had begun to assert its function , the structural re lationships of the instruments had gathered some coher ence as their profusion lessened . The Roman forces which were to carry forward had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces and almost seem to have gathered some of the order which the Greek half of the empire was destined finally to reestablish . It.is possible that this new Greek influence ? a certain return of the old intellectual power over form ? was acting uni versally , if subconsciously , throughout the expression of the empire before it came openly in the train of the reli religion whose dogma it had helped to formulate . Certainly this Greek power was always in the expression which the Church created , but the unity of that expression was short-lived . The empire split , its interests clashed , its architec ture followed the divergent , paths of east and west . It is necessary to make a clear distinction here because the future was completely separate in the re sults which developed from this divergence , but , for the moment , it would be misleading to forget all the interactions which continued until the fall of western Rome and indeed thereafter sporadically for many centuries . Both east and west built upon the sugges tions from Rome 's stability of construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the east drew its inspiration from the dome , the west from the basilica . Now , the bishop seated himself within the apse where once the magistrate had been , with the lesser clergy on the bench at - either hand , isolated by the screen from which comes our word chancel and before the altar which they // faced , where sacrifice had once been made to Jupiter or Mars , was now celebrated the worship of the Christian God . Time , as it changed the ritual of this worship , increased the complications of its material expression , but the basili-can type remained almost unchanged even as new buildings rose beside the originally pagan ones which Christianity had commandeered . Some additions naturally were made . An outer wall or group of buildings usually enclosed the space before the western front whence , through a portico , three doors led into the column-separated hall of the sacred edifice itself , a reminder , although without historical connection , of the old axial development of the Egyptian temple . Externally there were few attractions . The early Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empire had already melted , and the simple brick walls , often unfortunate in proportion , gave little indication of the richness within , stripped in many cases from some pagan structure . The Church , in power , had ceased to-regard tolerance as a virtue and had turned destroyer . // At this point we must leave the growth of western Christian architecture . Under the virile impulse from the barbarian blood that was to come it achieved the great expression of the new ideal ; under the remains of Roman influence it had realized no more than the establishment of an increased order among the old environment . Rome was too weakened to create new architectural systems , as she was too weakened to grasp all the advantages of the new unity that was in the Christian ideal . All the surviving creative power remained with the Greek race which now , under the Roman name , was freed from the Roman power and was embarking on its last experiment in civilization . THE architecture of the eastern empire ? Byzantine architecture stands usually on the pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So to consider it , however , is to separate it from its heredity . It is true that any growing impulse from Rome was over , that the new orderliness came from Greek minds and from Greek hands and that it was accomplished in the Greek lands , but it was an orderliness which was wrought from the old Roman inconsistency , which carried onward Rome 's structural suggestion , which continued the Roman method , of rough cores overlaid with a more beautiful architectural surface . There was no historical break in the events of construction and the new order had begun to assert itself throughout the empire before the dissolution of the western half . The Roman genius was mingled with the Greek although the Greek was master , but it was not the old Greek , nor yet the softened pagan Greek of the earlier Roman periods . The new impulse came from the Greece which had met the east and accepted eastern thoughts , which had spread over eastern territory and learned to understand the new ideal that had germinated in the east , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Byzantines was a Christian Greece , disillusioned from // its ideal of intellect , but persisting in , ? or renewing , ? in spite of all , its intellectual power over form . We can realize this immediately we contrast the By zantine encrusted architecture against the older Roman , for again Greece had wrought a unity . The fundamental facts of core and covering remained , but they were created with a single purpose , to express one thing . Neither was dominant . Structure was shaped for the best advantage of the covering and the covering was arranged to conceal no working of the structure . Forms which might have a con structive meaning never were made mere decoration , but accomplished the purposes of their designs , and both struc ture and decoration had taken on a new effectiveness be yond the increased order of unity . The development of the dome on unbroken circular walls could not have progressed further perhaps than its ac complishment in the Pantheon . The problem which grew from it solved the difficulties of placing a circular dome on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the ten-sided cupola of the so-called temple of Minerva Medica , nearly three centuries later than the Pantheon , there was a suggestion of it , and definite progress was evident in the church of San Vitale in Ravenna , but this was so nearly contemporary with the complete solution that we must look elsewhere for the progressive steps in the experiment . Such of them as still exist are in a group of churches in central Syria , a province of the east . It was Greece at work again , the new Greece of the duality of in tellect and instinct , but in this constructive prGgress , de veloping the engineering hints from Rome , we can almost see the reasoned mind of old Greece in its power of defini tion . More structural ingenuity perhaps was needed to meet this problem than had hitherto been called upon . The cir cle of the dome , touching the four sides of a square , left great discrepancies and the clumsy ways in which these // openings at first were filled and the very moderate gains with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evinced the difficulties ; yet , once solved , the conclu-sion showed itself inevitable . In the finished form , four open arches made the square , above which rose the dome , its lower circle resting on the central point of each arch . The openings between vertical arches and horizontal circle were filled with continually warping surfaces of material that amounted to spherical triangles with their apexes turned downward , with their sides clinging along the arches , and with their in verted bases , each one a quarter circle , meeting and holding the rim of the dome , the weight of which was transmitted , through triangles and through arches , to the same corner piers from which the arches sprang . This triangular feature of tran-sition is the pendentive and is one of the mechanical inven-tions which have gradually made our architectural struc-tural vocabulary what it is today . It is a fact to be remembered that almost every new phase of expression has taken its impulse contemporary with , if not directly from , some gain in the power of construction , from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendentive opened enormous possibilities and with its use much of the old immobility of structure disap-peared and active forces , having to be met and balanced , came into play . New Greece put life into the inert stability of Rome . // The dome on pendentives became the central structural feature of Byzantine architecture . Its expression dominated detail and the preparation for the decorative surface which was a controlling factor in the original conception , restricted detail . The arches rose from piers or columns , but the tyranny of the orders had been broken . The shafts were usually monolithic and of rich material ; the capitals bulged into what might have seemed uninteresting cushions had it not been for the deeply incised and expressive carving and the broad rests which were created for the springing of the arches , making of the capitals splendid instruments to do the thing that was needed and to show their action . Beyond the supports there was little detail , almost no projection , little moulding . Every building was frame and decorative surface and the frame was flattened for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became plastic in its structure in reaction from the plastic surface . The structure was the definition of the lingering intellectual power of old Greece , but it was softened almost , in its definition , to receive all the emotional order of its surface , just as the sharpness of the intellect had been softened to meet the intangibility of the new ideal . The surface contained all the color of the east , impassioned by the Christian faith and regulated by the Greek mind . Rome had used mosaics in her buildings , pieces of stone fitted together forming pictures , but now they were made of brilliant or deeply colored bits of glass , were spread over every possible part of the building , were made as much the essence of the building as was the structure which was formulated for them and which they respected in their expression of ideas beyond the structure . The luster of their combination covered the interiors of domes and apses and walls with reflecting light and outdid Egypt in its gorgeous tapestry of color , for what in Egypt had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lines of saints and processions of courtiers , groups of // the Holy Family or of the imperial one , adorned the churches . The panoply of heaven , as the Byzantines imagined heaven , vied with the even more magnificent ceremony of the earthly court , and heaven remained very reminiscent of worldly things . Eastern Christianity may have had all the passion and all the faith of the ideal , but its expression did not rise far above that of the mundane life which had satisfied old Greece . And now the life , which was becoming formula , expressed itself in formula , in convention . The vitality of this last impulse to create was shortlived , but the vitality to resist became almost as that of Egypt , so that the architecture of the Byzantines , during the centuries of its repetition , remained apparently alive to offer suggestions that were , as we shall see , important to the west . // Most of the buildings of this style were comparatively small and , even in their aggregate , could not attract so much attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life centers of the empire gathered in Constantinople , the church of Saint Sophia , dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God , arose to dominate the city , and combined all the threads of structural progress , all the pomp of empire and all the confidence of Christian worship into one such mighty unity of architectural expression that nothing like it had been seen since the erection of the Parthenon . It was essen tially a church yet , like the Parthenon , this Christian mas terpiece had not received any of that Gothic aspiration to-ward hidden mysteries that the western nations were to bring with their development . Saint Sophia expresses the old Greek concept of the beauty of this life , expresses it with all the pomp and disillusionment of the eastern empire , and expresses it in the name of Christ and God , but mys tery is absent from its vast interior . Procopius , the his torian of the reign of the Emperor Justinian , during which time the building was erected , tells us in his description of its freshness that the dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to cover the space beneath as though it were suspended from heaven by the fabled golden chain , " and that the enclosed air is so " singularly full of light and of sunshine , you would declare that the place is not lighted by the sun from without , but that the rays are produced within itself.71 Saint Sophia was a unique accomplishment , created to be the symbol of that royalty which symbolized the empire , rather than to be the symbol of God . With all its beauty it was a worldly church and its erection helped to drain the national resources and to make the people miserable . The structural scheme was a departure from anything // that had gone before . The manner in which the weight of the dome is balanced by the other factors of the roof and is finally transmitted to the ground shows that the forces which may abide in stone or brick were beginning to shake off their inertia and call attention to themselves as living things . In plan , the mass is square with a flattened dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows and which hangs nearly two hundred feet above the floor . The weight is partly held by four great arches and pendentives which spring from immense piers and form an inner square touching the dome , but the pressure is so much that other outlets are needed and two great half-domes fit , one the east and one the western arch , and carry off the active forces to where , below , they are distributed on heavy walls and apsidal formations until they , reach the ground . This arrangement serves not only to equalize the struc tural thrusts , but also to create a vast nave , running the length of the building beneath an ever-lifting ceiling which // gave space for the unprecedented pomp of the imperial ceremonies . To north and south , instead of the half-domes , massive buttresses regulate the pressure and , as they rise among the roofs , they give a certain ungainly quality to the exterior , make it seem almost to crouch , weighted to the earth . Indeed , the great beauties of the building are // within , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encrustation so that we can not judge how the exterior would have appeared if some original conception had been carried through in its completeness . The treasures of the empire were gleaned to embellish the interior . Columns and precious marbles were plundered from the ancient temples of Asia and of Egypt and of Greece . Mosaics and colored slabs covered the walls in all the profusion of Rome , but without the inconsistency . Here , not only were the forms used as they should have been used , but they were made to show , by their juxtaposition of proportions , the real vastness of the building . The details of the columns and of the smaller arches were so placed in connection with the larger spans that those parts near the ground , the size of which may easily be compared with that of a roan , make the eye instinctively appreciate the ever-increasing bigness of the upper features and even of the dome , which spans more than a hundred feet . This quality which permits a structure to show forth its true size we call scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as the complication of design increases , it becomes an important factor for good or ill , so that we must partly base our architectural judgments on whether it has been properly considered or ignored . Saint Sophia was the last achievement in the architectural development some of whose roots were founded in the Roman power , before that development passed , in any creative sense , out of the bounds of what had been the Roman empire , and Saint Sophia was the greatest building which had been reared within the bounds of Rome . It was a magnificent expression of one phase of the Christian ideal and , as such , its position in regard to the earlier Roman work was similar to that of the later Gothic , but there was , here , a more intimate connection . The Gothic was to grow , founded in Rome 's suggestion , but beyond the gap of the barbarian invasions , and to grow from the new ex- . // perience in civilization , of new races . The Byzantine and its culmination in Saint Sophia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic could shed the contradiction ? between the Christian and the pagan life because its creators were the destroyers of the pagan ; the Byzantine could not forget the millenniums of pagan culture which had been more effective in the evolution of its builders than had the newly proclaimed religion of Christ . AT this point , perhaps , we leave all that we can even broadly claim as Roman architecture , but there is one other expressive building , centuries nearer to ourselves , which was more a descendant of Rome , more a connection of Saint Sophia , than it was a relation of its own contemporaries ? Saint Mark 's in Venice . The face of Venice was always to the east . By tradition and in fact she had more in common with the Byzantines than with barbarian Italy . The church of Saint Mark was a slow growth , through many changes . In its final form it stands as much alone as does Saint Sophia , a packed treasure-house of the spoils from many lands and yet , in spite of all additions , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross , forming five squares , all crowned with flat domes which are separated from each other by shallow vaulted spaces . The nave runs east and west and its roof includes three domes , but the lateral axis stretches just as far and its projections on either side create a transept . Ilere , the definite centering of the plan breaks up all semblance of the basilican idea and fixes the attention under the central dome . There is little light and the gold grounds of the mosaics gleam among dim shadows and from corners screened away by polished columns . Saint Mark 's has gathered all the mystery and all the instinct of Christianity . It speaks out such understanding of hidden // things that the worshiper can not escape an overwhelming surety of something present which his senses fail to realize . Some deity broods throughout the place , demanding homage and accepting as its due all the beauty that man can work from rich material . Here the unseen becomes almost tangible , but makes no demand upon the adorer beyond wonder and worship . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond the walls , into a sphere where he can believe that he , himself , is part of God . Without , Saint Mark 's has attained all the beauty of surface , all the luxury of decoration which was denied the church at Constantinople . The upper part is largely Gothic and the bulbous coverings which hide the Byzantine domes increase its individuality , but the mosaics and the beautiful marble slabs with which the walls are faced show the results that may be attained by the method of encrustation . It is true that the front is lined with tiers of columns , trophies which were brought from conquered cities and , although the richness of their ordered lines is superb , they do transgress the law of usefulness . To some extent the sentiment which made them symbols of the Venetian prowess offered to the city 's patron saint , reduces our criticism , and the great visual harmony of the entire structure must make us view it with deep reverence . Few thinking men can stand unmoved before the beauty of Saint Mark 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty which was in Greece and Rome ; which Rome misunderstood from Greece , but passed onward to Greece again so that the Greek power over form which had defined the ideal of intellect for the past , should underlie the new expression of the future as it transcended intellect and beleaguered heaven . CHAPTER VIII FRANCE ROME was engulfed . The northern barbarians possessed the west . Christianity , surviving from the Roman past , imposed itself on the barbarian soul and attempted the control of the barbarian action . This was the beginning of our own phase of complication ; these barbarians were our ancestors ; all their experiments in living descend to us through the perpetuation of their blood which is our own . It is easy at this point to docket history , to say " Here is the end of the measured , self-sufficient , material pagan civilization and the beginning of a new existence , of a new point of view evolved through the development of new races . " It would be easy , as we visualized the progress of // this development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mission and passing onward to another distinct in its own achievement . On the surface , there Would be truth in this insistence on periodic definition ; indeed it is the culminating expression of one such period , of one such phase in the barbarian development , that we now must analyze , but if in that analysis we lose the thought of the underlying continuity of human life ? of its growth and its expression ? we shall lose the significance of the particular moment in which our interest centers , for we shall cut it away from the past which made it possible and from its future which has grown to be our present . The human total in the sum of evolution is after all so relatively small and so surprisingly comparable within itself that the homogeneity of development is , in the broadest sense , the fundamental fact even where we can separate into distinct races and realize vast eras of time . Our analysis has narrowed to a group of related peoples and to but little time as evolution measures time . The diversities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the significance of passing thoughts in the total of the future , yet it is the diversity which must incite the human interest . It is the progress through diversity to further difference ; it is the combination between diversities , which is the expression at least of the deeper progress , and this passage from the Roman world to the confusion which juxtaposed the still uncoinbined elements of what we call the modern , must remain significant , not because of the immediate and apparent break in civilization , but because of the immense possibilities it gathered for the future complication . So much would seem to hang on this transition that it is worth our while to pause long enough to recapitulate the situation , to take stock of this seemingly bankrupt past for the benefit of the future to which , after all , it paid so high percentage . We have seen how Greece , through her // own peculiar genius , created an ideal of human living ? perhaps the first ideal in the history of the nations which could transcend , in its rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility to become allhuman and timeless . We have seen Greece foreshortened in the perspective of the centuries and it is easy to forget that she was created ? on a smaller scale ? almost as our own present was created . The first Greeks were the barbarian conquerors of a complication older and less united than Rome 's , but one which , through a group of turbulent centuries , tried out and sifted the ideas which the further past presented . The Greek ideal evolved in the Greek mind , but from all the ideas of the older races with which that mind came in contact . The creation was from the elements of complication , but after racial consideration of these elements by Greece . Analogy can never be conclusive , but often it is illuminating toward conclusion . Our western Europe did not create the Christian ideal , but drew it from the Roman world wherein it had germinated from the combined thoughts of many peoples and many ages ; had been concentrated by an example which inspired the conviction of divinity ; had been formulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome . It is not historically comparable to the Greek ideal because it was not the creation of the new force which was to mould the future complication , but was the first great reaction of the old elements on this new force . As such ? as an element toward the future of the western nations ? it is comparable to the old ideas ? among which were its own first eastern germs ? which preceded Greece and through which the Greek ideal developed . The Christian Church was a legacy to the west from all the past and the first great expression of the west was the expression of the Church , a statement so convincing in its beauty that it stands to rank with the Greek and has perhaps the same power to become // all-human and timeless on the intuitive plane which the Greek ideal possessed on the plane of reason . We must insist , however , for the moment , on the historical contrast in the creation of the two ideals because the suggestion of the analogy continues . Greece , judging the elements which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow in the later future of the barbarian nations that they also will create ? Is it possible that they have begun to do so ? Will the west , sifting and judging all that it has gathered from the past , from the Greek ideal of intellect and the Christian ideal of feeling , build a new and more inclusive ideal into the centuries to come ? All this is immediately pertinent to our inquiry , even in the remoteness of any possibility of definition beyond conjecture , because it involves the very fundamentals of architectural expression , because the line of expression which continued in the west after the fall of Rome is still in operation and will remain so beyond ourselves , and because all the phases of this western expression have been the gropings of closely related cultural groups toward an end which even our present has not defined . Again the analogy ? after the Greek ideal had been created it did not weaken , its expression did not relax until the vitality of the Greek action had worn itself out . The created ideal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . The Christian ideal came to the west at the beginning of the western vigor and the unity , the intensity , the conviction of ideal expression fell away as the vigor of living took on new complexion , but with increase rather than diminution of power . The Christian ideal in its demand for inspired unity could not have been the final and fundamental ideal of the western nations , for their development has continued beyond that unity and their accomplishment has been broadened rather than restricted by the shattering of that unity . If the suggestion in the analogy is true , the summit of the western vigor is still to be attained , to be defined , to be // expressed . It is with this hope that we must look upon the phases of our own ancestral growth that lie between the Roman downfall and ourselves . It is always with this possibility in mind that we must visualize the changing architectural statement of ideal and of conviction . And if almost in the first flowering of western expression we shall find attempted a definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasoned confidence of Greece , combines with Greece in a duality of intellect and feeling to which no more recent statement of ideal has added significant matter or beauty , it is perhaps to all the present threads of complication that we may look to trace some evidence for the conviction that before the slackening of its vigor , the west will , in its own turn , create , will reforge the ideal , will find perhaps the fundamental unity behind the duality of intellect and feeling that we know . WE shall not presume to restate the Christian ideal . As a philosophy of life it is the reaction of the human to a conviction of eternal and immutable truth ? of divine fact ? which in turn reacts on humanity in judgment . It presupposes all the elements of the Greek ideal but deprives the human intellect of its Greek function of ultimate definition . Christianity judges humanity not in terms of itself , but in the terms of its conception of God ; its desires ? in the ideal ? have left the earthly plane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a life beyond the cares of earth ; in an assurance dependent altogether upon the intuition for its promise . The Christian life parallels the Egyptian in its insistence on eternity , but predicates the enjoyment of futurity upon the quality of the earthly life , not upon the advantages . It has left fact to found itself in obligation . The Christian ideal did not come to the new west in the simplicity of its intuitive statement . It came with the form of Greece and with the imperial preconceptions of Rome . // It came , not to offer the conviction of salvation , but to demand the universal acceptance of the code on which salvation depended . Itself the child of intuition , it allowed no latitude to the instinct of the individual , for it had wrought its formula and the admission of even the potentiality of question would weaken the fabric of its dominance . Before Rome fell , the Church was militant with an intolerance which contradicted Rome , and the chains it fastened on the unlettered imaginations of the barbarians were stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . They leveled man to a unity ? physical , mental , eternal ? which the Greek ideal had never demanded , a unity of obligation irrespective of worldly station , and they produced expression so unified in its massed results , so collective , so potentially cooperative in its endeavor that , until the enthusiasm of its unity relaxed , the Christian expression absorbed all the faculties of the western world . The Church was the first great civilizing factor in the western life . For centuries it was the dominant factor imposed on growth by the Roman past which was the inclusive past of all that Rome had gathered . The vitality of the Christian enthusiasm accorded with the vitality of the barbarian exuberance in the freshness of its culture and was accepted by the barbarian mind before that mind had begun to question beyond its imagination , but the Christian vitality was not from the enthusiasm of youth and contradicted the freshness of youth in the western culture . The west grew beyond the unity of the ideal before its youth entirely succumbed , but it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it admitted new factors to influence the development of civilization , it could not throw aside , when it discarded the complete conviction in the ideal , the questionings which the aspiration toward the ideal had fostered . The current of expression in the west began in the Chris202 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE tian Church , was at its greatest ? to the present ? in its interpretation of the ideal behind the Church and it was , almost in its beginnings , the culminating expression in which that ideal has flowered , but the current has passed , historically , beyond that ideal to things which the present has not yet defined . The moment which we must try to visualize was the moment of the utmost unity of the Christian faith . After that our path will lead us to face , from the reality of their expression , the facts which , beyond the unity of Christianity , have widened the possibilities of complication and which lead us through the present to what may be the more complete ideal definition of the future . AMoxG the races which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the Church had established its sovereignty . The unity of the ideal was proclaimed and was enforced . It reached the barbarian peoples at a moment in their development when its intuition , its imagination , its miracle , might bring , not understanding perhaps , but an ardor of faith which found more satisfaction in its mystery , more unthinking conviction in its divinity than would have been possible for any reasoned definition of the facts of existence and than would have been possible for these same peoples in any other stage of culture . Generally speaking , it imposed itself on every individual , became the confessed faith of every individual , whatever the idiosyncrasies of his daily action and of his personal character , but since in these barbarian conquerors there were the germs of all the human diversity which makes our present , the ideal reacted on men in different ways . Broadly , it divided the populations between the priests and the laity , between the men who found their vocation altogether in religion and those who maintained a life whose earthly aim was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow , must be guided by religion . And as always , behind the evident division there was an infinite shading of action and purpose which must have negatived the categories in the understanding of the All-Seeing Divinity of Judgment which the ideal predicated ; a shading from the ecstatic recluse who made himself a hermit thinking to serve his God , through the beggared monk whose service had some tincture of humanity , through the parish priest more'human and more balanced , through the churchman who cloaked his worldly leanings under his religion , through the layman who excused , even to himself , his inconsistencies of action by the religious posture of his reaction , to the warrior who buried his conscience in the forgiveness of religion , to the poor peasant who observed the forms religion taught him and who lived close to the earth without thought or desire beyond the earth . But to the mediwval mind the categories were real , were distinct , were divinely established . The Church had erected a celestial hierarchy of martyrs and saints and angels whose powers graduated through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infinitely divine Trinity of God Himself . The reaction of the Church erected the complementary categories of priests and laymen into earthly hierarchies . On the one side were the monks , the priests , the abbots , the bishops and the pope , who was the divine vicar of God on earth ; on the other , in all the interacting obligation ? and all the actual contradiction ? of feudalism , were the people , the nobles , the kings , the emperor . Christianity , supplanting Rome , had conquered the conquerors of Rome and had imposed on their confusion the idea at least of the material Roman unity as the greatest earthly weapon to insure the ideal unity of faith which the Church demanded . But the pope was not content with heavenly things and the emperor would not yield to him in earthly ones . Their struggle punctuated the mediteval ac204 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE tion with alternate divine and worldly victories in the continual skirmishing for earthly domination that accentuated the impossibility of the complete unity which was not after all essentially within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown under the ideal declared essential . It is not unfair to make a clear distinction between the original ideal of the Christian faith in all the simplicity of conception whose beauty no dream of man has ever bettered , and the organized dogma of the medieval Church which imposed on the simplicity confused gleanings from all the subtleties of ancient thought and instinct and which imposed on its adherents an unthinking obedience of belief and act which was foreign to the actual teaching of the Christ . This distinction is necessary to us if we are to understand the culmination of expression in the Middle Ages . The early life of the western nations , after the first confusion , was completely formulated by the hierarchies of church and state . Real unity was not attained and such as was imposed was not maintained , but there was more nearly a realization of unity at just this time than has been found before or since . It was a unity of the fear of the unseen , of the fear of future judgment . The Church proclaimed the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it added , as a coessential , a definition of inflexibly judging godhead which might have gone far to negative the love in the minds of the simple people . Fear of hell did much to create the unity of the Middle Ages , reached every man through the earthly hierarchy of religion , restrained much of the brutality of the earthly hierarchy of action . The unity remained comparative , but it was strong enough to create a passing unity of expression which was perhaps the most astonishing reaction the world has ever seen from a single organization . That this expression was filled with almost unimaginable beauty was not due , however , to the // organization but to the unquenchable appeal , to the real divinity of beauty which had been the original essential . The love welled up in spite of hell , forced itself beyond the restrictions of the dogma and the hierarchies , created its own worship in the very face of organization , ignored suggestions of the frown of God and established the Virgin as its mistress , as its intercessor between itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ which the Church had tempered to an avenging blade , passed onward to His Lady Mother and became the most vital power to formulate expression into beauty , became the instrument of an enthusiasm for an ideal of love which coordinated all the passing unity of organization into an outburst of unified expression that shall remain deathless in human history . RELIGION insinuated itself into every phase of life and wrought those phases on which its control depended into the graduated organizations it declared divinely sanctioned . It caught the future unawares and captured the western mind before that mind began to know itself , but there were lines of thought and action which evolved and were continued behind religion and beyond the unity of religion , which in themselves were natural to the west and were accentuated by inheritance , outside religion , from the Roman world . The barbarians when they gained supremacy were at that stage of culture where their imaginations could be fired by the beauty and by the terror which the Church wielded , but they had the instincts of a practical life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the moment when the consciousness of individuals began to combine into the consciousness of nations a new element was born contradictory to the churchly hierarchies of religion and of state , more fundamental and more enduring . The growth was slow and long . In the first cen206 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE turies the very elements of order on which the Church insisted worked also toward the concentrations which were destined to face the material power of the Church in conflict . When the nations fully awoke to the self-consciousness of nationality all pretense of material unity vanished and the unity of expression broke apart into the coordinate streams of national expressions , but there was a period of balance , hardly a century , ? a passing moment as the larger history measures time , ? in which a focusing of all the striving elements so wrought on the expression of the ideal , so gathered into a center of place and purpose and enthusiasm , that all the progress from past to present was held suspended while France created ? no part of the ideal ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the genius to fix the Christian statement , to make the supreme attempt to formulate the intangible . It was a task beyond any power over form that humanity has yet possessed . There was contradiction in its very essence . Even mediaval France in the almost miracle of unity she wrought between form and the fundamental formless did not define the Christian ideal , but she did define completely all man 's feverish aspiration toward the ideal . Almost at the moment when the unity dissolved , when the forces of the future already battered against the immovability of the organization of the Church , France , who had been the leader in attempting material unity and had turned among the first to its destruction , halted before the hope of the ideal unity and sought , in the intense outburst of statement , an affirmation of the ideal which the progressive facts of life denied . All the result was in the attempt . The fervor , the aspiration , the hope that proclaimed assurance , remain eternal ; the unity of definition is still before us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could not be kept even to a duality of religion and of ac- // tion which served religion . Much action and , following , much thought , ignored religion but added fullness to life . We must reiterate the distinction between the Church and the original conception behind it . There is no action which might not be guided by the fundamental predications of Christianity , but such intangible power ? the power of love alone ? did not satisfy the organization which claimed con trol over the application of Christianity , and so material conflict was created which contradicted the Christian spirit . The final beauty of the French expression had passed beyond the dogmatic confines of the Church and was in part made possible by the very forces which were rising to combat the dominance of the Church . Distinction has been drawn by some philosophers of his tory between the imaginative type of man and the practical or commercial type and it has been pointed out that the difference between them is so fundamental that it is one of kind , not of degree , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the infinite gradations between the imaginative and the commercial faculties in individuals and in the nations they combine to form . If we could fix upon a man whose every reaction depended not on fact , but on his personal imaging of fact , on his distortion of fact into the reflection of his personality , a man who lived ignorant even of all trafficking , and if we could fix upon an-other , outside of fiction , who had no instinct beyond the hard facts of barter and of money , we could admit the abso lute distinctness of the types . Proof would demand a per sonal knowledge intimate as that of self , combined with a judgment balanced to recognize the imagination and its opposite . It is impossible . Collectively , it is true that Rome expressed herself in action rather than image-making and that she turned to money as her standard . It is also true that the young western nations grasped the imaginative ideal of Christianity and tried to live it , that it failed them // in its completeness and that they too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and changing balance , not separation into types . It was commercial Rome which accepted imaginative Christianity and passed it onward to control the potentially connnercial barbarians who had overrun the west in their imaginative youth . The imagination reacted on the individual according to the tendency of the individual and with the first order that was reconstructed , commercial habits were resumed and were given new direction . It is true again that the new commerce ? if it were really new ? was connected with the still living Roman cast and that it was seized upon most eagerly by the populations where the new blood was thinnest in the growing mixture , but its spread was rapid even to the peoples where the blood was all barbarian . France held the balance . It was she who first concentrated upon the ideal ; it was she who first attempted the material unity ; and it was she who first maintained a normally increasing nationality contrary to that unity , which called all the weapons of the new commerce to its aid and so broadened among her populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the noble caste which represented the feudal hierarchy , there grew the third estate of merchants . Wealth gave them power and gave them leisure for education which understood the springs of power . It increased the possibility for liberty of thought which might not always accept the dogmatic unity of the Church . The trading centers became cities almost independent in their wealth and always props for the concentrating nationalism which alone was their protection from the actual anarchy of the feudal hierarchy , was their guarantee of the order which commerce needed . The safety of eternity was in the Church , but the safety of earthly living was to grow with the growing earthly wealth . // The French communes and royal cities focused the new spirit of France within the unity of the ideal . From them came the greatest of the French expression and to them , by some students , has been given the final credit for this consummation . Without them certainly it never could have been fixed in its magnificence . Without their wealth , without their variety of mind , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undertake great ventures , the supreme expression never could have flowered . And yet , with all the cities had to give , they remained but the means , the focus of the endeavor . The ideal had come to them from beyond themselves and their aspiration toward it carried them beyond themselves : Their growth threatened the material unity which maintained the ideal unity they attempted to express ; their potentialities separate from the ideal did not predicate significant expression at all . The fear of hell still drove all men to propitiate celestial justice . The earthly organization which claimed to hold the keys of heaven permitted the expenditure of wealth in the service of the Church , the expenditure of trained craftsmanship , to mitigate the rigors of eternity ; men were driven by the pangs of conscience to give that they might be saved and since the cities contained the greatest variety and power of production , the cooperation of their giving became immortal in the coordination of their expression . And there was the other side . No community controlled by Christianity ? absorbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the love , fear since it was based on no substantial fact would have led even sooner than it did to questionings of evidence which would have mitigated fear . The things for which the cities stood tended to break the dominance of the Church , would have made them greater factors in the struggle than they became , had not the nationality which they had fostered // found their local liberty a danger to itself and crushed their spirit , later , to centuries of impotence . But at the great moment of expression there had come no articulate question even of the material dominance of the ideal and the terrible judgment of the Christian God threatened the future of every man . It did so because man permitted it to do so , and man permitted it because he had found his ideal of love in the exquisite figure of the Virgin , which , even in the desperation of his fear , he set between himself and God , to find the assuagement of all fear in the promise of forgiveness . And so , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most concentrated impulses of the French people in their first self-consciousness , there arose in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the most amazing and the most creative of French expression . It was not from all the people . The earth still claimed the masses as it had done in Egypt and Greece and Rome . Slave and serf and peasant were always chattels to which the ideal might stoop , but who could not rise to push expression nearer to its divine source . This is not a point for criticism . Growth was to bring the mass in turn to its own self-consciousness , may in the end permit the mass its own expression , to transcend the past . Christian France had not yet done so , but at this moment there was greater promise of it than the past had given and than was permitted to the future for many centuries . The unity of the ideal was for all mankind , the expression of aspiration toward it was from the devotion of all the classes of the people who might have power to express , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearts of men than in any previous attempt to define the relationships of life . THERE is a lesson in the fact that the ultimate expression of aspiration came , not from the organization of the // Church itself , but from the people , from that part of them at least who had become self-conscious . It would almost seem that the enthusiasm of the statement was from the vigor of the new energy that was growing with nationality and commerce , from the intensity of a new humanity suspected behind the divinity of the Church and more in tune with the inner spirit of the ideal than the Church itself . But if the vigor came from the budding liberty , the matter of action which for a period made possible the liberty , had not become articulate for self-expression . Even to the present no preponderantly economic phase of culture has wrought an ideal of living that has demanded or could produce supreme expression and , in the Middle Ages , the present economic system was in its infancy . Supreme expression ? that of the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of a momentary combination of forces , a momentary balance between the human energy for progress which must continue despite all attempts of definition to dam its movement , between this energy and the ultimate statement of some coordinated attempt toward definition . The mediaeval energy was thrusting toward results beyond the unity of the Christian ideal , toward results of which it did not have itself the least suspicion . It was become gigantic in its power to express and the only matter for expression was in the ideal it still believed divine in unity ; in the ideal around which the organization of the Church had wrought a daily circumstance which made some reaction toward religion a matter of almost hourly necessity for every man , filling existence with deep symbolism for those who saw beneath the fact , weighting existence with the minutiae of obligation whose neglect might bring damnation , for those who met the fact and did not see the symbol . Everywhere , the Church was guiding , was proclaiming love until it saw cause to threaten , when it became terrible // beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell did not permit extinction . The only refuge was in religion , almost the only sanctioned thought beyond the animal sensations of living was in religion or tinctured by it . The energy of a rational existence and the energy of commerce were collecting for the future , but were hardly conscious of themselves under the pressure which the Church exerted over even the most practical-minded of the adventurers toward modern living . And as with the growing centralization the Church itself became established in a certain way upon a money basis , it reached into the resources of rich and poor alike , took from each man his measured toll to complicate the final judgment . of divinity . Our interest is in the concentration of expression which resulted , expression of the ideal which was to pass , intensified by the very energy which brought the passing , but energy which was still so burdened by the weight of the ideal that it must heave and try to fix a colossal statement of all the ideal meant , or stifle unrecognized , and fail the future . Otrrsmn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was restricted in its rapine by the threatenings of the Church and by the growing order which resulted from increased commerce and the consequent political stability . Yet war remained the avocation of a gentleman ; his sword was the best promise of his fortune . Constant battle was the commonplace of life and at the bottom the Church could but acquiesce in a condition whose elements she had the willingness to turn to her own temporal advantage . The barbarians when they had conquered Europe had really been barbarians and it is not surprising that , after the few centuries permitted them for culture before their first great outburst of expression , much of the savage remained to color action . The surpris- // ing thing , rather , was in their aptitude for civilization , was in the avidity with which the barbarian nature grasped the beauty that was in the Christian teaching and applied it beyond the obligations of religion to soften the surface , at least , of action . The codes of chivalry and of romantic love seen often artificial things as we study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not prevent the killing ; all the protestations of the lover might be shocked to silence by the possibility of returned affection . The courtesies of chivalry , the songs of the troubadours , did not influence the fundamental personal reactions of hate and love . They remained to some extent a pose , but it was a pose significant of the desire to beautify existence , a pose which was a human reflection of the divine love the ideal predicated . It may not have restrained the individual in the crisis of his passion , but it modified society so deeply that we feel it in the present and only in the present are we losing some of the beauty of relation which it fostered . As in all such social manifestations , chivalry and romantic love had their excesses , their exaggerations , their hypocrisies . They shaded in their reaction from actual association with religion to a worldly silence in religious things that might seem to deny the presence of the ideal in their conception , but they all resulted from the dominance on life of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its action upon the worldly existence of the feudal hierarchy . From the point of view of the ideal , the expression was restricted , but it gives a further indication of the participation of all castes among the people in the complete expression which had drawn , from just this restricted phase , a more playful finish , a more delicate insistence on pure beauty than could have come from the massed popular energy alone . It is not advancing beyond the present point in our in214 A BACKGROUND TO ARCHITECTURE quiry to state that the culmination of expression was architectural . In our analysis of the Gothic churches we shall find the totaled Christian aspiration of France so far as it was fixed in the expressive media we call art . Form in any sculptural significance , and the beauty of color were so bound to the architectural achievement that our consideration of them must remain connected with the buildings . Literature and music , interesting as they may be in their early fragments , show but beginnings , phases , tendencies ; have not the scope to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unified in stone form as it was unified in no other concrete manner , as it was unified in only one expression of the action , an action we must realize to understand the architecture . Centered in a French endeavor , all feudal Christian Europe proclaimed its aspiration , its conviction in the ideal , by combat against the other eastern religion which had flowered from the same ancient complication and which , as much from likeness as from contrast , had made itself the rival of the Christian . THE religion of Mohammed was a second monotheistic statement of the instinctive interpretation of relationships which had germinated in the east . It was promulgated by a prophet who did not possess Christ 's intensity of love and it was not tempered by any defining power like that of Greece . In its purity it denied form , forbade all images and checked its own growth as an ideal . Remaining formless , it did not create fundamental expression of its own ; depending solely on the instinct , it predicated no intellectual progress among its devotees . Islam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the west drew inspiration from the confrontation of the two ideals . Christianity , working on the vigor of the barbarians , was creating new nations with a new bias of culture in western Europe . Islam , when it absorbed the east , did not // change the east but concentrated it , and the east still had something left to give to the Christian west whose own ideal had been originated in eastern minds . Old forms of expression penetrated the formlessness of Mohammedanism and became the interpreters of its fanatical spirit ; suggestions from old intellectual experiments were built upon in the passing glory of civilization which followed the sudden expansion of Islam . Intellectual definition was inherent in neither faith and the freedom of its application might threaten the dogmas of both , but the power for intellectual definition was present in the western races more strongly than in the eastern peoples and in the end developed at the expense of Christian unity and in spite of the active restrictions of the Church . It was by a curious twist of progress that some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church had banished , should seep into their native west again through the conflict of the rival faiths ; that Islam , which has not progressed in the modern sense , should preserve some germs of the ancient curiosity which underlies our modern science , should build upon them and should transmit them to the future more potential factors than she had found them . The almost conquest of west by east in Christianity increased the possibility of restless questioning between intellect and instinct in western thought and gave it , perhaps , its power of growth . Intellect did not permanently react upon the east , there was little questioning and there has seemed no growth . In this has been the fundamental rivalry which brought the clash of faiths although within itself there was no question of either faith . It was the rivalry between potential growth and potential stability ; it was racial , climatic , geologic , not religious . To us , the significance of the struggle as such is in its possible reaction on the expression of the west . There were two fac216 A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we shall see , the west found suited to its own ideal , which the west took to itself and made instrumental in its own expression , through which the expressive result was immediate and self-evident . Islam also maintained ideas in which the west recognized the kinship of its intellect and which the west gradually absorbed , making them steps toward the expression of a future beyond even our own present . In the quarrel of the faiths the crusades were futile struggles ; in the progress of complication they became essential links beyond the restricted vision of the combatants . CHRISTIANITY imposed on life the ideal which dominated the west ; the barbarian vigor as it concentrated became constantly more eager to express , but neither ideal nor vigor predicated form ; the barbarians were young as nations and form was not inherent in their culture . Much of the ancient store remained from Rome to be the foundation of the expression which was to grow and the final complexion of western form was from the interaction between ideal and vigor . We can not estimate what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rome without the reaction to the east which came with the crusades . By them the achievements of Byzantium and of Islam were opened to the west and the example was so strong in the accomplishment that we must state its complication with the general western culture to be prepared for the appearance in the architecture of forms which can be traced to Byzantine and further eastern sources . It is certain that the Gothic building would have flowered in some different way without the reflex impulse from the crusades , but it is almost certain that this possible different flowering would have possessed the same spirit , the same intensity , the same aspiration , which was present in the actual . The conflict did not add to these , // although its backwash brought new forms to help express them , and the western enthusiasm which tool : up the conflict was the same as that which burst forth in the stone beauty of the architecture , no matter whence the forms . The accomplishment of the crusades was not in their attempt . The earthly kingdom which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly on western lines that it differed from Byzantium more than Byzantium differed from Islam . The divergent pathways of Christian feeling which we realized before the Homan downfall , had continued divergent . The eastern Romans considered the western nations as mere upstarts , whose help perforce they called , but whose assistance was almost more inimical than the enmity of the Mohammedans . The rifts in the Christian dogma were already very vexing and made cooperation impossible between the helped and helpers and , even among the helpers , cooperation was broken by the inconsequence of feudal rivalry . The hierarchy of action which the Church had sanctioned could not maintain the unity that was necessary for success and the western states in Syria and Palestine were overthrown within a short century after thev had been established . In all this striving there was little that was pertinent to the distant future ; it was but a whirlpool in the current of the action , but in its sweep it gathered things of value for the future from a distant shore to which the main strewn had not reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laycd the essential character of the action , displayed the force beneath it and the futility which broke across its surface . The crusades have interest for us beyond result because they themselves became expression and paralleled , as such , the significance of the buildings . The crusades were the climax of response to the demands of the mediaeval Church , but there was little real unselfishness in the adventure- . The Church was almost more // than human in its collected knowledge of humanity and in the basis of its summons is a striking illustration of the way the organization endeavored to force mankind to win entrance into the heaven the Church held out as recompense . Pilgrimage to sacred places had long been pronounced most efficacious in the escape from the results of sin ; the scenes of Christ 's experience were the final goals of pilgrimage . The crusades were massed and embattled pilgrimages , not only to visit but to reconquer these goals from the defilement of the infidels . In their winning , heaven was almost sure for the sinners who undertook the enterprise ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , the earthly power of the Church was spread , the possible dominance over the eastern Church increased . There was no real hypocrisy . Had there been , the very real enthusiasm never could have followed . The Christian hierarchy believed in itself , believed in its mission and prodded its human charges in the sensitive spot where fear still held their imaginations bound to the observance of the forms of the ideal . And as always in the medæval action and its expression , release from fear carried enthusiasm beyond fear to some reflex of the love that was behind fear in the ideal . While the enthusiasm lasted , everything was possible , but the sober practical forces that were in the daily living met facts and lost the certainty at least that was in the fear . The enthusiasm waned , even the possibility of unity was lost ; the crusades were fruitless to the Middle Ages because the future had interposed and turned the results to its own advantage . The ideal had failed to meet the whole of life and life continued its complication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the cathedral of the mediaeval chivalry . All the aspiring motives were behind them ; all the push of Church with its age-old wisdom and of people with their new-found consciousness were in them ; all the beauty // of personal feeling and the recognition of the divine immensity beyond the personal were present . The crusades were the culminating structure of action in the thrall of Christian imagination . Lnagination was their strength ; its failure became their weakness . Imagination had overreached itself , had left the earth , and the facts of earth reconquered life , weighted the scales against imagination until time with its complication should bring another balance and create again supreme expression .
