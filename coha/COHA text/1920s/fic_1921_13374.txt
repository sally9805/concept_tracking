A long narrow room , so lined with books in their cases that one might suspect a book-shop  --  one of those new Washington Square club-like places  --  if it were not for the signs everywhere of one habitual inhabitant . There is a fireplace in which a basket full of coal is almost ceasing to glow ; there is a leaf-table with a student 's lamp , and a lay-out of the pet supplies required by a rather eccentric writer . The ink is in a big pot ; two dozen pens ready for use in their holders , stacks of papers , and neat blotters are at hand ; also in a portfolio hundreds of neatly written sheets . There is a grand piano , upon which , at its curving point farthest from the keyboard , is a low glass bowl crowded with hyacinths , azure and white . There are deep chairs ; doorways into two adjoining rooms , and one into the main hall ( for this suite occupies a floor in an old house that has been made over into apartments ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then a gentleman  --  one supposes him to be the writer , whose name is STEVEN TILLERTON  --  lets himself in by a key . He is in evening dress , with an Inverness that was once rather smarter than it is now , and an opera hat , and cane . He carries his white gloves . A cigarette is in his mouth . Probably he 's fifty  --  possibly more , possibly a little less . He goes directly to the piano  --  and plays the theme of the Ride of the Valkyries . Incidentally he is accompanied by another gentleman  --  his old friend , WALTER PRESCOTT , to whom he talks , but of whom he is not thinking very much just now . PRESCOTT Feeling a little apologetic in the presence of TILLERTON 'S abstraction . I 'm only going to stay a minute . It 's after twelve  --  p. 3 TILLERTON Take off your coat , anyway , wo n't you ? And sit down . Without sitting , he continues to finger at the theme that still gallops through his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it tonight . PRESCOTT Oh , Die Valkyrie . Well , I 'm tone-deaf . Still , I like to go to the opera every once in a while . There 's something highly charged  --  electric  --  exciting , about the Metropolitan on a big night . TILLERTON I know . . . . Have a cigarette . TILLERTON stops playing , takes off his overcoat , and turns on the lights in the chandelier . PRESCOTT No , given up smoking . . . . Doctor 's orders . He has taken up the evening paper . Seeing him absorbed in the headlines , TILLERTON is drawn back to the piano  --  and again touches the keys  --  playing the Ride . Prescott speaks presently , disapprovingly , suddenly . Do you always go when your wife sings ? TILLERTON arises , moves away from the piano , lights a cigarette , and finally decides to answer . TILLERTON You can hardly call her that . I had the honour of being only the second and most obscure of Madame Canava 's four husbands , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm usually there . p. 4 PRESCOTT Expensive habit , is n't it ? TILLERTON Very . PRESCOTT I should think you 'd never want to hear her voice again . It 's cost you too much . And when I say that I 'm thinking of the money it cost you to take her to Paris and make a singer of her  --  and the money alone . TILLERTON Well , money was never better spent , was it ? PRESCOTT Ignoring him . If there 's anything I detest it 's a sentimentalist . Have you heard anything more from the executors of your rich friend 's estate ? TILLERTON With a smile . A great deal more . PRESCOTT I hope you 've explained that after she sang for him , he said he did n't want you to pay back the money he 'd lent you to have her voice trained ? TILLERTON After a pause . I explained that , naturally . PRESCOTT And that he told you he was going to tear up your notes for the eight thousand dollars you 'd borrowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . They 've found them . And there 's nothing on earth to do but to pay them . There 's nothing sentimental about that . It 's very legal . p. 5 PRESCOTT But they ca n't expect to come down on a man after twenty years and collect a sum like that  --  like that  --  He snaps his fingers to illustrate . The thing to do is to let them go ahead and sue you for it , if they want to . . . . Besides , if the money 's got to be paid  --  Canava ought to pay it , not you . TILLERTON That ca n't even be discussed . I 'll pay it , of course . PRESCOTT But you have n't got it . TILLERTON I 've arranged for it nevertheless . PRESCOTT Eight thousand dollars is n't a mere trifle  --  to a novelist whose novels have always refused to be best sellers . TILLERTON Money 's a dull subject . Let 's talk of something else . PRESCOTT Suddenly , accusingly . Then you 're going to sell your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true , then ? I heard it today  --  that you were going to sell them  --  but I would n't believe it . See here  --  let me manage this for you . p. 6 TILLERTON Quietly . Hands off , my friend ! This is my own affair . Very much my own affair . . . . I 'll be glad to get rid of them . I 'm a book-ridden man . I 'm going away somewhere  --  away from books . He continues in a lighter tone . And maybe it 's not too late to write something I have n't read before , after all . PRESCOTT And Brasa Canava gets three thousand dollars every time she sings ! And since she 's got the strength of an ox and the soul of a cow , she 'll go on pouring out that golden flood of a voice for years and years and years . TILLERTON " To him that hath shall be given  --  " She hath . . . that 's all . That 's greatness . PRESCOTT One sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only their own sort of greatness . PRESCOTT And it 's often only that they 're great sponges . . . . TILLERTON Often , yes . Or great roses for whose blooming the trees have been pruned and stripped . But they make the beauty of the world . And that 's enough . PRESCOTT Having a voice has no more to do with true greatness than the shape of her nose . p. 7 TILLERTON Quietly . I know her better than you do . There 's greatness there . Ludicrous greatness , if you like , the comedy of greatness rather than any of its thousands of tragedies ; but great gifts , undeniably , and greath growth , and above all , great luck . Let 's have some supper . That walk home has given me a bit of an appetite . PRESCOTT No , thanks . No late suppers for me . Doctor 's orders . It 's after twelve . I ought to be getting some sleep and so ought you . We 're too old for late goings-on , nowadays . TILLERTON Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago  --  twenty-five years ago  --  almost thirty years ago  --  we were the kings of the high-steppers . We were in the high-jumper class . Well . . . Tempus fugit . PRESCOTT Time flies ? No . Time stands still . It 's we who move . Time is the pole in the center of the merry-go-round . We 're the children riding the lions and the tigers . TILLERTON Life does n't seem to me such a holiday matter . And Time seems to me like a gray old cynic who always has his finger to his lip , hushing us to sleep  --  because he 's too important to listen to anything we might happen to be saying . . . and yet  --  suddenly lifting a book from a table  --  a sick boy wrote a few poems . . . and he was more important than Time . . . . Time put to sleep the pompous men and the rich men and the fashionable men  --  and the pretty ladies , too , who looked down on the little Cockney poet , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep  --  ever . p. 8 PRESCOTT No . . . and that 's greatness ! TILLERTON Not noticing the argument in the inflection which his friend has given to his words , but reading instead the first lines that meet his eye as the book comes open in his hand . " Much have I travelled in the realms of gold "  --  He closes the book sharply , and continues , speculatively . . . And yet , he must have been an odd , lonely little chap  --  with a very stupid idea that he was n't worth his salt . . . . He was probably very apologetic for being alive at all in such a practical world . He lays the book down . By the way , there 's a poem in the new Bookman that I want you to read . It 's on the table  --  there . . . . The telephone rings . Pardon me . He answers while PRESCOTT picks up the copy of the magazine and reads . TILLERTON Hello . . . . Yes ? This is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; nothing you could ever do would surprise me . . . . But surprise does affect his voice and manner as he answers , presently . Certainly . He hangs up the telephone and turns about suddenly elated and speaks almost like a man a bit drunk as he goes and slaps PRESCOTT on the shoulder . Well ? Have you read it ? Is n't it fine ? p. 9 PRESCOTT Not bad . TILLERTON It 's good enough to remember ; and if I were a magazine editor like you I think I 'd not forget this chap 's name . What time is it by your watch ? TILLERTON gets out his own watch and compares it with a clock on mantel . PRESCOTT Twenty-eight minutes after twelve . TILLERTON You 're ten minutes fast . PRESCOTT Defensively . I know it . I keep my watch that way . What are you doing ? TILLERTON Who has moved away and is bringing a table over . Getting ready for some supper . Puts table in place . You do n't want any , you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got anything that 's easily digested  --  ? TILLERTON Evidently anxious to get rid of him . Better stick to your resolution , if it 's the doctor 's orders . Wait a minute . He starts into the kitchen . As he opens the door , he sees a light inside . Evidently Kitty Mulberry is still here . The light 's burning . He goes out for an instant and is heard calling , " Hello , Kitty , " in a gay voice. p. 10 PRESCOTT Following him to the door . If you 've a cracker , just a little hard , thin , dry cracker of some sort , I think I could eat that . TILLERTON Calls back . All right . PRESCOTT takes up a cigarette and looks at it , then regretfully puts it down . TILLERTON returns , a small plate in his hand . Here you are . PRESCOTT Thanks . He takes the biscuit offered , and begins munching it solemnly . TILLERTON Suddenly . The remarkable part of it all was that she was a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILLERTON Yes , she was a very good wife . PRESCOTT Oh , you 're talking about her . TILLERTON Still with the same elation . Going on , not heeding the interruption . She 'd come home from the opera , even after her first big success , and wipe up the floor with our brand-new French servant because she was n't neat enough in the kitchen  --  or had let us be overcharged for the chicken . p. 11 PRESCOTT They say she is going to marry again . TILLERTON A little dampened . People always talk a great deal about the affairs of celebrities . PRESCOTT They say he 's only twenty . TILLERTON What ? Who ? PRESCOTT Bloch . The Bulgarian violinist  --  whom she 's going to marry . TILLERTON Sascha Bloch ? PRESCOTT Yes . KITTY MULBERRY enters . KITTY MULBERRY To TILLERTON . Would you like anything hot , sir ? Or just what I have in the ice-box ? PRESCOTT Hello , Kitty Mulberry . You do n't keep union hours , do you ? Why are n't you asleep ? KITTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , but the old man 's been on a spree again and had the door locked agin me when I got home ; and bein ' as I had no money on me to go to a movie with , I came back here to wait for the likker to die on him . She turns to TILLERTON . I 've some nice cold chicken , sir , if you 'd like me to lay it out ? p. 12 TILLERTON Is there plenty ? KITTY MULBERRY Yes , sir . If that friendly young woman who is always borrowing our stove do n't come begging , sir . She 's giving a party tonight and she 's sure not to have enough to go around . But I hope you wo n't let her get anything away from you , sir . TILLERTON Find out what time it is by the kitchen clock , Kitty . He looks at his watch again . KITTY MULBERRY Yes , sir . She goes . PRESCOTT I know that young woman . She tries to write . She invites editors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I replied I was going to speak at a banquet to the Mayor of Newark . KITTY enters . KITTY MULBERRY Eighteen minutes after twelve , the clock says , sir . TILLERTON It 's slow . What time have you now , Walter ? PRESCOTT Looking at his watch . Thirty-one minutes after . Then he pauses sharply . You 're not catching a train or anything , are you ? TILLERTON Not aware of his friend 's facetiousness . It 's about twenty-four minutes after . You 're seven minutes fast , not ten . He hurries on as if to avoid some subject that he does not wish to discuss . Does that young woman really borrow our stove , Kitty ? p. 13 KITTY MULBERRY She takes it , sir . She comes tiptoeing to the kitchen door : " May I cook this on your stove ? " she 'll say . " You know I 've only a kitchenette with one burner . " And it 's not that I begrudge the stove , sir , only there are so many things she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the opry was about ? TILLERTON About a great , golden-haired woman  --  a goddess named Brnnehilde . KITTY MULBERRY Then I would n't have liked it myself , sir . I like a tune as well as anybody , only I 'm partial to a good , natural plot , and goddesses are a bit unnatural , to my way of thinking . TILLERTON So they are . That 's their glory . KITTY MULBERRY I suppose , being as they 're always in a furreign tongue , you might say that the opry is more or less the movie of the rich . But I 'd better be minding my own business at this time of night , too . She goes . PRESCOTT Suddenly speaking sobrly , apropros of nothing . You know , you would have been a great man , if it had n't been for her . TILLERTON Nonsense . PRESCOTT No , it 's not nonsense ; it 's the truth . You had it in you . You 'd have made the grade . But she drained you dry . She used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw you away . That 's what I 've always had against her . p. 14 TILLERTON Drily  --  not liking this turn of the conversation . Are n't you forgetting the facts ? A divorce court decided that I deserted her . PRESCOTT Just a part of your delicacy . You cleared out because you knew you were in her way . You spoke of her luck just now . I ca n't help thinking that the greatest luck she ever had was in meeting you . TILLERTON Oh , someone would have drifted her way , and looked at her face  --  and heard her sing  --  and rescued her from those band concerts in those little raw prairie towns . . . . That was written in the stars of Hollyhock Jones , the Texas Nightingale . PRESCOTT I 'd give a good deal to know what she thinks of it all when she looks back . TILLERTON She has no such weaknesses . She never looks back . PRESCOTT I wonder . TILLERTON More to himself than to his friend . But , of course , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed in that big career , I did get out . . . . She was a sort of museum piece , you know ,  --  a little impractical for every-day use . . . . So they say she 's to marry this Bulgarian chap , the violinist , do they ? p. 15 PRESCOTT Yes , that 's what they say . . . . You never see her , do you ? TILLERTON Drawing his finger along his neck . I have never set eyes on her , off the stage , since our last big scene , of which this scar is a delicate souvenir . But she 's coming to see me tonight . However , she 'll probably be much too formal to throw any more teacups . PRESCOTT A little alarmed . So that 's who was telephoning ! I 'll go . TILLERTON Of course you will . She said she 'd be here in ten minutes , and I 've been watching the clock . I was just about to put you out . PRESCOTT Well , she 's got a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that much for her . Good night . Then he adds , grouchily . It 's just like her coming here at this hour . TILLERTON Too pleased to understand the disapproval in his friend 's voice . It is like her , is n't it ? Good night , Walter . Good night . Good night . PRESCOTT Taking his departure a little awkwardly . Good night . As he goes , KITTY enters from the kitchen , carrying a large tray. p. 16 KITTY MULBERRY It 's a good bit of supper , if I say it , as should n't . The chicken is cooked very pretty ; and the asparagus just came in from the country this morning . There 's some quince jelly ; and a fine cheese . And now I 'm going home , as it 's on the table waiting . TILLERTON Looking up , aware of what she is saying , now . That 's right . . . . He looks at the supper , which she is setting out on the table . Yes , it looks very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay so late . I hope you 're not very tired . KITTY MULBERRY I 'm never tired . And never been tired since I was sixty . When I was younger I used to feel sorry for myself with all my complaints  --  but after you 're sixty the work seems to come handier , somehow , and by that time you 've got so used to it that the only thing you worry about is how long you can keep on giving satisfaction . Well , good night , sir . TILLERTON Good night , Kitty Mulberry . . . . KITTY goes . TILLERTON moves about , a little restlessly . He places the chairs , just so ; rearranges the light ; stirs the fire ; and at last goes to the piano and plays again , very badly , but with a ringing sound , the Ride of the Valkyries . There is a knock on the door which he does n't hear ; then another which he does ; then another before he has time to reach the door ; and a violent hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over rugs and chairs in his haste , he delays an instant longer and calls out. p. 17 TILLERTON Yes  --  I 'm coming . In another instant he has managed to get the door open , and BRASA CANAVA , like a magnificent thunder-cloud driving an invisible chariot , is whirled into the room by four great German police dogs , that strain , two by two , from the pair of chain leashes which she holds in each hand . She herself is frowning a little , and is a little annoyed  --  at this instant  --  in spite of the natural radiance flowing from her brilliant eyes and skin , her red hair , and her great height and grace . CANAVA Her first words are in the abruptly casual manner of a person taking up a conversation where it was interrupted a few moments ago . Why have n't you a bell ? TILLERTON Abjectly  --  in bewilderment . But , my dear  --  He pauses , staring at her helplessly . CANAVA Interrupting . Why have n't you a bell , I said ? I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILLERTON Staring at her still , a little lost . But how wonderful you look off the stage  --  how young ! p. 18 CANAVA Suddenly as sweet as honey . My Stevie looks won'erful , too . . . . A little thin , maybe . TILLERTON Swept along , but protesting a little . Now do n't talk baby talk to me after all these years , Hollyhock ! CANAVA In a voice of which she might speak of murder . Good heavens , man , do n't call me Hollyhock ! He laughs . She continues wryly . " Hollyhock Jones , the Texas Nightingale . " I 've not forgotten . I want to give my dogs a drink . Where 's the kitchen ? TILLERTON May I take them ? CANAVA They may object . But he has taken the leashes from her hand . She pats their heads , speaking first to one and then the other . There  --  Tristan . . . . Ah , that booful Carmen ! Their tongues are out . We walked down . They like you . TILLERTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CANAVA What 's funny about that ? . . . TILLERTON Please forgive me for being surprised at your energy . Come , Carmen  --  Tristan  --  and what  --  p. 19 CANAVA Interrupting with the information he is about to ask for . Wotan and Tosca . I 'm going to sing Tosca next year . TILLERTON But you 've never sung Italian opera ! CANAVA What does that matter ? Why are you keeping those poor dogs waiting ? Give them some water , and then come back . TILLERTON Of course  --  pardon me  --  take off your things , wo n't you ? He whistles the dogs out of the room , into the kitchen . Left alone , MADAME CANAVA 'S first thought is to open both windows wide . Having done this , she takes off her hat , her furs , and her gloves ; finds a cigarette ; and then calls , loudly enough to awaken the neighbours , to TILLERTON in the kitchen . CANAVA Bring me a glass of water , too ; but do n't put any ice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just a moment  --  He returns with the water , and sees the cigarette which she is rolling between her fingers . Do you smoke ? I thought most singers did n't dare . CANAVA Pausing one second to answer . They do n't . . . . Then she drains the glass while he finds the matches before she continues , complacently . But nothing hurts my voice . Now give me a light . . . . Do you think I ca n't sing Tosca ? p. 20 TILLERTON Of course ; you can sing anything . Only I heard you tonight , and after Brnnehilde I wonder why you bother . CANAVA You always come on my nights , I suppose ? TILLERTON No , not always . CANAVA Judiciously . You should . . . . He lights her cigarette for her , and she continues in an irritable voice , as if arguing . I sang Carmen this year  --  with everybody saying I could n't  --  and it was n't worth while  --  and this , that , and the other . Ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know who  --  ? CANAVA Calmly , but with eyes that alternately brood and gleam , as she smokes . My enemies  --  those damned cats around the opera-house  --  men cats as well as women cats ! . . . The success-haters . . . . That 's what I call them  --  the people who have never got what they want and turned sour on everybody who has . The world 's full of them . . . . As soon as you 've made good they begin to watch for you to fail : " Her voice is n't so good this year , " they say  --  after an opening night , when you never sang better in your life . " Ah , a cold . . . ? " they say , if you ever do miss a performance . And the way they say it is a hint that what 's really wrong is drink  --  drugs  --  an operation on your vocal cords  --  or an attempt at suicide ! . . . For fifteen years my enemies have been trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit the voice . Good God  --  there 's never been such a voice as mine !  --  although they 've been watching me like hawks  --  listening for me not to take every note  --  lying  --  criticising  --  waiting  --  I know them ! p. 21 TILLERTON But  --  my dear  --  ! He is a little appalled . CANAVA Continuing , but somewhat more calmly . So they say I ca n't act  --  I must stick to the great heroic rles ! That 's why I thought I 'd do Carmen for a change  --  and show them . And I showed them  --  did n't I ? He does not answer . She goes on , half-angrily . Well ? What did you think of my Carmen ? TILLERTON I did n't see it . I did n't go . . . . You see , you 're one of the goddesses to me  --  and I 'd rather not see you do anything that you do n't do better than anyone living . CANAVA In a deadly voice . Will you tell me why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not your type  --  CANAVA Why not ? What do you know about it ? Did you ever see a Spaniard in your life  --  who was n't crazy about red hair ? He laughs outright . Carmen must have been very much like me  --  blonde and tall . You ought to see  --  you have seen  --  the way those Spaniards follow me on the street  --  when I 've been in Spain  --  Remember that time at Gibraltar  --  p. 22 TILLERTON Smiling , but veering away from further discussion . You convince me , as always . Now come and have some supper . . . . I 'll get out a certain bottle of champagne that I 've been saving for a great occasion . CANAVA Deeply hurt . Do you mean to say you 'd forgotten that I always drink milk ? You know I never drank anything else ! TILLERTON My dear ! How was I to know that the world had let you go on drinking milk all these years ! Forgive me . CANAVA Muttering . Think I 'm a weather-cock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought n't I ? CANAVA You ought . TILLERTON Sit down  --  wo n't you ? Here are chicken and asparagus  --  and  --  I 'll get the milk . . . . Will you help yourself ? CANAVA Sitting , her head suddenly in her hand , babyishly . No . . . . You wait on me . I want to be waited on . TILLERTON That 's very charming of you . He serves her . Of course there 's not much  --  p. 23 CANAVA Are n't you going to have any ? TILLERTON In just a minute  --  I 'll be right back . He goes out . CANAVA tastes the food experimentally . TILLERTON returns with the milk . There  --  He fills her glass . CANAVA Judiciously . The chicken 's cooked well  --  but it 's been in cold storage . I 'll give you my butcher 's address . And I do n't suppose you know where this asparagus came from ? TILLERTON Is n't it right ? I 'm sorry . CANAVA Right ? Indignantly . It 's wonderful ! Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . . . . Did you notice what that conductor tried to do to me in the third act  --  tonight ? TILLERTON I thought he took certain passages a little too fast  --  CANAVA Yes  --  and if he ever tries to hurry me again  --  this is good butter  --  if he ever tries to hurry me again he 'll never conduct again when I 'm singing . . . . Why did you leave me ? TILLERTON Why did I  --  what ? p. 24 CANAVA That 's one of the things I 've always meant to find out  --  if I waited fifty years . But twenty 's long enough . What made you leave me ? TILLERTON Incredulously . You mean  --  why did I go away  --  twenty years ago  --  ? CANAVA I asked you a direct question , did n't I ? Why did you leave me ? Ca n't you answer it ? You 're not eating anything  --  and the chicken 's damned good  --  even if it has been in cold storage . I can always tell a cold-storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't even have to taste it . She eats . He stares at her  --  a smile on his lips . Presently she lays her fork and knife down abruptly , with a clatter , and stares back at him with troubled eyes . You must have had some reason . What was it ? TILLERTON The reason  --  whatever it was  --  has been forgotten . CANAVA Liar ! There are some things nobody forgets . And one is why you leave your wife or your husband . I left my first husband because I did n't like him . TILLERTON Leslie Jones , you mean ? CANAVA Yes , Leslie Jones . . . . I do n't know why I ever married an undertaker , anyway . I suppose it was because he had an ear for music and I loved flowers , especially lilies . Always , after there was a funeral , he sent me the flowers . Then , too , I liked him because he looked as tenors ought to look  --  very romantic and sad . But he was lazy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him  --  not because he was lazy and drank and had no ambition , though . I left him because I 'd got to hate him . Then , when you came along , of course , I was glad I had had the sense to get free . You were just what I 'd always hoped for . Of course  --  she is suddenly humble and compellingly sweet  --  I did n't know enough then to really know how wonderful you are . I just knew you were fine  --  like silk  --  and that everybody else I 'd ever known before seemed suddenly coarse and cheap  --  like the commonest cotton . There is a pause . She has put out her hand and touched his . Then she continues in a low voice . I was always awfully afraid of you , Stevie . He laughs aloud . She goes on wryly . You always laughed at me , you know ! p. 25 TILLERTON But it was always very sympathetic laughter , Hollyhock . CANAVA Do n't call me Hollyhock ! TILLERTON Brasa  --  then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christen you " Brasa . " CANAVA Yes . It took time for me to get used to your ideas . I used to think that Hollyhock was a beautiful name . Why did you leave me ? That 's what I want to know now . TILLERTON Is that why you came tonight ? CANAVA Suddenly depressed . No . I came because I want your help . I 'm at the end of my rope  --  about something . She hesitates and plunges again , half-angrily . You were in such a hurry to leave me that I do n't suppose you stopped to consider what might happen after you 'd gone ? TILLERTON But I did consider . I considered everything . You had your first big contract to sing at Covent Garden the following season . . . and you 'd made a great success in Paris . . . . I knew nothing could stop you  --  or happen to you  --  CANAVA I almost died  --  that 's all . TILLERTON Died ! You were n't ill ? p. 26 CANAVA After studying him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby six months after you left me . TILLERTON What ! CANAVA Do n't tell me you never guessed  --  TILLERTON But of course not ! Do you think I knew anything of the sort  --  CANAVA Shyly . I 'd hinted  --  TILLERTON Good God ! CANAVA I went around knocking wood . I did n't want to talk too much about it . Accusingly . You know I 'm superstitious about such things ! TILLERTON Again . Good God ! CANAVA Well  --  do n't you care what happened ? Do n't you want to know whether it was a boy or a girl ? TILLERTON You damned crazy , funny , astonishing woman ! . . . Tell me . CANAVA I 'd like to know what 's crazy or funny  --  or astonishing about having a baby , when you 're married . TILLERTON It 's not that ; only you kept it such a secret  --  you 've never let me know in all these years  --  p. 27 CANAVA Why should I ? I thought you did n't want anything to do with either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILLERTON Gently . And our child . . . we had a child . . . . Tell me , my dear . . . . Have I  --  a son ? CANAVA Drily , grimly . You have . And so help me God  --  he 's the damnedest poor excuse for a nineteen-year-old boy I 've ever seen in my whole life . TILLERTON All at sea . You mean  --  he 's  --  not turned out  --  well  --  ? And he 's nineteen . Yes  --  of course he 'd be nineteen . Well  --  even if  --  as you say  --  he 's not quite a model youngster  --  just the fact that he 's alive at all  --  is great news  --  to me . Thank you  --  a thousand times  --  CANAVA Almost in tears . Stevie  --  I did n't know you 'd feel like this . . . . You 're making me want to cry . . . for having been such a fool  --  all these years . I wish I 'd had better sense  --  only I thought  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply  --  and dries her eyes violently  --  speaking abruptly . Just wait until you see him . Maybe you wo n't feel so sentimental then . p. 28 TILLERTON But he 's just a boy , is n't he ? One does n't expect perfection from boys , my dear  --  CANAVA Do n't go on calling me " my dear . " You used to call me " my dear " when you were angry . TILLERTON I seem to be having a hard time . Brasa  --  is rather professional , you know . CANAVA Petulantly . You can call me Ducky  --  ca n't you ? You always used to . TILLERTON Of course . . . . By the way , what is our young man 's name ? CANAVA Raymond . . . . I got married a little later , you know  --  TILLERTON Yes  --  to Riboux ; I know . CANAVA Riboux taught me everything I really know about music . You know , you never knew anything about music , Stevie . You knew the sort of things I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just my voice that carried me along until I sang with Riboux . TILLERTON Haltingly . Of course . . . . It must have been a very wonderful thing for him to have had such a voice and mind as yours to teach . p. 29 CANAVA He was wonderful  --  until I left him . He 's never done anything since . TILLERTON None of us have  --  have we ? Leslie Jones , the undertaker  --  who drank himself to death ,  --  or Riboux , who has never conducted or composed any new work since your divorce  --  or Count Stowitstitsky  --  the sculptor  --  or I  --  He pauses a minute , regarding her curiously . I wonder why . . . ? CANAVA Firmly believing what she says . If you have n't gone on it 's your own fault . You ought to have put a book before the public every year . TILLERTON Patiently . You were telling me about  --  our son  --  CANAVA You asked me what his name was , did n't you ? He went by the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody thought he was Riboux 's son , instead of mine  --  if they bothered to think anything . TILLERTON That was rather natural , I suppose . CANAVA Drily . It was convenient ; I did n't mean to tell him anything about you . p. 30 TILLERTON That , too , was rather natural , I suppose  --  since you thought I 'd deserted you and him . . . . CANAVA That reminds me . What made you leave me ? TILLERTON I suppose now it was a great mistake  --  but you 'd made a success  --  and seemed very much engrossed in your career  --  and in one or two persons who were the sort given to cultivating ladies with careers . . . . CANAVA You mean you were jealous of that Russian Grand Duke ? TILLERTON Possibly that 's the simplest way to put it . She is silent for a minute . Then she looks up , half smiling . CANAVA I got rid of him in short order  --  as soon as I found out what he was after . TILLERTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANAVA If I had  --  do you think I 'd have let him hang around ? TILLERTON But I told you very plainly that you could n't accept diamonds from a man  --  CANAVA But it was such a beautiful necklace ! TILLERTON Precisely . p. 31 CANAVA And my first one . I have it yet . TILLERTON But do you mean that you kept it  --  and sent him away  --  CANAVA Of course I kept it ! He gave it to me because he admired my voice . What 's wrong about that ? Every king and queen in Europe has given me something because they admired my voice . It 's not the sort of voice they hear more than once in a lifetime  --  and they know it ! But when I found it was n't only my voice that interested the Duke I put him in his place . . . . After that  --  whenever I met him  --  he doubled himself up with respect . I dined with him  --  and his wife  --  in London several times , my first season there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always behaved after I knocked him down that time . TILLERTON You really knocked him down  --  ? He is smiling . CANAVA Yes , I knocked him down  --  and threatened to spank him . He was only about that tall , you know . She indicates a distance well below her shoulder . TILLERTON And you 'd not known what all his attentions and gifts meant  --  ? CANAVA Why should I ? He knew I was married . I thought he was just like lots of those rich foreigners , crazy about music . . . . Besides , I could n't understand French  --  except what I happened to be singing  --  and I did n't know what he was jabbering about half the time . . . . I only knocked him down . . . but I suppose I 'd have killed him if I 'd known he was the cause of your leaving me . You 're not eating , and you 're not drinking . What 's the matter ? p. 32 TILLERTON Tell me more about  --  Raymond . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . now . CANAVA Without enthusiasm . You 'd better see him for yourself . TILLERTON What is he like  --  whom does he look like ? CANAVA A jockey . . . . Then she adds as she shakes her head sadly . I do n't know what to do with the boy . . . . That 's why I 'm here to tell you that you 'll have to help me get some sense into his head . TILLERTON Slowly . Of course , it 's rather awkward  --  until I see him . But what does he like to do  --  best ? CANAVA  --  Spend money . TILLERTON  --  Most boys have a tendency of that sort  --  and I 'm sure you 've been very generous with him . I wish I could be . . . . Has he  --  has he any talent , of any sort ? CANAVA Drily . He says he 's a poet . TILLERTON A little appalled . A poet ? Well , is he ? p. 33 CANAVA  --  Yes  --  but what of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real poet  --  CANAVA Repeating . Yes  --  what of it ? TILLERTON  --  It 's very wonderful  --  and also , in certain ways , very unfortunate . CANAVA With great energy . That 's exactly what I think . She pushes her plate away . No more . . . . I want a cigarette now . TILLERTON  --  Match ? CANAVA  --  I always roll mine first . . . . You know a poet is a damned nuisance to have around . Now you can give me a light . TILLERTON  --  So the boy 's a poet . . . and a nuisance . Why is he such a nuisance ? CANAVA  --  He 's unhealthy , in the first place . TILLERTON  --  He ca n't help that . CANAVA  --  Nonsense . . . . He 'd be healthy if he 'd do what I tell him  --  but he wo n't take enough exercise and he wo n't eat the right food  --  and he wo n't keep regular hours . He 's finicky , and nervous , and lazy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uppish with me . He criticises me . Makes fun of me . And he tries to keep me from doing things I want to do . . . . He talks like a Bolshevist . . . . Says he believes in the brotherhood of man and he does n't believe anybody ought to have any private property . Then he goes out and sends me flowers . Beautiful flowers  --  everything that 's out of season  --  only I pay for them , myself , at the end of the month . He 's got your mania for books , too . Only regular books do n't suit him . He 's got to have first editions . He 's always in debt  --  and never tells me until somebody is going to sue him . He makes fun of the stage settings at the Metropolitan and designs costumes for me I 'd be arrested for wearing . And he sulks if I do n't take his advice about everything I do  --  from buying a hat to singing Carmen . p. 34 TILLERTON Half smiling , half serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimly . And now he 's gone and found a tart he wants to marry because she has a beautiful soul and a sad story . TILLERTON  --  Good heavens ! CANAVA  --  And  --  believe it or not  --  the boy 's ashamed of his own mother for being a virtuous woman ! TILLERTON  --  That does n't seem very likely , Ducky . CANAVA With heat , almost in tears . Oh , yes . He 's told me . He says it 's very bourgeoise to be always getting married  --  that it 's not necessary for the artiste to marry . . . . I suppose he 'd make a tart of me , too ,  --  if I 'd listen to him . But no man that walks this earth  --  has ever been able to do that  --  and I 'm not going to lose my character now just because I 've a son who 's a poet . You 've got to help me manage him , Stevie . You 've got to try and make a man of him  --  There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment  --  He opens the door . A very young man in a dinner-jacket , without a hat , is there . The only thing that mars his form is a white kitchen pail which swings from one hand. p. 35 THE YOUNG MAN With a polite drawl and quite an air . Pardon me  --  but the young woman who lives on the next floor  --  I think her name is Stanley or Standish  --  asked me if I 'd ask you if she could borrow some yellow rat cheese or some eggs or anything you might happen to have ? She 's giving a party and there 's not enough spaghetti to go round . She did n't expect all of us , you see . He is in the room by this time . CANAVA Turning about abruptly , and speaking grimly . Are you in the habit of going to parties where you 're not expected ,  --  given by strange young women whose names you 're not sure of ? THE YOUNG MAN Calmly . Of course , Ducky . Everyone is , these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to next . TILLERTON With a frown and a smile . And is this  --  the poet ? THE YOUNG MAN Whose name is RAYMOND , of course . Ah  --  my mother 's told you I 'm something of a poet , evidently . . . . I did n't know you were in the habit of these tte -- tte suppers , Ducky ,  --  with  --  he studies TILLERTON impertinently  --  strange young men . . . . p. 36 CANAVA Rising  --  very sadly and addressing TILLERTON . Well  --  ? She makes a helpless gesture . You 've seen him . What do you think of him ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  You might introduce us , Ducky . CANAVA Ironically . He 's your father . You 've heard me speak of him . There is a slight pause . RAYMOND gets his bearing first . RAYMOND TILLERTON Calmly . Ah , yes  --  you were one of mother 's husbands , I believe . The second , was n't it ? I 've heard her mention you . TILLERTON Huskily  --  emotion beating at his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happens that I never heard of you  --  until tonight . . . . Do n't you think we might shake hands ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  If you like  --  only do n't get sentimental , old man . And how about those eggs ? Anything that can be cooked over one burner or in a chafing-dish will do . CANAVA  --  Do n't mind him , Stevie . He 's deeply touched . I know him . He likes to act like this  --  as if he did n't care . But he 'll write a beautiful poem about it , tonight , or tomorrow . See if he does n't . Suddenly motherhood overcomes her and her arms are about RAYMOND , as she talks to him in the language usually reserved for babies . Who 's the mos ' won'erful thing in the world ? Muvver 's little boy is the mos ' won'erful person in the world . . . and he writes the most boo'ful poems  --  he 's a smarty  --  p. 37 RAYMOND TILLERTON Bearing her shower of kisses patiently . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  CANAVA  --  Call him " Father . " . . . He 's my little boy 's real father . TILLERTON  --  Yes  --  I hope you can condescend to such informalities , my  --  my son . I 'm going to call you Raymond , you know . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Certainly  --  only these things are always a little awkward . It usually takes a little time for me to get used to the idea of addressing strange men as " father . " . . . It 's happened before , you know . TILLERTON  --  At least , let 's hope it will never happen again . RAYMOND TILLERTON Suddenly struck by an idea . I say  --  could you give me a little of your time ? I want your help about something . I need it . TILLERTON  --  Of course . I hope we are going to be together a great deal . CANAVA Suspiciously . Go get those eggs , Stevie . . TILLERTON  --  Yes  --  I 'll see what I can find . . . . Pardon me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door closes on TILLERTON . Look here ! What are you up to ? What do you want your father 's help about ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  What did you hunt him up for ? They glare at each other an instant . CANAVA Accusingly . You 're going to try to make him help you keep me from marrying Sascha ! RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Precisely . Were n't you trying to get him to help you keep me from marrying Inez ? CANAVA  --  I certainly was . You 're under age . He 's your father  --  and the girl 's a tart . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  And Sascha Bloch is only a year or two older than I am  --  CANAVA  --  He 's been famous since he was ten . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  He 's just one of those musical freaks  --  CANAVA  --  I 'm of age  --  and I 'll marry whom I please . . . . He 's one of the greatest artists in the world . And his father 's always lied about his age , anyway . He 's twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years older . I 'm a young woman . And I 'm lonely  --  p. 39 RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Oh , mother  --  This time there is a real cry of distress in his voice . If only you would n't go on making yourself ridiculous ! CANAVA After a pause , half-gently . Will you give up this tart ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  She 's not  --  that . She 's an exquisite thing . I 'm the only person who understands her . She needs me . I  --  I ca n't desert her  --  CANAVA Abruptly . She 's thirty and a tart ; and we 'll see whether you give her up or not ! And we 'll see whether you 're going to interfere in my affairs or not . . . . A boy who ca n't even earn carfare  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  If you ever torture me about not being able to make money , again , I 'll shoot myself . I swear it ! CANAVA Half muttering  --  tears in her eyes . You 're always going to shoot yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is that I 've never done it yet . I 'd like to know why anyone wants to stay in " this world that is no better than a sty . " . . . Shakespeare knew what he was about when he called it that . . . sty ! He rises and goes over to the window . May I put this down ? . . . It 's cold in here . p. 40 CANAVA  --  Do anything you like . She sits again brooding in her chair at the table  --  her head between her hands . Presently she rolls a cigarette . RAYMOND sees the magazine open on the table and picks it up and stares at it . TILLERTON returns . TILLERTON  --  Here 's everything I could find  --  five eggs  --  some bacon  --  and some cheese  --  though it 's Roquefort  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Thanks I 'll take it up . Miss Whatever-her-name-is will be no end grateful . . . . By the way  --  somebody 's been reading a poem of mine . He indicates the magazine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Yes . I usually sign my things like that . TILLERTON Looking again at the poem  --  and then laying his hand on the boy 's shoulder and speaking with emotion . I wish you 'd signed it Raymond Tillerton . I 'm very proud of you , my son . RAYMOND TILLERTON His eyes full of sudden tears . Thanks  --  father . . . . He touches the open pages of the magazine . Beauty 's all that matters , anyway  --  is n't it ? p. 41 TILLERTON  --  It matters most  --  to people like us . It 's the great illusion . There is a pause . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Could you lunch with me tomorrow , sir ? At the Ritz  --  at one ? TILLERTON  --  I 'll be there . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  You write novels , do n't you ? TILLERTON  --  Not very successful ones . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  I despise success anyway . . . . CANAVA grunts , in derision . RAYMOND turns to her and continues , placatingly . When you get ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll call me . But she is still proud and hurt . CANAVA Huskily . I 'll walk ! RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Alone ? CANAVA  --  I brought the dogs . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Well , you 've more energy than I have  --  which is nothing new . . . . See you tomorrow . . . . He lingers , as he opens the door , for one more remark . We 're all of us a bit odd , I expect . Then he is gone . TILLERTON comes over and touches CANAVA on the shoulder , tenderly. p. 42 TILLERTON  --  You and I have got to respect that very young , young man , Ducky . CANAVA jerks away from his touch and goes to the windows , throwing both open as far as they will go , with a monosyllable of explanation . CANAVA  --  Hot ! Then she turns and surveys the room a little scornfully as if she were seeing it for the first time . She comments in a perfectly matter-of-fact tone . You 're rather shabby here , Stevie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Of course what you really need is a good housekeeper . She goes about , finding dust on everything she touches  --  straightens a picture on the wall  --  and continuing impatiently as she pushes chairs out of her way . One thing I like about the Metropolitan Opera House is that I always feel I have plenty of room there . Again she paces about  --  looking for something . Who ate the matches ? He is quick with a candle for her cigarette . She drapes herself affectionately about his shoulder . Then after an instant she speaks , half-angrily , half-tearfully . Find that damned poem and read it to me , Stevie ! THE CURTAIN FALLS TILLERTON  --  Good night , Kitty Mulberry . . . . She goes . TILLERTON moves about a little restlessly . He places the chairs just so ; rearranges the light ; stirs the fire ; and at last goes to the piano and plays again , awkwardly , but with a ringing sound , the Ride of the Valkyries . There is a knock on the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming  --  But he has paused to place some primroses on the supper-table , and again the knock is repeated , and a violent hand laid on the doorknob . Yes , yes  --  right away ! I 'm coming . He gets the door opened , and BRASA CANAVA , like a magnificent thunder-cloud , enters . She is in dark street clothes , overhung with splendid furs . She is frowning and annoyed in spite of the natural radiance flowing from her brilliant eyes and skin , her red hair , and her height and grace. p. 43 CANAVA Her first word is shy , then she continues instantly in the abruptly casual manner of a person taking up a conversation where it was interrupted a moment or two before . Hello . Why have n't you a bell ? TILLERTON Abjectly  --  in bewilderment . But , my dear  --  CANAVA Interrupting . I had to knock three times . Made my hand sore . TILLERTON I am sorry . CANAVA Again interrupting . Are you alone ? TILLERTON Yes . CANAVA Then shut the door , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . TILLERTON Closing the door , but a little lost as he stares at her . But , my dear , how wonderful you look off the stage  --  how young ! CANAVA Melting suddenly . My Stevie looks won'erful , too . . . . A little thin , maybe . TILLERTON Swept along , but protesting a little . Now do n't talk baby-talk to me after all these years , Hollyhock ! p. 44 CANAVA Good God , man , do n't call me Hollyhock ! He laughs . She continues wryly , in a voice in which she might speak of murder . " Hollyhock Jones , the Texas Nightingale . " I 've not forgotten . Where 's that glass of water ? My tongue 's out . I walked . TILLERTON You walked ? After singing Brnnehilde ? From the Metropolitan ? CANAVA What 's funny about that ? . . . Yes , I walked ; and I 've just made up my mind to sing Tosca next year . TILLERTON But you 've never sung Italian opera , have you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water and then we 'll talk . TILLERTON Just a moment . He goes into the kitchen . CANAVA Calling loudly . Steve ! Do n't put any ice in it . Have you any matches ? TILLERTON Calling . I 'll find them . He returns with the water after she has rolled a cigarette , finds the matches , and offers her the water . She drinks while he is speaking. @x The basement kitchen in MADAME CANAVA 's town house . A beautiful kitchen , shining and white  --  and presenting something of the same aspect of scientific efficiency as an operating-room in a hospital . At the back there is a door that opens from the hall . Steps can be seen outside , leading to the back hall upstairs . There is a door at one side into the servants ' sitting-room , and at the other there is a magnificent coal stove , with a glow inside , side by side with an electric stove . There is a long table  --  that has the look of Elizabeth 's rural England ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few red geraniums blooming on the sill of each neat white-curtained window on either side of the stove . There are white-globed incandescent lamps in wall brackets and a cluster in the ceiling . The room is in darkness except for the glow from the stove and the moonlight through the windows . Steps are heard on the uncarpeted steps outside , however , and RAYMOND 's voice . RAYMOND TILLERTON Wait a minute ; I 'll turn on the light so that you can see . Do n't fall . . . . Almost instantly there is a blaze in the hall outside . RAYMOND in the doorway calls back . Coming , sir ? TILLERTON 'S VOICE I 'm coming . RAYMOND switches on the kitchen lights , full tilt . TILLERTON arrives immediately after him , a little bewildered , his hands full of typewritten , badly damaged manuscripts . TILLERTON wears street clothes , RAYMOND a dinner-jacket. p. 46 RAYMOND TILLERTON Quick on the trigger . Put the poems there on that table . . . . I 've got a great idea . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . to explain . . . and to talk to you alone . He comes close to him . What do you think of Inez ? TILLERTON She 's only been in the room five minutes  --  and during most of that time I 've been trying to think where I 've seen her before . RAYMOND TILLERTON Impatiently . On the stage somewhere , probably . . . . She 's been in half a dozen musical comedies , in roof shows , and in dreadful bedroom farces and things . There 's no secret about that  --  but does it matter ? TILLERTON Quietly . Probably not . There is a pause . RAYMOND is sitting on the table . He stares at his father in great disappointment as TILLERTON does not say more but gives all his attention to the manuscripts in his hand  --  as if trying to arrange the pages properly . RAYMOND TILLERTON Presently , sulkily . I suppose you would be on mother 's side . p. 47 TILLERTON Looking up . Why ? RAYMOND does not answer . TILLERTON indicates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter a great deal , however . . . . Thank you for showing them to me . RAYMOND TILLERTON Despondently . I would n't care if you put them in that stove and burned every one . TILLERTON That 's not a bad idea . . . . They mean more to me , naturally , than to anyone else in the world  --  but an early book of poems has proved a very embarrassing skeleton in the closet of many a man of letters . RAYMOND TILLERTON Are they as bad as all that ? TILLERTON You may think so some day . . . . He reads one , silently , tenderly . RAYMOND TILLERTON I was talking about Inez  --  TILLERTON I know . . . . But these are so much more important . . . . " Beauty is all that matters "  --  is n't that what you said to me the other night ? RAYMOND TILLERTON She is Beauty . TILLERTON Paying attention to the papers . Think so ? Tastes differ , of course . . . . Well , shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ? p. 48 RAYMOND TILLERTON Emotion catching hold of him now . A book ! Father ! He pauses sharply and then continues gravely . You know  --  I never thought I had it in me  --  really . . . . I mean , to be any good , really . I knew I was better than nearly everybody else  --  but that did n't mean much . They 're most of them  --  eighteenth rate . TILLERTON I know . But if you 're adrift on the eternal seas of Art , my boy , you 'll only make port by watching your star and your compass . You ca n't steer by the course of other barks . . . And now do n't you think we 'd better go back upstairs ? RAYMOND TILLERTON With sudden energy . Oh , no . You do n't know my plan yet . TILLERTON What is it ? RAYMOND TILLERTON A cooking party . . . . Did you know mother could cook ? TILLERTON For three years she cooked for me about three times a day . RAYMOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it ever really as bad as that ? I mean , did n't you have any sort of servant  --  for three years ? . . . She 's said so  --  but it never seemed quite possible . p. 49 TILLERTON For three years we did n't have any sort of servant . We might have had  --  only we 'd borrowed money to live on so your mother could study , and it did n't seem quite honest to her to spend any of it on a cook  --  until the time came when her voice began to pay . RAYMOND TILLERTON Shuddering , his face in his hands . It 's a strange thing she should have me for a son ! It must be a tragedy to her . I really ought to shoot myself , you know  --  TILLERTON Do you think she 'd like that ? RAYMOND TILLERTON No ; she 'd hate my doing that more than she hates any of the other things about me . . . . She  --  she 's really fond of me ; besides , she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she does . She 'd let herself get very ridiculous if I did n't keep her on the right track . At that , sometimes she puts one over on me and gives silly interviews ; and puts on too much make-up  --  off the stage , I mean ; and gets her hair the wrong colour  --  when it 's touched up ; and buys the wrong kind of evening dresses . You know , I really dress her , father . . . . And I 've kept her from marrying a number of times since she divorced Stowitstitsky . And I tried to keep her from singing Carmen . I was sure she could n't do it , even the papers were making fun of her for trying . . . . But it was all right . . . . She was wonderful . . . . She put it over  --  p. 50 TILLERTON Smiling quietly . I 'd never worry about her if I were you . It 's been her destiny to float upstream . RAYMOND TILLERTON So far . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why I 'm glad you 're here . She  --  she respects you . . . . And we 've got to keep her from marrying Sascha Bloch , you see . I could n't bear that . . . . TILLERTON A little shaken . Your mother 's affairs  --  are n't exactly my affairs any more . . . . We 're off the track again  --  very far off the track again . . . . You were saying something about a cooking party . . . . RAYMOND TILLERTON Listlessly . Yes . . . . I was plotting to defraud her that way . He laughs curiously , bitterly , and continues . She loves to cook . It  --  it always gets her into a good humour . And I 've got to get her into a good humour tonight so that I can get some money from her . A lot . I 've brought Inez here to meet her  --  and that will make her hate me , to begin with , although I promised to be civil to Sascha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILLERTON Quietly . Is he coming tonight ? p. 51 RAYMOND TILLERTON Yes , she 's bringing him home with her , after his concert . TILLERTON With a movement as if to go . You did n't tell me that . RAYMOND TILLERTON I know it . And it was n't fair of me . I knew you 'd not come if he did . But I ca n't be direct like mother . . . . I 'm always a little tricky . . . . Please do n't go  --  I 've got to get five thousand dollars from her tonight  --  unless you 'd lend it to me until she 's in a better humour . TILLERTON You 've never earned any money , have you ? RAYMOND TILLERTON No  --  but I ca n't be tortured about that . One of my poems might be as beautiful as a cathedral  --  and I could n't get more than fifty cents a line for it  --  ! Fifty cents a line ! Ten dollars for an immortal lyric , maybe ! It 's not fair to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that . He pauses as if hinking how to say what he 'd like to say . RAYMOND TILLERTON Then you do n't want to lend it to me ? TILLERTON Are you very much ashamed of me for not having it ? p. 52 RAYMOND TILLERTON Oh ! He is terribly embarrassed . TILLERTON I suppose  --  if it 's anything you ca n't talk about  --  I could raise that sum , somehow  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON In a low tone , but with sudden resolution . No . . . . I 'll tell her . . . . She 'll pay it  --  if I handle her right . Never mind . Do n't worry . He changes the subject suddenly . I 'll get some comfortable chairs from the servants ' sitting-room  --  and call Inez and Mr. Prescott . He bounds to the doorway and calls upstairs . Inez ! Inez ! INEZ DALTON In a thin voice , calling from upstairs . Oohoo  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON Come on down  --  Bring Mr. Prescott  --  Follow the light . INEZ 'S VOICE All rightie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other door . RAYMOND TILLERTON I 'll turn on the light in the other room and get the chairs  --  He starts out , and then turns back wistfully , speaking guardedly , as steps and the same light voice are heard from the hallway . Do try to understand Inez , father . . . . There 's something more than just her wonderful beauty  --  Oh , I forgot  --  you do n't see even her beauty  --  do you ? But it 's there . . . . Without waiting for an answer he goes into the next room , stubborn pride in his manner and voice . His own thoughts transfix TILLERTON for the moment . A young woman , INEZ DALTON , enters , followed rather patiently by WALTER PRESCOTT . She is in a blue serge dress , and wears a hat and fur scarf . She carries long soiled white gloves and a beaded bag . Her age is anywhere between twenty-five and thirty-five . She is rather effectively tricked out , but only a shade more than the most commonplace prettiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from thousands of other women of her type , just as shallow , just as vain , just as cheap. p. 53 INEZ DALTON As if continuing an argument , to both men . You know , really , I ought to be dressed  --  She regards herself with a downward look . Raymond did n't tell me we were coming to his house after dinner . . . . I do n't mind not having on an evening dress  --  though I suppose Madame Canava will have one on  --  but I 'm sure I never looked worse . . . . This dress is a thousand years old . I 'd never wear it because it 's so unbecoming . What did Raymond want us all to come to the kitchen for ? Where is he ? PRESCOTT But is n't it an enchanting kitchen ? He stares about . She looks at him as though he might be making fun of her . INEZ DALTON Enchanting ? Cautiously , glancing around . I suppose everything 's the best . . . . The stove certainly looks expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a stove , does n't it ? RAYMOND enters , shoving a big chintz-covered chair in front of him . RAYMOND TILLERTON Hello  --  He shoves the chair toward his father . Take this , will you , and settle Inez in it ? I 'll get some more  --  He disappears. p. 54 TILLERTON Placing the chair . Suppose I put it here  --  ? INEZ DALTON But are we going to stay in the kitchen ? TILLERTON It 's Raymond 's idea to have a cooking party  --  PRESCOTT Supper here ? That 'll be ever so jolly . INEZ DALTON But who 's going to cook ? I do n't know a thing about cooking . TILLERTON I 'll let him spring his own surprises . RAYMOND enters with another chair . RAYMOND TILLERTON These things are heavier than they look  --  INEZ DALTON Facetiously . Never worked so hard in your life , did you , Raymond ? TILLERTON Helping RAYMOND . I 'll take this  --  He relieves RAYMOND of the chair . RAYMOND TILLERTON Thanks . He goes out . INEZ DALTON Well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know whether to take off my hat or not . I suppose my hair is dreadfully mussed . And there 's not a mirror  --  is there ? p. 55 TILLERTON There 's probably one in the next room . INEZ DALTON Where Raymond 's moving all the furniture from ? TILLERTON Yes  --  Again RAYMOND enters . RAYMOND TILLERTON Coming toward the group with a light rocking-chair . This one is n't so heavy . INEZ DALTON Is there a mirror in there  --  so I can do my hair ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Yes , of course  --  though it looks lovely  --  She has taken off her hat , and her hair is rather becomingly loose . Why you 're always doing something to it is a mystery to me . He looks at her in frank , almost stupid adoration . INEZ DALTON Jumping up  --  with a rather foolish laugh . Silly ! Everybody does n't feel like you about  --  about such things , maybe . I 'm sure I 'm a sight . She turns to the others , self-consciously . Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , where 's my bag ? I 've got a comb in it  --  she makes a joke as she digs for her bag  --  as well as other little necessities  --  " what every woman knows ! " Pleased with her archness , she follows RAYMOND into the next room . WALTER and TILLERTON , sitting comfortably in the heavy chairs , glance at each other for a long instant . Then TILLERTON slowly , reluctantly , grimly smiles. p. 56 TILLERTON And two weeks ago I did n't know anything about a father 's feelings ! PRESCOTT The blind young idiot  --  ! TILLERTON No , I 'd say  --  the four-eyed idiot ! PRESCOTT Meaning that his imagination is the same as an extra pair of eyes , I suppose ? TILLERTON Something like that . PRESCOTT Well , seeing what is not there and not seeing what is comes to the same thing as blindness . TILLERTON Not exactly always . PRESCOTT Well , about . TILLERTON Yes , about . A pause comes between them . Suddenly . I do n't think Raymond 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inez Dalton has any such honourable intentions as matrimony . PRESCOTT But has n't she promised to marry him ? TILLERTON She 's made him think something of the sort . . . . But she knows there 's nothing in it for her . So she 's going to break his heart instead . . . . I almost wish she were n't . Lots of men marry women with tissue-paper souls , and never find out the difference . p. 57 PRESCOTT You mean to say that you 'd approve of such a match ? TILLERTON Of course I would n't approve  --  but since when has love been a thing for middle age to approve ? In a case like this  --  when a boy has lost his heart to the wrong woman , apparently  --  we can only stand by and pray that Fate is a better matchmaker than ourselves . . . . No , she likes to have him about , because he tells her she is beautiful  --  and believes it when he says it . . . . His mother need n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his worrying about her . She takes what she wants  --  and it seems that she really wants her musical prodigy . . . . She 's talked to me about him  --  the Texas Nightingale has n't a glimmering of what it is to be self-conscious , you know . . . . I ca n't tell you , Walter , how strangely interested I am in her affairs  --  and Raymond 's . . . and how amused . . . and how agitated ! The pair of them make me feel very old indeed . . . . And very humiliated by the realization of how long I 've been standing stock-still , living my life without energy or imagination for many years . And I wonder if peace is enough for any man . . . ? But he speculates no further . PRESCOTT finds a cigarette , and lights it in silence . Then he remembers and offers his case to TILLERTON. p. 58 PRESCOTT I beg your pardon , old man . . . . TILLERTON Thanks , Walter . . . . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , and their few words regarding it . There is another bare pause . RAYMOND opens the door from the other room . RAYMOND TILLERTON In the doorway . Plaintively . I wish you 'd both come and help me persuade Inez that she does n't have to wear her hat . It hurts her head , but she says she looks better with it on . PRESCOTT A little impatiently . Then how can anything we might say prevail against her own opinion ? RAYMOND TILLERTON She says she 'll let you decide . TILLERTON Rising . This is a matter of moment , Walter . . . . We must n't evade our responsibility . Rather absently he goes about switching off lights . WALTER goes into the next room . RAYMOND TILLERTON Holding the door open for his father , who is about to follow PRESCOTT . Why are you turning out those lights ? p. 59 TILLERTON Realises suddenly that he has left only the center light burning . Oh ! He laughs . Habit . . . . The habit of a man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulberry for many years . . . . He regards his work half-whimsically . However , it will do no harm to leave them off  --  and by doing so we 'll possibly save your mother  --  a fourth of a cent a minute . . . . Can you understand things like that ? I never could . . . . But RAYMOND has n't waited to return to INEZ  --  and TILLERTON follows him as he realises that he has been addressing the air . For an instant the stage is empty ; then TILLERTON returns , with RAYMOND at his side . RAYMOND TILLERTON That 's what I told her  --  TILLERTON Seriously , as he goes and slumps into a big chair . You were perfectly right . It 's all nonsense  --  her keeping on a hat , if it hurts her head ! RAYMOND TILLERTON With deep appreciation , following him , and speaking in a low voice . The nicest thing Ducky ever did for me was to pick out for my father the most perfect gentleman it 's ever been my good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , but very pleased . Oh  --  you 'd have felt the same  --  anybody would  --  about any other man who had happened to have the luck to have you for a son . RAYMOND TILLERTON Flatly . You 're wrong . I 'm very critical . As you 'd have found out , all right , if you 'd turned out not quite the right sort . The Texas undertaker . . . . Or poor old Riboux , or crazy Stowitstitsky . . . . It was funny about Riboux  --  He was a great man . Do you know why he fizzled out ? TILLERTON No . And I 've wondered . RAYMOND TILLERTON Sagely . It was all Ducky and her conscience . He 'd always been very fond of women , you know . A sort of Don Juan who liked to teach and liked to be looked up to . A lot of women kept up his morale as a great man . . . . Then he met Ducky . And he very soon realised that she 'd have no goings-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day he realised that he bored her . . . He was getting old  --  and domestic  --  and by that time she did n't need him any longer . She 'd learned everything he had to teach her , and she was going on , and he 'd stopped . So he got out  --  he was very sensitive . p. 61 TILLERTON And Stowitstitsky . . . . You called him " crazy . " I should n't be curious , I suppose . . . ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Enjoying gossiping with his father immensely . Oh , Stowitstitsky was n't really crazy  --  he was just morbid , and Ducky has n't much patience with that sort of thing . She thought he did n't take enough exercise . He was young and very good-looking  --  and she likes that . She 's like a school-girl about good-looking men . It 's a weakness with her . That was why she married the undertaker , she told me once . She liked to look at him . TILLERTON I know . But it 's a very honourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . RAYMOND TILLERTON However , I do n't believe that was why she married Stowitstitsky  --  TILLERTON Involuntarily . Then  --  ? But he checks himself and says no more . RAYMOND TILLERTON I think it was because  --  the very first time she met him  --  he insulted her by asking her to pose for him as Diana  --  in the altogether , you know . TILLERTON Inscrutably . Oh ! p. 62 RAYMOND TILLERTON It made her furious , but it pleased her . He told her it would be the most beautiful new thing in the world . . . . So she married him . He did do his Diana ; then he stopped . He seemed content . He said he would never do anything to touch it again . Ducky tried to make him go on working . But he would n't . So of course she left him . You can see how she would . She had decided he was lazy  --  and anybody who is lazy gets on her nerves . TILLERTON Quietly . You must have been a very precocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was ! Each is quiet for an instant . Then the door is flung open , as CANAVA 's voice shouts . CANAVA Do n't move ! There in the brighter light of the hall , she stands in full view  --  her arm extended straight from the shoulder , her hand holding a gleaming pistol . She too gleams . Her evening coat is like snow and ice and silver wires . The gown beneath has the same scintillating whiteness , but there is a diamond wreath on her red , roughly curling hair . Both RAYMOND and TILLERTON have leapt to their feet . RAYMOND TILLERTON Ducky ! p. 63 TILLERTON Hollyhock ! CANAVA Sternly . Do n't  --  call  --  me  --  Hollyhock ! TILLERTON I mean  --  Ducky . . . . She pays no attention to his meek apology , however , as she enters , closes the door behind her , and advances to the table , glaring at RAYMOND . CANAVA So it 's you ! I thought so . Who turned off these lights ? She has thrown her revolver on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that TILLERTON has turned off . TILLERTON I did . But she interrupts him . CANAVA Nobody 's going to get me to cook . I know his tricks , Stevie . He wants something . But we 're going to have supper upstairs . Sascha 's coming . Oh , God , Stevie ! As she speaks she suddenly goes limp and drops into a chair , covering her face with her hands and shaking with sobs . TILLERTON Connecting her mood , somehow , with the revolver , which he picks up . Ducky ! Did something frighten you ? Whose is this ? p. 64 CANAVA Sobbing . Mine . . . . I always keep one handy  --  She looks up , confidentially explaining . I like to be armed when I hear things . I thought it might be burglars I heard down here when I let myself in a minute ago . TILLERTON Oh , that was what was worrying you . CANAVA Furiously , with a big sob . Good God , no ! TILLERTON As she bends her head , weeping again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is worrying unnecessarily . I do n't think it 's anything very much . CANAVA Lifting her head to glare at RAYMOND . What do you know about it ! Then she confides in TILLERTON . It 's Sascha  --  Stevie  --  TILLERTON A little amazed . Yes  --  ? CANAVA Still confidentially . He  --  he played so beautifully ! p. 65 TILLERTON Oh ! RAYMOND TILLERTON I thought that was it . CANAVA Weak one instant , and valiant the next . It broke my heart . I 'm not over it yet  --  ! God ! It was wonderful ! Is my nose red ? She is powdering her nose . TILLERTON Not  --  not now . CANAVA I 'm exhausted . I nearly died at that concert . I had to put black on my eyes five or six times . I 'm not going to cook , I said . She rises . RAYMOND TILLERTON Limply . Oh , Ducky . . . CANAVA Listening , suspiciously . Who 's in that room , there ? RAYMOND TILLERTON You said I could bring Inez here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bring her to meet me if you 'd be civil to Sascha . RAYMOND TILLERTON Impatiently . I 'm going to be civil . I promised I would . But I wanted father to see her , too , and got him here  --  p. 66 CANAVA To TILLERTON . He has some idiotic notion that one look at her drives away anyone 's common sense  --  The door-bell rings . Her head goes up . Ah , that 's Sascha . And the Count , too , I suppose . There is a kind of wrathful pleasantry in her observation . Then her eyes fall on RAYMOND , as she speaks to TILLERTON . Go up and see , Stevie . RAYMOND TILLERTON I 'll go . Do n't send father . He does n't like Sascha . CANAVA To TILLERTON . Run upstairs , Stevie , and if there 's not a maid about open the door , will you , and bring Sascha down here . TILLERTON looks a little hesitant . RAYMOND TILLERTON I 'll go  --  if you ca n't wait for a servant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like Sascha . CANAVA He does n't have to like him to open the door for him , does he ? Besides I want to say something to you before you see Sascha  --  Run on , Stevie  --  and tell him to come down  --  A bell rings again . Sascha 's like me  --  very impatient . Evidently from her tone she approves of impatience. p. 67 TILLERTON Reciting her orders . Tell him to come down . . . . And the Count ? CANAVA Let him wait . No one asked him to come , anyway . RAYMOND TILLERTON Uneasily , as the door closes upon his father . You 'll remember your promise to be civil to Inez , wo n't you , Ducky ? CANAVA Calmly . I promised to let you bring her here , and take a look at her , if you would be civil to Sascha ; but I did n't promise to be civil to her  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON Oh ! CANAVA Triumphantly . And if you want me to be you 've got to promise something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to insult her , once you got her here  --  CANAVA I did n't get her here ; you got her here . . . . Well ? RAYMOND TILLERTON What do you want me to promise ? CANAVA To go with me to Carnegie Hall Tuesday afternoon to hear Sascha play . Do you hear ? And talk to him tonight . I want you two to like each other . p. 68 RAYMOND TILLERTON I do n't want to hear him play . CANAVA But you 've got to hear him play ! RAYMOND TILLERTON I ca n't . I 've taken an oath not to go to any of his concerts . And I do n't want to like him . He 's made you ridiculous . CANAVA Furious . Nobody in this world could make me ridiculous ! RAYMOND TILLERTON Muttering . Then you 've made yourself ridiculous . CANAVA What did you say ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Nothing . CANAVA I ask you again : will you talk to him tonight , and make him like you , or not ? He is silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILLERTON Weakening . I ca n't have her insulted . Yes  --  damn it  --  I 'll talk . CANAVA You promise ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Yes . If you promise to be civil and make her love you tonight . CANAVA I 'll be civil  --  but that 's all . And I do n't want her to love me . And I 'm not going to cook . I know you . . . . Go and get her . p. 69 RAYMOND TILLERTON Wistfully . Do be as civil as you can  --  please , mother ; she 's awfully afraid of you . Everybody always is , you know . CANAVA makes some sound that might be taken for a grunt of derision . TILLERTON appears again in the doorway from the hall . TILLERTON He 's coming  --  A young man dashes past him , and almost hurls himself at the outstretched hands of MADAME CANAVA , which he seizes impetuously in both of his . CANAVA Sascha ! SASCHA BLOCH At the same instant , crying out . Brasa ! He is a very radiant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two seem , oddly enough , very well matched . He is dark and extraordinary-looking  --  unquestionably a personality , although in MADAME CANAVA 'S presence he has only the vague value , at first , of an appurtenance . His accent indicates his foreign birth ; but it is the accent of a cosmopolite who speaks half a dozen different languages comfortably and even thinks in any of them . TILLERTON finds himself , awkwardly enough , arrested and interested . SASCHA BLOCH Impetuously to CANAVA . But why did you not wait ? p. 70 CANAVA With bluntness and yet  --  somehow  --  with coquetry . I never wait for anyone . SASCHA BLOCH But I fought quickly to be free of my admirers  --  and you had gone . Did I not play well ? Was that your reason ? CANAVA If you want to know why I did n't wait  --  ask him  --  She indicates TILLERTON , and then remembers details . Oh , I do n't think you know each other . . . . This is Sascha , Stevie . . . . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be my husband . SASCHA BLOCH Bowing as if to an audience ; delightfully impersonal . How do you do ? TILLERTON manages a very stiff bow . CANAVA Rushing ahead with her evidence . He saw me when I came in . He can tell you . SASCHA BLOCH With a sudden thought . But perhaps you did not like my own concerto  --  that I played tonight for the first time ? It is not easy to grasp . CANAVA Frigidly , then bluntly . Oh ! Is n't it ? I cried until I was sick over it ! p. 71 SASCHA BLOCH In delight . Really ? He kisses both her hands , with sudden radiance . CANAVA Still angry in spite of his penitence , almost exploding at him . It 's the most beautiful thing I ever heard in my life ! That 's how difficult it was for me to grasp . SASCHA BLOCH My darling ! CANAVA I was n't fit to be seen afterward . I almost stood up in the box and told you to stop because I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to be alone  --  Do n't start me again  --  SASCHA BLOCH I understand . It is like that for me always when you sing . My heart is left vulnerable and bleeding . I must hide away with it . CANAVA To TILLERTON , as she winds her arm about SASCHA 'S neck , deeply content with his words , and almost lapsing into baby talk . Ah  --  he 's the most wonderful person in the world , Stevie . But she adds , as if explanation were unnecessary . But you 've heard him play ? TILLERTON Often . p. 72 CANAVA Insistently , stroking SASCHA 'S cheek as if he were a kitten . And is n't he the mos ' won'erful person in the world ? TILLERTON In his own way  --  quite . CANAVA Leaning her face against SASCHA 'S , and announcing babyishly . Makes his Ducky cry . ' Cause his music is so boo'ful . Boo'ful things are always awful sad . . . . Sad . A flash of memory makes her suddenly alert as she turns to TILLERTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time I ever heard you say that ! I thought beautiful things were just pretty-pretty then . . . . I did n't know what on earth you were talking about . She turns back to SASCHA , intimately . I thought he was making fun of me when he showed me a Botticelli and told me it was beautiful . I stood there and nearly laughed myself to death . Those long-legged , sheep-faced women do look funny when you see them the first time . Then  --  She reverts to her mood of reverie and baby talk . They begin to get boo'ful . They get more boo'ful every time you see them . Now I think they 're almost as boo'ful as my Sascha 's music . Maybe not quite so sad . . . . But she argues this out with herself . They 're saddest when they 're dancing . Anything dancing is awful sad . She shakes her head as she meditates profoundly in baby talk . Everything dances got ta stop some day  --  Botticelli 's stopped  --  but his sheep-faced women  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his boo'ful new concerto  --  that 'll go on dancing  --  long , long time  --  long as there 's anybody to play violin . . . . But I do n't s'pose anybody 'll ever play it like he played it tonight again . . . . ever . Again she pats his cheek , her spirit rising . He 's my smarty . . . . Is he awful hungry ? p. 73 SASCHA BLOCH Deep in her mood . Yes , Ducky ; awful , awful hungry . A little , odd-looking man has come bubbling into the room with the aid of a monocle . THE LITTLE MAN With an immediate stare at TILLERTON , offering his hand . Bon soir , monsieur . We have met before , I presume ? I meet everyone ; but faces I do not always place at the moment ; pardon me . TILLERTON Obviously at sea . Ah , I see . But I do n't believe we have met before . THE LITTLE MAN Indicates SASCHA . No ? I am the papa . CANAVA Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Steven Tillerton . The Count is Sascha 's father , Stevie . Mr. Tillerton is my son Raymond 's father , Count . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Bent on being agreeable . Ah , then we have much in common . Will you smoke a cigarette , monsieur ? The tobacco is excellent . They are sent to my son by the governor of one of the finest tobacco provinces in Turkey . You will perceive the Houdonyi-Bloch insignia , which is on each one , as a compliment . Turkey is a very interesting country . The governing classes have a great admiration for music . On Sascha 's last visit to Constantinople  --  p. 74 SASCHA BLOCH Frankly , a little contemptuously . My father will talk too much , monsieur , if you will listen . Do not let him bore you . The COUNT shrugs hopelessly . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH To TILLERTON . Ah  --  these sons . . . . But you , too , know something of their manners  --  and when they are artists  --  TILLERTON is lighting the cigarette that the COUNT has pressed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than Raymond 's . TILLERTON To the COUNT , a little proudly . My son  --  our son  --  happens to be a poet . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Sympathetically but not really interested . Ah , yes ; that I have heard from Madame Canava . The poetry does not pay , she tells me . It is unfortunate . TILLERTON Proudly still . One can not deny the fact that there 's no more money in being a poet than there is in dying for one 's country . p. 75 COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Still agreeably , and without bothering to understand . Ah , yes ; monsieur is romantic ; his son no doubt is like him . CANAVA Bluntly . Count , he means it 's a fine thing to be a poet , and he 's glad Raymond is one , whether there 's any . Exactly . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH With music I am glad of saying it is very different . Sascha has made himself very rich . SASCHA BLOCH But everybody knows that , my father . Why do you brag ? TILLERTON He is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOUDONYI-BLOCH Complacently . It is true . And I have both his arms and each finger insured for sums aggregating half a million dollars , in American money , so that if an accident should happen  --  He shrugs . One never knows . . . . Also he is fortunate that he is to marry Madame Canava . In their first concert tour together there will be a fortune . They can get ten  --  twenty-five  --  fifty dollars a seat everywhere ! p. 76 CANAVA Rot ! SASCHA BLOCH My poor father is always greedy . The COUNT bubbles on , not noticing their interruption . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH And when he has her to take care of him I can retire to my large estates in Europe and live the life of a gentleman which suits me well . . . . She will keep him out of trouble for me . We fathers like to be left in peace after a while , eh ? Is it not so , monsieur ? TILLERTON Uneasily . Is  --  is this marriage to take place soon ? COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be pleasant if , when the opera closes , we sail all together , that the honeymoon may be in the castle of Sascha 's great ancestors in Bulgaria . CANAVA As if realising it for the first time . I 've never been married to a Bulgarian  --  or even engaged to one . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH In our country the Houdonyi-Blochs are like kings . CANAVA Practically . That does n't mean as much as it used to  --  though I will say that if I 'd been married to the Czar he 'd never have lost his throne . Suddenly she rises . Sascha , take your father upstairs to the dining-room and tell the maid to give him a bottle of brandy . Stevie , tell Raymond we 'll have supper at once . TILLERTON is glad to disappear into the next room. p. 77 COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Alas ! That we could stay . CANAVA Stay ? Of course you can stay . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH No ; it is not possible . It is for that reason that I came myself  --  to take Sascha away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . CANAVA Of course he 's not going ! COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Imperturbably . To the dentist at ten tomorrow morning he has an engagement . A tooth must be taken out or in his arm there may be difficulty . Five great doctors have decided it . I have consulted the best . Tomorrow at ten I must take him . It is important that I remember . I do not dare to address myself to your delicious brandy or the matter might go from my head . CANAVA Overflowing with tenderness . Oh  --  poor little smarty ! He has to go and have tooth pulled ! SASCHA BLOCH But it is nonsense . I have no pain from it . It is these doctors . My father has me looked at by them often  --  even when I am so strong and well  --  and they must find something wrong for their money . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Yes ; with my race-horses and Sascha it is the same . One must find out troubles before they come , or some day there will be sickness and great losses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better go and have your tooth pulled . SASCHA BLOCH But I 'm hungry  --  ! CANAVA Sagely . Better not eat anything . Have some hot milk after you 're in bed . Good night , Count . SASCHA BLOCH What you tell me I do . . . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Good night , madame . I will wait upstairs , Sascha . He goes . SASCHA BLOCH With his arms about CANAVA . I do not like to leave you , Ducky . CANAVA Caressingly . But he 's got to go home like a good little boy and be put to bed early  --  Oh , God , Sascha  --  that was a magnificent thing you played tonight ! I wonder if those people in that audience knew what they were hearing ? SASCHA BLOCH With sudden despondency and doubt . And what , I wonder , did they hear ? I do n't know . CANAVA With thrilling conviction . I know ! p. 79 SASCHA BLOCH Clinging to her . Without you I am nothing . . . . I am sure of nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caressing him with her usual patter of baby talk . My little smarty . . . . Nobody ever lived who played like my angel . . . . And that 's not all  --  Serious and inspiring now , almost sombre . You 're one of the great composers , Sascha . . . already . SASCHA BLOCH Relaxing , and staring at her . If people had wings instead of arms yours would be the biggest and the whitest in all the world . CANAVA Literal and a little silly again . But my smarty could n't play his fiddle if people had wings instead of arms . SASCHA BLOCH Not paying any attention to her , busy with his own thoughts . Maybe you have wings , as it is  --  big white wings that carry you farther than anybody can follow  --  even I . . . CANAVA Shaking her head , then changing the subject . No . . . . You must go , now . Your father 's waiting . He 's a damned leech , Sascha. p. 80 SASCHA BLOCH I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who live on people like us are leeches . And he 's more useful than most . He really does all the tiresome things for me  --  and I let him alone and obey him most of the time because he 's usually right  --  and it 's easier for us both that way . I try to save his self-respect for him by letting him pretend I 'm half a child and half a fool . . . . Besides , he 's really and truly fond of me . At least , so I believe . CANAVA Drawing his face against her own and patting it approvingly . Nobody fools my Sascha . . . . But I wish he had n't been so damned clever about making everybody think you 're five years younger than you are ! She pushes him away and frowns . SASCHA BLOCH Now  --  now  --  now . . . . Let 's not start all that argument over again , Ducky . CANAVA But it makes me seem an extra five years older than you . SASCHA BLOCH What 's five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Or five hundred years ? . . . As long as you live you 'll love my music  --  and as long as I live I 'll love your wings . CANAVA Angrily . You do n't say anything about my music . A voice , to you , is just an accident . Nothing to be really respected  --  p. 81 SASCHA BLOCH Flatly . I wo n't quarrel with you . We 've not got time . . . . Good night , Ducky . . . . When I leave you I always feel as if I 'm going away limping . . . . It 's such a wrench . CANAVA Still sulky and cross , but gradually melting . Good night . . . . Do n't forget your hot milk . . . . I suppose we 'll be happy together about three years . I 've never been happy with any man longer than that  --  and if the truth were told I do n't believe many women ever have  --  not what I call happy . SASCHA BLOCH We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CANAVA Drily . No . I do n't want to throw cold water , but if that 's what you 're looking for  --  and ca n't get on without  --  you might as well cut your throat right now . . . . It does n't happen in this world , my boy . SASCHA BLOCH I do n't believe you . My love will last . CANAVA Oh , no . But I do n't expect it to . SASCHA BLOCH Do n't you think anything ever lasts ? CANAVA Quietly . Maybe what you feel for your work . . . or your child . . . and that 's enough . Whoever is responsible for this world and the human beings in it probably did n't intend anything more . Her mood changes as RAYMOND comes to mind . You 've got to learn to get on with Raymond . But  --  we 'll talk about that some other time . She does n't finish her sentence , but adds half-angrily . Good night . . . . p. 82 SASCHA BLOCH Reluctantly . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But . . . Good night . He lifts her hands , kisses each one , sighs , turns  --  and drags himself away from her . She turns about so that her eyes follow him . At the door he pauses , and announces very simply . You 're so beautiful . . . . You look like your voice , tonight . Then he goes . CANAVA is dreamy for an instant  --  standing staring at the door through which he has gone . Then she goes suddenly and flings open the door into the next room . CANAVA What in the name of God are you all doing in there ? Where 's that  --  But she checks herself , substituting , as RAYMOND appears in the doorway , TILLERTON following . Well ,  --  where is she ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Wearily . Gone . CANAVA Gone ! Gone where ? TILLERTON She persuaded Mr. Prescott to take her home  --  and they slipped out by the servants ' entrance . CANAVA Why ? RAYMOND TILLERTON She really is afraid of you , mother . CANAVA grunts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , too  --  it was too much . She wanted to wait , to meet you both when she was looking better . p. 83 CANAVA Oh , she did , did she ? Well  --  nobody wanted to take a photograph of her . RAYMOND TILLERTON I do n't know why she felt like that . She looked perfectly beautiful tonight . . . . She always does . She does n't need clothes . CANAVA What did you think of her , Stevie ? TILLERTON I did n't have much opportunity to judge . RAYMOND TILLERTON Miserably . I 'm afraid he did n't understand her . . . . She 's very self-conscious with strangers . CANAVA H 'm . . . . She goes over and jerks on the keys of the electric stove . TILLERTON Your friends have n't gone , too , have they ? CANAVA Getting an apron out of a drawer . Yes . Sascha had to have a tooth pulled tomorrow . TILLERTON Even greatness does n't escape the dentist 's chair , it seems . He smiles . CANAVA What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit ironical . p. 84 RAYMOND TILLERTON What are you going to cook , Ducky ? CANAVA I do n't know yet . . . . I 'll see . RAYMOND TILLERTON Did you ever taste mother 's waffles , father ? CANAVA Did he ? You remember my waffles , Stevie ? TILLERTON No one who has ever tasted them once could forget them . CANAVA I 'll make a souffl ! A souffl is one of the hardest things in the world to make . I 've never had a cook yet whose souffls could touch mine . Raymond , go up and tell Greta she can go to bed  --  if she 's anywhere about  --  and bring the sweet butter out of the ice-box in the pantry , and find something for your father to drink . RAYMOND TILLERTON Right-o  --  He goes . CANAVA Coming to the table . Got a cigarette ? He gives her one , and offers her a match . She refuses , impatiently . Ca n't you ever learn ? I always roll mine first . TILLERTON I am stupid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to wait for that electric stove to get hot . Takes time . . . . Now you can give me a light . He holds a match . She puffs . Then she speaks abruptly . What do you think of Sascha ? p. 85 TILLERTON He  --  he 's a great musician . CANAVA Drily . Everybody knows that . TILLERTON He  --  he seems  --  very nice  --  CANAVA Puffing at her cigarette , thoughtfully . You mean he seems very young . TILLERTON All the world knows that , too , does n't it ? He 's young , of course . CANAVA He 's not so young as they think . Does he seem very much younger than me ? TILLERTON My dear  --  I know your age ! CANAVA Accusingly . You think I ought n't to marry him ? TILLERTON I do n't say that . . . . I 'm afraid Raymond feels very strongly about it , however . CANAVA Raymond 's got nothing to do with it . What is that tart like ? TILLERTON Like millions of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to marry Sascha . TILLERTON If you do  --  I suppose that you will . p. 86 CANAVA It 's a mistake for a woman to think her life 's over at forty . TILLERTON That 's true enough . CANAVA With a sudden thought , frowning . Are you in love with anybody , Stevie ? TILLERTON No . CANAVA Half-threateningly . You 've never been married since you left me , have you ? TILLERTON No . CANAVA Vainly . You never cared for anybody else , did you ? TILLERTON No . CANAVA We did n't have a kitchen like this one , did we ? TILLERTON No . CANAVA Remember when I made my dbut in Faust ? TILLERTON I 'll never forget it , Ducky . CANAVA And remember I said I was going to sing Wagner ? TILLERTON Yes . CANAVA Well , I did  --  did n't I ? TILLERTON Better than anyone in the world . p. 87 CANAVA Remember that Russian Grand Duke who gave me the diamond necklace ? TILLERTON We spoke of him the other day . CANAVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you I dined with him and his wife , in London , now and then ? TILLERTON Yes . CANAVA The first time I ever met her I noticed that she had a necklace exactly like mine . You know you said the way it was put together was different from anything you 'd ever seen before . TILLERTON I remember something of the sort . CANAVA Well , the Grand Duchess said there were only two in the whole world like it , and both had once belonged to the Duke 's family . . . . Naturally , I did n't tell her he 'd given the other to me . . . . Two days ago I saw hers at a jeweler 's , and bought it . . . . Now I 've got both . TILLERTON Quietly . It might amuse the Duke to know that . CANAVA What would he find amusing about it ? TILLERTON The irony of it . Now that Fortune has turned on him , he has had to sell the necklace that he gave his wife  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So her jewels find their way to join those with which he once tried to buy you . . . . p. 88 CANAVA And which made you leave me . A pause falls . She tries to probe his silence . What are you thinking about  --  smiling like that ? TILLERTON With a start . Was I smiling ? I was only thinking  --  a slang phrase came into my head , somehow  --  that the world is very much your oyster , Hollyhock . CANAVA Do n't call me Hollyhock . He takes her hand between his , and pats it lightly . TILLERTON And that 's just as it ought to be , Ducky . You 've the capacity for a very big oyster  --  and life has served it up to you in fine style . CANAVA Touched , and as always a little petulant when moved to tenderness . I want my Stevie to have a big oyster , too . . . . Anyway , he can have a boo'ful souffl ! She becomes suddenly energetic , and moves away , getting out plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making her preparation with the quick , sure touch of one who knows what she is about . She indicates the plates . Put these on the table , and  --  RAYMOND enters , aimlessly , empty-handed , his eyes seeing nothing . Well  --  did n't you bring anything ? p. 89 RAYMOND TILLERTON Startled . Oh  --  no . . . I forgot . CANAVA What did you go for ? RAYMOND TILLERTON To tell Greta she could go to bed  --  and I forgot the rest . CANAVA What 's the matter with you ? He flings himself down at the table , his face in his hands . RAYMOND TILLERTON Desperately . Everything ! CANAVA and TILLERTON stare at him for an instant . Then at each other . Again , with sombre passion . I 've just been thinking . . . . Everything ! There is a sob in his words . TILLERTON Touching his shoulder . Tell me  --  if you can  --  my son . RAYMOND TILLERTON His eyes filling with tears . Do n't  --  father  --  do n't  --  or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't start him , Steve . RAYMOND TILLERTON Oh , God ! It is too late . He is sobbing , indeed , his head in his arms  --  like a child. p. 90 CANAVA Undisturbed , but impatient . Maybe I ought to take you to the dentist . Something may be wrong with your teeth . . . . He 's not healthy , Stevie . I told you that . He gets these spells now and then . Usually it 's about money . But sometimes it 's just pure hellishness . If he 'd take more exercise  --  and get up at eight o'clock every morning , like I do  --  and not eat things that upset him  --  he 's always had a weak stomach  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON Wildly . If you go on talking like that , I 'll shoot myself ! CANAVA Muttering . Oh  --  take poison for a change . RAYMOND TILLERTON Passionately . I warn you ! TILLERTON Intervening , gently . What 's the matter , my son ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Brokenly , lifting his face . I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Everything hurts . There 's nothing ever right . Even love . . . . Oh , father  --  He does not finish . Again his head goes down into the curve of his arms  --  but he 's no longer shaken by sobs. p. 91 CANAVA With a significant look at TILLERTON . Go upstairs , Stevie , and bring down anything you can find in the pantry that you want to eat or drink . TILLERTON Reluctantly , with a sigh . Very well . . . . But  --  But at a sign from CANAVA he goes . CANAVA finds another cigarette in the box TILLERTON has left on the table , and rolls and lights it . Then she goes over and slaps RAYMOND rather smartly on the back . He is unresponsive . She sits on the table and tries to draw his hands away from his face . CANAVA Look up here . RAYMOND is obdurate , and stares down , bracing his head with his hands . CANAVA manages , however , to get one hand under his chin . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter ? Money ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Mastering his voice . Money  --  Inez  --  Sascha Bloch  --  life  --  everything . There is a pause . CANAVA considers . CANAVA In a very businesslike tone . How much do you need ? He is silent . She gets a new idea . Has that tart been trying to get money from you ? p. 92 RAYMOND TILLERTON If ever you speak of her like that again I 'll never speak to you again as long as I live . There is an obdurate silence on the part of both of them . CANAVA Suddenly taking her apron off and sweeping majestically to the stove , turning off the current . I wo n't cook ! RAYMOND TILLERTON Presently , sulkily , but making a move toward peace . Please cook . CANAVA Firmly . No . There the matter ends for a moment . Presently RAYMOND begins again , tearfully . RAYMOND TILLERTON I do n't know what you see in him . . . . He 's just a musical prodigy who ca n't talk about anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best he can give you at any concert . You do n't have to marry him  --  but  --  but  --  if you 're so crazy about him you  --  in God 's name , why do n't you go  --  just go somewhere with him  --  and not let anybody know  --  Do n't let me know . Just go  --  but be decent about it  --  do n't marry him  --  before all the world . CANAVA I do n't like such talk . And you know it . If you were a man you 'd shoot anyone who talked to your mother like that . p. 93 RAYMOND TILLERTON Wearily . Let 's not bother to pretend . You know I have n't your primitive Texas sense of honour . CANAVA No  --  Nobody would ever accuse you of having anything very primitive about you . And they 'd probably run you out of Texas if you ever went there . RAYMOND TILLERTON Passionately . Oh , yes ! Make fun of me , if you want to ! You can . You 're not little and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never had to go through hell ! You just happened . You 're just a lucky shot . You 're just one of life 's mysteries . You  --  He has grown rather interested in what he is saying , but pauses sharply as if hardly daring to say what comes next . CANAVA Patiently , perfectly seriously  --  as she thinks it over , rolling a cigarette . Go on . Most of what you 've said is perfectly true . And thank God it is . For , believe me , my boy , you do n't come as far as I 've come from a Texas prairie without having the wind at your back . RAYMOND TILLERTON A slow , reluctant smile on his lips . You 're wonderful , Ducky . . . . I 'm sorry , though , you had to have me for a son . . . . p. 94 CANAVA Angrily . If I 'm not sorry , why should you be ? RAYMOND TILLERTON I 'm only sorry for you . You 'd be so proud of a son more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her arms . I do n't want any son but my funny little poet . . . . I like my Raymond . . . . RAYMOND TILLERTON Presently , his face against her shoulder . Ducky  --  CANAVA Yes , angel ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Faintly . You asked me if I needed any money . . . . CANAVA A little cautiously . Well ? RAYMOND TILLERTON I do . CANAVA How much ? RAYMOND TILLERTON A lot . CANAVA How much ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Five thousand dollars . CANAVA Almost hurling him out of her arms . Five thousand dollars ! What for ? p. 95 RAYMOND TILLERTON It 's to be a surprise  --  for you . CANAVA It would be all the surprise I want if you were n't always in debt . RAYMOND TILLERTON I  --  I 'm going to be sued  --  unless you pay . CANAVA Very well  --  let them sue this time . RAYMOND TILLERTON Father would have given it to me if he 'd had it . . . . He said he 'd manage somehow to get it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want you to ask your father for money . He has n't anything  --  and never did have . . . . What do you want it for ? RAYMOND TILLERTON He changes his mind , however , about telling , and makes a clean breast of it . I  --  I 've had my portrait painted  --  for you . CANAVA Your portrait  --  ? She takes it in at last . For me ? RAYMOND TILLERTON For you , of course  --  and Posterity . . . . CANAVA stares at him with a helpless smile . RAYMOND continues evenly . I 've always thought there might be something in me  --  you know , that might make Posterity care to know what I looked like  --  And I do n't take good photographs . . . . p. 96 CANAVA But  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON The man who painted it wants five thousand for it . It 's been finished four months  --  and he  --  he keeps calling up  --  He halts , adding lamely . He  --  he wants his money . CANAVA Drily . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANAVA Perhaps he needs it . RAYMOND TILLERTON I never thought of that . CANAVA At last . I never knew anybody  --  not even your father  --  with less sense about money than you have . RAYMOND TILLERTON Passionately , on the defensive . And how much sense would you have about it if you were singing in a tone-deaf world ? CANAVA The world does n't appreciate poetry , I suppose  --  you mean ? Well , perhaps that 's why every poet that ever lived has had to be carried around on somebody 's hip . . . . Is this damned portrait any good ? p. 97 RAYMOND TILLERTON Pierce says so . CANAVA Did Pierce do it ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Yes . CANAVA He 's a fakir . . . . Why in the name of God did n't you tell me if you wanted your portrait painted ? RAYMOND TILLERTON I did n't want to bother you . . . . You were getting ready to sing Carmen . . . and I . . . I had been having premonitions of an accident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly  --  and you 'd be glad  --  after I was dead  --  that you had the portrait . If I should die  --  you would be glad  --  would n't you ? CANAVA Oh ! Angel ! Do n't talk like that . I ca n't bear it ! Her arms are about him again . My poor little boy ! Do n't talk like that . . . . Suddenly practical . Have you been having pains anywhere ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Not lately . . . . CANAVA Then it 's all right . . . and if the portrait is n't as boo'ful as my baby we 'll get one as is . . . . She pushes him away once more and goes to the door , calling . Stevie . . . . Come on down . . . . p. 98 RAYMOND TILLERTON Ducky . . . . Please cook something . CANAVA As TILLERTON enters , empty-handed . Well  --  did n't you find anything , either ? TILLERTON Startled as he realises it . Oh  --  I  --  I forgot  --  too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I was  --  just thinking  --  like Raymond . CANAVA Practically . Put the plates on the table , you two . I 'll get the eggs . She opens a door in the wall , showing a huge refrigerator , which she points out proudly . You see this , Stevie ? It 's a back door to the big refrigerator . The cook does n't have to go into the hall . TILLERTON I see . CANAVA Upon closer examination of its contents . You know , I 've got to get rid of this cook . She leaves everything to the kitchen-maid  --  this refrigerator has n't been cleaned properly this week . . . . I 've only kept her because good cooks usually complain about my singing . The last one told me she could stand everything but noise . She has found the eggs and slams the door shut . Then she turns to RAYMOND . Go up and get that butter out of the other ice-box , Raymond . . . . Give me that bowl , Stevie. p. 99 RAYMOND TILLERTON Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I wish tonight could last . His eyes go from his father to his mother significantly . CANAVA Pausing , sharply , getting his idea and speaking with grave abruptness , a kitchen spoon lifted in her hand . Do n't you suppose I wish that , too , my boy ? Her manner changes quickly . Now go  --  and see if you can remember what you 're going for , this time . RAYMOND TILLERTON Butter  --  and  --  something to drink . . . . All right . He goes . CANAVA As she busies herself with breaking eggs , then presently finds TILLERTON 's eyes on her . You can say what you like , but a kitchen is one of the damnedest most romantic spots in the whole world . . . . It could almost get me tonight  --  if I 'd let it . . . . The kitchen and Raymond and remembering . . . and everything . . . . You know . . . ? TILLERTON Almost with a cry . Do n't I know ! Something dreamy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lays her hands on both his shoulders , looking straight into his eyes , her lips quivering , shivering a little  --  and the half-silly , half-tender baby talk on her lips. p. 100 CANAVA But it 's cold , Stevie . . . . It 's all cold . . . . It 's awful , awful sad . . . sad . . . . But  --  Vehemently , with tragic triumphant common sense . But it 's life ! They stare at each other , uivering smiles on their lips  --  as  --  THE CURTAIN FALLS @x STEVEN TILLERTON 'S apartment , a week later . The afternoon of an early spring day is on the wane . There is something very wrong about the room  --  the bookcases are empty ! STEVEN TILLERTON , without a coat , is very dustily engaged with a large box of old manuscripts . The box is on the floor . Two waste-paper baskets receive most of the papers he is throwing away . A few , however , go into the drawer of a desk which stands open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALTER PRESCOTT , smoking a cigarette , stands near the fire , watching . For a moment neither speaks . TILLERTON Suddenly . Do n't wait for me any longer , Walter . PRESCOTT But you 've almost cleaned that box out  --  TILLERTON But there 's another like it  --  and I want to do a neat job . I want to finish them both . . . so do n't wait . PRESCOTT Not moving . You 'll come back from a walk all the fresher for these damned morbid goings-on . TILLERTON Gaily . Ha ! If you think these are morbid goings-on , you 're all wrong . . . . p. 102 PRESCOTT If you do n't call it morbid  --  throwing away all the manuscripts you 've been working on for years , I do . Another bundle of papers is tossed into the basket . PRESCOTT glances at it with concern as he continues . What was that , now  --  that you just threw away ? TILLERTON Gravely , but smiling . That ? . . . Another unfinished novel . PRESCOTT makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILLERTON checks him by a quick , imperative gesture . No , please ! Any rescue work is absolutely forbidden . He adds in a low voice . I know what 's what . I really do . . . . I 'm not throwing away any masterpieces , my friend . He finds a few more pages , and a smile , rather wry , comes over his face . I used to think there was something in this , though . . . . PRESCOTT What is it ? TILLERTON Another unfinished novel . . . . He looks up , smiling keenly . But it was begun before the other  --  ten years before , in fact . . . . This , and Texas  --  and the Texas Nightingale were all mixed up in that exciting Mexico era . . . . I was still rather young then  --  for a young man who was going to be thirty some day . . . . He flings the pages away , and then laughs and adds as he sees PRESCOTT 'S long face . I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this old paper that 's going up in smoke in a few minutes is only  --  old paper . Anyway , of what use to any man are the dead dreams of great things that he 's never done ? p. 103 PRESCOTT Turning away from the subject , moodily , as he turns away from the fire and faces the empty bookcases . I wish to God you had n't gone and sold your books . This room looks like  --  He does n't finish . TILLERTON Taking up his words and the empty box at the same time , and moving toward the kitchen . Yes , those empty cases are n't very pretty , are they ? Well , we 'll tear them out some day  --  and paint the walls and hang up some pictures . PRESCOTT Suddenly . What has Madame Canava had to say about your selling your books ? TILLERTON Stopping short . She has n't been here since they were taken away the other day . But it wo n't be anything very serious . She does n't believe in reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person has n't time for a few thousand books . He is smiling , as he continues gravely . And I think that she 's quite right . PRESCOTT I hope to God she gets the truth of this transaction out of you , at any rate . TILLERTON She never will  --  and she 's very clever at getting the truth out of people , too . p. 104 PRESCOTT But what would she have done , under the circumstances ? TILLERTON Pondering a moment . She would n't have paid that money back ; and she would n't have let me pay it . She 'd have spent ten times the sum to prove what the facts were ; and incidentally she would damn me with her mightiest damns for having been worm-like and over-delicate . And she 'd be right . . . . The Texas Nightingale has a stern , uncomfortable sense of justice  --  and I do n't want to quarrel with her , because she 's been very he pauses , looking for the right word ; then he finds it , flushing and halting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she discovered that I did n't know Raymond was on the way when I deserted . . . . Wait a minute , will you , while I get rid of this box ? Kitty Mulberry can have it for kindling-wood now . He starts out , but decides to take the waste-paper baskets , too  --  glancing down at their contents , and managing to collect both with his free hand . And she can start a good many fires in her old-fashioned kitchen stove with these , too . PRESCOTT Calling after him . I wish you 'd come for that walk . . . and finish this job when you get back . p. 105 TILLERTON From the next room . No . I 'm going to the opera tonight . That means dinner early . . . . It 's Brnnehilde , you know  --  and it 's after four now . Then he continues , reverting to the subject of the loan , as if it had not been interrupted . Then , besides , it gives me a flattering sense of importance to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the making of that great voice were my personal contributions , after all . PRESCOTT Drily . I suppose you would get a certain satisfaction out of feeling that way . Well , I 'm sorry you wo n't come for that walk , but TILLERTON has brought another box from somewhere , and is already bending over it . PRESCOTT shrugs if you must burn your bridges  --  I suppose you must . TILLERTON Quietly . But they were n't bridges , Walter . That 's what I 've tried to tell you . They never led to anything . . . . And never would have . PRESCOTT Soberly . That 's something you ca n't be so sure about . I 'm off . . . . TILLERTON Good-bye . PRESCOTT goes . TILLERTON continues to sort out papers  --  reading a few lines now and then . KITTY MULBERRY comes in carrying a big scrap-book and a newspaper ; she watches him silently for an instant p. 106 KITTY MULBERRY Suddenly . You ought n't to be smoking , sir , while you 're doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . TILLERTON Never mind , I 'll be careful , Kitty . KITTY MULBERRY Yes , sir . But the lady who used to be your wife would n't have it , sir . TILLERTON smiles but does not answer , and she continues . What I come in to say , sir , was to ask if you 've finished with the morning papers , sir ? TILLERTON Oh , yes . You need n't keep them . KITTY MULBERRY Then you must have noticed this article , sir , about the lady who used to be your wife going to get married again . . . ? TILLERTON A little sternly . What about it ? KITTY MULBERRY Awkwardly . Nothing , sir . Only I was glancing at the paper myself , sir , a little while ago , and my eye fell on the lady 's photograph . Pardon me for thinking it might be of interest to you , sir . TILLERTON Gently . You were right , Kitty Mulberry . Madame Canava 's affairs are of interest to all the world  --  and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to her than I. p. 107 KITTY MULBERRY Sympathetically . Yes , sir ; so I thought . . . . Do you think she 'll be happy this time , sir  --  with him so young , and her own son so set against it ? TILLERTON You must n't worry about that . Things have a way of happening right for her . KITTY MULBERRY Still depressed . Yes , sir . . . . Well , I 'll get back and fly at my cake again . I 've been having foolish ideas , I expect . . . . She always seemed so fond of you . TILLERTON Quickly . That 's all right . She is , I think . KITTY MULBERRY And she 's had a pleasant way  --  once you got used to it  --  of making herself very free around here , sir . TILLERTON That 's all right , too . She  --  she 's used to making herself very free  --  wherever she happens to be . KITTY MULBERRY Yes , sir . . . . I 've cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you , sir . He busies himself with his papers . She continues presently . There 'll be a great many more later , maybe . TILLERTON Oh , yes . p. 108 KITTY MULBERRY They 'll fill up very nice , I must say . I have n't had much to put in about you , these last few years . Items have been getting very scarce . She does n't see the look on his face as his head goes up , and her tone is a little more lively as she continues . But there will be your son 's beautiful poems to add to it , now and then , as time goes on . I 've already pasted in two . TILLERTON Looking far off with something like elation . Oh , yes  --  there 'll be my son 's beautiful poems to add to it as time goes on . . . . KITTY MULBERRY But , of course , literary mentions and poems , and such , do n't show up like a wedding with a lady in it , and photographs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can take it as a great honour to have had a lady like that in our scrap-book at all . TILLERTON Gaily , suddenly , his voice a little strangled . You 're right , Kitty Mulberry ; that 's the way to take it ! That it 's been a great honour to have the lady in our scrap-book at all . She looks at his face . And suddenly she has the sense to say nothing , but goes  --  leaving the conversation at an awkward stop . There is , almost immediately , a quick knocking at the door . TILLERTON opens it himself . RAYMOND , as glum as rainy darkness , enters with a barely audible word . He is to be followed , as TILLERTON sees with great surprise , by several other persons. p. 109 TILLERTON At the door , in amazement . Oh  --  hello . RAYMOND TILLERTON Hello . He is instantly slumping into silence and a chair . INEZ comes next . She is sulking and ill at ease , and almost as inexpressive as RAYMOND . INEZ DALTON Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral , enters , hostility and embarrassment in his stiff demeanour . SASCHA BLOCH Jerking into a bow , almost gulping down his own words , uttered like a formula . How  --  do  --  you  --  do ? He finds an isolated spot behind the piano , near the empty bookcases , where , however , half a dozen volumes lean together in a loneliness that emphasises their isolation . One by one , he takes them down and stares through them . . . . It gives him something to do . His pompous father enters next , strangely without his grand manner . His salutation is entirely in pantomime  --  a wave of the hand back toward one ear  --  that might on the proper occasion be a blithe and taking gesture . Now , however , it is a mere inadequacy . He takes a firm position well forward in the room , beside a table , on which he plays a tune with his gloved fingers . There is a pause . TILLERTON remains , his hand on the door , wondering what in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110 TILLERTON Trying to get his bearings , and looking from one to the other , finally addressing RAYMOND 'S averted head , in particular . This  --  this is an unexpected pleasure . There is , for the instant , no answer . Then suddenly the COUNT wheels about , speaking with great excitement . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH May I suggest , monsieur , that you close that door instantly ? TILLERTON closes the door . TILLERTON Certainly . I did n't realise . . . . INEZ DALTON From the window , briefly , crossly . There 's no one coming . No one answers her . TILLERTON Still perplexed . Is someone coming  --  ? COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH With his hand to his brow , desperately . Mon Dieu ! Your American reporters  --  ! One knows never when they may not come . They are scoundrels . Never are they gentlemen to artists . SASCHA BLOCH Suddenly turning about , pointedly . You do not think that , my father , when we arrive on the ship and you make them listen to your large talk for pleasant pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and takes down another book. p. 111 TILLERTON A little sharply . Raymond  --  ! RAYMOND lifts his head . Continuing . Suppose that you explain ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Gloomily . There 's nothing to explain . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Quickly , bombastically . There is much ! INEZ DALTON Icily , turning around . I should say there is ! Then , as she turns back to stare out the window , she exclaims . Here are two fellows coming now ! There is an alert pause . Then she speaks again . No  --  they 've gone on by . Everyone breathes more easily . TILLERTON Something must have happened . RAYMOND TILLERTON Passionately . Ducky never gives anything a chance to happen ! COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH Furiously to TILLERTON . It was your son , monsieur , who did not give us a chance to arrange for our marriage license  --  p. 112 RAYMOND TILLERTON She prevented Inez and me from getting ours  --  and I 'll never forgive her if  --  He breaks off . The pause grows . TILLERTON  --  Patiently , impatiently . Then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  With intense sarcasm . Ah , that at least becomes clear to you , monsieur ? Your son and this charming young woman  --  He pauses , looking at INEZ . TILLERTON  --  Interrupting . But I thought Madame Canava was singing tonight ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Turning back , scornfully . Do you think that would keep Ducky from mixing in when someone was getting a marriage license for her ! After an instant 's pause he continues , vehemently . She always goes along on such occasions . She 's afraid it wo n't be legal enough unless she attends to everything herself . His voice is a barely audible mutter of disgust as he continues . And she 's got to have it good and legal  --  even if she always lies about her age . p. 113 SASCHA BLOCH  --  Slamming a book shut and turning about . It was necessary , it seems , for you to lie about your age . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Angrily . At any rate , I was n't lying about being five years younger . INEZ DALTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . I think it 's so nice when people are the same age . That 's why Raymond said he was twenty-two  --  the same as I am . She turns back , sure that this shaft has hit SASCHA . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  To INEZ , gallantly . Ah , but you are so young , my child ! That makes the difference . If Madame Canava could be twenty-two I would permit Sascha to be twenty-two also as a compliment to her . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Oh , would you ? When he 's only twenty-five ! COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  Exasperated . But a famous musical prodigy can not be thirty-five  --  the lowest age it seems plausible to give for Madame  --  so about the matter we can not quarrel . p. 114 TILLERTON  --  As everyone glowers at everyone else . But why  --  ? However , he decides not to be rude enough to ask them why they have come , and changes his question . Where is Madame Canava now ? ALL FOUR  --  Answering at once . She  --  Each one pauses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , as everyone else has dropped the matter . She 's coming here  --  so we can have it out . She stayed behind to tell the reporters there was n't any row at all . They knew something was up . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  Elaborately . It is at her suggestion that we intrude upon you , monsieur . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Bitterly . " Suggestion " ! Her orders , you mean . TILLERTON  --  I see . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  She wanted you in it . Besides , she thought we might have the reporters on our trail if we went home . INEZ DALTON  --  Sagely . Well , all we can do , now that we 're here , is to wait . A pause follows . INEZ leaves her post beside the window and sits down. p. 115 COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  Suddenly getting out his cigarette-case , and going over to INEZ . Will you have a cigarette , made-moiselle ? INEZ DALTON  --  Thanks , no . I never indulge . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  Trying TILLERTON . A cigarette , monsieur ? TILLERTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUNT goes ahead and smokes . A pause follows . Then MADAME CANAVA is pounding loudly at the door . Immediately there is excitement . Everyone stands . SASCHA BLOCH  --  There she is ! INEZ DALTON  --  At the same time . She 's here . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  That 's Ducky ! COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  Also in the chorus , expectantly . Ah ! TILLERTON is at the door which MADAME CANAVA is attacking violently . She flings it wide the instant he has released the latch  --  almost knocking him over  --  and storms into the room , taking everyone there into her glance. p. 116 CANAVA  --  To all of them . Well ? You 're here , are you ? Then she turns to TILLERTON . Let 's have some tea , Stevie . I need it . With great violence she adds . I 'm exhausted ! Then she grips her throat hurriedly , feeling it and patting it with her hand , as she speaks in a worried whisper . Do n't let me talk . I 've got to save my voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose you take off your coat and sit down . He is assisting her to take off her coat , and places a chair for her . CANAVA  --  Muttering . Glad to see somebody has some consideration . She drops into the chair and then looks up at TILLERTON , and speaks confidentially , as if she were doing him a great favour . I want to relax . TILLERTON  --  Gently . That 's right . I 'll see about the tea . He goes . CANAVA  --  Vehemently , to the others . Do n't talk to me , anybody , until I 've had my tea . Then , ignoring everyone , she deliberately closes her eyes and rests her head against the back of her chair . The others stand about rather foolishly , looking at one another and pretending a dignity that no one feels . TILLERTON returns with a cup of tea in his hand . At the same moment RAYMOND , out of nervous restlessness , perhaps , begins to pick out the Toreador air from Carmen on the piano . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you stop that noise ? Why in the name of heaven I ca n't get a moment 's peace  --  ! TILLERTON  --  Warning her gently . Ducky  --  your voice ! She remembers , and again her hand goes to her throat as she glares across the room at RAYMOND , who is now sitting dejectedly on the piano-bench . CANAVA  --  To TILLERTON in a mighty whisper . I know . But he 's trying to annoy me . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  To the floor . Sorry . . . . TILLERTON  --  To CANAVA . Here 's your tea . Kitty Mulberry had it ready . To the others . She 'll bring more in a moment , but  --  To CANAVA . I poured this cup for you without waiting for the tray to be ready . CANAVA  --  Taking the cup and sipping the tea cautiously , then almost throwing it on the small table beside her . Thanks . . . . Hot ! She begins to exercise her voice with extreme care  --  listening anxiously to the queer tones that come through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mn  --  mum  --  m  --  Again she pats her throat , this time with relief and affection , as she comments . Not bad . . . . What do you think I caught Raymond doing this afternoon , Stevie ? p. 118 RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Sullenly . He knows . CANAVA  --  And if I had n't happened along , accidentally  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  You came to get a marriage license yourself . CANAVA  --  Sarcastically . Oh , I did , did I ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  And I do n't see how you can call a thing like that accidental . CANAVA  --  Do n't you ? I do . I might have gone there any other day . But if I had n't gone today  --  and if it had n't been Monday , and my lucky day  --  and the fourth besides  --  four is my lucky number  --  you know that , Stevie  --  he 'd have had his license by this time  --  and a wife too , I suppose , for me to support . She can not help glaring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps . She gets an inspired suspicion as she stares again at INEZ , and then at RAYMOND . Good heavens  --  perhaps there 's going to be one anyway  --  She halts an instant , in midair , as it were , to ponder on this . INEZ is first to take in her meaning. p. 119 INEZ DALTON  --  Greatly agitated  --  scarcely able to believe what she 's thought she 's heard . Oh , gracious ! But MADAME CANAVA has turned quickly , decisively , first to the COUNT , then to SASCHA . CANAVA  --  Count , suppose you two leave us alone a moment ? Both SASCHA and his father stir , ready to obey . She continues swiftly . You can go outside and walk up and down , or go into the bedroom and sit on the bed  --  or into the kitchen and have your tea there while you 're waiting  --  I do n't care which . COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  Rather put out . I will wait outside . Come , my son . SASCHA BLOCH  --  Listlessly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Instantly . Show Sascha where the kitchen is , Stevie . . . . With sarcasm . I suppose you know where the sidewalk is , Count ? COUNT HOUDONYI-BLOCH  --  Stiffly . Yes , madame . Au revoir , madame . He manages to retreat from the room. p. 120 CANAVA  --  Calling to TILLERTON , who has gone with SASCHA into the kitchen . Tell Kitty Mulberry to give Sascha some cake  --  if she has any  --  with his tea . Then she continues in a loud , alarmed whisper to herself . I 've got to save my voice ! But she turns instantly to INEZ , and asks bluntly , loudly . Well  --  is there ? But INEZ is stupidly dumb . CANAVA drives ahead , however . Go ahead . You 'd better be perfectly frank with me . I want to know the facts . INEZ DALTON  --  Again in an appalled tone . Oh , gracious ! CANAVA  --  Because if there is  --  while I have no intention of becoming a grandmother at my age  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Interrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolly . Well  --  you 've always had ideas that I considered outrageous ; and if you 've persuaded this young woman to practise what you 've preached  --  to me  --  about free love , and that sort of thing  --  why should n't something of the sort happen ? It would be perfectly natural , and it might explain why you were in such a hurry about a marriage license . p. 121 INEZ DALTON  --  Again , involuntarily . Oh , gracious ! KITTY MULBERRY chooses this moment in which to hesitate in the doorway with the tea-tray she has been getting ready . KITTY MULBERRY  --  Did I understand rightly or not that you wanted tea served , madame ? CANAVA  --  Impatiently , since tea is n't the important issue just now . Yes , put it down . . . . KITTY quickly deposits it on a small tea-table which she places at MADAME 's right hand . KITTY MULBERRY  --  Is there anything more , madame ? CANAVA  --  Suddenly gentle with the old woman . Not now . KITTY goes , having received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous . . . . TILLERTON returns . CANAVA does not smile , however , as she turns suddenly and addresses INEZ . Sit over there . INEZ takes the chair indicated . CANAVA turns to RAYMOND . Sit down  --  why do n't you ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  I do n't want to sit down . p. 122 CANAVA  --  You want some tea , do n't you ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  No , thanks . CANAVA  --  Oh ! Sulking again . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  I 'm not sulking . CANAVA  --  Of course you 're sulking . She speaks to TILLERTON , confidentially . He always drinks tea , except when he sulks . If there 's anything I ca n't bear it 's a person who sulks . . . . TILLERTON is sitting at her left , just a little distance away ; INEZ at her right  --  close to the tea-table , on the other side . CANAVA addresses her again , pouring a cup while she talks . RAYMOND lurks in the distance beside the piano , on which he drums with the tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no sound . To INEZ . You 'll have tea , I suppose ?  --  Miss  --  Miss Whatever your name is  --  Walton  --  is n't it ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Her name is Dalton  --  not Walton . INEZ DALTON  --  Afraid to refuse , and bent on being as amiable as possible . Yes , thank you , if there 's plenty . CANAVA  --  To INEZ , ignoring RAYMOND . Do n't worry . There 's plenty . Nobody 's had any yet . . . . How do you like it  --  strong or weak ? p. 123 INEZ DALTON  --  Politely . It does n't matter . Involuntarily , MADAME CANAVA 's soul snorts in derision of such indecision . At that faint but belittling sound RAYMOND rallies to the support of his beloved . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  She likes it weak . CANAVA  --  Pouring hot water into the cup . Hm . . . . Again to INEZ . Lemon or cream ? INEZ DALTON  --  Oh  --  either . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Quickly . She takes lemon . This settles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a lump of sugar for INEZ 's direction . One or two ? INEZ DALTON  --  Whichever 's most convenient . CANAVA drops the sugar and the sugar-tongs and sets the cup down desperately , on INEZ 's side of the table . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  She takes two . She hates to be any trouble . p. 124 CANAVA  --  Let her take them herself . Then she 'll be sure she 's no trouble . INEZ DALTON  --  Oh  --  I do n't think I want any tea at all  --  if it 's just the same to you . But CANAVA has already turned to TILLERTON . CANAVA  --  You want tea , do n't you , Stevie ? TILLERTON  --  Not now , thanks . There is the slightest pause . He speaks again , uneasily . The Count is walking up and down , you know  --  waiting . . . ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Coming closer , with sudden energy , exploding . I do n't know why Inez and I are here , anyway ! CANAVA  --  Do n't you ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , I suppose . And I want to know why you were in such a hurry . That 's what I 'm trying to find out now . INEZ DALTON  --  Uneasy at the speculation in CANAVA 's eyes and tone . I 'm sure I do n't know what sort of a person you think I am , but  --  there never was anything wrong between us , was there , Raymond ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Loftily . I wo n't even discuss such things . p. 125 CANAVA Drivingly . Then why were you going to marry him ? INEZ DALTON Weakly . I  --  I  --  just to oblige him . CANAVA grunts . The conversation halts for an instant . INEZ blandly gets out a little mirror from her bag and critically inspects herself . TILLERTON Taking a hand and explaining graciously to INEZ . You see , my  --  Madame Canava feels that it 's not a very sensible thing for you two to do . Our son is n't self-supporting , you know , and any money that he has he receives from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  naturally  --  He stumbles a bit . INEZ DALTON Interrupting sharply . He 's got his allowance , has n't he ? CANAVA Unable to keep still . And where do you suppose that comes from ! Heaven ? RAYMOND TILLERTON To his mother . I ca n't stand this ! If you 've anything more to say , say it to me alone . Inez is n't to blame . p. 126 CANAVA Calmly . Very well ; she 'd better go into the bedroom , then  --  or outside with the Count . INEZ DALTON Always willing to oblige . I guess I 'd better go home . She gets out her powder-puff and refers to her mirror again by way of starting . RAYMOND TILLERTON No , not yet ! Come in here  --  He indicates the bedroom . INEZ hesitates . INEZ DALTON I 'll go outside , if it 's all the same to you . I  --  I  --  I think I 'd rather walk around with the Count  --  he seemed so nice and friendly . RAYMOND TILLERTON I 'll take you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she turns back , rather prettily , from the door RAYMOND is holding open . Bye-bye . See you later . Their silence means nothing to her as she goes  --  and the door closes upon her and RAYMOND . CANAVA Oh , my God ! She bursts into heroic laughter ; then she continues , half in anger , half in hilarity . And I 've been hearing how beautiful she was for six months  --  ! I thought I was going to see the sort of face that all the poets in the world ever dreamed of . Maybe I have ! Maybe that 's the sort of face that got Dante 's goat . Maybe Helen of Troy was a little washed-out blonde who did n't know whether she liked lemon or cream in her tea ! You ca n't believe a damned thing a poet says ! p. 127 TILLERTON They have a very difficult time with facts  --  of course  --  poets ,  --  and lovers . He is still smiling  --  a smile in which concern mingles with humour . CANAVA Suddenly serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense out of him  --  ! I wo n't have it ! You 've got to get some sense into his head . TILLERTON Gravely . That may be very difficult , Ducky . And we ca n't watch him every moment . CANAVA Weakly  --  her hand at her throat , her voice sinking to an alarmed whisper . I ca n't sing tonight ! RAYMOND enters . He comes , and stands between them  --  for an instant stern and manly and strangely touching . RAYMOND TILLERTON Have you thought of anything to do about it ? TILLERTON What I am going to do is to ask you to wait . You can do that , ca n't you ? RAYMOND TILLERTON I could wait a thousand years  --  if I had to . Only  --  why ? CANAVA Quietly , after a pause . I 'll give up Sascha . You give her up . p. 128 RAYMOND TILLERTON Oh , mother ! Hope is in his voice for a minute . Then he shakes his head . No  --  I ca n't trade her off , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a great mistake , my boy . You ca n't marry that girl . Do n't you realise that she 's a fool ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Also quietly . You frighten her . You do most people , you know . But she 's not a fool . She 's only shy  --  shy and beautiful  --  and mysterious . . . . He turns his back and goes over to the window . There is silence . CANAVA is grave and intense . She turns to look at him , and suddenly lifts the back of her hand to her wet eyes . TILLERTON Gently . Ducky  --  dear  --  CANAVA Helplessly , in a low voice . He means it , Stevie . There 's no use talking to him . It 's love  --  just  --  but she gets angry as she whispers just plain simple bull-headed calf-love . And he 's as stubborn as a mule about it . Defeat is in her face and voice as she lays one hand on TILLERTON 'S shoulder and the other over her heart . I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like not having my own way . p. 129 TILLERTON Quietly . You will have your own way  --  about Sascha Bloch , at any rate . CANAVA Suddenly , as her eyes focus on the door through which SASCHA has gone . Go into the other room , both of you . RAYMOND TILLERTON From the window , turning about a little . What did you say , Ducky ? CANAVA I said for both of you to go into the other room . I want to talk to Sascha . . . . He does n't move . She continues angrily . There 's a window in there you can look out of  --  if you ca n't keep your eyes off her . RAYMOND TILLERTON Turning half-apologetically , a little stupidly , as if drawing his thoughts away from INEZ with some difficulty . Oh . . . I see . You want to talk to him alone . TILLERTON Tactfully , to RAYMOND . And I 'd really like to talk to you alone  --  my son . There are certain things I feel I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have some influence over him , even if his mother hasn't. p. 130 RAYMOND TILLERTON Desperately . Ducky  --  I ca n't stop loving Inez just because you want me to . You do n't understand her . And anyway  --  how could you respect me if I did ? She grunts ; then in a sudden panic , with her hand on her throat , she begins to try her voice to see if it is all there . CANAVA M  --  mn  --  mng  --  ghm  --  etc . As they stare at her , she explains . I thought I could n't sing tonight  --  but  --  but it 's all right . RAYMOND TILLERTON For God 's sake , Ducky , do n't look like that !  --  as if you thought I 'd tried to kill your voice , even ! CANAVA Bitterly . What do you care how I look ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Half-angrily . You know I 'd rather be dead than  --  than hurt you . CANAVA Then why do you do it ? RAYMOND TILLERTON I 've got to  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't help loving her . No one can ever help loving anyone . CANAVA Drily . No ; but that 's no reason why you should lose your senses  --  and go on like this when you 're too young to know what you want to do . p. 131 RAYMOND TILLERTON That 's not true . You know I 'm not really young . Have n't I always been more like a father to you , Ducky , than a son ? CANAVA Come here . RAYMOND comes slowly . Looking into his eyes , she hovers over him a minute and drapes her arms about his shoulders and begins to talk baby talk with quivering lips . Muvver 's little boy ! Does he feel awful , awful old ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Huskily . Yes . Awful , awful old , Ducky . . . except , sometimes , with her  --  when I feel almost like a boy . . . . Then he tries to draw away , crying out sharply . Do n't ! Or I  --  CANAVA Sagely , gravely , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . That 's the way with love , Stevie . It makes you feel as young as a jonquil one day and as old as the stars the next . Does n't it ? But , instead of answering , TILLERTON goes quickly into the bedroom , leaving the door open . Now she is melting over RAYMOND again , caressing him by playing her hands about his head and face and planting a kiss now and then on his hair . CANAVA And muvver 's won'erful lil ' boy  --  he always feels awful old , anyway . That 's ' cause he 's so smart . He gets old sad thoughts in his head all the time ; that 's why he writes such boo'ful poems . And now my poor little smarty 's heart aches ' cause he thinks he 's in love  --  and that makes his mother 's heart ache , too . Maybe she 's jealous . . . . She did n't think he 'd go round getting in love so soon . p. 132 RAYMOND TILLERTON Pulling away , interrupting . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world  --  except your tenderness , Ducky . It 's awful when I 'm wrong  --  and you 're nice to me  --  only I do n't think I am wrong this time . She  --  she 's so terribly important ! CANAVA Suddenly , quietly . Marry the damned fool if you want to ! RAYMOND TILLERTON Ducky . . . ? CANAVA Only for God 's sake keep her away from me until she gets more sense . I might forget myself and choke her to death . You know how much I love fools ! But RAYMOND seizes on the note of gentleness in her voice , and ignores the harshness of her words . RAYMOND TILLERTON You mean  --  you 'll really let us get married ! CANAVA Yes . RAYMOND TILLERTON Oh ! She moves away from him and sits down heavily . He follows and stands beside her . There is a pause . Then he touches her hair , suddenly noticing it . They got it pretty red this time , did n't they ? It 's better one shade lighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as grey as it wants to  --  one of these days . RAYMOND TILLERTON No . It 's going to stay bright  --  up to the very last minute . CANAVA Sternly  --  with a sudden thought . Remember  --  when I die  --  I want you to see that there 's black on my eyelashes ! I do n't want them to look red ! RAYMOND TILLERTON I 've promised that a hundred times . Let 's  --  let 's not be morbid , Ducky . CANAVA I 'm never morbid . . . . I do n't know how I can stand her around , but  --  Again she has her arms about him . When muvver 's little boy gets over being in love  --  we can always get a divorce for him  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON Sternly . Ducky ! Do n't say such things  --  CANAVA Angrily . Am I trying to make you happy  --  or am I not ? RAYMOND TILLERTON Nodding , miserably . Yes  --  only . . . He ca n't find the right words , for an instant . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to know her . CANAVA grunts. p. 134 CANAVA Hm . . . . RAYMOND ca n't think of anything more to say at the instant , so he lifts her hand and kisses it . RAYMOND TILLERTON In a low voice . So . . . thanks a thousand times . . . . I 'll tell father . . . . Then I 'll go down and bring her up . He goes into the next room . But he turns suddenly , a frown banishing the light in his face , as he indicates by a nod of his head the room where SASCHA is waiting . A little uncertainly . Of course you 've still got him . . . . I 'm glad I went to that concert . His music sort of explains . . . . And I suppose you 've as much right to try to be happy , in your way , as anybody . . . . Of course dignity means such a lot to me . CANAVA With supreme sarcasm , annoyed at his attempt at generosity . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , sternly , as he goes toward the bedroom . Shut that door , and do n't come back until I call you . He looks as if he might answer , but she is already on her way to find her handkerchief which is in her muff , and to open the kitchen door  --  so he obeys , meekly enough . As the door closes behind RAYMOND she calls out to SASCHA . Sascha ! come in here . Bring your tea if you have n't finished . He comes , bringing a cup of tea  --  and a large piece of cake , which he is eating . She frowns at him . How many cups does that make ? p. 135 SASCHA BLOCH Four . CANAVA It 's too much . How 's the cake ? SASCHA BLOCH Gravely , his mouth full . Very excellent . CANAVA It ought to be good . I told her how to make it . There is a bare pause . We 're going to say good-bye , right now , Sascha . SASCHA looks up to find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken almost flatly . SASCHA BLOCH After a pause . I knew all the time this was soon to come . He speaks very gravely , and with perfect composure , although there is distress in his voice . CANAVA Also gravely , and with equal composure . Yes , I knew it all along , too . SASCHA BLOCH All good things are like dreams . And it was never quite real  --  that you should love me . CANAVA You 're a very wonderful person , Sascha . The most wonderful I 've ever known  --  except Raymond . SASCHA BLOCH Impersonally . About poetry I know nothing and I care nothing ; but always I think you value your son too much . However , you are a mother . So that is as it should be . . . . p. 136 CANAVA Give me a bite of that cake . . . . She helps herself from his piece  --  and eats thoughtfully , commenting . Not bad . . . . Mine is better , though . . . . You 've got all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . The best of all is ending now . It was one year ago , tomorrow , I played for you alone  --  that night . CANAVA Unhappily . Do n't talk about that . . . . You 'll marry someone else . . . before another year is out . SASCHA BLOCH That is impossible . I am very tired of my poor father 's company . But for a long time I will tolerate him because he will talk of you , and go into bad tempers because I was not clever enough to make this good match . I shall listen , very much amused but with a great ache at my heart . CANAVA Unhappily . That 's all right to say , but some simpleton will get hold of you , sooner or later  --  like the one Raymond 's picked out ! SASCHA BLOCH With a shrug . Will it matter ? She grunts angrily , broodingly . There is a little pause . He catches at her hands  --  and presses them across his closed eyes , speaking more to himself than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good to need another so much ! I have known that , and sometimes I have had the sense to be afraid of your hands over my eyes  --  shutting out everything . He kisses each of her hands , and again presses each one against his closed eyes , with a sigh . But love is such a wonderful darkness ! p. 137 CANAVA Unhappily . You 've got to work . . . SASCHA BLOCH Dropping her hands and straightening up . Oh , yes . I will work . Though I do not know , now , how  --  or why . . . . Good-bye . . . . You will hear from me , sometimes  --  in music that I might have had no need to make  --  if you had not taken your strong hands from over my eyes  --  and left me staring at an empty world . He turns about , finds his coat and hat , and goes to the door , rather awkwardly . But he turns back with a sudden thought , and a charming smile . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall find my poor greedy father when I tell him we have not got you , after all . He goes quickly . There have been signs of tears in her eyes  --  and for an instant she blinks them away . Then RAYMOND opens the door from the bedroom . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Ducky  --  may we come in now ? CANAVA Violently , in a weepy voice . No . Wait a minute ! She quickly applies her eyebrow stick , lip-rouge , and powder . Then she announces . All right . RAYMOND enters . TILLERTON follows. p. 138 RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  I 've told father . . . . CANAVA Without enthusiasm . Have you ? RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  And now I 'm going to tell her . . . . I 'll bring her up  --  so you 'll get to know her better right away  --  CANAVA Putting out her hand wearily , as if to ward off his enthusiasm . Not  --  not now , my boy . Take her home . I 'm singing tonight , you know  --  RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just a word to make her feel you 're glad ? CANAVA Angrily , loudly . No . I 've got to save my voice . You know that . RAYMOND TILLERTON  --  Yes , I know  --  but  --  TILLERTON To RAYMOND , tactfully . Tomorrow will do . There 'll be plenty of time tomorrow . CANAVA  --  Yes , the world is n't going to end tonight  --  although it might as well as not  --  for all I 'd care . RAYMOND TILLERTON Protesting . Ducky  --  ! p. 139 CANAVA  --  Go on down . Do n't keep her waiting . I 'll see her tomorrow  --  and the next day , and the next , and the next , I suppose ! Suddenly she claps a hand on TILLERTON 'S shoulder , and another on RAYMOND 'S , and begins to laugh . Then , as both stare at her , she breaks into explanation hilariously . Everything in the world always has to happen on the days when I 'm singing ! Last Friday two of the dogs almost died ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to a hotel ! And the Saturday before that  --  She begins her exercises . Mm  --  mng  --  gmn  --  oh-ho  --  ho ! Oh-ho ! Her voice , husky at first , rises into the cry of the Valkyries , and for an instant floats magnificently through the room . Then she speaks again , judiciously . Sounds pretty good , eh ? TILLERTON  --  Oh , you 'll be all right . RAYMOND TILLERTON Who has been thinking  --  propos of his own meditations . We are a bit odd  --  I suppose  --  the three of us . CANAVA With instant solemnity . Yes ; I wonder how in the name of God the three of us ever happened . . . . p. 140 RAYMOND TILLERTON Uncomfortably as she stares with tender derision first at him , then at TILLERTON . Well , I 'll go . . . . See you later . . . . And I 'll give her your love . He turns and gets out quickly to avoid further sentimentalities . CANAVA As the door closes , shaking her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fool of a boy make a terrible mistake . And I know it and you know it  --  just as well as we know we 're standing here . But what can we do about it ? TILLERTON  --  I 'm sorry . Terribly sorry . But there 's nothing to do about it , I suppose , except to pray for a lovers ' quarrel . CANAVA With bitter humour . Oh , no  --  that wo n't happen . He never quarrels with anybody except his mother ! But never mind . Perhaps I can knock some sense into her head . She may have just enough intelligence to learn to answer the telephone  --  in time  --  and put the flowers into fresh water every morning  --  and take the dogs out . TILLERTON Trying to be gay . Yes , she may develop unsuspected virtues as the daughter-in-law of a prima donna . She may even learn to autograph the photographs . p. 141 CANAVA With her usual sarcasm . She 'd have to know how to write to do that . . . . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone through today and sing Brnnehilde the same night . . . . Not one of them ! TILLERTON  --  That 's true  --  probably . CANAVA Suddenly very energetic . I 've got to go . I 've got to have my dinner right away , and save my voice . She falters . At least , I ought to  --  but . . . What time is it ? TILLERTON  --  Just five . A silence falls between them . CANAVA  --  I ought to have dined two hours ago . She moves about restlessly . Give me a cigarette . . . . He does so . TILLERTON Producing a match . Now ; have you rolled it ? CANAVA  --  Yes . . . . Thanks . . . . She accepts the light . Then she rests one hand on his shoulder , and her eyes seem to survey a whole lifetime in the look she gives him . Stevie . . . ? p. 142 TILLERTON  --  Yes , my dear . . . ? CANAVA Her eyes are bright and there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then takes him into her confidence with an outburst , half melancholy , half ludicrous in baby talk . Ducky 's got awful far-away , unhappy thoughts , Stevie . She 's been awful , awful successful ; and she 's gone all the way up a great big , long hill ; but at the top of the great big , long hill she 's looked round and found she 's all alone  --  all alone . Everybody 's left her all alone . And now that she 's getting old she 's ' fraid it 's going to be awful lonely going back down that big , long hill she sees the road going down . TILLERTON  --  Not for you ! Oh , not for you ! CANAVA Energetically , her dreaming , sad , silly mood dying . Why do you say that  --  that way ? What 's to keep me from being lonely ? That 's what I 'd like to know . TILLERTON  --  Your work  --  She grunts in derision . CANAVA  --  What else ? TILLERTON  --  There 's the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's going to stay there  --  until I 'm ninety  --  you 're wrong . TILLERTON Hesitantly . And Sascha Bloch . . . . Only this afternoon you went to get your license to marry Sascha Bloch . CANAVA  --  Who said I went to get a license to marry him ? TILLERTON  --  Did n't you ? Did n't you go with him to the marriage license bureau ? CANAVA Angrily . Yes , but do you know why I went there with him ? TILLERTON  --  I should think the answer is obvious . CANAVA  --  I went to stop the Count from getting the license , or trying to . And I went the minute Sascha came and told me that that was what his father was up to this afternoon . TILLERTON  --  Oh . . . . The Count must be a very enterprising man  --  not to consult the prospective bride . CANAVA  --  Damned enterprising . I did promise Sascha I 'd marry him  --  but that was two months ago  --  before I 'd met you again . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shyly , about something else  --  trying to make her voice casual . They 've named a new oil-town in Texas after me , Stevie . They want me to be there to raise a flag , at a big celebration  --  as soon as my season ends at the Metropolitan . It would be sort of fun  --  for you and me  --  to go back  --  to Texas together  --  would n't it ? Then to Paris , together , again ? p. 144 TILLERTON  --  I 'm afraid you 're talking gracious nonsense , my dear . CANAVA After a pause , abruptly . You mean you do n't want to marry me again ? TILLERTON  --  Why should you marry me again ? CANAVA  --  If I want to marry you , why should n't I ? There is a pause . Presently she turns , abruptly . What have you done with your books ? TILLERTON  --  I sold them . CANAVA Angrily . Sold your books ! Why ? Why could n't you have kept them for Raymond ? TILLERTON  --  I wish I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . I 'm a very unsuccessful sort of person , you know . CANAVA Her arm about his shoulder again . No ! He 's the mos ' won'erful thing in the world ! But he needs his Ducky to take care of him  --  make him work ! TILLERTON Helplessly . Oh  --  but the Texas Nightingale has become the Bird of Paradise of the whole world , and what is a humble citizen like me to do with a Bird of Paradise , anyway ? p. 145 CANAVA  --  Do n't wanta be Bird of Paradise . Wanta be wren  --  just my Stevie 's little brown wren . TILLERTON  --  You 're sure . . . ? CANAVA Vehemently . Of course I am sure ! Her hand goes around her throat and her voice is again a loud whisper . I 've got to save my voice . Must n't talk . . . . But she adds with her usual energy . Well ? Are we going to get married again , or are we not ? TILLERTON Gently , smiling . Not today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies a little too low for that . My pride is in the dust of the years ; and the idea of becoming a bridegroom all of a sudden again is a little bit alarming . . . . You must forgive my humility . CANAVA  --  You mean that ? He nods " yes . " Then her manner instantly changes . She is baffled and hurt , but suddenly winged with dignity . The pause between them grows . She goes over and gropes for her cloak . TILLERTON  --  You 're going now ? She nods " yes . " He helps her , a little awkwardly , with her cloak . Presently he speaks . We must keep on being the greatest friends . We 've Raymond , you know . She agrees with a nod . Then , all ready to go , she suddenly moves toward the fire . He follows her. p. 146 CANAVA After an instant , rather formally . Goodbye , Stevie . . . . Let me hear from you  --  sometime , after I go away . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only not  --  not to Paris . TILLERTON  --  Thanks . I 'll keep in close touch with you , always  --  now that I 've found you again . She puts out her hand . He takes it and holds it . CANAVA Huskily . There 's always been something in me that 's belonged to you , Stevie . Those three years were the best of all . TILLERTON Also huskily . Thanks . . . . They were my best , too  --  the rich years of a lean life . My heart 's gone on feeding from them ever since . . . . CANAVA  --  Then it 's a damned shame  --  She does n't finish ; but presently she begins again in a low , quiet voice . I said it was all cold , the other night . It seemed that way then . And I suppose it is  --  compared with what it was when we were young . But  --  She breaks off , and then resumes impersonally , shivering a little . Human beings are lonely and restless things , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , yes . CANAVA Suddenly bitter and humorous again , picking up her gloves , decisively . And damned fools  --  all of them . Even me . However  --  She pauses , and laughs  --  bracing herself , unconsciously , as if against the burden of many lonely twilights ; and her silence and the lift of her chin say that she is ready for whatever they have to offer . TILLERTON Suddenly repeating . Oh , yes  --  damned fools  --  all of them . Even me . So I 'll tell you a secret I 've not been able to keep from myself . You go your way , and I 'll go mine  --  a little while longer . Then one fine day I 'll come a-wooing . . . in a tall , shiny hat , with an elegant cane , and a gardenia in my buttonhole . . . and if there 's no Sascha . . . and if  --  CANAVA Quickly , happily , angrily , half laughing , half crying . I 'd like to know how in hell I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her throat , as if to allay some tumult there ; then suddenly a frail butterfly of tone struggles from her lips  --  but there is no nonsense about CANAVA as she exclaims critically . Ah  --  pretty good  --  in spite of Raymond , and you  --  and all that I 've been through ! Where 's my bag ? She has swathed herself in her fur coat , and now she lifts the collar about the precious throat as she snatches up her gloves and bag , in the manner of one who is in a great and important hurry . I ca n't stand here talking all day . I 've got to go and get a little rest and quiet  --  if I 'm to sing tonight . You 'll be there , of course ? p. 148 TILLERTON  --  Oh , yes , of course . She does take time , however , to linger hectically a moment longer , gathering him close to her with a wide sweep of her arm . CANAVA  --  You 'll come around for me afterward , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANAVA  --  Sort of like it used to be in Paris  --  when I first began  --  is n't it ? TILLERTON  --  Yes  --  CANAVA  --  And Stevie  --  TILLERTON  --  Yes  --  Ducky  --  CANAVA Very businesslike . Do you think Sieglinde is a better rle than Brnnehilde ? TILLERTON  --  Not for you  --  CANAVA  --  I could sing either ! TILLERTON  --  I know it . CANAVA  --  I 'll sing her some day  --  and show them . She 's got all that first act , you know . Kiss me . . . . Kiss me ! She races to the door  --  and , looking around at a very dazed , happy man , shouts out in a voice to wake many dead . See you later ! As she slams the door shut  --  THE CURTAIN FALLS                                               @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
