txt Police Commissioner Enright last night told the Kings County Grand Jurors ' Association that he transferred " aptain " Honest Dan " Costigan from command of the vice squad because he had been " insubordinate and disloyal . " He said that for the first ten mouths of the Enright administration Costigan was in charge . of the vice squad , but that he was transferred " after being tried and found wanting , and a better man , Inspector , " put in his place . He also said that the Police Department was enforcing the Volstead act along the lines laid down by the late Mayor Gaynor , and that " the police force had been more effective in enforcing the prohibition law than the Federal agents . " His audience took this to mean on the basis of the fatuous " outward order and decency . " The Police Commissioner 's charge of the inefficiency of Captain Costigan as head of the vice squad came after he . had delivered what he referred to " as an account of my stewardship c  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to answer questions about his administration . " Why did you transfer Captain Costigan front the head of the vice squad , and what was behind that transfer ? " asked one of the members . Reads to Answer questions . " That is a fair question , " responded Commissioner Enright , " and I am pleased to be able to answer It . But I shall have to read again a portion of my address to which I fear you did not pay much attention . " Commissioner Enright then turned to I the manuscript from which 14 .. had read 1 , his address and continued : " In the administration of a great department like this , there must eternally be changes in the personnel and in the men who are holding the positions of importance . Some of the most promising men are tried and found wanting and they must give way to other men who can and will perform the quality of service that IS required . Every administration has made changes because , I believe , they have found it absolutely necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dislikes , and beeomr.t so strongly attached to one administration that they are , in some cases , actually insubordinate , and disloyal to the ? succeeding administration . Some have enjoyed reputations wholly out of proportion to their achievements . " I have always been willing to give them a chance and I have always given them more than a fair chance and more consideration than they have rdcelved from other Police Commissioners . 1 have tolerated the disloyalty and inefficiency of some of them far beyond the limits of reasonable toleration . The men I have selected were not my friends but the men that I thought could and would render efficient service to the administration and the people of this city . Looking back at alt of it now , I have no single regret . I have treated them all fairly and squarely , while many of them have treated me to the contrary , and while I am willing to forget ' : heir disloyalty and the damage . they have tried to do the administration , 1 have no , apology to make to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice Conditions . " During the former city and : police administration it was boldly proclaimed , and we were told over and over again until it was actually believed by many credulous people , that an invincible and , sustained vice crusade was pursued froth day to day ; but the facts are that when I took the office of Police Commissioner I found that here were fortyeight fake hotels running in this city , and that they had been running for many-years . They were flourishing and insolent in the fancied security bred by huge profits and long freedom from interference of any kind . I found it number of gambling houses of high and low degree which had flourished for a long time .. I found out that Broadway and the side streets around the white Ilf-ht district , the hotel lobbies , drug stores and other places were thronged with women who were openly and boldly ply lug their trade . These ; ambling houses , every one of them , have been closed , as have the racing information bureaus . All of them have moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beyond the city line or just beyond the borders of the State . The gamblers nave been working ' just beyond the city line or beyond the Hudson River . They do not establish themselves In these distant places , away from their clients and tl.ese green pastures , when times are good and the . police are not vigilant In : Neu lork . After he had finished reading the extract from his address the Commissioner referred to Costigan . " The man in charge of that work for the first ten months of my adminis- : tration as Police Commissioner was Captain Daniel Costigan , " he said . . He was the head of the Vice Squad , and after I had tried him and found him wanting I gave the work to a better man , Inspector . " Discusses Dry Law . I His reference to the Police Department 's policy in dealing with the en , forcement of the prohibition law came in reply to a question asked by another member . ? " What are you doing with regard to the enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the juror asked . " Soon after the Volstead act became operative a year ago , " Commissioner Enright replied , " there was a conference of local and . Federal officials . The conference was attended by the District Attorneys of the five counties in the city , the United States Mario , . ttorney.t , in7. ' self and Chief Inspector Lahey . It was decided that the en : forcement of the Volstead act was I properly within the jurisdiction of the IFederal authorities , and the opinion of la Judge in Maryland was used as the oasis for that contention . The local authorities , of course , were expected to assist the FedePal agents when called on . We followed that policy until Nov . I. when Judge Tuttle of ? Binghamton , Y .. I think , said that there was a hick in the State prohibition law under which the police of the cities could act . I consulted Corporation Counsel O'Brien . and he decided that there was a kick in the State law , and thereupon I issued orders to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the lines laid down by Judge Gaynor when he was Mayor . I can say to you that the police of this city are doing more in the enforcement of the Vr , istead act than the Federal agents . " After the Commissioner had finished his address members of the association said It was their understanding that the police were enforcing the prohibition law under the " outward order and deMIseency " rule laid down by the late ayor Gaynor to Rhinelander Waldo , ? Police Commissioner in the Gaynor Administration . The Police Commissioner was asked why he had abolished all of the special squads established by the preceding Administration . " That story is false , " be replied , and added that when he became Commissioner , in the first month of Mayor HyInn 's administration , ho found all the special squads abolished and the depn.rtinent in a state of chaos . He said that his predecessor , Frederick H. Bugher , had not appointed any Deputy Police Commissioners during the short time he was in office , and that not only had the routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force had been affected . " Every one of the special squads ex 1 ists today , " he said . " I have added one to them and increased the number of men in many others . The Mitchel-Woods administration . for a reason I ca n't understand , transferred the members of the bomb squad to the Military Intelligence Service , , leaving no men in the department to handle that most important work . When I became Commissioner I reorganized that squad under Detective Sergeant James J. Gegan , and the squad is doing better work than ever before . " Laws Are Inadequate . " The laws relating to the punishment of criminals are inadequate , " said the Commissioner , " and criminal procedure is hedged about With delays caused by all sorts of sharp practices , which makes police work hard and the administration of public justice difficult . " The use of the nightstick , which has been one of the great symbols of law and order in this city , has been denounced , and a few instances of alleged police brutality used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of police law enforcement is stayed the criminal prospers , because the rule of the nightstick is the only law which he respects , and , so far as this particular element is concerned , it is the ir.ost effective measure at our command . " This much is certain , we must inaugurate a better , stronger and a far more prompt administration of public justice , the kind they call ' Jersey justice . ' The commercialized bail ? evil should be the subject of immediate reform . No criminal charged with a felony should be bailed before he is arraigned in a magistrate 's court . If there is one thing , more than any other , that the criminal fears it is to bo placed In the line-up which takes nlace at Po , . lice Headquarters every i  --  rning , and If he can avoid this ordeal by gaining release under bail his chances to escape conviction are greatly improved . " If he is brought to the line-up he will be confronted by hundreds of detectives who will recognize him and remember his previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city the detectives will retain a mental picture of him and know him if they see him again . teSides , there is a psychology in the line-up that frequently causes- these men to confess their crimes and therefore greatly aid the police in handling their cases .
