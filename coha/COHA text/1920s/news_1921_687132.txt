txt Out of the smoke screen of misleading statements issued by bah : sides in the ladies ' garment industry , one solid fact emerges . . By an instrument signed on , June 3 ' the Manufacturers ' Protective Association agreed to the organization of a ' joint commission , composed , of three members of the ; association and three , members of the union , which . ' should study shop* and labor . conditions with a. view to in-. creasing production and which should make ' areptirt ' with recommendations on Nov. 1 .. The joint commission was formed and it met . frequently , during the Summer . But the manufacturers , instead of ' waiting for the final report and ? recommendations , on Oct. 25 arbitrarily decreed a return to the piecework system , an increase of hours and a reduction of-wages . The reduction of wages and the increase of hours , far from , being the result of joint ' study and , agreement , were to " be determined by the Executive Committee of , the Manufacturers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duly authorized board of conciliation Vas thrown upon the scrapheap . The action is the more indednsible because ? the manufacturers have the weight Of justice and reason upon their side . It is not true that , as the workers have protested , piecework means " a return of the old sweatshop conditions . " The Joint Board of Sanitary Control , will see to that . But there can be no doubt that piecework will greatly increase production , giving merited opportunity to able workmen , and will lower prices to the public . In doing this it Will benefit not only the general public , ' but eventually the garment workers themselves . . The buyers ' strike continues in the clothing trades and without lower prices it can not be broken . The Labor Department at Washington reports that the cost of clothing in New York is still 131 per cent . above what it was in 1914 , being exceeded by only one notable item , furniture . Food is only 50 per cent above what it was then and shelter only 44 per cent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result from subletting . As a whole the cost of living in New York is only about SO per cent . higher . Thec , vast public of those whose wages ' have been deflated simply can not afford clothing at the present prices . Revival in the trade is definitely conditioned upon lower wages and increased production . In insisting upon wartime wages and conditions the garment workers are acting not only against the present in. terests of the community as a whole , but against their own ultimate and collective interests as wage earners . The truth of this- has been thoroughly burned into the popular ' consciousness and is doubtless evident/to the leaders of the garment workers , whose intelligence- isfar higher than appears in their fighting propaganda . All that should be needed to restore harmony and at the same time insure just conditions in the industry is frank conference and an honest effort toward conciliation . The manufacturers have formally agreed to this ; the joint commission is in existence and in possession of the necessary data .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
