The heavy importations of gold into this country , as well as the consequent drop in money rates and trade activities , has had a rather striking effect upon most if not all of the Federal Reserve Banks . Not only have the latter received less interest per dollar loaned , but their loans have contracted very greatly . Few Reserve Banks are at present earning the 6% dividend payable on their stock . The question is thus rapidly coming to the fore-should the Reserve Banks pay dividends out of surplus ? <P> The payment of unearned dividends out of surplus is very generally frowned upon in corporation practice . Yet , in part at least , this is what surplus is for . Moreover the structure of the Reserve Banks might well suffer , should their dividends be long cut or suspended . Their stock is held by the member banks , state or national . The latter must belong to the system under the law . But membership in the state banks is entirely optional , and many state banks have never seen fit to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system over the country 's banking business . If Reserve Stock produced no dividends , state banks would scarcely be inclined to invest in it , as they would have to do in acquiring membership in the system . <P> The real trouble has been that the U. S. Government has , under the specious pretext of a " franchise tax , " confiscated the earnings of Reserve Banks over dividends at a modest return to surplus account . The Reserve Banks should be allowed to accumulate large surpluses , so that , in just such times as the present , they could pay dividends out of surplus for years if necessary .
