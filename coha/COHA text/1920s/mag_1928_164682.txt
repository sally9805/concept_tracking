It was a warm week in New York State . At the end of it , Nominee Smith motored down Long Island to Hampton Bays , where stands Canoe Place Inn , oldtime roadhouse patronized in summer by Tammany politicians and Southampton society folk , in winter by hungry &; thirsty duck-hunters . Surrounded by friends , family and the ears and eyes of the public press , he plumped into the salt water in a white-striped bathing suit with a gold religious medal hung around his neck . He rolled like a porpoise , spouted like a whale , chortled like a boy . The cooling off had been made doubly welcome by a series of political backfires during the week-the Owen " bolt , " the Simmons resignation ( see p. 11 ) , the digging up of some anti-cigaret legislation which the Nominee had introduced under pressure as a young legislator , and the republication of that same legislator 's entire voting record on legislation touching public morals . The latter " expose " was the work of Willian Allen White , the round-faced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gazette , stout friend of Nominee Curtis . Earlier in the month Editor White had sketched the Smith record in an editorial and Nominee Smith had answered sketchily . He had accused Editor White of giving currency to inaccuracies broadcast by a New York clergyman-propagandist ( TIME , July 23 ) . Editor White had engaged two investigators to scour the New York Assembly 's Journal . Last week , armed with a mass of documents including photostats , he spoke forth again . He said : " Governor Smith has been a busy man , a fine , useful American citizen since he left the New York Assembly in 1915 . But , in his many activities , he has forgotten much of his Assembly record . . . . " He , with all his intelligence , with all his honesty , with all his courage-seems to have left his high qualities in escrow with Charles Murphy oldtime Tammany Boss when he went to Albany and there made a Tammany record on the saloon , the gambler and the prostitute . " No Klansman in a boob legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more subservient to the crack of the whip than was Al Smith-ambitious and effective and smart as chain lightning-in the Legislature when it came to a vote to protect the saloon , to shield the tout and to help the scarlet woman of Babylon , whose tolls in those years always clinked regularly in the Tammany till . . . . " I am throwing no mud at Governor Smith . He is honest , he is brave , he is intelligent . I do n't question his motives . To get where he is with the crowd he had to do what he did and from his standpoint it was probably worth the price . But the real point of interest in that record for the American people now , if Governor Smith will defend it , is the picture of Tammany putting pressure on fine , aspiring young men like Al Smith . . . how it overlays his conscience with Tammany psychology . . . . " I make no claim here that Smith is a Tammany plug-ugly . I honor him for having risen from the debasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the old record of a young man . But the young man rose on this record . . . . The Tammany system goes on today as it went on 100 years ago and , indeed , as it will go on in our American cities unless Governor Smith and the sinister forces behind him are overthrown . " Editor White , who was in
