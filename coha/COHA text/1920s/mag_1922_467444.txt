AMONG the phrases commonly used to liberate us from the need to think figures one that is applied sometimes to schoolboy , sometimes to emperor : " a born leader . " Thus we describe the man who emerges from among his fellows into a leadership that grows famous , sometimes infamous , which , historically , is much the same thing . Yet we seldom ask ourselves exactly what leadership means . We do not consider whether it is man who molds circumstance , or circumstance that molds man . We do not ask ourselves whether the leader leads because such is his temperament , or whether he leads because in single file some one must walk in front . The leader may merely respond to an appetite . All of us , sometime , must eat a piece of roast beef , or , as the case may be , a nut sandwich . We impart to beef or nut no sacred character . Without wanting to cheapen my betters , I might suggest that many a leader is a man who stands in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where at first he finds himself uncomfortable , and where by degrees he ' decides to act a part . That creates a difficulty as we seek out the leaders of mankind , for some have acted the part wonderfully well . Louis XIV of France was a fine specimen of the sham leader . He was the man who , descending the steps of his palace at Versailles just as his chariot drove tip said to the coachman , " I nearly had to wait . " He it was remarked to his wife , when she ventured to criticize a decision , " We have taken you , madam , so that you might give us children , and not that you might give us advice . " He made an immortal phrase , " The State , that 's me . " He was splendid : embroidered and jeweled clothes , fine nasal VoL . CXLIV . ?

Some one rather like him had a fall just before the armistice . Louis XIV spent his life in spreading throughout France famine and glory , those bosom friends ; he patronized the arts as an arbiter of fashion ; in the last portion of his life he chose generals for their elegance , rather than for their methods . He left behind him nothing but ruins , which before the end of the century were cleared up by the French Revolution . Many such frauds live in history : Lorenzo the Magnificent , Charles V of Spain , Charles XII of Sweden . They glitter through the pages , but we know that the true man may be imitated as easily as the genuine diamond . Their glow tends to throw pallor over the real people such as Bolivar , Lincoln , Bismarck , Gambetta . They deceive us ; they taint our idea of leaders ; they prevent us from recognizing among the men in shining armor those who are clad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , and they endure . Some one must speak the mind of man . This does not need a very large man . As a rule the national leader has all the qualities of the common man , but he has them to a greater degree . There , probably , is the root of the leader . If we consider such persons as Cromwell , Napoleon , Caesar , Washington , if we carry this into modernity , to Mr. Lloyd George or Lord Northcliffe , in all we find allied traits . The leaders are resourceful , not always original . They are men of action , not men of dreams . They do not allow " the native hue of resolution " to be " sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought . " Mr. Bernard Shaw said that be who can , does , and he who can not , teaches . One might parallel this by remarking that he who can think , thinks , and he who ca n't , acts . This should not be taken too literally ; though it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great common man , here is a rare quality . Commonness attains greatness only by being common enough . We see something of this in historical careers . Cromwell had audacity in action . On the outbreak of the British civil war he contributed to the Parliamentary war chest , he formed the Eastern Association against the king , and joined the Parliamentary army . The reader will observe the radicalism of his attitude . Any man might think of doing one of the three things ; Cromwell did them all . Later , leading the Independents , he seized the person of the king . It was he who observed the enthusiasm of the Cavaliers , and opposed them with a group of " godly men . " He cared nothing for public opinion , and demanded the head of Charles I , knowing that public opinion , well bullied , would indorse his action . He believed in force first , and his cruelties in Ireland were due to his belief that he must strike terror . The paradox of his career was that he who had beheaded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the muddled chamber , dissolved it , and became a despot . The word " toleration " he did not understand . His was a simple mind ; when lie proclaimed religious freedom he announced that this must not apply to Roman Catholics and Anglicans . On the other hand , he had a capacity for conciliation , and was capable of saying to members of Parliament , " My brethren , I pray you to consider that you may be wrong . " He was a narrow Puritan ; offenses against morals and slackness in churchgoingappeared to him felonious . At the same time , he had a broad mind ; his colonial wars with Holland and Spain , the exploits of Blake , embodied for him the idea of Empire . It was Cromwell who made the British navy into a national institution . Caesar was a different kind of man , but he had the audacity of Cromwell . In his youth he dared to marry the daughter of Cinna , though at that time in Rome SulIa was master . Sulfa determined that there should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detested , and demanded that Caesar should divorce the girl . Young Caesar defied the tyrant . He had sagacity . Ile was in a way a modern statesman , for when Pompey 's soldiers were demobilized , instead of allowing them to develop a grievance he settled them on the land . At the same time he made terms with the capitalists . Englishmen will think of a minister rather akin to him . On the other hand , there existed profound differences between him and Cromwell . Csar was throughout a democrat ; he always stood for the small man 's interests , whereas Cromwell stood for the small man 's soul . Also , there was no Puritanism in him . The early and middle parts of his life were extravagant and licentious , and at the age of fifty-four , when he was commander-in-chief of an army , he spent a year in Egypt toying with Cleopatra , and brought her back to Rome . Yet this voluptuary owned no cruel lusts . After conquering the Gauls he left them their customs ; he gave up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in Rome he forbade massacres . When we come to Washington we find some one less complex . Here is a man together strong in resistance and in action . We find him obstinately holding out at Fort Necessity and during the retreat of Braddock 's army . At the same time he is as bold as a pirate of the Spanish Main in his attack on Trenton . We find in him , as in Cromwell , insistence on discipline ; he is always building up his forces and can by magnetism prevent the mutiny of unpaid troops . Yet , though Washington is bold , he is cautious . As President , in spite of the flaming memory of Lafayette , lie is wise enough to remain neutral during the wars between revolutionary France and monarchist Europe . He knows how to keep out of trouble . That is because Washington is essentially pacific . It is no fire eater who takes over the command of the American forces , and it is largely thanks to him that his countrymen accept the John Jay Treaty with England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as simply and as efficiently as he can . To him the job matters , and he is not personally ambitious . Washington was a nobler man than most of the great leaders . It needed a fine spit it to resign his command after the Treaty of Paris , to refuse any money reward , and to retire to Mount Vernon . More remarkable still was his refusal of a third term as President , for in those days republics were hardly respectable , and most men must have thought it normal to pass from presidency to kingship . As for Napoleon , here we find again immense audacity , but we do not discover the noble modesty of Washington . We find an inflated ego , a passion for white mantles sown with golden bees , for Roman laurel leaves , fast women , and slave courtiers . We find also a queer sagacity in Napoleon 's attempt to make vassals and friends , instead of following the Romans and placing Europe under a direct yoke . Napoleon appears in history as a brilliant man , and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code and its national theater ; he created conscription and the French tobacco monopoly . All the same , we must not be deceived . These are interesting sides , but they do suggest the All Highest . Napoleon could never let anything alone , and if he had not had the rare faculty of choosing his subordinates well , he would have known ruin much earlier . But Napoleon chose well because he was a democrat . He might place the imperial crown on his head , but he remained the son of a small man in Corsica . He often tried to be dignified , then broke down and joked with a sergeant . He was essentially a common man , and he knew it , for once he remarked : " To lead men you must understand them , know what they want , know what they dislike , be akin to them , then you need only to have a will . That is the only difference between them and me . " One wonders whether Lord Northcliffe would formulate differently his type of power . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common strain ? they all dare . In general they have a good opinion of themselves ; they have clemency ; they can compromise . In general , too , they are not royal . Caesar and Washington were gentlemen , Cromwell was so-so , and Napoleon nobody . All have that quality of sagacity which tells them how far they may go ? that is to say , what the common people feel . If Cromwell were alive to-day he might edit with success an " uplift " magazine . It also matters that big men are seldom the sons of big men . Seldom is leadership hereditary . When we consider , for instance , Lord Gladstone , an estimable and competent man , we wonder that so faint a glow replaces the flame . Possibly the atmosphere of leadership stunts the growth of leadership ; there is no room . Queen Victoria complained that Mr. Gladstone addressed her like a public meeting ; if the queen suffered so , what can have been the experience of Mr. Gladstone 's son ? The leader can not be bred like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no contact with the common man , whom he knows only at second-hand . Living in splendor , the son of the leader can not aspire to splendor . It holds no glamour for him . If he is very highly born , habitual splendor goes with him , but then it is aloof . What is nowadays called a real leader must come out of the people . One thinks of Mr. Lloyd George , this X of the political equation , which is given to becoming Z whenever the equation approaches solution . Nobody knows Mr. Lloyd George , though his biographers are many . Possibly one can sum him up by saying that he always knows how far he may go . While a common man in a railway carriage wants cinemas open ( or shut ) on Sundays , and loudly proclaims what should be done , Mr. Lloyd George seems to feel whether more people want the cinemas open than shut . If he is not sure , he leaves the doors ajar and waits to see what happens . One does not suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows his Tennyson . It may be that he plays bridge , but if so he also plays whist . In his speeches lurk matters such as workmen 's trains , the garden , the domestic dog , true love tinder orange blossoms . There lies the leader 's magnetism ; he is in sympathy ; he understands . Especially , the common mart feels that he understands his leader ; that induces the common man to love him . Mr. Lloyd George is probably a great leader ; he leads because he goes the same way as the common man , and not much faster . He keeps in sight . When he is not quite sure he takes upon himself , as does sometimes Lord Northcliffe , the position which is related in an old English story : A man sitting by the roadside watched go past a large crowd . A little later there came toward him a man distressed , dusty , wiping perspiration from his brow . As he stopped to take a breath he remarked , " I must go on . " The spectator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? " " Why ? " replied the unhappy Ina n . " I 've got to follow them . I 'm their leader . " So much for the great , the national , leader ; but mankind is molded by those who apply the laws as much as by those who make them . All ministers learn that when they come up against Civil Servants . There are leaders everywhere , as if big leaders had upon their backs little leaders to bite them . Where twomen are gathered together , one is the leader . He is a miniature copy of Napoleon ; he not only wants to do what he chooses , but he wants the other man to do the same thing , just because he chooses ; he wants the sensation of making the other man do what he chooses ; invariably he thinks that he is in the right , because he thinks so . He considers that the other man does not know what is right , because he is the other man . Also , he feels a certain affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather sorry for him . Briefly , he has will , and leadership is the spoil of will . Thus , we find the minor leader , one day a priest , another day a nobleman , or a lawyer , or a financier . Most of our modern leaders arise among those types , for the day has gone when leadership fell to complete classes ; now it falls to individuals selected in those classes . Whereas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries leadership was shared between the priest and the nobleman , who occasionally enlisted a bourgeois capable of arithmetic ; while in the last century the lawyer came forward to share power with the financier , now we recruit individually . The priest has disappeared ; the nobleman practically went with Lord Randolph Churchill , who in his budget speech quoted a proportion as , let us say , 12.4 per cent of something else . On it being pointed out to him that the proportion was not 12.4 , but 1.24 per cent , he remarked , " Oh , never mind the damned dots . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as ours financier engages in a desperate struggle to tear it from the law . The transfer of power took place more swiftly in America than it did in England . There seemed to have been no men of title in America . It is as if the gentlemen of England felt it absurd to maintain these distinctions in old , wild Virginia , in a New England that was not yet trim . In America it was the lawyer who seized power , and it was not long ago that he began to share with the financier . The change from junker control to legal control was natural enough . The first American leader was a military pioneer , a sort of fighting squire , rather akin to the old English barons . The squires finished their job , as did the barons : they organized the country . When the Indians were subdued , when /coed government began to flourish as far as the Mississippi , the days of battle were done . The time had come for commercial organization , and a new type of man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Boston , and was heard of no more . That change over from military to civil power is the natural response to changed conditions ; it is not a thing to deplore , but it has produced a new kind of leader . Whereas the military leader had cut down jungles , the lawyer began to tape them up into neat bundles , while the business man put them up for auction . We therefore needed a leader with a more balanced mind , who preferred fair play to blows and knocks . Naturally , he went to the bad , as leaders do , and soon gave up fair play for selfadvantage . But , though the lawyer and the business man jabbed with their pens with as deadly effect as had been done with swords , they began to give a new organization to the world , the commercial organization of to-day , the neat balance of conflicting interests . That type of man we find in power to-day . He knows how far he can go in business ; he enters into the feelings of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies psychology a little ; he asks himself what people want instead of telling them to do his will . He uses his strength when he can , his craft when he must . He is less magnificent than the soldier of old ; lie leads by persuasion and compromise . Thus one may say today that the leading man , whether he is in charge of a factory or of a political department , must prove more supple than the leader of a few hundred years ago . That is because in a world where technical knowledge tends to prevail he finds many rivals equally equipped . He can predominate over them only by character , by will , by stratagem , by subtlety . A few hundred years ago a man who possessed knowledge possessed power . To-day all have some knowledge , and so we come to a reversal of history . Whereas , once upon a time , the learned man was under the strong man , while three or four generations ago the learned man led the strong man , now among the learned men it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find confronting each other two types of strong man . The lawyer is waning , for his profession leads him to caution , which is not good for the will ; he is a learned man , and his character is not well fitted for contest . He thinks of the regular rather than the dramatic . The struggle is already set between two formidable antagonists , the man of business and the man of science . The man of science is the latest product of humanity . He has always existed ? Geber probably played with mathematics three thousand years ago ; very likely Archimedes was killed at Syracuse while he was working out a problem ; Galileo did protest that the earth does move . We find the scientific man all through history , from the time of the Egyptian and Chinese engineers . There have always been men curious of life , men interested by an accident , such as the effect of fire on copper ore , from which came smelting . They had the mind which wants to know . They make a type of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much rather not know , for fear knowledge prove inconvenient . But only a hundred years ago or so our scientific man worked alone ; there was no laboratory where he could obtain helpers , apparatus , and textbooks . There were few textbooks , because until then most of them had been burned in the name of religious conformity . Sometimes a scientific man also was burned . Therefore the scientific man had to display genius . One became a man of science because one could n't help it , as one became a poet . The result was very original , but it was scanty . The times have changed . Now pure science , and especially applied science employ all over the world hundreds of thousands of people . There is systematic research ; one no longer flukes upon a discovery , such as the law of gravitation . There may be left to discover something quite as extraordinary as the law of gravitation ; it may be that Newton was wrong , and that a different law prevents our concussion with the sun . But if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research rather than by inspiration . Recently we have concluded that electrons exist because inductive reasoning seems to show that the atom can not exist without the electron . The modern method is laborious ; it progresses by precedent , contradiction , assumption . Therefore it no longer has much use for the poetic mind . A man may say , " I will prove that the moon is made of cream cheese , " and then take the steps in research which may demonstrate that the moon is so made . He may stumble upon lunar composition , but much more likely he will discover the composition because he is looking for it . That is the scientific mind . It is cool , difficult to deceive , absolutely careless of tradition , morals , accepted views . It cares for the truth only . If the truth must have " bad " effects , that can not be helped . It doubts whether there are " bad " effects , and considers that there are merely effects . Sometimes this mind is jealous , for it is still hijnian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end it publishes them , and it seldom tries to sell them for money . The scientific mind is not mercenary , because it is thinking of things other than money . The scientific man is , like other people , capable of lies , baseness , disloyalty , but he is seldom grasping , because money has little value for him except to buy moreapparatus . He is a man who plays with toys ; he is like a supreme child making new palaces with old bricks . The business man is perhaps his opposite . He is not without the passion for creation ; he takes a strange joy in increasing his turnover and his profits ; he likes to add floors to his office , to extend his branches . Whether he be commercial or industrial , he belongs to the same type , for the industrial business man is seldom scientific . He employs the scientific man , but he does not join him . He wants something else , money and the power that goes with it . ( I am not making an unfavorable comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes with that . ) The business man is not concerned with truth ; things are what they seem , and that is good enough . If what he believes profitable is proved untrue he goes over to the new gospel without hesitation . He takes no interest in methods unless they are cheap . His desire is to make money as quickly as possible , as much as possible , and as easily as possible . He is not interested in tradition . If he comes against a good old thing he retains it ; against a bad old thing , he scraps it . He is akin to the scientific man in that he respects nothing . Incidentally , he does not respect science . He will use it , buy it as cheaply as he can , just as he buys men , but there is always in his mind the idea that the scientific man is wasting his time , until , of course , he produces aniline dyes , synthetic rubber , or cultured pearls . The business man is essentially secretive , because secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of money . He is not stupid ; he realizes that his customers must make money if they are to buy from him , but that does not apply to his rivals . Thus , if he sells baby carriages he wants the bankers , linen drapers , grocers , etc. , to make as much money as they can so that they may buy baby carriages , but he inevitably desires the ruin of every other baby-carriage maker in the world . Thus , if he comes upon a device enabling him to make equally good and cheaper baby carriages , he conceals the process or patents it , while the scientific man publishes it . One might say in general that the scientific man does not care what damage he does to ideas , while the business man does not care what damage he does to people . One might also differentiate them temperamentally by saying that no man goes into scientific research for money , while no man goes into business except for money . In that sense the two are polar to each other , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer . The scientific man may set out to be another Crookes and end up as a wealthy patentee ; the business man sets out as a beast of prey and ends up as an introducer of model villages , ideal staff control , as a useful organizer of the cheap production of goods that humanity needs . Thus some plot good that evil may come , and evil from which goodness arises . Man never knows what he does . If he does his work well that seems enough . Those are the two types which now confront the remains of political society , which must accommodate themselves with it and with each other . The reader will observe that one type has been completely ignored ; that is the artist . It is right that he should be ignored , for he has never been of the slightest direct importance . He has painted his pictures , written his books , made his music , rather like a popular courtesan . Very often he has produced phrases which have altered the mind of mankind , but as the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice penetrate human brains , his power is that of the dead hand . In the society of his day he is ridiculous among the few who know his name ; to the masses he is as if he were not . He has his joys and his prides ; he savors the satisfaction of contempt for those who know not what they do , but he can not affect their conduct . He is crushed under the weight of ledgers , and chemical fumes curl about his ambrosial lips . The world , then , goes to the strong , those who are desirous , and those who are cool , who know that a cube has eight corners , all of them sharp . Only the business man and the scientific man hold that view fully . Now those corners indent the dry old society in which we Eve . It is still a confused society . If we examine in America or in any western European country the composition of the ruling class , we discover that it seems to have changed but little in fifty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lawyer holds a number of the seats ; from his class are recruited governors , ministers , and such . The workman figures to defend his class ; the schoolmaster , the doctor , the excivil servant figure considerably . These naturally gravitate toward the legal class , for they affect its official habits , its etiquettes . They do not understand the rule-of-thumb attitude of the business man , his tendency to improvise a method rather than look for the ideal solution . The business man is not strong in the parliaments of the world ; even though he holds a good many seats , he generally enters political life only when his business life is done , when he hesitates between golf and politics . Having made a fortune , he sometimes fancies that it would be rather fun to remold the world . As a rule he does it badly . The career of the business man during the Great War was almost tragic . He showed great energy , perfect ruthlessness , but he did not know how to work vrithsuperiors ; he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly granting favors , giving rebates . He made public life incoherent by inequality , and gladly retired when the war wasdone . One must not conclude that the business man does not care what happens . In America he allows the nut to be handled by the lawyers , but he keeps a close eye on the kernel . In fact , political life is a screen behind which the real struggle is being conducted between the scientific and the business man . They have little to struggle for , since one wants reputation and the other cash , but struggle they must because they are opposite types . They are akin to a cat and dog which live in the same house , for both of which there is abundant food and attention , but which must fight all the same because the one is a cat and the other a dog . They dislike each other . The scientific man generally looks upon the business man with the contempt that a swallow may feel for a rhinoceros . He thinks him dull , uninterested in obviously interesting things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he thinks his taste for automobiles vulgar . On the other hand , the business man looks upon his antagonist as a poor fool , whom anybody can take in , who does n't care for the good things of life , and who is , on the whole , wasting his time . Each revises his estimate in time , for the scientific man can not help respecting the millions , while the business man grudgingly confesses that " there may be something in these stinks and bangs . " The extreme attitude of mutual contempt is going , for the modern men think much more than their fathers of science applied to industry , while industry realizes that science promises to yield further profits . The question is , How shall the money be shared ? In other words , who shall have the leadership ? It is well understood that money power is now the only power ; that long ago the captains and the kings departed . An ambitious man must desire money ; even if he desires tame , he obtains money , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened , as the scientific man grows more mercenary , the struggle is likely to define itself . Some time ago a correspondent wrote to me as follows : I believe that the scientific , the engineering , looking-forward type is going to cut a big swath in public affairs in future , and to a large extent take the place now occupied by the legal , **25;584;TOOLONG type . My correspondent is an engineer , and , though his remark may be partly correct , he seems to be forgetting the business man as surely as Napoleon forgot Blucher . He voices the opinion of part of his class , and it is presumable that he is looking forward to a new type of scientific man ? namely , the engineer . Let us not here sing the engineer that Mr. Kipling deified , but let us concede that he is an intermediate type . He is scientific and practical . He wants to know and he wants to do . He is a business man , in a sense , and it may be that he will eventually prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards the scientific man , it seems impossible that lie should ever lead the world . Every now and then he creates a sensation by discovering an inoculation against chilblains , or determining a year or two before the wedding the sex of the probable child . He makes a sensation , the newspapers print articles on eugenics or trial marriage , and nobody worries . The only thing that may happen is that some practical political person is taken with the idea , and imposes it upon a population rebellious to any idea . The business man does that now and then ; he likes card indexes , cash registers , fatigue charts , movement studies , etc . When the psychometer is invented he will use it to engage only female employees who do not think about dancing while they are canning peaches . That is not strange , for the real scientific man hates action . He may discover the psychorneter , but when that is done he will lose interest in it , as a cat in her kittens at six weeks . Unless , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables us to know everything of one another . That is why the future leaders are much more likely to be business men than scientific men . If we consider the world to-day , apart from the big politicians , we find that real power lies in the hands of people like Mr. Stinnes , Mr. Rockefeller , Mr. Rothman , Lord Rothschild , etc . They are not yet as powerful as their enemies make out , but they arc continually telling governments what they must do if they want affairs to go well , and the governments listen . They must listen , for the big business men can withhold loans , paralyze railways , engineer press campaigns . Moreover , they have great power for good ; thanks to their international connections , they often take a view wider than that of the average politician become a prime minister . It is rather a special view , for they tend to consider that if abundant goods are being made , carried on ships , and sold in shops , all is well with the world . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is prosperous , it looks after its education and its intellectual development . The scientific man hardly ever has a world view . He seems to know only his laboratories and those of the people who labor in his own field . His appearances in politics are generally inept ; he has no sympathy with whist , the garden , and the dog . That is why the business man must beat him . The business man is intellectually inferior , but the scientific man is often so caked with knowledge that he can not move ; that , through the thick crust , he can not perceive the common men and their desires . The engineer type may introduce a variation ; intellectually sound , and practically capable , he may by degrees design a world where there is less grab than in the business man 's paradise . He has a tradition of effective action , as against the business man 's tradition of profitable action . He raises against himself less merriment than the scientific man , and less hatred than the business man . His only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things .

No. 861-84the engineer may by degrees outline some scheme for the organization of a pacific and happy world , but I suspect that the business man will get there first . It is probable that , as time goes on , the scientific man will become more commercial , the business man much more scientific . Since neither can do without the other , since they must use each other , they may go on struggling for power and in the end become merged . But one doubts whether a combined mind can produce the future leaders . I suspect that the leaders of the future will be recruited from among the business men much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them their power , because commonness is not a low quality ; it is not unkind ? it is animal , earthy , everyday .

They were out for money at any price , but the fact remains that theycheapened production , brought into the home of the poor man comforts that King Crcesus never knew . They have organized industry , regulated it . It may be that their service is finished , but a service it is . The minds that did these things are no smaller than they were . They arc still capable of broad views , of international organization .
