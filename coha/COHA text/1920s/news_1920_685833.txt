txt The lockout of garage workers by the Garage Owners ' Association was begun yesterday , and last night the association declared that nearly all its members had abolished all service , and that by tonight every garage would have paid off its washers , polishers , cleaners and floormen , to the number of 2,500 . The decision to operate on a " storage only " basis was taken after the garage workers ' union had demanded more pay , a ? eight-hour day , and better working conditions . Doing away with service leaves 90 per cent . of the automobiles kept in public garages ill Manhattan and the Bronx without service , garage owners say . Hereafter automobile owners must attend to the cleaning and washing of their own cars . The East Side Garage Owners ' Association met yesterday afternoon in Terrace Garden and voted to put their garages on a non-service basis . This was the last of the combLned associations to make this decision . The meeting was private , and , so far as could be learned , the workers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floor , as it had done when the association met earlier in the week . How effectively the membership carried out the resolution to stand by the Executive Committee was ' shown by the reports that reached union headquarters . 619 Ninth Avehue , that everywhere the men were being paid off and told their , services were no longer needed . A member of the Executive Committee said that the new system of storing cars without service had been successful so far , and he predicted that car owners would soon accustom themselves to new conditions . " The non-service garage has come to stay , " he said . " It is the logical way out of a situation created by the union . The garage owners simply could not meet their workers ' demands . We estimated that to give the men what they want and to establish three shifts would cost car owners from $10 to *20 a month more than present prices , but . later estimates showed that instead of charging $50 a month for open cars and $00 for closed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Federation of Labor yesterday came to the assistance of the Garage Workers ' Union . Alexander Marks , an organizer of the Federation , has taken charge of affairs at union headquarters and will map out a program of action for the workers . It is considered possible that other union workers having to do with garages or the driving of cars may be called upon to support the locked-out workers . . ? The situation is practically unchanged , " said James Walsh , President of the Garage Workers ' Union . Reports reach us that the east side garages are tonight paying off the men and letting them go . " Members of the Automobile Club of America . who store 1,000 cars in the two garages maintained by the club , have not yet suffered from any lack of service as a result of the demands of the garage workers . In the main garage at the clubhouse in Fifty-fourth Street , near Broadway , there are 600 cars and in the East Seventy-second Street garage 400 .

Until a month ago they were not members of a union , but early in September the union was formed and we received a request similar to that sent to the various garages of the city demanding a new wage and time schedule . No attention was paid to it and the governors of the club have taken the stand of absolutely refusing to have anything to do with a closed shop . The club is paying high wages . Washers who formerly got $18 to $20 a week are now receiving $35 to $40 for six nights a week and polishers are averaging $35 a week . " Owing to the reasonable prices charged for members ' cars , there is always a waiting list to get into the club garages . The club storage rates , including seri'ice , have been advanced only $2.50 in recent Nears , the club price being for open cars and 542,50 for closed .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
