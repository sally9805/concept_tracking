Last October-just before the election-President Coolidge announced that he was troubled by the prospect of a deficit next June 30 . He could see only the " narrowest margin between revenue and expenditures . " An air of anxiety , if not gloom , was thus cast over the Treasury-in voters ' minds . The conservative conclusion could only be : If a deficit threatens , let us not change horses , i.e. , political party control , in midstream . The President 's announcement was also used as a fiscal hackamore to make Congress stand hitched . <P> Last week the U. S. paid its 1928 income tax . And as has invariably been the case under the Mellon regime , it was seen that the Treasury had underestimated its revenue expectations . Tax payments ran high enough last week for Fiscal officials to talk of a $50,000,000 surplus . <P> Such a surplus would handily meet a $45,000,000 bill which the U. S. Supreme Court last week declared the Government owed the railroads in back pay for carrying the mails.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
