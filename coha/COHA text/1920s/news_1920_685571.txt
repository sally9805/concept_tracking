At the start of the race the great gas bag , with eight men in its car , including three reporters , was hovering a thousand feet above Ambrose lightship . Thirty minutes later it was a wreck on Barren Island in Jamaica Bay , ten miles away . It had fallen dnto the bay like a shot . bird - after a frantic race shoreward with the nose of its envelope collapsing as hydrogen gas escaped from rents in the top of the hag . Had Been Carefully Tested . C-I0 , with Lieut . A. W. Evans in command , has watched the yacht races every day with moving picture men and reporters in the car . A running report on the race has been sent in . Today the ship had been carefully tested for lifting power before the command " stand clear " set it free to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed scarcely five minutes before the crowd of bobbing pleasure %craft around the light ship was directly below . The two yachts were tacking back and forth waiting for the signal to start . When a signal broke out on the committee tug , bobbing on the swell be/ow , Lieut . Evans said : " We 'll go down to read it , " and the ship 's head sank slowly as it dived down to a lower level . There seemed to be something wrong when the blimp flattened later , close down to the craft below . Evans and his crew kept looking up to the bag above . Evans tugged at the control cords in front of him and both motors roared into life again , Read Danger in Faces of Crew . Swinging into a great circle , the air. , ship began to climb , but without its I usual quick response . Below a white steam puff from the committee boat marked the five minute whistle and as the blimp rounded toward Rockaway the racers went over the line on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race . It was heavy and sullen and Evaiis signaled for ballast to go over . The balloon was now 3,000 feet up in the air . From both rear cockpits showers of sand went down . Not a word had been spoken . The roar of the motors would have drowned any attempt at talk . The passengers just sat still and watched the set faces of the airmen . It was plain something was wrong , but the ship was heaving upward and those young navy men looked trustworthy . Radio Batteries Thrown Overboard , Again the commander called for bal last overboard . The sand went out in a stream . Ahead and far below Rockaway beach and Jamaica bay beyond leaped into view through the haze . The airship , now tipping down by the head and sinking fast despite its roaring motors , turned out toward the narrow bay . Its commander came climbing back again , " ThroW over your batteries , " he called to the radio man . With a knife slash the o , -. ? erator cut the wires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went hurtling down to splash in the water far below . The surface of the hay appeared to be leaping upward . The ship was dropping fast , but there was little sensation save the rush of the wind . " Life preservers ! " Evans called above the dying roar of the motors . The passengers began to struggle out of the parachute harness in which they had been rigged and the engineer leaned first to let free all the gasoline in the tanks , then . reached , ottt the jackets . Slope of Fall Steepens . Foot by foot the slope of the fall steepened . Then ? with a final rush , the nose of the big gas bag struck water , the front end of the car plunged down into it up to the cockpit rail , a bumping lurch shook it and the gas bag went toppling to one side . But the tail of the bag was full and the stern . of the car still rode above the surface . A last turn of the starboard prnpellor I tore a great hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having ! even ducked its engines under . Well , we 're down , " said Evans in I a casual tone . " Stick to the ship , " The C-10 , was now moored against a ' ragged row of piles . " Welt wait for our own boats , " he i called to volunteer rescue boats , and climbed upon the rocks to stare at his ship , lying with rudder far up in the air , nose crumpled and Its car i sunk to the first cockpit in the water. , The rescue followed soon afterward.
