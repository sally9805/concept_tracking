What are the principal factors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ii near future the course of demand deposits ? If , in the affirmative , by what practical means ? ? V. hi . B. Money exercises a powerful influence on security prices . But demand deposits of Clearing House banks are not regarded as a reliable stock market indicator . It is true , a decrease in deposits ordinarily indicates a decrease in loans and a contraction of credit . This sometimes is regarded as unfavonable . But there might be counterbalancing stock market developments that would completely offset the effects of a loan contraction when that was based , for instance , upon seasonal contmercial demands . The New York Clearing House bank statement includes only New York City banks . Principal factors that influence demand deposits are loans and the general state of trade . It is only possible to foretell the course of demand deposits to the extent that one can foretell the future course of business .

What in your opinion are the reasons for the stock selling at $49 a share ? ? 11 . E. S. Th.e Western Union Telegraph Co. has guaranteed a. 5 r ; f1 dividend on the $14,000,000 outstanding stock of the American Telegraph &; Cable lease , which expires in 19S2 or nine years from NOW . As the two cables owned by the company are more or less obsolescent there is no present reason to argue that the 14'estern Union trill have to renew such a lease , anyway it is certain that if the Western Union did come to sonic arrangement . it would not be anything like as profitable to American Telegraph ?

NEW YORK . CHICAGO &; ST . LOUIS 26006 ? On behalf of a friend who has 100 shares of common stock of New York . Chicago &; St. Louis Railroad Co. ( old ) and who opposed the merger and dissented therefrom . I beg to Inquire what if any provision has been made to retire or take Care of that stock ? Is it entitled to dividends or interest until it is retired ? I understand that dividends are being paid on the new stock at the rate of $8 a share a year and that the money to pay these divideRds comes from the earnings chiefly of New York , Chicago &; St. Louis Railroad Co . As the Interstate Commerce Commission only approved the merger on June 18 last , this money must have been earned for the most part prior to . the merger . Does it not therefore belong to the old stock-1 holders ; and can It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without provision being made to take care of the old ? ? W. E. 1 .. Old Nickel Plate stock can be exchanged for stock of the new consolidated company at any time through the Guaranty Trust Co. of New York . The old Stock ceased to be eligible for dividends on the day consolidation was approved , but holders of old stock are entitled to dividends on stew stock of consolidated companies by depositing any time before September 1.1 . It is doubtful if they could be deprived of dividends even if they offered stock for exchange after that date . The old companies ceased to exist on June 22 aml . therefore , ceased to pay dividends . The revenues of lines formerly owned by separate companies are taken directly into the consolidated company , the new owner of the property which it operates for its own account . Natthc new company would not consider paying dividends on the stocks of what was formerly constituent companies . STATE OF CEARA ** 1947 , BONDS 28007 ?
