LAST June I went to a reunion of my college class and saw men I had n't met or heard from for twenty-five years . The committee in charge had sent us circulars during the spring , picturing the coming occasion as a delightful affair . They were a little too full of enthusiasm , from my point of view ; they talked of our happy years together in the days of our youth , and said that now we 'd live them again , which , of course , was n't so . But they were trying to get a number of busy men to put business aside and leave their wives and families and travel to our old college town ; and , naturally , they had to make it seem something which no one should miss . I sent them my check and arranged things so that I could go ; but the memories which came slowly back to me were not like the committee 's . Theirs were all sunshine , and mine , I discovered , were mixed . We fellows from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once set out with great hopes and plans , to conquer the world . And now our battered selves were going back again to stare at one another , searching for the young selves we 'd known so well in those days . I wanted to be there with the others ; but I hardly knew why . I felt as though we were all being summoned to a modern Grand Assize , where we should be called on to account for our twenty-five years . . . . Of course , a good many fellows did n't show up at our reunion . Percy Clede , for example . He told Solly that itwould bore him . Dull after-dinner speeches , childish marching round be ? hind a brass band , shaking hands with fellows you only half-recognized , a gen ? eral fake air of brotherhood ? that was the way he regarded it . Well , that was what he 'd have found if he 'd come . All that was there ; I felt it myself , though I 'm no Percy Clede . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , even at the time ; and I shall not now describe it . What struck me was the companionship and scrutiny I felt underneath . Clede wanted it to be a brilliant exchange of epigrams over the teacups , or a salon of intellect , or a time of important discussions . He says there 's no companionship in a mixed crowd who are incompatibles ; he wants some ? thing more civilized and selective , more choice , more worth while . But he 'd have a different conception of fellowship if he 'd ever been in a regiment . Incom ? patibles ? Why , yes ! But that 's the point of the thing . A class is not like a clique . If you can hear none but sympathetic spirits round . you , you 'll be disappointed . But not if you 're game to enter an arena filled with both friends and foes , to take the other men 's measure , and to be ready to let them take yours . But you can get that in daily life , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These reunions are of men who once spent four years living together . They knew one another before their shells hardened . All buncombe and pretense may as well he left at the door with your umbrella . No matter how high-up and famous you may seem to the world , your classmates will not he impressed if you really are hollow . They may not say anything , their opinions wo n't be rammed down your throat , but you 'll feel it in the air that they 're thinking you still are a light-weight . Similarly , if you 're all right , they know it , whether the world does or not . You may have failed wholly in doing , as distinguished from being ; or you may have a cloud over your name owing to some wretched scandal . Well , out in the world you will feel it , but not at your reunion . Not if your college friends know that you are a man to respect . I saw a good many things at the reunion that I had n't expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , weighed less than of old . I heard of several ? Joyce and one or two others ? who were quite down and out . Life had been too stern an affair for those nice , pleasant fellows . . . . I once had a talk with a soldier of the old German army . He said he had had chances for promotion but had preferred to forgo them , because he disliked to knock men about and kick and abuse them . A corporal had to do that , he said . Not that he was so ordered , but he had to produce good results , and that was the quickest way to train soldiers and to maintain a firm dis ? cipline . Life is often like that . Our timid , attractive men , like Joyce , have gone under , or else failed of promotion . There are times when a man must be ready to give as well as to take blows . That is one of those things we learned from athletics , but not from the curric ? ulum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sorts : those like Billy Wade , who loved a sport whether or not they had the strength for it ; and those who had mighty physiques but were coerced into playing . Billy had a great deal of spirit . though notvery much else ; he was always ready to try to move mountains . And sometimes he did ! Those others , the coerced men , did good conscientious work on the field , but it was the fire in the captain 's breast that made them spring about , not their own . Not all the songs and cheers from the bleachers nor the ex ? citement of conflict could light the true spark in those giants . They played a fast , vigorous game , but they had to he made to . And that is the way they 've gone through the world ? steady-going , powerful machines when there has been someone to run them , but without any gift for accelerating or steering them ? selves . With our mental giants it has been the same . Some are captains , some troopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their professions . Professors or lawyers or architects ? they 're all supermen . The others had as good brains or better ? they got high marks in college ; assign them any brain-work , and they 'd do it with clear ? ness and skill . But though they had this perfect equipment , they were mental machines . Since graduation , whatever their field , they have done best under or ? ders ? they ca n't take the reins in their hands , like the true homo sapiens . There were still other men who did nothing in college , and who seemed to its failnres ? men who could neither serve leaders well nor he leaders them ? selves . They had n't the gift of com ? mand , and they were too lazy or per ? verse to obey . It was a kind of stu ? pidity ? though many of them were not stupid men . They did n't fit into the organization , they were not co-oper ? ative . Yet since graduation some of these men have done well enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he went to work hard and made it . Money was the inducement he needed to make him join in . Others have worked hard under pressure ? the wolf at the door , or dependents they had to take care of . Money again . That factor was n't present in college ? that is , in our activities . In our college world it was social service which counted ; it was as though we 'd been communists . But social service in such a commu ? nity has to take some fixed form . There is little scope for the man whose gift is not for fitting in , but for organizing. ' lake Otto Levy for instance , how ob ? scure he was in those college days ; whereas now he is running highly effi ? cient department stores , and is a great business genius . Then there were our literary men , who wrote and edited the small college maga ? zine . One of them , Chips Johnson , who used to construct poems to spring , with ingenious interior rhymes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cor ? poration lawyer , who constructs intri ? cate systems instead . George Scilly is a dealer in potatoes ? some Chicago com ? mission house ? he married the pro ? prietor 's daughter and she put him to work . Percy Clede , the remaining man , is a dilettante who writes for freak magazines . We expected great things of Clede once . But many of our men , not so great as Clede , have been far more effectual , while he has had a worm in him somewhere which has gnawed at his powers . There is nothing very real any more about the stuff he turns out . There was nothing very real about our college magazine , come to that . It was an awesome institution , like the Bank of England in its forbiddingness , with ways that were as fixed as the pigtails of the old Chinese Empire . It had a traditional style of its own in which all contributions had to be written , other ? wise they returned to their writers , marked with the single word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a writer in his place , and avoided all argument . The editors would n't even trouble to parley with him until he had learned the right style . That style was difficult to attain to , but its requirements could have been easily stated . First , swell up and put on the dignified robes of pontiff ; then be ? come condescendingly genial , and un ? bend . That was all . Our writers made hideous pontiffs , and their attempts to unbend were deplorable ; but men will always deform themselves gladly to preserve old traditions . So much for our writers . What of our debaters and speakers ? Well , one of our prize-winning debaters was a fellow named Brenna . He had a high stand , and he won a fencing match and sang on the glee dub beside . An all-round sort of fellow . Pleasant , friendly way of talking ; liked everybody . But he was n't awfully well liked himself . Men were a little apologetic to one another about it ? he seemed to deserve better treatment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied law after we were gradu ? ated , and went into politics . He has become very prominent . He is one of those men who always is making im ? portant addresses . He constantly stands for high ideals and principles and the best current reforms , he belongs to good clubs , and he is often seen in society . He has even declined an ambassador ? ship . The public considers him the most successful man in our class . ' He appeared at the reunion . Affable to everybody . Shaking hands right and left . And being a speaker , and prom ? inent , he was on the toast-list at our class dinner . He urged the importance of high ideaIs ? with his usual glibness . I sat near him at table and watched him . In college he had a plump , youth ? ful countenance , not at all strongly molded . But the lower part of his face has developed tremendously since . He 's all jaw . Looking at him in profile , it was like watching a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncoiled , and swung his mouth into action . I was so appalled that I left my place and went to a seat where I faced him . But there it was even worse ? nothing but an open mouth and plump , waving hands . A fellow like that tends to give all college men a bad name , not only with the public but with big solid non-college executives . The more he succeeds , the more scornful they naturally get . Another of our brilliant men was Hewett . He was stronger than Brenna , and a finer type ; a good deal less showy . A serious-looking man in horn-rimmed spectacles , who liked fancy socks . He too went into politics . But he left it ? he could n't stand the falsities , he said , of political life . Hewett is an upright , good citizen . And yet-1 do n't know . He has taken to writing books and-articles now , on the solution of every ? thing . He is very much respected ? even by some of those big keen execu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff ehockful of holes . Most of our men respect Hewett still , for his earnest aspiring character . It is generally felt , that at any rate he has been faithful to his ideals . Well , lie is sincere , and Brenna is not . But I 'm afraid he 's equally hollow . College men are encouraged to have fine aspiring ideas about politics , with ? out being warned that such ideas need rigorous testing . They go out believing that the thing to do with a fine idea is to get us , the public , to try it , merely be ? cause it sounds right ; and if we hang back and call it theoretical , they gravely admonish us . They know how to sail the ship of state without going to sea . In college we admired our idealists much more than now . They admired themselves more , too ; for since then they have had a hard time . Hewett has n't suffered he is one of the kind that has stayed blind ? but others have been getting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am general ? izing unfairly , or arranging my facts ; for of course there was no fixed group of men in college whom we specifically labeled idealists . But the fellows at our reunion who looked the most bat ? tered , spiritually , were again and again of that type : men who as boys had had high hopes of life combined with not much understanding of it . Our men who were of good birth and breeding have been saved that at least . Some of them have changed for the worse , of course , but not in that way . And fellows brought up on farms have been saved it ? they too were hard ? headed . But our cruder members who had no sophistication have suffered . One of these was a . Jewish emigrant who came to this country in childhood . He was an ardent young reformer in college ; tall , fiery , dark-eyed , deter ? mined . At the reunion he looked old and tired and cynical ; and lie sneered so much at everything that we wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galahad-like Kansan who had been ardent too ? a fresh-faced , trustful young ? ster . He had so altered that I did n't know him ; I had to ask someone his name . He had done well enough , they said ; nothing much one way or the other ; but you 'd have thought from his bitter expression he had been cheated abominably . He had all his old Kansan robustness , but his eyes looked wan and sick . He was better off , at that , than the men whose expression had coarsened . I did n't recognize them either , in some cases ; they too had so changed . Lindy Wallor for instance . In college he did n't look piggy ; he was just a good honest sort . But I realized , looking backward , that he had been the other extreme from our Jew ? he had had no idealism at all . He had been " a practical man " from the start . Now his eyes had gone dead . They were n't dead in college ? but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were other fellows at the re ? union who did n't seem battered at all . A few of them had stayed young by the simple expedient of not growing up . They had n't been banged round enough by storms to force them to grow , and they had had no wish to , themselves , or perhaps no ability . But aside from these , it was fine to see the youngness of our intelligent men ? intelligent in the sense of being men who know how to take things . Even such men can be shattered , of course ? there is no sure preservative ; but they go through most storms unhurt because they have an eye for what 's real . So many of as are frightened to death by blank cartridges . We lase money , and believe that this has wounded us iu some vital spot . We lose the love of someone who never truly loved us at all , and whom we ourselves perhaps only imagined we cared for ; and we think it 's tragedy . By keeping on thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent men do not feel unreal troubles at all , and they have a big-minded way of bearing up under the real ones . They have an enormous recuperative power . They find few things intolerable . It looks like grim courage to others , but it 's better ? it is wisdom . Bayne was one of those men . He lived in a lonely way all his life . He took several postgraduate courses in electricity , and this new thing , bio ? physics , and got so deep into his sub ? jects there was hardly a soul he could talk to , except two or three men in America and England , and another in Holland . No one else spoke the lan ? guage that you had to use on those new heights . This need n't have shut him off from purely social occasions , how ? ever , but what hampered him there was his singleminded sincerity . I remember one night when Carter had complained about some illness he 'd had , Bayne asked him whether his father had had certain disreputable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was shocked at the thought . He would n't even consider it ; he pushed it away from him . Bayne was mystified by Carter 's discomfort . He was only trying to help search round for the possible cause of the illness . How else could one estab ? lish its nature and the best mode of treatment ? This was in the days before Freud , when people were more easily wounded than now ; but even a Freud ? ian might have been upset by some of Bayne 's comments . He habitually saw the fundamental motives for everyday acts , and very few men were detachedenough to take his remarks as imper ? sonal . In college Bayne was a stoop-shul ? dered , talkative student , who was for ? ever arguing with everybody . He dropped arguing afterward . Perhaps he had only been trying to find himself . The more he was swallowed up in his studies , the more silent he got . His egoism , which had always been decent enough , had found a great outlet . Nobody liked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . Now that he 's dead we realize what a likable fellow he was . It was merely that we did n't know how to take him . He was farther on . Would aborigines know how to like a white man whose notions disturbed them ? There was one of our men who got an honorary degree at reunion ? Joe Hard-ing . He stood up on the platform , a smallish man and awkwardly built . When he 's standing still he looks lum ? bering , though he can move with great speed . His square thick hands hung at his sides like a yokel 's ; and his features , as the President addressed him , looked heavy and hard . But when Joe is talking to his friends his expression is warming , and those hands of his are supple and flexible when you grasp one in yours . Joe is chief surgeon for a rail- way in the northwest . That 's how he got this degree . He has a passion for surgery , As a young practitioner he did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too busy studying problems and fixing up human beings . When his money gave out he 'd go to his desk and send out a. few bills , but he grudged the time , and felt awkward about it ; never knew what to charge . This method did n't work very well , but he 's on salary now . He is still working away to the limit of his strength and beyond it . Night telephone at his bed ? side , and all that . Doctors are a fine lot . Joe had had a strong enough body to stand the racket for years , but he 's getting twitchy -- -he wore out his nerves in France during the war . But they were showing signs of wear anyhow , for he 's overdone it . Like others of our athletic men , he was serener in college than now . I hate to see him querulous , where other types have grown calmer . Our athletes could have faced the life of other centuries better , I think , but a modern man 's attention is strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It flickers over the news of the world , it . is endlessly interrupted all day ; advertisements beckon it , it must dodge the motor cars that flash by . This adds up . A tough body helps one to stand it , but it also takes a tough brain . But Joe is still a fine specimen . In college he was our football captain . He had great determination , and he under ? stood men . There was a slow smile of intense enjoyment that used to come on his face at the training table , when Carter , the center-rush , was grumbling to him and telling him what he would not stand . Carter would stand any ? thing if he were handled right , and Joe knew just how to handle him . But during a game when you saw Joe 's face you would wonder if there had ever been a smile on it . At a moment that called for action it was implacable . His voice rang , there was a thrust to his orders . lie would n't take less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sets his jaw like granite in emergencies , he becomes so intent he seems incandes ? cent ? he knows what Solly never learned , that there is a time to smile and a time to rule all that out . But nowadays when that implacable look comes there is pity behind it ; or not pity exactly but gentleness . He fights against the ailments of his patients as he fought his opponents in football , hilt he is conscious every minute that the battleground is the patient , and human . The difference shows in those hands of his . They are as big and thick as ever ; but they are changed , for all that . He used to pour only his force into them ? he made them his weapons . Now he has made them his instruments , and they have learned to be gentle . But they could be weapons still , if a need came ; they have lost nothing ? a new thing 's been added . That 's one thing that has happened to many of the men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are more fully ourselves than in college , when we were half-grown cubs . We have paid for it ? we have been knocked about . It was n't only the war . Fellows have dropped out , right along , from the daily strains we 've all felt . Joyce has broken down ? he went to pieces during the 1907 panic through worry . Carter and two others are exiles , they live in the mountains ? their lungs have given out and they must sit still and merely look on . One of our men is in prison ; he broke a rule of the game . One is insane . One killed himself , only last year ? the pace was too hot . Chips Johnson has been crip ? pled in an accident . A dozen have died of disease . Bayne was cruelly murdered in his laboratory , for a handful of coins . But when we meet. , we see these mis ? haps in a decent perspective . They are bad , but they are the exceptions . On the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a meeting that adds to one 's wisdom of life . It is like a reunion of navigators who once sailed out of port young and hope ? ful , each in his own vessel ; and who , now that they 're grizzled and older , put in to the sit on the beach at a banquet and exchange talk of tempests . Then a handclasp and a " Good luck to you , old boy , " and each to his vessel , and they are off again . To he sure , all classmates are not affectionate , but they do have an inter ? est ? they do n't , care for one another , exactly , but about one another . But that 's a great deal . It gives you a sense of friends in the background , it makes the sea seem less lonely . It makes one take rather more pains how he handles his ship .
