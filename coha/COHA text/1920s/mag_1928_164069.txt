Later than it does to most men , Death came last week to Chauncey Mitchell Depew , after-dinner orator , optimist , railroad lawyer , spectator of U. S. national affairs since the Mexican War , aged 94 years less three weeks . A bronchial infection , picked up after a winter in Florida , turned into pneumonia in Manhattan . Two bishops and a Fifth Avenue rector officiated at the funeral service . Thousands of dignitaries attended or despatched their respects . <P> " I have lived long because I could laugh at anything , " Chauncey Depew used to say . Arthur Brisbane , Hearst writer , who usually has a pat last word to say on any subject , observed that Napoleon , who seldom laughed , did not live 93 years but that " he did live more in one day than amiable Mr. Depew in all his 94 years . " <P> Nevertheless , Chauncey Mitchell Depew 's was a full life , based on an alert brain , a well-guarded stomach and a useful diaphragm . The diaphragm 's usefulness was revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his birthplace . The other schoolboys recited their orations . Chauncey would offer original compositions . His master began an oratorical training which was completed at Yale and on the political stump . He declaimed his way into the New York Assembly . On the advice of Commodore Vanderbilt , whose railroads he was to help run for the rest of his life , he renounced politics as a career . Speech-making thereafter became his " relaxation , " his theory being that the brain cells he used during business hours could take a rest while his speechmaking cells were active . By his own estimate , he addressed three banquets per week " in the season " for 50 years . It was his practice to skip all courses up to the roast when dining in public , and to drink champagne only . <P> Among his most famed speeches , away from the groaning board , were speeches at the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty , the opening of the Chicago World 's Fair , the centennial of Washington 's inauguration , his nomination of President Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union League Club , in Manhattan , on his summers in Europe . At the Republican National Convention in 1916 , Senator Harding called on him unexpectedly during a lull in the proceedings . Aged 82 , he extemporaneously spellbound the hall for 45 minutes . Four years later he repeated the feat . <P> The Republican Party owed thanks to Chauncey Depew from its inception . He stumped for its first candidate , John C. Fremont , in 1856 , and attended every Republican convention from 1860 to 1920 . All the Presidents from Lincoln to Harding knew him well . In 1888 , he himself received 99 votes for the nomination , but withdrew in favor of Harrison , who later asked him to be Secretary of State . He declined , having the presidency of the New York Central R. R. to attend to . In 1899 he entered the Senate , but his two terms were chiefly sociable . Politics , with him , was a sideline . Business came first , then speechmaking , then living long . <P> He had one son ( Chauncey Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Central up to his death . A few hours after he died , steelworkers swung the final girder into place atop the pinnacle of his last project , the 36-story New York Central Building behind the Grand Central station , dominating famed Park Avenue .
