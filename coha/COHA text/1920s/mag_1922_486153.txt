I T was at commencement in Cambridge , more than twenty years ago . A multitude of us loyal alumni was lifting its voice in " Fair Harvard . " Beside me stood a handsome young man in the garb of a priest , whose clear Irish baritone struck pleasantly upon my ear through the mass of noise . Till the stock of the Puritans die . My neighbor was psalming with unconscious heartiness and representing in his own comely person a new era in the oldest intellectual stronghold of the old Bay State . The Puritan was beginning to die . He is not dead yet in Massachusetts and he survives vigorously in the new New England , the Western States . But a generation ago he was losing grip and his hymn was coming true in a way that the author had not intended nor foreseen . A boy with an Irish name was captain of the football team . There had been scandalous and rebellious talk about the hold of boys from Back Bay families and saintly schools upon the crew and the baseball team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fair Harvard , observed , in one of his frequent shrewd moments , that Massachusetts is a Roman Catholic commonwealth . The stock of our forefathers was visibly losing power . It was losing in religion , in politics , in education , in business . I hold no brief for any race , creed , party , or other condition of servitude , but merely note facts , especially changes and developments . When Dr. Eliot observed that the codfish commonwealth is dominantly Roman Catholic , he made the observation , we may be sure , with a bland freedom from prejudice . The fact is there . Let us consider it . The most potent clergyman in Massachusetts is William Cardinal O'Connell . But there is no sign of a successor to Edward Everett Hale or Phillips Brooks . Add together the " orthodox " Congregational churches , which are the traditional godly center of all Massachusetts towns , the right and left wings of the Episcopalians , housed in The Advent and Phillips Brooks 's Trinity , the Unitarians of old King 's Chapel , where once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Protestant , nonconformist sects , such as Methodists , Baptists , and the 1 est . The Catholic Cathedral dwarfs them all  --  that is , as a spiritual institution . I once heard a member of the Clover Club , composed of Irish Roman Catholics , many of them brilliant and delightful , and probably prolific , say that the time was near when a Baptist parade would be impossible in the streets of Boston , partly on account of lack of material and partly on account of interference . The Clover Club thrives . The Papyrus Club is dead . And the Saturday Club of the elder New England wits and poets died so long ago that one has to think of it in terms not of decades but of generations . If it existed today there would not be anybody to belong to it . Roman Catholic does not mean Irish , in Massachusetts or anywhere else , even in Ireland . But if the two terms do not register exactly , if in Boston and the surrounding mill cities is a large population of Italians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Celtic-American cardinal , nevertheless Irish and Catholic are roughly synonymous in the Bay State . And non-Roman Catholic does not , in an age of slackening interest in religion and of wavering demarcations of faith , mean either Puritan stock or any one brand of nonconformity . The Protestant forces are scattered , lukewarm , and blurred . Consider that the First Church of Christ Scientist is about half way between Brimstone Corner and the Harvard Medical School . If you want to start a sect , start it in Massachusetts . Other States will take it up later . Any dark-skinned individual with straight hair can initiate a new creed in the Back Bay with no other equipment than the dermatological  --  with pleasure for all concerned and profit to himself . But alone among all diverse groups Irish Catholicism marches triumphantly on . Politically Massachusetts still plays an important part among her forty-seven sisters , and she has acute private troubles . Nothing can be proved but much can be suggested by contemplating three of her sons who represent her wisdom in the national government . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them but shall view them as expressions and examples of interesting social conditions . First there is the senior Senator . Mr. Lodge is an aristocrat by birth and training . Perhaps he has never had a great thought . Without question he is neither a Sumner nor a Hoar , but at least he has not for fifty years written or spoken a bad sentence . If he had not given up to politics what was meant for mankind he might have been a distinguished historian and writer of essays . His introduction to the autobiographical " Education " of Henry Adams is a neat bit of writing , worthy of Adams himself . He carries on the traditions of a State which in times past has sent men of letters to all the capital cities of the world , including Washington . The junior Senator is David Ignatius Walsh , a graduate not of Mr. Lodge 's fair Harvard but of Holy Cross , a member not of the Massachusetts Historical Society but of the Irish Historical Society of America . He was a small-town lawyer and seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor of the State . He does not belong to the Boston political rings , and his public life has been clean . However that may be , it is safe to predict that he will be succeeded by many of his own race and kind . There will be no more Lodges . That breed is passing . Above these two learned gentlemen from Massachusetts sits Calvin Coolidge , Vice-President of the United States , Calvin Coolidge of Northampton , born in Vermont and not , distinctly not , of the Boston Coolidges . They are on the boards of directors of great trust companies . The highest fiduciary position attained by Mr. Coolidge was that of president of the Nonatuck Savings Bank of Northampton . How he got to be Governor of the State and Vice-President of these United States is one of the inexplicable jokes of politics . The three men , the two Senators and the Vice-President , may be easily placed . Mr. Lodge is the aristocrat , well bred , well educated , with literary talent . Mr. Walsh is the successful small-town Irish lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient command of words not to make a fool of himself , inherently a democrat , and growing with his public experience . Mr. Coolidge is the yokel , neither of the blue-blooded aristocracy nor of the red-blooded invasion . He neither r presents staid tradition nor brings insurgent progress . I have lived among New England farmers and I have read or heard many specimens of what is supposed to be the Yankee manner of speech from Hosea Biglow to " The Old Homestead " and " Shore Acres . " Mr. Coolidge 's diction outdoes caricature and parody but has no trace of the shrewd humor of the soil . It must grate on Mr. Lodge 's exquisite Boston ear . There are two men in the political-legal life of the nation of whom the more enlightened citizens of Massachusetts may be proud . How often you find in the dissenting minority of the United States Supreme Court Justices Holmes and Brandeis ! Were ever two men of such different origins and traditions linked in the interests of liberalism and humane interpretations of law ? The one is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine hand of the senior Senator ( it was , I think , Judge Holmes 's father who first applied the term " Brahmin " to the Boston swell ) ; and the other is a Jew , whose appointment to the Supreme Court made members of clubs writhe in their leather chairs , not because he is a Jew  --  he had been accepted socially  --  but because he had dared to attack State Street and the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad . These two men are almost always together on the same side , the minority , the beaten , the right side . And both are citizens of a State which is assumed to be the heart of conservatism , of reaction , of the safe and sane . There is matter for reflection in this pair of colleagues . They are in a sense the living survivals of the best New England tradition , of independence , of intellectual courage , of noblesse oblige applied to public service  --  an indication in their disparate origins that the blood-stream is not the channel through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts has always had a reputation for wisdom and integrity . I once heard a Boston judge say that the decisions of the Massachusetts courts carry weight in England as compared with the decisions of the courts of other States or even of the United States courts , and I think he quoted Pollock as his authority . I am not sure . I merely noted the judge 's remark as showing the pride which exists in Massachusetts , and probably in all Atlantic States , in having the approval of Englishmen , and also as showing the great respect , no doubt deserved , in which judges and lawyers are held . Not long ago the legal profession of Massachusetts , or rather a small part of it , was under fire . Long-standing and well-intrenched corruption in the district attorney 's office in Suffolk County , and an infection therefrom in the neighboring Middlesex , was at last brought to the bar of judgment . An elaborate system of extortion and black-mail was revealed and the offending district attorneys were removed from office and disbarred . Now this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State . But inextricably bound up in it were the threads of religious and racial antagonism and prejudices . The central figure , the district attorney of Suffolk County , was the " Supreme Advocate " of the Knights of Columbus and hence probably the most conspicuous Catholic layman in the State . This had played no small part in the immunity generally credited to him and his ring . His safety was axiomatic in the whispering galleries of non-Catholic Massachusetts . That he was found guilty by a unanimous Supreme Court of which two members were of his own faith calls for no encomiums , but merely a solid satisfaction that the prophets of peril were again proved wrong . On the other hand the conviction was apotheosized into a religious martyrdom by a group of his friends and a very considerable Catholic following  --  despite the two Catholic judges , his replacement as district attorney by another Knight , and the Protestantism of his fellow-malefactor in Cambridge . The Catholic following was sufficiently strong to secure for Pelletier the Democratic nomination for the office of district attorney from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Senator , Mr. W. A. Gaston , a former president of Boston 's leading bank , did not repudiate his fellow-candidate . But the voters in this overwhelmingly Democratic district did and so ended a nauseating episode . The tinder-box is ready for the irresponsible match-thrower . The burning of a convent in the fifties is still street-corner campaign material . The use of public funds for parochial schools is a constantly recurring issue . That they have not been voted in 80 to 90 per cent Catholic Boston would indicate that this religious group is not more than any other politically a unit , nor , as is charged , clay in the hands of its hierarchy . Of course State support may come and will , if the resident " Prince of the Church " has his way . The political cleavage is , generally speaking , along religious lines . Protestant Democrats are for the most part isolated iconoclasts , individualist dissenters , whose part in the State 's party politics is wholly disproportionate to their numbers . Social cleavage is even more marked though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclude typists and office boys because they are Catholic , and owners of estates to whom their gardener 's faith is more important than his work . This is of course resented by the Catholics whose most effective response is their steady increase . The signs of this increase are obvious in the daily press which in no other metropolitan city so extensively chronicles the four-corners gossip and the personal item . The County Kerry Associates are holding their annual ball  --  with the Mayor , or perchance even the Governor , leading the grand march . The St. Joseph 's or Sacred Heart parishes are busy with their whist or other entertainment . The Cardinal has dedicated a new church or chapel with Celtic monsignori in attendance , filling specialized sacerdotal and , to the native , exotic-sounding functions . The Irish are everywhere . " Take for granted in talking with anyone that he is a Catholic unless you definitely know the contrary " was the advice given by a Boston newspaper editor to one of his reporters . Boston is filled today with O'Brien and Fitzgerald and Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and the square which once bore the name of Edgar Allan Poe now bears the name of Matthew Emmet Ryan . And many communities , like South Boston or Dorchester , the summer resorts around Nantasket , or Brant Rock further south , are as homogeneous as the villages of Tipperary . If they are more slovenly they are perhaps more joyous than the habitats of the inbred Bakers and Davises on the Cape , of the Litchfields and Turners of Plymouth County , of the Lanes and Pooles of Cape Ann . If these more recent Americans sometimes mistakenly and stupidly abuse their new-found strength in applying their Index Expurgatorius code to debar from public libraries works on the Spanish Inquisition or the novels of Zola theirs is but a slight transformation of Puritan zealotry . When the trustees of the public library of Brookline , stronghold of the elder respectability , exclude Professor Chafee 's scholarly " Freedom of Speech " on the ground of " radicalism , " what consistent grounds of protest against newer forms of obscurantism remain for these suppressors ? I have referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the scandal involving District Attorney Pelletier and others the editors began unctuously rubbing their editorial palms and congratulating Boston and the commonwealth on the house-cleaning  --  after it was all over . For years every cub reporter had known that all was not well , and many of them with the crusading enthusiasm of youth and decency burned to bring out the facts . Boston editors , if they stay Boston editors , are not made that way . At least not since the days of the late Edward Hazen Clement , who despite restrictions and his inhibitory environment gave the Transcript much of the quality which made it the best-known Boston newspaper in the country at large . The rest of the press , unless we except the Monitor which is national rather than local , exhibits the dress and cultivation of a boom mining-town . Of it no less an expert than Jason Rogers , publisher of the New York Globe , says in his book " Newspaper Building " : I do n't recollect whether the Post is responsible for leading nearly all the other Boston newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing up of really trifling items beyond news of world-wide interest or not , but I think so . .. . The fact that some small preacher in Lynn slipped from the straight and narrow path is bigger news from the Boston newspaper standpoint than almost any ordinary first-page news in other newspapers throughout the country . Likewise the Boston papers of large circulation follow the erring village pastor and erring mill-worker clear up into Maine or New Hampshire . On the surface of things it would seem that there was a fine opportunity for a first-class , honest-to-God morning newspaper in Boston . . . . There is such a fine opportunity for real newspapers in Boston , but there will not be one if we concede the truth of Chester S. Lord 's dictum that a newspaper can not be greater than its editor . A newspaper need not be a moral crusader , and its chief business may not be to reform a naughty world , but , in the face of long-continued social blood poisoning those papers did nothing , did not even call for the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indignant members of the bar , who took the lid off the unsavory Pelletier mess . But no newspapers in America  --  and the standard is not high anywhere  --  do less than those of Boston to encourage common ordinary decency in public affairs . They start nothing , but live in timid subserviency not only to the greater economic and denominational powers but to the pettiest wire-pullers , to the cheapest advertising bullies . The editor of the Herald , which pretends to be the organ of the cultured  --  in the jargon , " the quality medium " ? once remarked that the modern newspaper was essentially an advertisers ' broadside , and its editors were merely hired to fill in the chinks between the advertisements . But even under this conception which dominates Boston journalism the possibility for improving the filling is immeasurable . To find a paper which tries , or in times past tried , to work for the good of its local community , the State , the nation , and the universe , one has to go to Springfield , the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from political scandal , with a fine and justified civic pride . This suggests that Boston is not the whole of Massachusetts . It is both more than the State and less . It is more than the State because it is the business capital of all New England and it is a national financial center second only to New York and equal to Philadelphia and Chicago . It is the citadel of " protection " and privilege . In the capitalization of the West , the building of railroads , the exploitation of mines , the developing of the textile industries , Boston money was , and is , potent . Boston has no Rockefeller , no Carnegie . But the aggregate wealth in the stockings both of old families and of modern upstarts is tremendous . Nor should we omit mention here of the considerable and fruitful profession of trusteeship  --  the handling of the estates of defunct industrial pioneers , which nowhere has been more firmly established . That the third and fourth generations are frequently unable to take care of the copper deposits , paper or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride the hounds , or live abroad , or sometimes form innocuous connections with bond houses , indicates that the older stock has not merely been driven out by more fecund newcomers . The old race has of itself been petering , and not a few of its occasional atavistic scions sensing its atmosphere of dry-rot have of late gone elsewhere to seek fortunes founded on their own abilities . Even the children and grandchildren of the recent Abolitionists have faded into complaisant and insignificant conformism . That last and greatest chapter of the contribution of Massachusetts to America has melted into past history . The Union Club still has the tradition of its founding  --  otherwise it is scarcely distinguishable from the slightly more effete Somerset . Uninspired and static  --  that is Boston today . Who can adduce tangible or visible evidence to the contrary ? Boston is less than the State because the smaller cities and towns , especially those of the western part of the State , have a character or characters of their own . The eastern cities are Boston , even though they preserve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be considered as a vast industrial city , interspersed with lovely bits of country , which are rapidly becoming a vast suburban garden . To the west there is something different . The difference may be slight and I do not know how to express it . There is all too little difference between small American cities . But as William James 's friend the farmer said : " There 's mighty little difference between one man and another , but what little there is is mighty important . " If you consider that Massachusetts is so small that measured on the map it would look like a mere county of a Western State , and that in an age of communication the distinctions between neighboring communities are being obliterated and State lines are artificial , then you will expect to find the diversities between the eastern and western portions of the little commonwealth faint and hard to define . Yet they are mighty important , if you can capture them . I think of Massachusetts as jammed in between her neighbors , separating them and sharing their natures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire 's industrial cities , like Nashua on the same Merrimac . Brockton , Fall River , and New Bedford resemble Pawtucket and Woonsocket in Rhode Island . If I suggest that Pittsfield is like up-State New York , it is not wholly because the General Electric Company has also a plant in Schenectady . It has one in Lynn . Yet Pittsfield is liker to what lies across the line than she is to her sister who lives on the Atlantic coast . Is it not said in this community , where county pride exceeds State pride , regional affection , and patriotism , that " the best thing about Berkshire County is the chain of mountains to the east which shuts it off from the rest of the State " ? Perhaps we put too much emphasis on cities . But Massachusetts is , for America , thickly populated , and the passage from town to town by train or motor is almost imperceptible . The rural life is changing , it is changing character and changing hands . It is changing character because the old village is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and the smoke of the mill blows over the fields . I have known many old Yankee farmers but few young ones . Those who turn the sod now and make market gardens in the east and tobacco fields in the Connecticut Valley are foreigners who know how to work and make things grow . The native has not been entirely supplanted , but the tendency is that way . The Yankee farmer is disappearing in Massachusetts , going into business  --  or getting to be Vice-President of the United States . The most beautiful farms are the playthings of gentlemen who live in Massachusetts or who come to Massachusetts in summer . And Tony or Francois does the work . In the villages and small towns you see a State road , sometimes in need of repair but usually good . It runs past a pretty common . Facing the common are stores , bank , church , movie theater , and a few old houses , some of which are run down , some of which have been spruced up by new owners or by heirs who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; in some of them the heirs , as pathetic as Hawthorne 's Hepzibah , are trying to make a living by a tea-room where tourists are fed nothing for a big price . A factory district . A splendid estate , either the old house made over or a new not altogether successful Italian villa . One of the stores is still owned by Ezra Chapin , who has been town clerk for thirty years , but he is being put out of business by the Greek or Italian grocer on the other corner . The post office is dingy , the church is good , thanks to Wren and a defunct race of carpenters who built both churches and ships , the " libery " is not offensive , the soldiers ' monument is a fright , the trees on the trim common are gorgeous unless the beetles or the moths have completely routed the local tree warden and the State commission . And so to the next town , which is much the same . But it is not always the same . There is diversity within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been under the delusion that Boston is Massachusetts and that Harvard and Bunker Hill are intellectual and historical Boston , you may be disabused of that idea at odd turns of the road ; by the thrill that follows one 's glimpse of the gentle dignity and beauty of Williamstown and its college ; of Greenfield , of Leicester , of old Salem , Gf Sudbury , or the quaint charm of Deerfield , of Ipswich , of Marblehead , of Duxbury , of Provincetown , of Newbury-port . None of us knew until recently , because it is a recent structure , the beauty of that excellent building which Boston College has erected on the hill overlooking the city . The State is full of learning , at least of visible signs of the effort to learn , Amherst , Williams , Tufts , Wellesley , Smith , Clark , Holy Cross , Boston College , Boston University , Technology , Mt . Holyoke , Wheaton , and others . No State has more conspicuous educational institutions . And every small town provides in its own high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction in preparation for any college . Colleges and college education as they are today need not be taken too seriously , but I insist on the number and variety of the colleges in Massachusetts , because while the other States were developing their own institutions , perhaps greater and better , they always looked to Massachusetts for education , common and preferred . Then , with all this equipment , is Massachusetts intellectually decadent ? In some ways she is , but decadent from the standards which her own people set . Boston is , as Mr. Herford said , the abandoned farm of literature . But not in literature alone . In all the arts , in all intellectual matters Boston , once the Athens of America , is stagnant , moribund . The Atlantic Monthly is the sole heritage of the vanished Pericleans . One reason is that young people of talent follow a tendency , already cited , which is both social and commercial , to move to New York , much as Englishmen seek London and Frenchmen seek Paris . The migration does not greatly matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent lives . And it seems that the intellectual life of Massachusetts is not quite exhausted by departing sons and the declining vigor of the native stock . For note this , making due allowance for the fact that there is immigration as well as emigration and for the general fallibility of statistics : in the Geographical Index of the latest " Who 's Who " New York occupies twenty-seven pages , Massachusetts is second with ten , Pennsylvania and Illinois are third with eight each . And the rest are also-rans . If I have seemed a bit severe at times with the Massachusetts that I have known and loved a generation , it is , I repeat , in relation to values of her own erecting , to ideals of her own creation , to the visions and hopes and aspirations she herself has inspired . It is not by the standards of Mississippi or Arkansas that one judges Massachusetts . Come back to her from afar and there is a clean orderliness , a wholesome stability , a familiarity with the coinage of culture  --  in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Western flats and Dixie swamps . The intellect of a community is its great interest , its human value . But God , the God of the Puritans , was active long before the Puritans , or the Indians , or the Irish , or the Italians . He happened to lay out , not as a commonwealth but as a landscape , one of the loveliest corners of His footstool in the small strip of land which is now by man called Massachusetts  --  the North Shore with its rocks , the South Shore with its sand , the Berkshires on the west , the Connecticut Valley , and all the tumbling hills and gentle smiling little corners in between . It is not so rugged and vivid as the more mountainous and still wild States to the north . Connecticut is a bit softer . The Bay State , most of which is not on the bay , lies between , the heart of New England . God made it so , and man has not yet unmade it .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
