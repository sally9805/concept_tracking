Tuberculosis antagonists last week at last had something to say more audible than the claims of the cancer , heart disease , pneumonia and even leprosy people . If their demands for public attention and support have made the undiscerning U. S. suppose that tuberculosis was diminishing in this country , they last week , through the National Tuberculosis Association averred that it has been increasing in at least the larger cities . Thirty-eight cities last year recorded 24,471 deaths , 430 more than in 1927 . One softening of the picture was that those same cities increased their populations during 1928 .

He lectures to his patients , explains to them the various ways that tuberculosis affects various people and their organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing the spread of infection .

Mosby of St. Louis published the second edition ( price $2 ) . <P> *An institution for the treatment of chronic diseases , as tuberculosis , and a place for convalescence under medical supervision . Not to be confused with sanitarium , a health resort .
