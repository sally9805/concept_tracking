Since the War , a community called University City has sprung up on the site of the old defensive walls of Paris . Senator Andr d'Honnorat gave it form and became its president . France , Belgium , Great Britain , Canada , the U. S. and other countries built houses there for students . What was needed was a central administration building . Last fortnight , John Davison Rockefeller Jr . contributed $2,000,000 for that purpose . He had looked into University City last summer and Senator d'Honnorat had come to the U. S. last winter to study university methods .
