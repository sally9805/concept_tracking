Eagerly U. S. editors once played up cables from Imperial Austria , hinted daringly the senile eccentricities of Kaiser Franz , frankly glorified U. S. maidens privileged to be presented at his Court , and got out screaming extras when the suspicious , hidebound old Emperor was finally tricked into taking his first automobile ride by Wilhelm II . <P> Today however Austria is only a republic , and therefore when the Cabinet at Vienna fell last week , most U. S. editors reacted as though a pin had dropped . Tucked away on the tenth page of the omnivorous New York Times was a very creditable account ; but elsewhere in the U. S. the story was either omitted entirely , * or condensed into a sketchy account varying in length from three lines+ to 30. ** <P> Evidently it is not news that the only Priest-Prime Minister in Europe has resigned ; nor does it seem worth printing that his resignation is attributed in Vienna and Rome to a " suggestion " from Pope Pius XI . Undeserving of a line is the fact that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try a bloody bout for Power . It is not even worth explaining that at the root of the political crisis there is a law-championed by the Communists and fought by the Catholics-which today enables the working people of Vienna to rent houses for next to nothing by paying their landlords at the pre-War rate in the pre-War currency of Imperial Austria , now worth less than half of its former value . It is not news that Catholic War Minister Karl Vaugoin openly advocates the proclamation of a Fascist Dictatorship , while Communist Otto Bauer , onetime Foreign Minister , is quite as eager to proclaim a Dictatorship of the Proletariat . Finally there is not space in which to note that Wall Street is inclined to sell distinctly short on Austria-as is shown by the fact that it has recently proved impossible for the Government at Vienna to borrow in Manhattan $100,000,000 urgently needed to revamp Austria 's state railways , telegraphs , telephones . <P> Seipel Resigns . In the historic Foreign Office of Imperial Austria , called the Ballhausplatz , Chancellor Monsignor Ignaz Seipel , tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and without warning announced his resignation . <P> " Austria 's progress is blocked , " he said , " by a political tension , for much of which the present Government is held responsible , although unjustly . Long-continued agitations and accumulated hatred , which so far as concerns my person would be bearable , have also without reason been cast on my priestly office and my Church . <P> " I therefore think it right , as I have been five years head of the government , ++ to give the political parties a chance to find another way to assure our political future . <P> " The church is my chief concern .
