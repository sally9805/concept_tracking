Twice as big as a horse should be the size of Margaret F. Maclntyre , 23 , physiology assistant at Goucher College ( Baltimore ) if only her rate of breathing were considered . The bigger an animal , the slower it breathes . A rat respires 100 to 200 times a minute , a cat 20 to 30 times , an adult human 16 to 24 times , * a horse 6 to 10 times . Miss Maclntyre breathes only 3 to 5 times a minute . In that respect she is phenomenal . Doctors read about her with wonder five years ago when she was a student at Mount Holyoke College . Only last week did the general public learn of her strange case . <P> She is a healthy young woman , 5 ft. i in. tall , 120 lbs . in weight At athletics she does not lose her breath as quickly as do other girls . She can hold a singing note amazingly long . Physiologically her body gets all the air it needs because , breathing more slowly than normal , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep inhalation contains five quarts of air . A person can never completely void his lungs of air . Even in death about one quart remains . In ordinary quiet breathing the average lung always contains a residue of two and a half quarts of air . Quiet inhalation adds a pint . Ordinary people use only three-fifths of their lung capacity . Miss Maclntyre , who breathes about a fifth as fast as her Goucher pupils , uses practically all her lungs at each breath . Her continual ability to do this results , physiologists guess , from some particular modification of a section of the sub-brain ( medulla oblongata ) which through a part of the spinal cord in the nape of the neck causes the chest to expand ( pulling the lungs open ) and the diaphragm to contract ( giving more room in the chest cavity ) . <P> * A newborn baby breathes 62 times a minute , the rate of a grown rabbit .
