" Would n't it be nice , " said Mrs. Manhattanite to her husband , " if we could go to the theatre tonight and at midnight you could fly to Chicago in time for that conference tomorrow morning ? " <P> " Would n't it be nice , " said Mrs. Chicagoan to her husband , " if , after a hard half-day at the office , you could take me to a Manhattan night club ? " <P> Such excursions will not only be " nice " but also possible within four months , if one has faith in Giuseppe Mario Bellanca , designer of the monoplane , Columbia , which carried Pilot Chamberlin and Passenger Levine across the Atlantic ( TIME , June 13 ) . <P> Last week , Mr. Bellanca announced that he had contracted to build five triple-motored planes for passenger service between New York and Chicago . The trip will be made in seven and a half hours . The fare ( one way ) will be in the neighborhood of $60-50% greater than railroad fare . Each plane will carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve meals , operate the radio and be emergency pilot . The cost of each plane , equipped with three Wright Whirlwind motors , will be $28,500 . The company will be financed by A. R. Martine of the Bankers ' Service Co. , Manhattan . <P> Said Mr. Martine : " The pilots will do simple straight flying averaging 100 miles per hour with no stunts and no races against time . . . . There is no comparison between the comfort of traveling by airplane and traveling by railroad . Our passengers will sit in comfortable chairs . They can get up and walk around . From their seats they can survey the country rolling past beneath them . " <P> Three days after the Bellanca-Martine announcement , Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh emerged from conferences in Washington to speak five sentences concerning " the establishment at an early date of a passenger-carrying air transport line that will be national in its scope . " Possible allies of Colonel Lindbergh are such men as William B. Mayo , chief of the aircraft division of the Ford Motor Co. ; Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis backers of Colonel Lindbergh 's transatlantic flight ; Howard E. Coffin and Paul Henderson of the National Air Transport Inc. ( air mail operators ) ; Casey Jones , skillful pilot ; Chester W. Cuthell , onetime U. S. Shipping Board counsel . It seemed likely that this group would form a huge corporation , would put ships in the skies to compete with the Bellanca planes over the New York-Chicago route , would eventually link every U. S. metropolis . <P> Thus , a competition to carry the U. S. public in the air looms between the backers of a 25-year-old Nordic , Charles Augustus Lindbergh , who is everybody 's hero , and the backers of a 41-year-old Latin , Giuseppe Mario Bellanca , who is as obscure in the popular eye as he is small in stature ( 5 ft. , 1 in . ) . And yet , it is Mr. Bellanca who designed the Columbia that stayed in the air over the U. S. for 51 hours and later flew 3,905 miles , who carries in his pocket the plans for a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind the plans for gigantic transatlantic airliners , who is regarded by European experts as the leader in modern design .
