A fortnight ago 18 balloons shot into the air from Solbosh Plain in Belgium to compete anew for the Gordon Bennett Cup , * presented in 1906+ by the son of the James Gordon Bennett who founded The New York Herald . This cup was won for a third time , and , according to the rules , outright , by Belgium last year ; but through the generosity of the Belgian Aero Club in redonating it for competition , this year 's event was made possible . <P> From the outset only three aeronauts had a chance : Ernest de Muyter , who won the race in 1920 , ' 22 , ' 23 , ' 24 , Belgium , Wade T. Van Orman , U. S. , Lawrence Bienaime , France . A full day after the race had begun , although only six of the 18 gasbags were in the air , this order was unchanged . <P> On the second day news of Bienaim 's descent put him out of the reckoning and the race was actually between the U. S. and Belgium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III , dropped into the Atlantic after covering 441.18 miles . He and his equipment were saved by the German ship Vaterland . Next came the news that De Muyter had landed at Quemper in France , having covered a distance of 422.54 miles . It was thought that the American 's landing in the sea disqualified him and it seemed certain that the Belgian would be awarded the victory-but one balloon remained unaccounted for . <P> On the third day M. Veenstra , Belgian 's second string , came down in Spain ,
