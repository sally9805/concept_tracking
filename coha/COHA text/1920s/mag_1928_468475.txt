saving ; the true solution is to forget money utterly and to concentrate all one 's thought and energy upon the wise spending of time , upon that chosen work which seems interesting and important , quite regardless of reward . I am not saying that even for an idealist the money question settles itself , for it is not so obliging as all that . But what I am saying is that if the much bigger problem ? the spending of time ? is handled with common sense , the smaller problem ? the money question whichis inescapably involved in it , will he settled at the same moment . As a financial program , put forward in all seriousness , the deliberate forgetting of money , the complete ignoring of dollars and cents , may easily seem both hazardous and fantastic . In reality , however , it is so safe and sound , so altogether sure to succeed , that it may properly be classed with those traditional gilt-edged investments recommended to widows and orphans . But I am here making assertions and must prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to experience . If I turn to chapters in my own life it is only because I can here speak with entire authority . If I speak with surprising frankness , it can hardly seem a regrettable lack of reticence , since I speak , as I have said , not as an individual , but as a typical member of a class to which the world owes so much ? and from which , alas , it has often suffered so much ? the Idealists . Imagine , then , an average American boy , neither rich nor strong nor gifted . On the contrary , I had several grave handicaps . A series of money troubles had reduced the family to moderate circumstances ; I was always distressingly delicate ; finally , if I had any talent , it was not sufficient to be noticeable . 1 did have one splendid heritage and that was an alert spirit . But this is not exceptional ; it is , I think , typically American . I inherited my own high spirit from my mother . To her , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps ought not , live she nursed me into reasonable health . When they said that I could not possibly go to college she provided the means and the necessary tutors and sent me . In this heroic atmosphere I early made the important discovery that the world is an extraordinarily interesting place , and I Caine to have a boyish contempt for those who found it otherwise . It is true that I met plenty of such persons , and they seemed to me even then quite unforgivably dull . I put my finger quite unerringly , I think , upon their defect ? it was not lack of opportunity , but poverty of spirit . As for myself , I made up my mind that I would never allow life to bore me ; that I would do only those things which seemed to me interesting and important ; and finally that money should have no hand in the game . I still marvel that a delicate fifteen-yearold boy , singularly sheltered from the world , should have come to such important and far-reaching conclusions . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom was always lived up to . There were several desert wanderings , and probably others now quite forgotten . But the point is that on the whole I was faithful to all three resolutions , and that they did much to offset the grave handicaps 1 have mentioned and to make my life interesting and successful . I was much too delicate to go to school ; technically speaking , my early education was quite neglected . To this fortunate circumstance I owe so much that I have never ceased to be grateful . I escaped the commonplace , unimaginative standardized outlook on life which is the almost unavoidable portion of those boys who do go to school . Left so much alone , I could not help developing initiative . Such small originality as I possessed was conserved and strengthened . I learned to think for myself ; I learned to write ; I gained some of the minor accomplishments . I was early taught to THE PENNY AND ride . But above all , I kept unimpaired that boyish sense of wonder and mystery which is the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew at first hand and in a very real way . What I felt was the immediate Presence of God- -I was a mystic before I knew the meaning of the term . This habit of mind still seems to me a priceless possession ; and in any rational scale of values quite outweighs the best gifts of a more formal training . The unquenchable intellectual curiosity which marked these first sixteen years of life has never left me . I am still a student-at-large . It made it very easy to enter college after only five months ' preparation , and to carry off prizes and scholarships . Better still , it made the four years of undergraduate study a period of unfailing intellectual excitement and delight . I was no brighter than the fellows I outdistanced ; in many eases I was not so bright . Their handicap was that the lower schools had killed their interest ; my advantage was that I was still a flaming spirit . But now I met a genuine difficulty . My field of interest was so wide that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and concentrate upon a profession . I modestly wanted to know everything Not only did knowledge seem to me better than riches ? it seemed to me our nearest touch with the divine . But specialization was absolutely necessary , both as a practical program of culture and as a solution of the bread-and-butter probkm , the problem which I have set out to illustrate and , in Iater paragraphs , to solve . My mother had made large sacrifices to send me to college , and it was now quite time that I should be aming my own living . I was twenty , aut still much of a child . However , I i.m disposed to think that this unworldly 3utlook upon life was a distinct help . Had I been more worldly wise I might cave been less fearless . In looking over the delectable field of knowledge I discovered one profession which required by actual count a practical familiarity with at least the chief facts of eleven distinct and separate sciences . This offered a good start and , though I have since made many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original choice . And so I set to work . In the matter of opportunity I found a genuine embarrassment of riches . So many doors flew open that my satisfaction in what I was actually doing was always tinged with profound regret that I had to decline so many other alluring chances . Let me say again that this was not because I was clever . It was solely because my heart and mind were resolutely set upon the work in hand , upon the profitable spending of my time , and only quite incidentally upon the pay . Anyone who will honestly put his work first and the reward second simply can not avoid success . At first I worked for others ? I had my apprenticeship to serve ? but I soon found that it is vastly more interesting to paddle your own canoe ; and after that I worked for myself . I came to value my time so highly that I refused to sell it , refused to do anything which did not seem to me both interesting and important . Sometimes the chosen hit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will remember that I had early resolved to allow money no hand in the game I was bent upon doing what I wanted to do and what interested me . I meant , in a word , to have my own way just as far as I possibly could . And I commend this policy to everyone who attempts to handle his life seriously . So many men tell you quite pathetically that they are not doing what they want to do . The truth is that they may not want to do what they are doing , in and for itself , but they have been beguiled by the perquisites . As a boy , I felt a certain contempt for the people who did dull , unimportant , unessential things ; as a man , I came to question the propriety of selling one 's time upon any terms whatever ? in a word , the propriety of all wages and salaries . It seems to me more ethical , as well as more delightful , to he a genuine free-lance , to own your own time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should find our dear present-day America a far more thrilling country if a larger percentage of our people were self-employed . The pay envelope may be a convenience , an easy unadventurous way of keeping body and soul together , but it takes the edge off of life most dreadfully . I commend self-possession . I found it the more possible to carry out an individualistic program myself , because I early added a second profession ? I began to write . I am somewhat appalled when I remember the wide range of subjects I wrote about in newspaper columns and magazine articles and in various books , but all this writing was fundamentally sincere , for it grew out of my own wide experience . Writing comes to be a habit , just as talking does , and so delightful a habit that in certain moods any blank sheet of paper is an invitation to your pen . I might easily have succumbed to this allurement and become a professional man of letters , but after a winter of almost feverish book reviewing for a large city newspaper ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , economics , and science ! ? I realized anew that literature to be sound and permanent must be the leisurely outgrowth of a well-scrutinized , first-hand experience . I did not want in the end to be obliged to say about myself what I had once been tempted to say about a far more famous writer : that he said it all so well that you really wished he would say something ! it is my own deliberate judgment that all writers would do well to have a second profession , rather a strenuous one in fact , a profession which would bring them into daily touch with our three-dimensional world of effort and failure and success . At any rate , my own double calling added much to the pleasure of my very pleasant life , for each contributed sub stantiaily to the other ; and each , when I turned to it again , offered the refreshment of a genuine recreation . I even added a third string to my bow ? I became in a very modest way a public lecturer . I never took this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Scotch friends call " the gift . " But it so chanced that two or three causes in which I was deeply interested seemed at the moment to be without adequate spokesmen , and I felt that it was better to speak even indifferently well than to have the causes go without an advocate . It was a proper decision , I think , and neither causes nor audiences seemed any the worse for it , but I confess that I was myself the largest beneficiary . This excursion into the lecture field lasted only two or three years . I soon realized that the popular lecture appeal must be to average intelligence rather than to one 's intellectual peers and , like continued book reviewing and other newspaper work , led inevitably to a chronic and disastrous superficiality . I rather shivered at the sort of mentality which I glimpsed as threatening myself . There are a lot of things which a young man may profitably do , but which , if he loves his soul , he must not go on doing . In addition to my major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I made a number of small excursions into other related and unrelated fields , and from all of them I brought something back . This very wide browsing does , of course , keep one from minute erudition and the chair of ultimate authority ; but I have found that working disinterestedly , all these sidelights do help to illumine the major task , and to give it a large sanity and proportion . It must also be added that in and for itself the habit of wide horizons adds immensely to the interestingness of daily life I am not forgetting that this little essay has an economic purpose , and so THE PENNY AND I pause here to remark that meanwhile I was making my own living , and had been doing so from my twentieth birthday on . But the point which I want to emphasize is that I was making an adequate living quite incidentally , almost casually , and at no sacrifice of personal advantage or interest , or even inclination . I was doing resolutely what . I wanted to do ? the things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most worth while . It was a time of great intellectual activity . Young people were reading Emerson and Matthew Arnold , Browning , and Newman . Few of us read Darwin " in the original , " but most of us read about him in Huxley and Spencer . Evolution was then a new and thrilling doctrine , and all young and ardent spirits seized upon it with avidity . In handling the evolutionary doctrine in those early days and especially in trying to apply it to daily human life we made more blunders than ten-strikes . In particular we made the cardinal blunder of supposing that evolution explained many issues which are in their very nature inexplicable . But in spite of all our crudities and our downright errors and misapplications , the doctrine came as an immense spiritual stimulus . To a young man with my own passion for self-development it offered both justification and the outline of a new and more effective method . Almost without exception , we overemphasized the power of environment and too much lost sight of the inescapable force of heredity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our attention to the one factor in evolution which is open to immediate control . Evolution at once became for me an ethical program , a process by which my smaller self might grow into the large self of my most vivid aspiration . Apparently the method was given , and so simple that in running one might read ? it was to control the environment completely and so to adjust it that it might be the efficient cause of predetermined and clearly formulated effects . In a word , evolution was to be made conscious ? we , the illuminati , were to do it ? and environment was to be exploited to the utmost limit . This magic formula was , of course , only a new name for an age-long process , the eternal quest of perfection , which has its low tides and its high tides throughout the sweep of the centuries ; but the new name had genuine value , even though we too often forgot that no environment , short of miracle , can make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the quiet domain of personal inclination into the categorical imperative of absolute duties . I was to avoid juiceless occupations , meaningless routine , mere money-making , not alone because they were stupid and distasteful , but even more because they were unethical , grave disloyalties both to myself and to the progress of civilization . 1 , a torch-bearer , could not settle down by the embers of a dying fire . I must be forever en route . After that I became more of a free-lance than ever . I was critical of every environment . I was eager to detect the precise moment when its value was spent . Practically , this meant . that I traveled more , being as ready to change my geography as my particular bit of work . I was in Europe half a dozen times , remaining as much as a year at a time when such a stay promised desirable harvests . I took another year to go around the world and to see something of Japan and India . I visited our neighbors on the north and south , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Porto Rico . I was enjoying my life as an immediate experience ? not to-morrow , not yesterday , but to-day . It added immensely to this enjoyment to feel quite honestly that I was responding to the larger influences around me and becoming more of a person . What I valued was not money but time , and the slow cultural reactions which only time can bring . I arranged my life so as to have plenty of time , and in spending that I drove the sharpest bargains and tried to get the utmost possible benefit . By avoiding school when I was a boy I had had plenty of time and had learned something of its value . As a man I have avoided meaningless routine and the many forms of toil which bring no worthy harvest , and this has given me a wealth of time for better uses . In such an atmosphere of intentional leisure one becomes a conscious lover of excellence and feels the reality of the true aristocratic spirit . Some things are worth while and some are not ; and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who choose the second . There is a true distinction in persons and things , occupations and viewpoints , art and leisure , science and technology . There is a rich , fine way of handling life and there is a shabby , meager way of handling it ; the first way requires leisure and intelligence , leisure and skill , leisure and piety . Only those who are persistently in a hurry are democrats ; it fatigues them to take trouble and , finding the striving for excellence too exacting , they proclaim an equality which nowhere exists . Iv And meanwhile I was making my living , but in such an effortless , casual way that it was increasingly possible to forget money altogether and to do pretty much as I wanted . I felt myself rich , indeed very rich , not because I had money but because I had time and always enough money to spend the time profitably . I was not troubled about either the present or the future . In a vague way I hoped to die while still in action and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure as the unexpected . In my own case the unexpected came in the form of sudden , disabling illness . I had been frightfully delicate all my life , but I had managed to keep in the field , and to lead an active , in teresting life . Now , however , a combination of unfavorable conditions turned the odds against me , and I found myself definitely on the shelf , perhaps for the rest of my life , certainly for a period of years . My earning capacity had ceased . When I had rallied sufficiently to set about adjusting my affairs to these altered circumstances I examined my financial resources to see just where I stood and how much I had to live on . I knew , of course , in a vague way , but not in terms of income-producing power , for the question had never before been important , and I was much too practical a philosopher to waste time in keeping personal accounts . On exploring the modest strong box which contained my securities , I found to my surprise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good investments from the quite worthless ones , I had nearly two hundred thousand dollars . This is not a large amount , not so large indeed as the yearly income of many prosperous Americans , but it is a tidy sum , and was quite sufficient to satisfy the needs of an elderly gentleman of simple , scholarly tastes . But I was frankly puzzled to know where this small fortune had come from . Even now , several years later , I am still a bit perplexed . I had inherited very little ; my accumulations were not the result of deliberate saving ? I had never been so foolish as to tuck away a certain percentage of my income , quite regardless of whether it could be spent to advantage or not . Even had I been so foolishly inclined , the scheme would have been impossible , for not until that public nuisance , the Income Tax , arrived , with its devastating inroads upon a man 's time , did I know what my yearly income amounted to . Nor had I the humiliation of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I had always been liberal with myself in this respect . I had done graduate work at a second American university ; I had taken my doctor 's degree in Europe ; I had traveled extensively ; I had bought books and all other needed equipment ; I had declined post after post when my soul cried out for leisure . This little puzzle of my financial independence gave me food for thought during my enforced idleness . What had happened to me and to my worldly affairs was in reality extremely simple . My income had followed an upward curve ? it was easily visible had I chosen to look . While I was so completely preoccupied with my own improvement , gaining knowledge and skill , growing in character and insight ? as required by the formula of conscious evolution ? I was all unconsciously becoming correspondingly more valuable to my surrounding world . My earning capacity increased simply because the worth of my service increased . And this , I am sure , would be the testimony of thousands of successful men everywhere . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social argument in its support . In the matter of expenditure , I found a distinct and unsuspected novelty . It had come about quite without intention , and its belated recognition had all the flavor of a discovery . In general , as everyone will agree , the curve of expenditure is apt to follow the curve of income : the more a man makes the more he spends . This policy , I may point out , easily destroys a man 's freedom . If his style of living grows as fast as his income does the chances are that he will become the slave of that income , and even do unworthy things to maintain or augment it , because he is unwilling , or believes himself unable , to change the style of living to which he and his household have , perhaps foolishly , become accustomed . The situation is ignoble , but it is also essentially tragic , and I am quite willing to incur the charge of preaching if I can induce any younger men to avoid it . To keep one 's freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wants must be simple and wholesome , not increasingly complicated and fantastic . It was one of the surprises of this leisurely analysis of my own slender but long-drawn-out budget to find that the expenditures followed the income very closely for a number of years , but that there came a point when the two curves separated , the curve of expenditure rising Less rapidly . Then there came a second point where this curve not only ceased to rise but began perceptibly to fall ; that is , expenditure was not only less as compared to income , but was absolutely less . I have called this a surprise , but the explanation is very simple . Early in life opportunities for wise expenditure exceed one 's means , and an earnest man will spend his income quite up to the hilt . With the passing years , however , one 's needs become less and less objective , and more and more purely intellectual and spiritual . In my own case there came a time when it was less important whether I was in America or Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tropics . There was no loss of interest , in fact , no loss of real activity , but Life became more an affair of the inner spirit and , therefore , less expensive . In maturity a man 's genuine needs are considerably less than in youth , and if the simple personal tastes , perhaps forced upon him in early life by necessity , are afterwards retained with slight modifications as a matter of choice , the yearly budget of expenditure tends to grow smaller instead of larger . I knew now where my own fortune came from . It was not the result of conscious saving , of sacrifice , of niggardliness : it was the unspent surplus of a simple , active , industrious , interesting life . My strong box revealed something else , something less admirable ? an assortment of securities which had cost about one hundred thousand dollars and were now entirely worthless . This , of course , was a great stupidity , for I ought to have invested my surplus with more care and intelligence . I do not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not allow myself to waste any time in useless regrets , for that would only add to the loss , but occasionally 1 do think for a moment of the many delightful ways in which even a philosopher might spend a hundred thousand . I have given at considerable length this concrete illustration of what we may now call Automatic Saving . It would have no value whatever if I were an exceptional person , and in any way brilliant or remarkable . But as I have been insisting all along , I was simply an average boy , or even below the average , for I carried the handicaps of small means , extremely delicate health , and limited talent . It is , therefore , reasonable to assume that what such a boy could do , other boys with sturdier qualifications and using the same method could do and do far more victoriously . V In trying to present a brief and simple and coherent account of an experience which was itself neither brief nor simple nor coherent , but was palpitating with all the vagaries and adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalize , but I have , I believe , been faithful to the underlying truth . And now for the application . As a chance practitioner of Automatic Saving , whose experience was , on the whole , surprisingly favorable , I am naturally disposed to believe that the same method , carried out by intention , would yield even better results . The accidental might well be made the habitual . It is true that the spontaneity of the unconscious pioneer would be lacking , and one would miss some of the spirit of high adventure , but this would be offset a bit by the possibility of avoiding some or all of the pioneer 's mistakes ? that lost hundred thousand dollars , for instance . It is quite safe to believe , too , that the junior idealists of any new generation may be trusted to hit upon sufficient novelty to make any venture interesting . The early activity of our youthful aspirant will have to do wholly with time ; and money should stand in the same casual relation to it that a railway ticket does to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not hoard railway tickets ; in fact they become at a later date quite invalidated . It is eminently worth remembering that money suffers a similar and more tragic depreciation . Its purchasing power is never so great as in youth . Then it spells opportunity . It brings advantages of every sort , travel , books , study , society , a. hundred new experiences of value . When one is young , potential opportunity is always miles ahead of actual income , and the man who means to make the most of his life will spend every penny he can honorably lay hands on . To an older generation ocean travel to-day seems unreasonably expensive ; but if one needs Europe it would be a thousand pities to put the passage money into a savings bank . The price of books is high ; but if a new book offers a larger point of view , an added skill , a wider range of information , it is only elementary wisdom to pay the price . The same may be said of all the proffered agencies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , health measures , clubs with a purpose . It is no merit to make use of them , but it is a grave fault to omit them . Any simpleton can save up his doltars , but the wisest of men can not save up opportunities ? they must be used as they come . They go on coming , it is true , but they come increasingly to younger men . The opportunities offered to the older man are less and less objective , and more and more subjective . They are opportunities for the spirit , and make so few demands upon the purse that the problem of wise spending almost disappears . It would be idle to try to say just when this point is reached , for it comes to different men at different ages . But it comes to all normal men and with sufficient definiteness to be easily recognized . The time to begin the accumulation of a surplus has arrived when the whole income can no longer be spent to legitimate advantage . A man may be forty , or forty-five , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hour he would much better risk the poor-house than to hoard a penny which might have been exchanged for a larger personal experience . In a word , I am advancing the dangerous doctrine that a young man on the quest of personal good fortune may not morally save until he can no longer morally spend . A rational scrutiny of one 's affairs does not inquire how much one can save but how much one can wisely spend . When the curve of income and the curve of expenditure separate , with propriety , the resulting surplus may be invested from year to year with a perfectly clear conscience , but it should be done much more carefully than in my own case , and with not too many eggs in one basket . Normally this surplus ought to grow larger from year to year , both because one 's income is growing larger , and because by reason of increased spirituality on the part of the spender , one 's expenditure grows less both relatively and absolutely . This perfectly painless , automatic accumulation may be ended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ? it is not important . The point is that the proverbial rainy day has been adequately provided for without the conscious saving of a penny ; and the resulting little fortune does not represent the tragic price of omitted opportunities and narrowed horizons . I hope that I have succeeded in doing what I set out to do ? to show that in our somewhat mercenary age the wholesome procedure for those who love excellence is neither to save nor not to save . It is to occupy themselves solely with the wise use of time , knowing full well that the solution of this major problem carries with it the solution of all minor problems and , if I seem to the critical reader to be advocating a scheme by which a man may have both his penny and the gingerbread , I can only reply that such a scheme is precisely what I mean to advocate . I do so because the scheme is entirely practicable . Looking now at my own hands , I see in one of them the penny and , in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
