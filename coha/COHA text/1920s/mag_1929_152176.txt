S. there are 778 buildings of ten or more stories , including 377 buildings of 21 or more stories . New York has more than half the buildings in both classifications . Surprising New York statistic is that more than half the high buildings are between 14th and 59th streets , that Midtown Manhattan has more tall buildings than the famed downtown financial district .
