Jean Frenchman rushed to his favorite wine merchant , to his tobacconist , to his butcher , baker , candlestick maker . Hastily , he laid in a supply of articles about to become vastly more expensive . Then , clutching his remaining franc notes , he sought out the sellers of foreign bonds and securities . <P> The cause of this " buying panic " - which did not assume dangerous proportions-was twofold : 1 ) Finance Minister Loucheur had just presented the Chamber with the first draft of a new tax bill expected to raise eight billion additional francs per annum , by increasing the taxes on alcohol , business transactions and practically everything else ; 2 ) The franc slipped down last week to 27 to the $1 , a new low record for the year . The relative stability of numerous foreign currencies , prompted the harassed Jean to transfer his currency into pounds , gulden , Scandinavian kroner , U. S. dollars . <P> Since M. Loucheur 's bill is admittedly subject to extensive amendment , if indeed Premier Briand can railroad it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrific squabble which is brewing over the measure to M. Marcel Cachin , fire-eating Communist Deputy , who created a loudly welcomed diversion by denouncing the nation which he feels to be responsible for most of France 's financial ills : <P> " The United States is now accomplishing the ambition of her financiers 50 years back-'We , the world 's granary , will become its workshop , but shall only be really victorious when we become its banker . ' The United States has become our banker . With the Dawes Plan she has enslaved Germany . We ourselves are marching with big strides toward financial dependency to American capital . . . . From the beginning of the War I watched closely the purchases France made in the United States . . . . With what suppressed anger did I not analyze those veritably usurious contracts which America , profiting by our distress , imposed upon us . ... Does the United States really require the 75,000,000,000 francs they are asking us to pay ? Every one knows they are almost suffocating beneath the weight of gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Our ally 's demands are absolutely incompatible with the situation of this country as well as with the most elementary morality . France paid with her blood . This thought must ever exercise full weight in the minds of all honest men ! " <P> Observers opined that M. Cachin had coined into a few striking phrases exactly what is at the back of many a Frenchman 's mind . That these thoughts will not be allowed to come forward injudiciously was proved by the fact that a majority of the Paris press refused to print the speech at all . <P> With such sulphurous words safely expanding into ever thinner air , interest centred again directly upon M. Loucheur . When that notable millionaire-financial expert accepted the post of Finance Minister he declared ruefully . " I shall soon be the most unpopular man in France . " His prophecy has proved true .
