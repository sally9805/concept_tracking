We are both free peoples and strong peoples , and ought to be united , but we have reached liberty by different routes ; the French by principles and proclamations , the English by the gradual extension of the rights of the individual-which is , after a fashion , the way their people express in public life their love of comfort . " <P> The Spectator ( London ) , independent Conservative weekly , contained this statement : " This is a new reading of English history , under which Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights become simply the public expression of the Englishman 's dislike of discomfort and inconvenience- not by any means an unattractive reading ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Benito ; but , because the Premier was trying to conciliate the Catholics , many members of the Party sympathized with him , seceded , became political nonentities . <P> To regularize this situation , the seceders met at Bologna , home of the sausage of that name , founded the Italian National Centre Party , with a program identical to that of the Partita Popolare , except that it was decided to support the Fascist Government . <P> Benito beamed , encouraged the new Party , hoped that it would knock edgeways the adherents of little Don Sturzo.
