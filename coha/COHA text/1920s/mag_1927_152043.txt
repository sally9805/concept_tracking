The Woman of Bronze . Seeing this revival of Margaret Anglin 's onetime success is like reading last year 's almanac . It is not ancient enough to be antique or new enough to be curious , or great enough for the decades . It is just faded . There are offered in stock : 1 ) an artist , married but fascinated by his model , 2 ) a wife , married to the artist and ready to " fight for him , " 3 ) a model , beautiful but not for long . In the end the artist comes back home . Most interest attaches to Miss Anglin , who , dedicated in the past to the Greek tragedy in outdoor theatres , brings an austere recitation to her indoor lines . <P> Talk About Girls is a summer musical show , advertised by an honest press agent as " better than most , " which is no panegyric . There are two impecunious fellows who masquerade in Lower Falls , Mass. , as captains of industry . They are soothingly played these hot days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sojourn in the small town they become involved in a water power deal of large proportions , and love . The comedy consists of scrambling out of the mess of presumptions on the day of reckoning with a whole face and heart . From this the reader may have guessed that the show is based on James Gleason 's onetime farce vehicle , Like a King . The leg work is good , the singing terrible .
