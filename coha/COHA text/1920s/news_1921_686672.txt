txt The American polo team gained a decisive victory this afternoon in the first of the series of matches for the International Polo Cup . Victories in two matches out of three are necessary to win the cup . The Americans got 11 goals to the British teams 4 , and though the score hardly gives a fair representation of the difference between the two sides , the result was never in doubt . The Americans gained 2 goals in the first chukker and were within an ace of scoring a third , and the Britishers were never able to recover the lead . Indeed , only in one chukker , the fourth , did the defenders clearly have the advantage . They pressed the Americans all through it and they had three or four shots at the goal which . seemed to go wide by inches , but 1 goal was all they could make out of it all , and when the next chukker began and luck began to favor the challengers the Americans put on 2 goals in almost breathless succession . ? The goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : table The excellence of the American mounts called forth much admiration . Again and again when there was a race for the ball the American pony proved he had the heels . In a fast game such as this that . was a great advantage , as it gave the American forwards the ball at Moments when the British goal was open to attack , and all the British back could hope to do was to ride the Amerlean off and spoil his shot . Americans More Accurate . Another marked point in the game was the much higher proportion of American shots that found the goal . If the British forwards had been nearly as accurate the final score would have been more nearly even though the result had been the same . Toward the end of the match a sort of groan went up from the spectators as they saw a British player break away from the general scrimmage , drive the ball down the field with long , steady strokes , only to hit outside the goal posts . - Every one was glad to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken an electrical treatment for his lumbago and sprained back and decided after a trial canter on his pony that he was fit enough to play . Certainly no one who ? saw his sterling work for his side would have thought be had narrowly escaped the sick list . ' Apart ftom the actual game , the gathering at Hurlingham Field was a brilliant society function . As close as the club is to London , and hemmed in though it is by a rather dismal suburb , It resembles in many ways a fashionable Long Island country club . A fine old mansion is used ' as the clubhouse and around it is an old-fashioned garden with velvety lawns for tennis , high box hedges , magnificent trees and gorgeous flower beds . Here club members and their friends began to assemble in the morning for luncheon and a trip to the stables to get a peep at the ponies .. It was a beautiful day , with the sun not quite so powerful as it had been at Ascot and with a cool breeze blowing . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with most of the . men in black morning coats and black or gray tall hats , the scene was one of society at its brightest . Many Americans Present . The club had lined both sides of the polo field with stands to seat 10.0.0 . Unfortunately the price charged for the seats  --  from bi to ? 10 ? was too much for these days of high income taxes and coal strikes . In several of the more expensive stands there were rows of seats unoccupied . A large number ' of Americans were among the spectators . The Ambassador and Mrs. George Harvey brought with them a strong contingent from the eml:assy and all the principal hotels sent their transatlantic guests to give the . ro-nerican team a cheer . Polo is one of the , good things the East has conferred upon Western civilization , and so a little knot of Indian princes , in brilliant turbans , ? headed by Maharaiah Holkar of India , turned out to watch the match , while near them Were the Japanese , the French , the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for Englishmen , there were representatives of every walk of life and dozens of celebrities and notables . Lord Beatty and Earl Haig headed the military and naval contingents ; Lord ? apd Lady ' Birkenhead , Lady Curzon , Mr. and Mrs. Winston Churchill and the Duke of Northumberland came from the political world , while such polo experts as the Duke of Penaranda and Captain Ritson watched the play with critical eye . From four tall masts , one at each corner of the ground , waved two Stars and Stripes and two Union Jacks . The Playitg ground was a perfect lavel of emerald green turf . Drawn up across it at one end were massed the bands of the brigade of guards , in their pre-war uniforms , with scarlet tunics and bearskin busbies . They made a brave show . At their head were four drum majors , bearing their gold-headed staves . Slowly the glittering parade got into motion and in slow time marched in long lines the full length of the ground , playing a. number from Meyerbeer 's " Les Huguenots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side entrance to the ; rounds announced that something was happening . It was the Prince of Wales arriving in , an automobile with some ' riends . He was wearing morning dress . with his tall hat at the Beatty angle over his left eye . He was in the height 3f good spirits and greeted his acquaintances to the right and left as he strolled around to the royal box . Members of the teams who had been talking to their friends walked across the ground ' from the pavilion to be ready to meet him . As the American four were recognized hearty cheers greeted them and they end the British four were then presented to the Prince . He stood and loked with them - until the photographers Raw their opportunity and insisted on his being photographed in their midst . Three o'clock had struck and the Guards ' Band , moving as one man , marched to the centre of the ground , and , whirling round , faced the royal box . The shrill cheer of children sounded from the road outside and a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the way and then came the King , the Queen , Princess Mary and the Duke of York in one carriage , followed by anetherecarriag-e with their ladies and gentlemen in waiting . As they halted at the royal box the ' royal standard was hoisted and the bands played British and American national anthems while the spectators stood and uncovered : Both teams were then presented to the King and Queen . The Americans were presented first and after a few words with their Majesties they tools their seats . Ambassador Harvey Honored . Ambassador Harvey , was invited to sit next to the Queen . Others in the royal party were the Queen Mother Alexandria , King Alfonso of Spain , , ex-King Manuel and Queen Victoria Auguste of Portugal , the Duke of Connaught and Lady Patricia Ramsey . Then came the parade of ponies ; led by a Boy Scout carrying an American flag . The American string of twentyseven passed slowly around the grounds . Another Boy Scout with the Union Jack led the British twenty-four , and as the bear.tiful animals , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applause was loud . The Americans , as challengers , were the first to appear on the field . They took a few trial shots and Milburn had a consultation with the umpire . - The British team quickly followed , and the bell for play rang immediately . The ball was rushed down toward the British goal , and in two and a half minutes J. Watson Webb , No. 3 , scored the first for America . The game was started again , and hardly had the-ball got- into play before the Americans again obtained possession and T. C. Hitchock , No. 2 , hit another goal . They got a generous cheer for it , but the spectators began to look worried , as the Americans kept on pressing and had won a penalty for England 's hitting behind as the bell ' brought the first chukker to a close with the score 2 goals to ' O. ? The Americana failed to make use of this advantage when the game started again . The British drove them steadily down the ground . The play was fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance and put the first through for England . America was quick to retaliate . Louis Stoddard , No. 1 , got possession of the bail almost from the hit-off and , racing half the length of the ground , put it into the eenglish goal for the third time . This stirred the defenders and they developed a grand attack . Their second set of ponies seemed to compare better with the Americans than their first lot and their shots at the American goal came thick and fast . Narrow Margin of Success . Three times at least did the British make attempts to equalize the score , but missed by inches and the second chukker ended , 3 goals to 1 , with the award of a free hit of twenty-five yards to the British for a dangerous crossing . Major Barrett , No. 2 , took the free hit and made good use of it . He scored the second goal for the British , but gained no permanent advantage . The Americans came back with a rush and scored their fourth goal . Once more the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and neither side had much the best of it . The British were awarded a second , free hit , but Barrett failed to make use of it and immediately afterwards Tomkinson scored the British third , goal . Once more the Americans came back harder for ' the point scored against them and after the bell had sounded for the end of the third chukker , Hitchcock got the fifth goal for them , bringing the score to 5 goals to 3 . The fourth chukker was most disappointing for the supporters of the English team . " America 's lead , as big as it was , was not a commanding one , and there was still time to reduce it . The game was fast , but for a time it seemed to be going well for England . The Americans managed to get the ball at times into the centre of the ground , but they were mainly on the defensive . Four distinct shots were made at the goal by the English forwards in quick succession , only to go wide , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomkinson had one thrilling run down the ground with two Americans thundering behind him , merely to fail again , but as the bell rang the English were attacking again with the score 5 goals to 4 . The fifth chukker was just as clmrly American as the . fourth had been British . Once , and only once , ' did the defenders look dangerous ; and two American goals came with a rapidity that was ? absolutely startling . The chukker ended 7 goals to 4 . Two more American goals came at the beginning o the sixth chukker , and the British team made only one serious raid on American territory . Milburn , however , rodb off the leading English forward and saved the situation . The chuke ker ended 9 goals to 4 . The seventh chukker saw two more American victories and once again the ill luck that had dogged the British team all through the contest sent their last shot at the American goal wide , so the final score stood 11 goats for America to 4 for England , Lieut .

LONDON , June ** the game Yesterday Captain Milburn said to The London Sunday Times , " it was a great game and very fast . The boys played splendidly and naturally I am delighted . " The London Sunday Times correspondent says , " the score is hardly indicative of the course of the play , which Was by no means so much in favor of the Americans as the goal margin would lead one to suppose . The hitting of the English team in front of the goal was very erratic , and in the fourth period , especially , England missed at least three opportunities of scoring . " The Americans are undoubtedly a remarkable team of powerful hitters and very quick on the ball , and they ' availed themselves of practically every . opportunity of scoring that came . their way . Their ponies were in most cases far faster . than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Observer says . " undoubtedly the Americans deserved their victory . In addition to having better ponies they played with better understanding than England 's players , who never were in front : They had their chances in the third and fourth chukkers , ? but they threw-them away by poor shooting .
