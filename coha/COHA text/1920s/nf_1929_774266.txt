txt  | therefore , play an important role in limiting the amount of fungal mycelium in a soil , though their importance can not yet be assessed as there are so many organisms in the soil that can feed on fungal mycelium ; and , in fact , it seems that the life of any long piece of mycelium in the soil must be fairly short . These interrelations between the various members of the microflora may be of considerable importance in the control of plant pathogens in the soil , for the growth of some pathogenic fungi can be inhibited by some common soil fungi and bacteria . R. Weindlingl has claimed that the soil fungus Trichoderma lignorum can control the damping-off of citrus seedlings by a Rhizoctonia , and A. Lal2 that it can control Ophiobolus graminis , the fungus causing " take-all " in wheat and barley . J. P. Chadiakov3 has also claimed that bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas and Achromobacter can control some Fusaria , causing a wilt of flax . The great practical difficulty is to find means of encouraging these desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the pathogenic organisms effectively if they are sufficiently active in the soil , that is , if they have an adequate food supply . It can not usually be done by inoculating the desirable organism into the soil , as it will not be able to compete with the indigenous population for food , nor in general will adding an inoculum of a desirable organism already present help , for again the extra numbers of the organism will not usually be able to find enough food to keep them active . However , C. H. Meredith4 has reported what appears to be an exception to this rule , for he claimed to have reduced the severity of panama disease in bananas , caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum var. cubense by adding to the soil an inoculum of an actinomycete derived from the soil itself which is antagonistic to this fungus . The only way desirable organisms can have their activity increased is by altering the soil conditions . This can be done in two ways : either by adding organic matter and increasing the activity of the whole saprophytic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisms that are antagonistic to specialised plant pathogens ; or by altering the soil conditions in such a way that the desirable organisms can obtain a larger share of the available food supply . Thus , the fungus causing root rot in cotton , Phymatotrichum omnivorum , can be kept in control in irrigated Arizona fields by adding to to 15 tons of manure or other decomposable organic matter annually to the soil well before the cotton is planted.5 Weindling and Fawcett showed that the footnote l'hidoputh. , 1912 , 22 , 837 ; 1934 , 24 , 1153 ; 1936 , 26 , 1068 ; with H.

And the cotton root rot fungus can be attacked by saprophytic fungi in the roots of the cotton plant after harvest if the cotton plant is then cut below the crown ; for this injury allows saprophytic fungi to enter the roots rapidly and destroy the root rot fungus in the process of attacking the root cells themselves . ) Some further methods of controlling fungi attacking plant roots will be described later on p. 217 . The problem is in some ways easier when the pathogenic fungus can only live in plant tissue , and is carried over in the soil in infected tissue , for anything that hastens the decomposition of the plant remains the soil hastens the killing-out of the fungus . However , although the problem is easy in theory , it is difficult to find suitable methods in practice because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , Ophiobolus graminis , the cause of take-all in wheat and barley , is carried in the soil in infected straw , and it is not possible to get all the stubble decomposed between harvest-time in August and the beginning of the next growing season in March . But it may be possible to help the soil organisms in their work of destroying the pathogen if its resistance can be weakened in any way . In the particular case of Ophiobolus , S. D. Garrett2 has shown this can be done by depleting the soil of available nitrogen directly after harvest ; for the fungus , which is growing in the nitrogen-poor straw , appears to need some soil nitrogen during this period . Hence , any evice which does this , such as under-sowing the corn with Italian c-grass or trefoil , for young trefoil takes up soil nitrogen in autumn , ill weaken the fungus .

Interactions between the Soil Microflora and Fauna The standard example of the relation between the soil 's fauna and icrofiora is that between the protozoa and bacteria , though B. N. high 's work has shown that other protozoal-like organisms , such as yxobacteria , Acrasieae , giant amoeboid organisms and presumably footnote ' F. E. Clark , U.S. Dept . Agric. , Tech .

Bacteria , however , vary in their edibility to these different organisms : some bacteria appear to be readily eaten by them all , some by only a few , and a few appear to be inedible to all the organisms tested ? these latter mainly being pigmented bacteria which may secrete strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various origin tested for edibility by five groups of these organisms , a soil amoeba , a myxamoeba , a giant amoeba and two rnyxobacteria , twelve were eaten by all five groups , twenty-five were eaten by four , seventeen by three , thirteen by two , thirteen by one group only , and seven were not eaten by any . ' Thus , the great majority of soil bacteria can be eaten by at least one group of these bacterial feeders known to be present in the soil . The soil fauna can affect the microflora in several ways : the larger saprophytic soil animals , by being motile , distribute both the decaying organic matter and some of the microbial population throughout the soil layer in which they are working ; for they will be ingesting food at one place , mixing it with bacteria in their gut , and excreting it at another . In fact , this process of comrninuting and distributing dead plant litter throughout the surface layers of the soil is the predominant action of the larger soil invertebrates on the microbial population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that ingest soil at the same time , also affect the composition of the microbial population , for these animals will always be taking into their gut the micro-organisms attached to the plant residues or soil ingested , and be subjecting them to the action of their digestive juices , though whether they can in fact affect the composition of the microbial population is not known . It is possible that earthworms can depress fungal development in the soil by feeding on fungal mycelia , for it is an interesting fact , of unproven generality , that fungal mycelia only seem to develop abundantly in those soils of the temperate regions where earthworms are scarce , though more experimental work is needed to establish the validity and interpretation of this generalisation . There appears to be another interaction of importance , this time between the soil invertebrates and the protozoa , for some of the saprophytic invertebrates carry a protozoal population in their gut to help digest some of the more resistant plant products , such as cellulose , which the animal appears to feed on . Thus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important environment of the soil protozoa ? an environment of presumably great activity.2 footnote ' F. j . Anscombe and B. N. Singh , , Nature , 1948 , 161 , 140 .

G.  | The Effect of Soil Conditions on the Soil Microflora The composition of the soil population depends on soil conditions , particularly on the sources of energy available and on the air and water regime , but it does not show striking geographical changes . The same characteristic groups of bacteria , fungi , algae and protozoa are much the same in arctic , temperate and tropical soils , the differences between zones being far less marked than are those for the distribution of higher plants and animals . The reasons for this constancy of the soil population are to be sought , partly in the nature of the organisms themselves , partly in the soil as a habitat . It is possible , and indeed probable , that micro-organisms are less susceptible to environmental conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a depth of from 2 to 7 or 8 inches below the soil surface are more constant than on the surface itself ; the temperature is more even ( p. 332 ) , and the atmosphere is almost always humid and nearly saturated : there are no marked differences in degree of humidity such as affect profoundly the distribution of plants . The numbers of the bacteria in particular and their associated protozoa are constantly varying . The causes of these variations can not be completely analysed , for in a mixed interrelated population such as occurs in the soil , a change in numbers of a single species will automatically cause the changes in the numbers of other species . These fluctuations make it difficult to trace the effect of external conditions on the behaviour of any group of soil micro-organisms , and this difficulty can only be overcome by devising long series of experiments using proper statistical control to minimise their importance . Nearly all the work on the effect of soil factors on the numbers of the bacteria , actinomycetes and fungi has been done using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next sections are uncertain . It is very desirable that they be checked , using the more direct methods of estimating bacterial numbers and the amount of actinomycete and fungal hyphae present . SOIL MOISTURE AND SOIL TEMPERATURE These two factors have quite different influences on two distinct aspects of the soil microflora : their numbers and their activity . The bacterial numbers in a soil appear to increase with increasing moisture content , a result found by every investigator , though it has only been established for numbers based on the plate count . H. L. Jensen , l working with a pasture soil in New South Wales , found the numbers of ' actinomycetes were almost independent of the moisture content , so that the ratio of actinomycetes to bacteria increased as the moisture footnote 1 Proc. fun , . Soc. , N.S.W. , 1934 , 59 , ioi.  | content decreased , but the number of fungi increased with moisture content ; whilst W. G. E. Eggleton , l using an English pasture soil , found the actinomycetes increased somewhat with moisture content , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungi was independent of the moisture content . It is , however , probable that these fungal results reflect more the limitations of the technique used than their field behaviour , for H. J. Conn , 2 using the Cholodny slide technique and soils incubated in the laboratory , found that fungal mycelia were prominent in the drier and absent in the wetter conditions ? a result in accord with our general knowledge that many soil fungi thrive in fairly dry conditions but demand good aeration for active growth . The effect of the usual variations of soil temperature on the number of micro-organisms is still undecided . The careful work of Jensen and of Eggleton on pasture soils , and N. James and M. L. Sutherland3 on a fallow soil in Winnipeg all failed to show any effect of temperature on the numbers of the soil bacteria if the associated moisture effects were eliminated . Eggleton found the number of actinomycetes increased somewhat with temperature , a result not found by Jensen , and neither found any effect of temperature on the number of fungi . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a fallow soil at Rothamsted , found the numbers of bacteria tended to decrease with increasing temperature , and D. Feller and M. Franck , 5 using Hungarian pasture and forest soils , found they increased . The effect of the season of the year on the number of bacteria , as determined by the plating method , appears to be small for soils that are either fallowed or are under forest or permanent pasture : the linear regression with moisture content accounts for about half the total variability ( variance ) of the bacterial numbers in Jensen 's , Eggleton 's , and James and Sutherland's6 experiments . But the effect of an annual crop on bacterial numbers is considerable . James and Sutherland found the number of bacteria in the wheat soil , reduced to a standard moisture content , was the same as the fallow soil at the end of May , but was nearly double that at the end of September . The effect of season on actinomycetes and fungi has not been so fully investigated . Under pasture conditions Jensen found less of the variability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Eggleton found about as much of the actinomycete as the bacterial variability could be so accounted for ; whilst J. Singh ' working on the permanent wheat and mangold plots at Rothamsted , found no apparent seasonal effect on the numbers of fungi or actinomycetes. footnote 1 Soil Sci. , 1938 , 46 , 351. 2 .

Biol. , 1937 , 24 , 154.  | Variations of moisture content and temperature cause many changes in the activity of the micro-organisms that are not connected with their number . The activity of all aerobic organisms in a soil increases with increasing moisture content up to a maximum and then begins to decrease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess water ( see Fig. 171 ) , and the activity of all organisms increases with increasing temperature up to a maximum and then decreases when the higher temperatures are injuring the organism . Thus , the net effect of these factors on the activity of a group of organisms in the soil is the product of the number of organisms present and their individual activities ; and the maximum activity may , and for temperature dependence usually does , occur when the numbers are falling . The relation between temperature and activity can , however , become very complex when two or more organisms are living together . Thus , E. H. Richards2 showed that the rate of nitrogen fixation by Azotobacter , living in the presence of starch-decomposing organisms of the Aerogenes group and feeding on the by-products of the decomposition , had two optimum temperatures , the one at the higher temperature corresponding to low footnote A. E. Traaen , Zbl . Bala . IT , 1916 , 45 , 119. 2 5 . Agric . Sci. , 1939 , 29 , 302.  | numbers but high activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more abundant food supply produced at the higher temperature by the Aerogenes bacteria . Jensenl investigated the effect of temperature on the relation between the CO2 evolution of a soil and the number of bacteria it contained , and showed that as the temperature rose the CO2 evolved per I , 000 million bacteria , as determined by the direct cell count , increased from about 16 per cent of their dry weight per day at 15 ? C. to 30 per cent at 28 ? C. and to 50 per cent at 37 ? C. , whilst if plate counts were used as the basis there was no clearly marked temperature dependence , and for some soils the CO2 evolution per day would be over sixty tirnes the dry weight of the organism , which would correspond to higher rates than observed for young cultures of active bacteria growing under optimal conditions . He considered the fungi were inactive under these conditions . When decomposable organic matter was added to the soil , Jenson found that the fungi , as measured by the abundance of mycelia on the Cholodny slides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was correlated with the CO2 production ; in fact , the multiple correlation of this and the total cell count for bacteria with CO2 production was about o-8 . At low temperatures , 4 ? to 7 ? C. , the importance of the fungi was small compared with the bacteria , at 14 ? to 16 ? C. it was about equal to that of the bacteria , at 28 ? C. it was considerably larger , and at 37 ? C. it was equal or less ; but in all these cases this was only true for the first week of decomposition , after that the fungal activity fell off rapidly compared with the bacterial . THE EFFECT OF SOIL REACTION The effect of soil reaction can be very marked under conditions of extreme acidity , though , as will be discussed later in connection with plants . ( see p. 473 ) , the effect of the hydrogen-ion concentration may be less important than associated effects such as the lack of calcium or phosphates , or the presence of soluble aluminium and manganese compounds . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burrowing animals , such as the earthworms , which mix the surface litter with the soil . Dead and partially decomposed plant material accumulates on the surface as a mat , and the population below the soil surface lives under conditions of very small annual additions of nutrients . It is possible that fungi may be transferring nutrients from the mat to the soil by sending their mycelia into each region , but the importance of this transfer has not been established . footnote Proc . Linn . Soc. , N.S.W. , 1936 , 61 , 27.  | Acid soils probably carry a larger fungal but a smaller bacterial flora than neutral soils . Acid mor soils , whose pH usually lie below 4 , are typically characterised by a profuse development of fungal mycelia , which are far less prominent on less acid mull soils ( see p. 515 ) . But if the acidity is not extreme , the evidence is not extensive enough to admit of any rigid generalisations . Thus the bacterial population on Rothamsted pasture soils is not dependent on pH in the range 3.8 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's total cell count , though they are depressed at the lower pH if determined by the plate count . Jensen 's work , just quoted , suggests that the total cell count gives a more accurate estimate of bacterial numbers , with the consequence that at the present time it is best to assume that the total bacterial population is not very dependent on soil reaction . The type of bacteria present in the soil depends on the soil reaction . Nitrifiers , i.e. bacteria oxidising ammonia to nitrites and nitrates , are relatively inactive in acid soils , though the pH by itself can not be the sole cause of this , as it also depends on the vegetation . Thus , C. Olsenl found that nitrates were produced down to pH 3.8 in Danish pasture soils , but only to pH 4.5 in forest soils , whilst H. L. Richardson2 found very little nitrate produced below pH 6 in a Rothamsted pasture . Again , the common species of the aerobic nitrogen-fixing Azotobacter are usually absent in soils with pH below 5.7 . Very little definite information appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of micro-organisms present in the soil , though there is some evidence ( p. 291 ) that nitrifying organisms may be limited by phosphate starvation under very alkaline conditions . Partial Sterilisation of the Soil The soil population can be greatly simplified , and undesirable groups of pathogens can be eliminated from the soil by partial sterilisation . This consists either in heating the soil with steam or in adding to it sterilising solutions such as toluene and carbon disulphide , and this treatment increases the fertility of the soil markedly for a time . Relatively mild treatments , such as drying the soil , heating to 450C. , treatment with poisons which are not too strong , 3 cause a fall in numbers of bacteria , but when the conditions are again made suitable , the numbers rise considerably . They do not remain high , but sooner or later fall to the normal range of values . More drastic treatment , such as heating the soil to 5o ? C. ( at which temperature most of the trophic forms are killed ) , or treatment with footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . 2 J. Agric . Sci. , 1938 , 28 , 73 . " The effect of poisons was first observed by Oberlin in Alsace ( Bodenmiidigkeit tend Schwefelkolhlenstoff , Mainz , 1894. ) .  | certain stronger poisons , also causes a fall and subsequent rise in bacterial numbers when favourable conditions are restored , but the high numbers are maintained much longer . The phenomena are not confined to soil , but are shown also by other complex microbial associations , such as sewage beds . " According to S. A. Waksman and R. L. Starkey , ' the fungi in soil are first much depressed , but increase greatly in numbers soon after the conditions again become favourable . The actinomycetes are also at first depressed , though nothing like as much as the fungi : they do not recover as quickly as the bacteria , though they multiply rapidly if cellulose or other energy material be added . E. J. Russell and H. B. Hutchinson showed that the numbers of bacteria in partially sterilised soils , unlike those in normal soils , reacted in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general explanation E. J. Russell suggested that the treatment , by curtailing or eliminating ( according to its severity ) one or more of the groups of the soil population , leaves the others more free from competition , and , therefore , able to increase to higher numbers than before , and also to react normally to changes in external conditions . This view was put in more concrete form in conjunction with H. B. Hutchinson , ' and evidence was adduced that bacteria , at that time regarded as the only important living micro-organisms in the soil , were not so in fact , but that other organisms were normally present keeping down their numbers . It was shown that these organisms were probably protozoa , a view that Cutler subsequently substantiated . ' The organisms surviving partial sterilisation produce more ammonia and nitrate than did the original population , so that soils treated by methods calculated to injure trophic life gain in fertility , an apparently paradoxical result in view of the importance of trophic life to soil fertility ( Table 43 ) . Partial sterilisation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined , increased the amount of ammonia and nitrite in the soil , ' suppressing the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate ; and under these conditions plants will rapidly die from nitrite poisoning . Further it may also increase the amount of available manganese in the soil sufficiently to cause plants growing on it to suffer from manganese poisoning , ' and this footnote The disinfection of sand filters leads to increases in the numbers of bacteria . This was observed in the typhoid epidemic at Lincoln in 1904 , and also in the experimental sewage filter at Guildford in 1907 : A. C. Houston and G.

The fact has long been known to cultivators of the soil . Heating the soil has been practised from time immemorial in India ; the process is called " rab " , and is mentioned in the Vedas ; 3 the burning of stubble was known by the Romans to increase the fertility of the soil , and various possible explanations were shrewdly put forward by Virgil.4 footnote 1 F.

Prescott2 and shown to be due partly to microbiological , and partly to physical , causes . A. N. Lebediantzev3 considers that this repeated drying and heating of the soil plays no small part in maintaining its fertility in hot countries . The effects on the plant are in all cases described as resembling those of nitrogenous manure . This increased production of ammonia and nitrate is not a necessary consequence of the higher numbers of organisms ; on the contrary , higher numbers , e.g. those induced by adding non-nitrogenous organic matter to the soil , might depress the ammonia and nitrate content ( p. 235 ) by taking up these substances for their own nutrition . The increased production of ammonia and nitrate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to account for it . L. Hiltner and K. Stormer , 4 who were the first to associate the beneficial effects of partial sterilisation with bacteria , 5 considered that the new bacterial flora set up after the treatment was more potent in decomposing protein than the old one . This view was shown to be inaccurate by Russell and Hutchinson , who replaced the old flora by inoculating untreated soil into partially sterilised soil , and showed that the bacterial numbers rose even higher , and produced even more ammonia and nitrate , than did the new flora by itself . The idea was modified by Waksman and Starkey , who suggested that in normal soil much of the decomposition of the protein is effected by fungi , which assimilate a good deal of the carbon and a corresponding amount of nitrogen ; after partial sterilisation , however , the fungi are for a time suppressed and the decomposition passes to the bacteria which assimilate much less of the carbon and nitrogen and , therefore , produce a larger amount of ammonia . Russell and Hutchinson connected the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new bacterial flora was not widely different from the old , and might therefore be expected to behave like the old , except that , being more numerous , it would accomplish more decomposition . The close relationship between bacterial numbers and ammonia ( or nitrate ) production in their experiments supported this view . Stormer suggested that the additional ammonia and nitrate came from the decomposition by bacteria of the organisms killed by the partial sterilisation process . footnote 1 A. and G. L. C.

There is thus still no satisfactory explanation of why partial sterilisation , either by steaming or by the use of antiseptics , increases the rate of production of ammonium or nitrate nitrogen . ' These problems of partial sterilisation are gaining in practical importance at the present time with the introduction of relatively cheap sterilising agents , such as calcium chloracetate and the chlorinated hydrocarbons , e.g. D-D , which is a mixture of 1,3-dichloropropene and 1,2-dichloropropene . These chemicals have been found to control root-attacking nematodes in the laboratory and to give very considerable increases of crop when added at the rate of several hundred pounds per acre to eelworm-infested land .

The interfacial volume between the plant rootlets and the bulk of the soil , in which this population lives , is often called the Rhizosphere ; 2 but this volume has no exact bounds , for some of the rhizosphere population may penetrate the outer surface of the rootlet and some will extend into the neighbouring soil .

The picture obtained from viewing living plant rootlets in the soi14 is that there are obvious concentrations of micro-organisms around the rootlets , but that there appear to be few in the body of the soil itself . Large colonies of small bacteria occur in clumps , or even sheaths around the rootlets , and large numbers of motile bacteria may be swimming in the thin water films around them , and actinomycete and fungal hyphae of various types can be seen on the surface or even penetrating their epidermal cells . This concentration of the microflora around the plant roots encourages the development of predatory protozoa and nematodes which feed on this population.5 footnote 1 For a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.

The significance of this population for plant growth is not fully understood . It probably helps the plant to extract phosphate2 and possibly other nutrients from difficultly available compounds , though whether this is entirely due to the higher CO 2 concentration the microorganisms produce around the root hairs has not been established . The population , on the other hand , must obviously derive some benefit from the plant ; presumably a proportion at least must draw their energy supply from the plant , partly directly from the living and partly indirectly from the dead or dying tissues , but no estimates are yet available of the proportion of the carbohydrate fixed by the plant that is used by this population . In spite of these limitations there is little doubt about the correctness of the general conclusions reached by this older work , namely , that the soil in the immediate neighbourhood of the plant roots carries a larger , or possibly only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots . It is consistent with all qualitative observations so far made , and also with the evidence from the rate of CO 2 production of the soil , which is greater near the root than a little way away from it . In fact R. L. Starkey3 found that there was a rough correlation between the rate of evolution of CO 2 by roots and the number of bacteria in the rhizosphere , suggesting that the microbial population on the root makes an appreciable contribution to the rate of CO2 evolution in the immediate neighbourhood of the root surface . It is still more difficult to assess the relative importance of the rhizosphere population compared with the general soil population when expressed as the proportion of the bacteria present per acre of soil in these two populations .

Krassilnikov4 has made a rough estimate of uncertain validity and concludes that there is probably about twice the weight of bacteria in the lucerne rhizosphere as in the body of the soil , namely , about 2 tons and i ton live weight per acre respectively , whilst the bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. L. Starkey 's work ( Soil Sci. , 1929 , 27 , 319 , 355 , 433 ; 1931 , 32 , 367 ) is a good illustration rI the type of results obtained by these methods . 2 F. C. Gerrctscn , Plant and Soil , 1946 , 1 , 51. a Soil Sci. , 1931 , 32 , 367. 9Mikrobiologia , 1944 , 13 , 144.  | infertile soil probably only weighs about 5 lb. per acre and , in consequence , is negligible compared with the rest of the population . The size of the bacterial rhizosphere population depends on the plant and on its stage of development , but is not very dependent on the fertility of the soil ; 1 though since the less fertile soil will often have a lower population , the difference in numbers between the rhizosphere and the soil populations may be higher in the less fertile than the more fertile soils.2 For a given plant , the population is most numerous when it is making its most vigorous growth.3 The effect of the type of plant has not been investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lucerne probably carry a considerably higher population than arable crops , including beans . The plant roots will sometimes supply a part of the population with simple amino acids and with growth factors such as aneurin and biotin . A. I. Virtanen4 showed that pea roots might sometimes excrete the amino acids , aspartic acid and p-alanine ; P. M. West5 showed that the roots of flax and tobacco could excrete growth factors such as aneurin and biotin ; and H. Lundegardh and G. Stenlid6 found that wheat roots could excrete nucleotides and flavanones . Further , Lochhead and other Canadian workers have shown that the rhizosphere bacterial population differs from that in the soil as a whole by having a lower proportion of bacteria that require complex growth substances , such as yeast and soil extract , and a higher proportion with very simple requirements , although those on some crops , e.g. flax , require some simple growth substances and those on others , e.g. red clover , require amino acids as well . ' This presumably indicates that these crops excrete such substances , lending support to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their root system is too young for the sloughing off of rootlets or nodules to be expected . The rhizosphere bacterial population differs from that of the soil in its morphological as well as its nutritional composition . R. L. Starkeya showed that a large proportion of the rhizosphere bacteria belong to the Radiobacter , or in Conn 's terminology ( see p. 151 ) the Agrobacter group which includes the nodule bacteria for leguminous plants . These are Gram-negative , non-spore formers , which may include some fluorescent types as well , but spore-formers are rare . Lochhead9 footnote 1 F. E. Clark and C. Thorn , Trans. 3rd Comm . Int .

Little additional knowledge about the occurrence of specific groups of bacteria in the rhizosphere is available . H.

I. Timonin3 found that manganese oxidising bacteria could be so prevalent in the rhizosphere of some varieties of oats that the oats could not take up enough manganese , so suffered from grey speck disease , whilst other varieties of oats , growing under the same conditions , had a smaller population of these bacteria and could take up enough manganese . The numbers of manganese oxidisers in the rhizosphere could be increased and in consequence the severity of the grey speck symptoms , by applying a straw mulch to the soil ; and the numbers and the grey speck symptoms could be decreased by adding partial sterilising agents such as chloropicrin , formaldehyde and even calcium cyanamide to the soil . Association of Fungi with Plant Roots Plant roots , even from apparently healthy plants , carry a considerable fungal population in and around their roots in addition to the bacterial . The fungus enters the epidermal cells of the roots , and is usually restricted to them . These fungi may , but do not always , kill the cells they invade , and the species range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit a healthy plant . P. M. Simmonds and R. J. Ledingham4 in Canada studied the fungal flora on and in the surface of the roots of apparently healthy wheat plants , by digging up the roots , cutting off short lengths , washing them well and putting them in potato agar , a medium that is favourable to the growth of most fungi . In this way they showed that half the infections and a third of the species recognised were due to recognised pathogens , and these infections were much more common in the roots taken from the first foot of soil than from greater depths . They made the further interesting observations that none of the fungi that were only found below the first foot was a pathogen and that the phycomycete mycorrhizal fungus ( see p. 226 ) , which did not seem to harm the root in any footnote Soil Sci. , 1946 , 62 , 343 ? 2 See , for example , F.

Glynne , ' working with wheat roots taken from the permanent wheat field at Rothamsted , reached the same general conclusions , and further showed that the frequency of infection increased during the growing season , reaching a maximum in June ? a result comparable with Katznelson 's for bacteria around mangold roots . Not only the species of plant , but also the actual variety can affect the rhizosphere population , particularly if two varieties are chosen , one of which is relatively susceptible and the other relatively immune to typical fungal root infections . This dependence has been studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots of flax varieties immune and susceptible to wilt ( Fusarium lini ) and tobacco varieties to black root rot ( Thielaviopsis basicola ) .2 The varieties susceptible to these diseases , even when healthy , carry a larger and a more typical rhizosphere population than the immune . In the case of flax3 this seems to be due to the immune variety excreting larger quantities of HCN from its roots than the susceptible , which is derived from the decomposition of the larger quantity of the glucoside linamarin which it contains in its roots . This increased HCN concentration depresses some members of the rhizosphere population , particularly the weakly pathogenic soil fungi , e.g. Fusarium , Helminthosporium and Verticillium , without affecting the non-pathogens such as Trichoderma , Mucor and Penicillium . Problems of great practical importance arise in the attempt to limit the density of pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of the plant root , because if soil conditions could be so adjusted that they could not flourish there , it would offer a way of controlling soil-borne fungal diseases in the field.4 Obviously , one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decompose the pathogenic fungal tissue when in the soil , and the principles of doing this by increasing the general activity of the population have been described on p. 200 . Another way is to use a good rotation of crops so the pathogens of each crop used are never able to build up in numbers . And this principle applies to soil-inhabiting fungi that are only weak pathogens . Thus , J. Singh5 found that species of Fusarium , which are very characteristic decomposers of wheat straw and also weak parasites of wheat roots , 6 footnote 1 Trans . Brit . Mycol .

The fungal population around the root can be altered in two ways : one is by altering the plant so the fungus can not attack it or can not extract much food from it , and the other is by altering the microbiological conditions in the soil . Many plants have their resistance to fungal infection increased , or suffer less damage from the infection once it has occurred , if growing in conditions of high fertility . A generous but wise use of fertilisers is , in fact , one of the best ways of reducing damage by many of the fungi attacking plant roots . Thus , in England the damage due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungi Ophiobolus graminisl and Cercosporella herpotrichoides2 respectively , can be reduced by proper manuring , particularly with nitrogen , although in Australia where available phosphate limits plant growth , dressings of superphosphate reduce the severity of take-all very considerably . There is , in fact , no truth in the generalisation , which has often been made , that the use of fertilisers and particularly nitrogen fertilisers , necessarily increases the susceptibility of the crop to fungus diseases ; for in many cases they have the opposite effect by increasing the resistance of the plant to root fungus diseases . This result must , however , be interpreted with caution . The manuring does not so much increase the resistance of the crop to infection as reduce the damage done by the fungus , through increasing the power of the crop to make new roots or new tillers to replace these affected by the fungi . The plant can be modified so that its resistance to invasion by root fungi is increased in other ways besides increasing its general vigour . F. M. Eaton and N. E. Rigler3 showed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier the lower the level of carbohydrate in the bark , hence anything increasing this carbohydrate content increases the root 's resistance to root rot . Unfortunately , the productive strains of cotton tend to send all their carbohydrates into the boll , so have low concentrations in the root bark . The effect of modifying the microbiological conditions in the soil on the ease with which soil-inhabiting fungi attack plant roots is shown by an observation of A. A. Hildebrand and P. M. West.4 They were studying root rots of strawberry and tobacco caused apparently by the roots being attacked by a number of common soil fungi , none of which appeared to be primarily responsible for the initial attack in strawberry , though footnote 1 S.

Further , it reduced the number of potentially pathogenic fungi on the strawberry roots . Farmyard manure or decomposing red clover tops had none of these effects . They also found that adding glucose or acetic acid to the soil was as effective in controlling root rot , and had the same qualitative effects on the bacteria and fungi of the rhizosphere as decomposing soybean tops ; and H. Katznelson and F. E. Chase2 found that other carbohydrates had the same effect on the bacterial population as soybean tops and that strawberry leaves and tops had the same effect as clover , but they did not test if these had the same effect on the prevalence of the rots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotations and suitable green manuring to control these rots which the Canadian workers have found on strawberry , tobacco , tomato , lettuce and tulip , and all of which seem to be associated with the same group of fungi and nematodes . But the cause of this control is not known , so one can not predict which root rots it will apply to . That it does not apply to all is shown by some results of G. H. Berkeley and L. W. Koch , 3 for they found a brown root rot of tobacco , also apparently caused by a complex group of organisms under conditions that are not yet known , was encouraged instead of discouraged by adding soybean tops to the soil . Thus the present position is that a few isolated methods are available for combating root rots by modifying either the resistance of the root to infection or the microbial population in the rhizosphere outside the root ; but the general principles underlying the methods are not yet understood , and the methods so far developed have only very limited applicability . Specialised Associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots in a soil profoundly affects the general microbiological population in their neighbourhood as already discussed , footnote 1 V. C. Cochrane ( Phytopath. , 1948,38 , 185 ) found that red clover tops contain some soluble substance that turns radish roots brown , and hence presumably very liable to attack by these fungi . Soybean tops do not contain this substance . 2 Soil Sci. , 1944 , 58 , 473. 3 Canad . Dept . Agile . Pub/. 667 ( Farmers ' Bull . 85 ) , 1940.  | but they can also affect a few groups specifically . Thus , as is described in Chapter 16 , some soil-inhabiting bacteria can attack and enter the roots of certain species of leguminous , and perhaps other plants , multiplying inside them in specialised structures known as nodules and forming an association with the plant that usually increases its growth and vigour by their power of converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form available to the plant ? an effect of very great agricultural importance . At least one species of actinomycetes may form a corresponding association with the alder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leguminous . Fungi have probably been living in close association with the roots of land plants ever since they evolved . When intermixed with algae they form lichens , but they occur in similar associations with the bryophytes pteridophytes and higher plants.2 The association ranges from obviously parasitic through apparently neutral to obviously symbiotic , 3 and the degree of parasitism or symbiotism depends not only on the fungus , but also on the health and vigour of the plant , which , in turn , depends on the soil conditions and the climate . The fungi concerned fall into three groups : firstly , the specialised parasites that merely exist in the soil and only develop when plant roots approach them ? they attack and enter the roots and then live entirely within the plant ; secondly , a large group of soil-inhabiting fungi , only some of which are recognised as capable of being serious plant pathogens and which have been described in the previous section ; and , finally , specialised fungi , often only capable of growing in the soil near a plant root , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many cases are eventually digested by them . The individual hyphae of this group usually live simultaneously in the soil and in the root , and the group itself is known as mycorrhiza formers . This association is of proved benefit to some plants , but its effect on others is still unproven . The mycorrhizal associations can conveniently be grouped into four classes : those mainly between some higher Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes with the roots of many forest trees ; those between perfect and imperfect Basidiomycetes with orchids ; those between a group of fungi and ericaceous plants , neither of which will be considered here ; and those between a very characteristic fungus and most types of higher plants growing in suitable conditions . footnote 1 M.

This structure is composed both of a mantle of fungus mycelium outside these roots , whose cortical cells are enlarged , and also of fungal hyphae filling the intercellular spaces , as can be seen from the cross-section of a mycorrhiza reproduced in Plate XI . The mantle is often coloured , the colours ranging from white through golden brown to black , and usually has a fairly smooth surface , though it may be loose and have many hyphae radiating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were initially called mycorrhiza , or fungus roots , by B. Frank.2 The type here described , characterised by a fungal mantle and the fungal hyphae filling the intercellular spaces , is termed ectotrophic , but there is a more common type to be described later , the endotrophic , which has no definite mantle and the hyphae invade the cortical cells . There are also transitional types , particularly of the ectotrophic , where some hyphal penetration of the cell takes place , known as ectendotrophic . Mycorrhizas are typically ephemeral structures lasting only a growing season . Infection takes place when the sub-laterals send out their new short roots , from living fungal mycelium or spores in the soil produced there in the preceding autumn , and the structures are usually dead by the end of the growing season . The trees which can carry these mycorrhizas include the Abietineae ? the firs , pines , spruces and larches ; the Betulaceae ? the birch , alder , hazel and hornbeam ; the Fagaceae ? the beech , oak and chestnut ; and the Salicaceae ? the poplars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as elm and hickory . The fungi are mainly Hymenomycetes , such as species of Boletus , Amanita , Lactarius , among others , but include at least one member of the Gasteromycetes ( puff balls ) , Rhizopogon , and by inference truffles and truflfe-like fungi , such as some of the Tuberales and Elaphomyces belonging to the Ascomycetes , as well as several fungi whose systematic position is not known as their fruiting bodies have not yet been observed.3 Normally , a given species of fungus can form mycorrhiza on a number of species of tree , and , conversely , a single tree can carry mycorrhiza formed from a number of fungal species . footnote 1 For descriptions and photographs of some of these different types of mycorrhiza , see M.

But this problem of the source of the energy supply to the fungus has not yet been definitely settled , for it is not yet known how far the fungus can obtain any of its energy supply from the soil organic matter . There is much evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree . In the first place normal mycorrhizal infection only takes place when the plants are photosynthesing . Thus seedling roots only become infected after the leaves have opened4 ? an observation exactly analogous to that in leguminous crops , whose roots only become infected with nodule bacteria after the first true leaves have opened ( p. 316 ) . Further , E. Bjorkman5 has shown that the number of mycorrhiza on pine and spruce seedlings increases as the carbohydrate content of the root increases ; and indeed he considers that the root is only susceptible to infection when protein synthesis lags behind carbohydrate synthesis for any reason ? as , for example , lack of available nitrogen or phosphate in the soil or the presence of climatic conditions conducive to rapid rates of photosynthesis . This evidence shows that in the early stages of attack the fungus is probably mainly dependent on the plant for its carbohydrate supply , and this is further borne out by the observation that the mycorrhiza formers differ in their nutrition from the related Basidiomycetes in only being able to obtain their energy supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a few can use starch with difficulty , 6 whilst the non-mycorrhizal fungi can use celluloses and some even lignin . ' Further , the spores of the mycorrhiza-forming fungi will only germinate in the presence of complex growth-promoting footnote L. G. Romell , Svensk . Bot .

Rome112 considers that the fungi rely on the tree for their carbohydrate supply all through the season , for he has found that many mycorrhizal fungi can only form their fruiting bodies when the tree they are attacking is fairly well grown , and he interprets this as showing that the fungus must make heavy demands on the tree 's supply of carbohydrates in order to form its fruiting bodies . He quotes3 an observation of P. Larsen in Denmark , who found that the fruiting bodies of a single species of a hymenomycete mycorrhiza-former on spruce contained 16o lb. of dry matter and 42 lb. of nitrogen per acre , and he estimated that the fungus would need at least 350 lb. of carbohydrate per acre to produce this crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the carbohydrate used by the spruce to form new timber growth . On the other hand there is some evidence that the fungi obtain at least part of their energy from the soil humus . Thus isolated fruiting bodies of typical mycorrhizal fungi can be found apparently unattached to any tree , though the possibility of them attacking other plants in their neighbourhood can not be entirely ruled out . Again , as will be discussed shortly , the fungus seems to supply the tree with the greater part of its nitrogen supply when the level of ammonium or nitrate nitrogen in the soil is low . Unfortunately it is not known what forms of nitrogen besides ammonium the fungus will take up , but it is possible that a part of its supply is derived from the organic matter by direct decomposition brought about by the fungus . In the same way it supplies the plant with much of its phosphate , and some of this may also be directly obtained from the organic matter . The fungus can not properly be considered parasitic on the tree merely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be looked upon as an extension of the tree 's root system , supplying the tree with water and mineral nutrients derived from the soil , but obtaining the energy required for this from the tree itself . It is even possible that the fungus takes less energy from the tree to do this than would the uninfected roots . The mycorrhizal association , on the other hand , is not essential for the trees , since they grow most vigorously in fertile soils when their roots carry few , if any , mycorrhizas.4 But it benefits them in many natural conditions , particularly if the humus of the forest floor is of the footnote 1 N.

Mycorrhizas only develop freely on trees under three fairly definite soil conditions . They need a supply of organic matter , so develop most freely in the surface litter of the forest floor , ' and can often be encouraged in a mineral soil by adding leaf litter or compost . They need well aerated soils and are inhibited by water-logging both through lack of oxygen and also by the presence of sulphides and other byproducts of reducing conditions.2 Sandy soils are more conducive to mycorrhiza formation than clays or peat bogs ; but loosening a heavy soil or draining a bog , by increasing the soil aeration , increases the mycorrhizal development . They also need a restricted , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact mycorrhiza formation appears to be the tree 's response to low availability of nutrients . There are many soils in the world that are too poor in phosphates , and there are even soils too low in available nitrogen to carry mycorrhizas : merely adding phosphates3 in the form of superphosphates or basic slag in the one case , or available nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate , 4 for - instance , in the other , results in a great development of mycorrhizas on the tree roots and , in consequence , a great increase in tree growth and vigour . On the other hand , adding a balanced fertiliser , or the nutrient in shortest supply , provided it is not in too short supply , may decrease mycorrhizal development . Mycorrhizas benefit the tree by having a greater ability than the uninfected tree roots to extract plant nutrients , and possibly also water , ' from the soil . This is illustrated in Table 44 which shows how the mycorrhizal association increases the nutrient uptake of pine seedlings compared with uninfected roots growing under comparable conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well supplied with available nutrients , the uninfected roots can take them up quite easily . This last remark may not , however , apply to all trees , for A. L. McComb and J. E. Griffith ' Bound that uninfected roots of Douglas fir had little power to take up even readily available phosphate . Over the greater part of the afforested areas in the world , however , the mycorrhizal association appears to be footnote 1 See R. Paulson ( Trans . Brit . Mycol . Soc. , 1924 , 9 , 213 ) for photographs showing this concentration of mycorrhiza in the leaf litter . s W. N. Jones , Y. Agric . Sci. , 1941 , 31 , 379. s See , for example , A. L.

The root system of many trees that normally carry mycorrhizas are very inefficient extractors of soil phosphates compared with agricultural crops . Thus , A. L. McComb3 found that by adding phosphate to an Iowan prairie soil the growth of jack pine seedlings , as measured by their weight , was increased twenty-eight-fold , whilst that of oats in the same soil was only increased by 8o per cent , and this increase in the jack pine was brought about through the phosphate stimulating a soil-inhabiting fungus to become mycorrhizal . Table 44 also shows that the beneficial action of the mycorrhizas in the two soils there used was mainly through the increased uptake of phosphate they cause.4 The uninfected root systems of the trees are also unable to extract enough nitrogen from soils footnote 1 H.

' Thus tree roots in a well-drained raw humus or mor layer , which is characterised by a low mineral nitrogen content and by a thin layer of high microbial activity , can only obtain an adequate nitrogen supply through the agency of the mycorrhizal fungus ; for the fungus can either extract nitrogen direct from the organic matter or its mycelium , by ramifying through the mor layer , or can take up appreciable amounts of ammonium nitrogen even though it is only present in a very low concentration . On the other hand mull soils , which have a deeper layer of high microbial activity , typically contain an appreciable concentration of nitrate nitrogen , so the trees do not need the fungus for their nitrogen supply and , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only carry a few mycorrhiza . Mycorrhizas possess this ability to extract more nutrients from the soil than the tree roots for several reasons . They have a far larger absorbing surface than the root , for uninfected short roots rapidly become suberised except at their tips , and hence have only very little surface available for absorption , whilst mycorrhizas are not only fatter and more branched , but also delay the onset of suberisation of the root cells . They therefore tend to benefit the tree more towards the end of the season than the beginning by this power of keeping the roots physiologically young , as is shown in Table 44 . Further , fungal hyphae frequently radiate from the mycorrhizas into the soil , which again effectively increases the absorbing area of the root system . These two effects allow the tree to absorb more water from the soil , and hence more nutrients , and this , as suggested by E. Stah12 and A. B. Hatch , 3 may be an important means by which mycorrhizas obtain additional nutrients . Mycorrhizas may also be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three other reasons . Firstly , they can have a higher rate of CO2 production than uninfected roots , and may even excrete organic acids , and each of these effects will increase the solubility of phosphates and also of iron compounds in their neighbourhood , and this effect appears to be more important in acid than in neutral soils.4 Secondly , the fungal component may be able to compete more effectively than can the plant roots with the general microbial population for the nutrients in short supply . Thirdly , if the mycorrhizal fungus can decompose some of the organic matter in the litter , it can extract nutrients directly from it , instead of only using those excreted by the general saprophytic population . footnote 1 E.

They rarely have characteristic root forms ? though the mycorrhizas on ericaceous plants are outstanding exceptions to thist ? so their presence can only be recognised from a microscopic examination of root sections . They may , however , cause dwarfing and profuse branching of the rootlets carried by the main lateral roots of trees.2 The fungi producing this widespread type of mycorrhiza can not easily grow outside the living plant , and have not been observed to form fruiting bodies , nor have their range of host plants been investigated by pure culture inoculations . Hence , practically nothing is known about the number of strains that exist , and only little about their taxonomy.3 The typical fungi are phycomycetes , classified in the genus Rhizophagus , which is probably related to the Endogonaceae . The fungus winters in the soil , attacks the plant roots when growth starts in the spring , and sends hyphae through and around the cortical and epidermal cells , but only rarely into the endodermal cells and practically never into the vascular tissues . The hyphae in some of the cells can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shown in Plate XII , and arbuscules or cauliflower-like organs composed of fine tufts of hyphae , shown in Plate XII , the latter typically occuring in cells near the endodermis . Hence , this group of fungi are often referred to as the vesiculararbuscular type of mycorrhizal fungi . The vesicles seem to be of universal occurrence , both in the cells themselves and in the soil , and are probably storage organs for fatty substances when first formed . Arbuscules are of more erratic distribution ? they are often absent in published descriptions ? and rapidly undergo intracellular digestion as is shown in Plate XII . A third type of intracellular occlusion , known as pelotons , consist of coils or skeins of hyphae , and are illustrated in Plate XII , but these probably more often belong to a weakly parasitic Rhizoctonia than to a true mycorrhizal fungus . Typically , all the infected rootlets have died by the end of the growing season . This association can presumably have the same function as ectotrophic mycorrhizas under some conditions and for some plants , but very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet been demonstrated , for example , that its mycelium extends from the root cells into the soil . It is probably exactly analogous to the ectotrophic for some forest trees , such as the cypress , thuja and yew , among the conifers , and the ash , walnut , sycamore and poplar among the deciduous . footnote 1 For a description of these , see R.

Thomas , ' in Colorado , found it extensively on plants growing above 7,500 feet , but much less commonly below 5,000 feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nutrients , though this can not be deduced from them . G. Samuel2 found it extensively on plants growing in phosphate-deficient soils of South Australia , and it was particularly strongly developed on oats growing in manganese-deficient soils . This association is also commonly found on the roots of a number of trees and shrubs of commercial importance , including the fruit trees , fruit bushes and strawberries of the north temperate regions , and citrus , coffee , tea and rubber in the tropics and sub-tropics , and also on many leguminous plants . Its significance is entirely unknown for most of these crops , though there is no reason to suppose that , when it is beneficial , it differs from ectotrophic mycorrhizas . It does , however , appear to differ in the greater ease with which it can become parasitic ifits host plant loses vigour for any reason . Thus , H. S. Reed and T. Fremont3 found citrus roots in some Californian orchards carried numerous mycorrhizas which were perfectly normal in healthy trees , but were parasitic in trees growing in unfavourable soil conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick cortical layer of cells in their rootlets , such as the clovers , lucerne and peas carried extensive mycorrhizas , which did not appear to affect nodulation early on in the season . But these mycorrhizal rootlets tended to die off before uninfected rootlets , with the consequence that plant growth was brought to a standstill sooner than on those plants not carrying mycorrhizas.5 Thus some varieties of lucerne in Wisconsin made practically no growth in late summer as the larger part of their transient rootlets had become mycorrhizal in late spring and were dead by midsummer , leaving practically no absorbing rootlets to produce late summer growth . The endotrophic mycorrhiza can also be harmful if it weakens the roots sufficiently to allow pathogenic fungi to enter . Peyronel found that the mycorrhizal roots of many plants he examined usually carried a subsequent infection by Rhizoctonia , which are weakly pathogenic soil-inhabiting fungi . Strawberries have furnished an excellent example of this effect .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements : they can usually be grown in pure cultures whereas the mycorrhizal fungi either do not grow at all , or else only very slowly ; they often cause discoloured spots on the outside of the infected root , due to necrosis of the cells they attack , whilst the mycorrhizal fungus merely causes a slight yellowing of these cells ; and their intracellular mycelia do not usually suffer digestion easily , nor do they usually form organs of large surface , such as arbuscules in the cell , though Rhizoctonia may produce pelotons which should be susceptible of digestion , though this only seems to have been described in some orchids , ' which differ from the other mycorrhizal plants by being definitely parasitic on the fungus . footnote 1 D.

They can be divided up into three main groups of material : the cell contents , the reserve food supply , and the cell wall and structural material . The first group is rich in proteins and sugars , and the second in starches , fats and proteins . The third group consists of two fairly distinct materials , the skeletal framework and cementing and encrusting substances . The skeletal framework is built up from cellulose and cellulosan fibres . Pure cotton cellulose consists of chains of glucose residues linked at the i : 4 i3 positions , as shown in Fig. 18 , but structural cellulose also contains some xylose and glucuronic acid residues similarly linked in the glucose residue chain.l The cellulosans of the angiosperms are shorter chains , mainly of xylose and a few uronic acid residues similarly linked , as in Fig. 18 , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their linkage has not been definitely established . The architecture of the skeletal framework is still under discussion ; it is probably built up of micelles containing about a hundred oriented cellulose chains , each containing several hundred glucose residues with up to 20 to 30 per cent by weight of shorter cellulosan chains similarly oriented. 2 The cementing and encrusting material consists of two distinct groups of substances : polymerised sugar units and the lignins . The former predominates in the young shoot but the latter in the mature . Initially the lignin only covers the cell walls and the ouside of the cellulose micelles , but as the tissue matures it may encrust the fibres in the micelle also . The carbohydrates are normally arbitrarily divided into those substances soluble in water or dilute acids ? the pectins , gums and mucilages ? and those soluble in dilute alkali ? the hemicelluloses ? though this group contains some of the cellulosans already mentioned . These substances are built up of either glucose and the corresponding glucuronic footnote 1 A. G. Norman , Biochem. 1936 , 30 , 2054 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 , 281 ; S. P. Saric and R. K.

The lignin of Phenyl propane Gualacyl radicle Syringyl radicle cereal straw has , however , a much lower nitrogen content , o ? 5 per cent being perhaps a typical figure . The lignins of wood have a still lower nitrogen content . Lignins are composed of substituted phenyl-propane groups linked together .

The interpretation of the analytical results is complicated both because of the deficiences in methods of analysis commonly employed , and also because the rotting process includes the synthesis of microbial protoplasm , ) and the excretion of products of microbial metabolism , both of which may react in the same way to the analytical methods as some of the initial plant products . The difficulty can be serious for substances containing uronic acids or yielding furfuraldehyde on acid hydrolysis , i.e. products of the hemicellulose type ; but it is greatest for the organic nitrogen compounds , and no attempt has yet been made to follow the course of their transformations during composting . The general course of the decomposition of cereal straws under normal conditions is reasonably well understood . Initially , the hemicelluloses encrusting the cellulose fibres are strongly attacked , mainly by fungi , and this attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide . The most prominent feature of the attack , once this initial stage is over , is the loss of cellulose , which accounts for the major part of the loss of organic matter . Thus , Norman , ' working with oat straw rotting aerobically under favourable conditions , found that moo gm. of oat straw , containing 23 per cent of free hemicelluloses and 44 per cent of pure cellulose , lost mo gm. of hemicellulose and under m gm. of cellulose in the first four days , an additional 1 ' 5 gm. of hemicellulose and 4 gm. of cellulose in the next four , and an additional 1.2 5 gm. of hemicellulose but 11 gm. of cellulose in the next eight days ; the maximum temperature was reached on the seventh day , but the maximum rate of heat production occurred between the second and sixth days . The reason for the slowing down in the rate of hemicellulose decomposition when only half has disappeared is presumably due to the inhomogeneity of this fraction . Finally , the products of microbial activity appear to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-rotted compost contains little hemicellulose or cellulose , but the relative times taken for these two constituents to fall to a low level depends on circumstances .

The cause of the discrepancy is not known , but may lie in the different methods used to determine cellulose and hemicellulose . The course of the lignin decomposition has not been followed in any great detail because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only decomposes slowly , and its rate of decomposition depends . on its composition and on its admixture with other hemicelluloses ; thus , J. P. Martin and Y. Wane have shown that the lignins in timothy and clover hay appear to decompose more easily than those in oat or maize straw . The importance of the lignin fraction in decomposition lies in the fact that it renders some of the cellulose and possibly other constituents inaccessible to the microflora , hence the higher the lignin content of the material the greater is the proportion of cellulose that is encrusted with lignin and the slower is its decomposition . Thus , 15 per cent of lignin seriously reduces the rate of decomposition of cellulose ; 20 to 30 per cent , as is common in woods , slows up the decomposition so much that they cease to have any agricultural value footnote See , for example , S. A. Waksman and F. C. Gerretsen , Ecology , 1931 , 12 , 33 ; S. A. Waksman and F. G. Tenney , Soil Sci. , 1929 , 28 , 55 ; J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agron. , 1944 , 36 , 373 . Y. Amer .. Soc .

' The course of the decomposition depends on the relative rates at which the heat is produced and dissipated in the initial stages , for these determine the temperatures at which the decomposition takes place , and hence the composition and activity of the microflora . These relative rates are controlled by the decomposability of the substances , the water supply and the aeration ; a moist , loose , well-aerated heap decomposes and produces heat more rapidly than a compacted badly aerated heap , but if the heap is too loose it will also lose its heat rapidly . The effect of the temperature at which decomposition is taking place has not yet been worked out in detail . The general results seem to be that in the temperature range 5 ? to 3o ? C. , 2 the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after it has slowed down the smaller is the loss of organic matter and the higher is the organic nitrogen content of the compost . Low temperatures , in fact , as H. L. Jensen3 has been able to show , directly encourage the accumulation of microbial protoplasm . At very high temperatures , ' in the range 45 ? to 75 ? C. , the loss of organic matter and the organic nitrogen content of the compost both decrease with increasing temperature , probably due to the increasing restriction of the microflora to specialised thermophilic organisms , and to their tendency to attack proteins rather than cellulose . In the range 30 ? to 450 C. , 5 increasing temperature may not have any marked effect on the loss of organic matter , but may allow the organic nitrogen content of the compost to increase . The results are unfortunately not clear cut , and the effect of the maximum temperature reached during decomposition on the properties of composts and manures has not been properly worked out.6 If high temperatures , over 6o ? C. , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed with less loss of organic matter , and that it is more crumbly , contains fewer volatile substances , i.e. has no smell , and has a higher nitrogen content than if the maximum temperature only reached about 4D ?

On the other hand , if the maximum temperature is kept low , ' possibly under 2o ? C. , the loss of organic matter is reduced footnote 1 See , for example , W. H. Fuller and A. G. Norman , 3 .

The nitrogen demands of the microbial population during decomposition are of obvious practical importance . On the whole , material containing less than 1.2 to 1.3 per cent nitrogen , on the dry weight basis , when rotting in the presence of ammonium salts will cause some of the ammonia to , be taken up and converted into organic nitrogen compounds . If the material contains more than 1.8 per cent nitrogen , some of this nitrogen will be converted into ammonia during the rotting process , though if the nitrogen content is not much in excess figure of this , ammonia may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decomposition . Materials with intermediate nitrogen contents , between 1.2 and 1.8 per cent , tend to have no net effect on the level of ammonia during the decomposition , though they also often take up ammonia initially and release it again later.i Fig. 19 , taken from some of H. L. Jensen 's work , 2 illustrates these points . Thus , the rotting of nitrogen-poor plant or animal remains in a soil will lower its content of mineral nitrogen , i.e. ammonium and nitrate ions , whilst the rotting of a nitrogen-rich material will increase it . But these effects depend somewhat on the type of material being rotted , and neither the nitrogen content alone , nor the ratio of the carbon in the material to the nitrogen , is a safe guide to the effect of the rotting process on the mineral nitrogen level in the soil . For an example of this , see N. H. Parberry and R. J. Swaby , Agric . Gaz. , N.S.W. , 1942 , 53 , 357 . I am indebted to Dr. R. J. Swaby for showing me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various materials used . C. N. Acharya et al . ( Indian . Agric . Sci. , 1946 , 16 , 178 ) obtained somewhat similar results . , J. Agric . Sci. , 1929 , 19 , 71.  | An experiment of Waksman and F. G. Tenneyl illustrates these effects well . They added ground-up plant roots of varying nitrogen content to a soil and measured its nitrate nitrogen content during decomposition . They added to 28 lb. of soil sufficient material to contain 600 mgm. of nitrogen , incubated it for three months , then leached the soil well and determined the nitrate nitrogen in the leachates . The results , which are given in Table 46 , show that ground clover roots , with a nitrogen content of 1.7 per cent , contains just about enough nitrogen for its own decomposition , but the other plant roots remove nitrogen from the soil during this process . The nitrogen demands during the rotting of a material can be specified by its nitrogen factor , which is defined as the number of grams of nitrogen , in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of too gm. of the material . The nitrogen factor , however , is not a constant for a given material , but depends somewhat on the conditions prevailing during the decomposition . However , E. H. Richards and A. G. Norman , 2 who introduced it to specify the amount of nitrogen that must be added to heaps of vegetable waste in the field to allow rapid decomposition , found that in farm practice it was sufficiently constant , both during the course of a rot and for a given material rotting in compost heaps under natural conditions , to be of practical value in farm advisory work . In the first place the nitrogen factor is not quite constant during the course of a rot , as is shown both in Table 47 , taken from Richards and Norman 's work , and also by the fact , already mentioned on p. 235 , that materials with a small negative nitrogen factor may remove ammonium and footnote Soil Sci. , 1927 , 24 , 317. 2 Biochem. , 7. , 1931 , 25 , 1769 . Material used  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decomposition and release it later on . In the second place , the nitrogen factor of a given material can not be predicted from its nitrogen content . It is usually higher for natural materials , such as straw , than for pure substances , such as cellulose or straw treated to remove some of its constituents , as is shown in Table 48 . The nitrogen in a material is not all equally available to micro-organisms : they may use ammonium salts , if present , in preference to difficultly available nitrogen I ompounds in the material . Thus , Richards and Norman found that bean husks , which had a nitrogen content of 3 per cent , rot to liberate ammonia in the absence of readily available nitrogen , but immobilise some nitrogen in its presence ( Table 49 ) . The rate of decomposition of a material with a low nitrogen content can be increased considerably if a suitable source of nitrogen is added , fir the nitrogen supply obviously limits the maximum amount of protoplasm that can be present , and , if it is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen may also allow a larger proportion of the carbonaceous organic matter to be converted into microbial protoplasm or its by-products , hence it may increase the proportion of the added organic matter that is converted into humic substances ) . This forms the principle underlying all processes for rapidly obtaining a compost or manure from straw without passing it through a stockyard.2 Since its nitrogen factor is about o ? 8 , at least 18 lb. of nitrogen should be added per ton of straw to ensure its rate of decomposition is not limited by nitrogen shortage . This is commonly added as ammonium sulphate , but any other material rich in nitrogen , for example , urine , animal droppings , dried blood , leguminous hays or young green plant material , is equally suitable . It has been claimed that organic nitrogen compounds give a mellow and friable compost in contrast to inorganic nitrogen compounds , which give a more sticky compost , possibly because the former encourage a greater development of fungi compared to bacteria , but there is little critical evidence for this statement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low nitrogen content is decomposing depends on several factors , not all of which have been well established . For a given carbon and nitrogen content in the decomposing material , the amount of soil nitrogen locked up during the decomposition increases as the speed of decomposition increases . Hence , materials low in lignins typically immobilise more nitrogen than those high in lignins , 3 and decomposition in warm soils immobilises more nitrogen than in cool soils . Thus L. A. Pinck , F. E. Allison and V. L. Gaddy4 found that under Maryland conditions a ton of wheat straw immobilised about 16 to 18 lb. of nitrogen if decomposing during the winter , but between 21 and 28 lb. during the summer .

The process of decomposition may lock up other nutrients besides nitrogen , or be retarded by their lack . The ash of microbial protoplasm may contain up to 25 per cent of phosphorus and 37 per cent of potassium , 2 so that the micro-organisms may compete with growing crops for the available supplies of these nutrients if the soil or the decomposing organic matter is very low in them . I. P. Mamchenko3 has brought forward some evidence that increasing the phosphate supply of material well supplied with nitrogen , such as clover residues , increases the proportion of carbonaceous material converted to humic substances by reducing the proportion respired as carbon dioxide . There is also some evidence that the rate of decomposition of tree leaves depends on the base content of the leaves , 4 though whether this is due simply to the effect of the bases in controlling the pH of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to their nutrient effect on the micro-organisms has not been determined . In conclusion , the conditions favouring rapid decomposition of plant products are : i . The material should have a low lignin , and probably also a low wax , content . 2 . The material should be in as fine a state of comminution as possible ; and it is probable that the principal natural agents bringing this about are the larger soil animals . 3 . There should be an adequate supply of available nitrogen . 4 . The pH should not be allowed to fall too low , otherwise the microbial population becomes unduly restricted and the larger soil animals die out . 5 . The aeration should remain good and the moisture supply adequate . Anaerobic conditions or water-logging lead to a restricted population , mainly bacterial , though the nitrogen demands of the population falls . 6 . The temperature should be fairly high .

The chemical processes of decomposition in the compost heap and the soil differ in two respects : the compost heap is usually not so well aerated , and the temperature of the decomposition can be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of importance in composting are ensuring that the water content and the aeration of the heap are within certain limits : in practice the rate and type of decomposition is controlled by varying the aeration conditions rather than the water content of the heap . If the heap is too dry , too compacted , or too water-logged , little decomposition takes place , and if it is kept moist and loose , decomposition is at its maximum . There appears to be no virtue in rotting down materials in the compost heap compared with letting them rot down in the soil itself as far as adding plant nutrients to the soil or increasing its humus content are concerned . The relative value of the two methods depends on circumstances . One can not always add farmyard manure or waste organic material to the soil when it is available : one must often leave it until it is convenient to put it on the field , and composting is a way of storing these materials until they are required . Again , some soils are naturally very open and free draining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of this open structure . Under these conditions it is much preferable to add wellrotted humic material , for this will tend to reduce the openness of the soil . Again , an important difference between the unrotted plant material and the compost is in physical condition . The unrotted material typically holds little water and is coarse and fibrous ; the compost holds much water and is friable . On light , sandy soils , which in any case are too open for optimum crop growth , a compost is obviously preferable on this score , whilst on some heavy soils the uncomposted material may be better . A third difference lies in the consequence of decomposition . A compost , when added to a soil , continues its decomposition only slowly , whilst unrotted material , particularly if it is rather succulent , begins to decompose rapidly , with the consequence that the carbon dioxide content of the soil air is raised , which may be very beneficial on light soils ( see p. 479 ) ? that is , on just those soils whose physical condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too rapid , however , the carbon dioxide content of the soil air may rise so high , or the nitrates in the soil temporarily fall so low , that plant growth is inhibited .  | A fourth factor , the importance of which has not yet been established , is that rotting a given amount of material in the soil will usually give a larger addition to the humus and nutrient content of the soil than if it is first composted and then added to the soil . Experiments have been made at Rothamsted for a number of years in which a given dressing of straw and nitrogen ploughed into the soil is compared with the same quantity of straw rotted with the same quantity of nitrogen in a compost heap and then applied to the land . The ploughed-in straw has always given a better yield than the compost , as is shown in Table 50 . The cause of the better crop response to the rotting in the soil compared with rotting in the compost heap may be due to losses of nitrogen during the composting process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly one quarter of the nitrogen in a mixed organic refuse , whose C/N ratio was initially 32 , was lost during the first 20 weeks of composting , probably mainly by volatilisation as ammonia , but there was no net loss if some soil was added to the refuse . Presumably the ammonia set free in the decomposition is absorbed by the clay in the soil and then nitrified . Composting has , however , a considerable farm health aspect . It allows many parasitic organisms in the plant and animal material to be destroyed before the residues are put back on the land , and this destruction is more complete the higher the maximum temperature attained and the better the compost has been made . High temperatures have the further advantage that all the weed seeds present are also killed and decomposed . Hence , if possible trouble from either of these footnote 1 Indian J. A , gric . Sic. , 1915 , , 15 , 214 ; 1946 , 16 , 90.  | sources is suspected , good high-temperature composting may be well worth while . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vitamin B complexl and other growth-promoting substances , such as the auxins , 2 has been investigated by many workers , who all find that the amount of these substances in the heap decreases during the course of the decomposition . Composts are , therefore , not rich sources of these substances , but , as has already been mentioned on p. 25 , there is no evidence that any farm crop benefits in any way by increasing the levels of these compounds in the soil . The Micro-organisms involved in the Decomposition of Plant Remains Many species of soil fungi , including members of the Aspergilli , Penicillia and Trichoderma , can decompose natural plant debris in pure culture and have therefore unspecialised food requirements ( Table 51 ) .3 They can readily utilise purified sugars , starches and some hemicelluloses for their energy supply , though many grow better on cellulose in its natural admixture with hemicelluloses than on the highly purified material . None of these fungi in pure culture , however , can decompose plant material as rapidly as can a suitable mixed population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Filamentous fungi can certainly decompose the lignins of straws and leafy plant material , but where lignin-rich residues accumulate , as , for example , on forest floors , the higher basidiomycetes seem to be the dominant decomposers . The fungi attack all the constituents of the plant debris at the same time , and though they can obtain part of their energy supply by decomposing the lignin , most species must also obtain part from more readily . decomposable material . Some hymenomycetes however , such as the mushroom Psalliota ( Agaricus ) campestris , l appear to use lignins in preference to the polysaccharides . G. C. M. Harris2 found that this was also true of Marasmius peronatus when growing in beechwood litter , but this is probably not a general property of this fungus , for G. Lindeberg3 found that it attacked the polysaccharides as well as the lignin of pine litter . The higher hymenomycetes may be very selective in their food requirements , for V. Y. Chastukin4 found that on the forest floor pine twigs and needles and birch twigs and leaves each carried its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to behave like soil fungi , in that they are unspecialised feeders on plant remains , though initially they may not utilise hemicelluloses or celluloses quite as easily as fungi . Norman found those he was working with had relatively little power to decompose purified hemicelluloses , but S. A. Waksman and R. A. Diehm5 worked with some that could be trained to grow readily on these purified substances . The power of bacteria to attack plant constituents depends on the aeration . Under partially anaerobic conditions , many pure cultures of bacteria can attack celluloses and hemicelluloses , either in their natural condition or when purified , provided an adequate supply of organic nitrogen compounds and growth-promoting substances are present . Surprisingly little is known about the number of aerobic bacteria which in pure culture can utilise the cellulose or hemicelluloses of plant remains in their natural state , when provided with growth-. promoting substances and an organic source of nitrogen . Nearly all the work done has been concentrated on a search for aerobes that can utilise purified filter paper for their energy and ammonium salts for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in soils and compost heaps . But direct observation of decomposing plant tissue between crossed nicols shows that the individual colonies of bacteria that attack the birefringent cellular fibres also footnote r S. A.

B. Hutchinson and J. Clayton , 4 but now named Sporocytophaga myxococcoides , 5 which is extraordinarily specialised in its food requirements , for it can only use cellulose or glucose sterilised by ultrafiltration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellulose and related carbohydrates and other members only related carbohydrates . ' Certain members of the soil fauna can digest plant cellulose , and probably also many hemicelluloses , but there is no evidence to suggest any can digest lignin . Termites , for example , are probably more important digesters of cellulose than the micro-organisms in many tropical soils , whilst in temperate soils , though the micro-organisms play the main role , species of nematodes and possibly mites and insects may also be able to feed directly on these polysaccharides . Unfortunately no critical biochemical examination has been made on just what fractions in the ingested food are digested by these saprophytic animals . The relative importance of these various organisms in different natural environments has not been worked out in any great detail . Fungi typically appear to initiate the attack on freshly incorporated plant debris , but their dominance is often short-lived , and their mycelia form a readily available food supply for many bacteria . They remain dominant under aerobic conditions in acid soils , but are replaced by typical cellulose decomposing myxobacteria and true bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always the dominant decomposers . The process of the conversion of plant residues into humus is still not understood . As will be pointed out in Chapter 15 , humus appears to be built out of two groups of material ? oxidised lignin and byproducts of the metabolism of the soil organisms . The outstanding feature of humus formation in soils appears to be the importance of the footnote F. Baker , Zbl . Bakt . II , 1933 , 88 ; with R.

Kubienal has shown , for example , that in earthworm-free soils , humification appears to be confined to the excrements of the different species of animals present , and when earthworms are present their excrements predominate over that of all others . The products of microbial metabolism include microbial cell-wall components such as polyuronide gums and other polysaccharides , as well as lignin- and humic-like substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also produce polyuronide gums , particularly if they are working under conditions of limited nitrogen supply ; 2 for they may have to attack a large amount of polysaccharide to extract sufficient nitrogen for their growth ; and since it is nitrogen and not energy supply that is limiting their growth , they have to excrete energy-rich by-products . Some fungi produce dark-coloured products similar to cc-humus ( see p. 257 ) when growing on cellulose and other lignin-free plant products.3 Some bacteria may also produce such products , both from the easily decomposable components in recently dead plant tissue , 4 and also from the mycelia of the fungi that originate the attack on the more resistant plant remains.5 Green Manuring Plant residues can be applied direct to the soil instead of via the compost or manure heap , and the usual method of doing this is to plough in a growing crop . This method of green manuring can have several effects on the soil , depending on conditions : it may increase the organic matter content of , or the available nitrogen in , the soil ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it may concentrate nutrients likely to be deficient in the surface soil and leave them there in a readily available form . Green manuring normally can not confer all these benefits on the soil simultaneously , and it may confer none of them . Green manuring , when properly used , can either increase the humus content or else the supply of available nitrogen in the soil , but rarely can it do both at the same time , and therein it differs from well-made farmyard manure , for the humus content only appears to be increased footnote 1 Ztschr .

Thus , the effect of a given crop as a green manure depends on its maturity when ploughed under . Table 521 illustrates this point for rye .  | Young rye decomposes rapidly with a large production of carbon dioxide , and consequently leaves little residue but much nitrate nitrogen , whilst mature rye decomposes much slower , leaving a large residue and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This conclusion has recently been questioned by F. E. Allison and his co-workers . ' They concluded that the proportion of carbon added in a green manure crop that gets converted to resistant humic material only depends on the amount of added carbon and not on the stage of maturity of the green crop . On this view immature green manure crops add little carbon to the soil compared with mature crops because of the much smaller weight of carbon they contain when ploughed under . But this conclusion is based on experiments made by adding the green manure to pots containing only 20 lb. of soil and growing five crops of sudan grass or wheat ? experiments in which the root residues of the crops per pound of soil would be far higher than in the field ? and it was not possible to allow for the contribution made by these resistant root residues to the resistant humic material in the soil . Hence their conclusions may not apply to green manuring in the field . Green manuring has , in most parts of the world , been applied more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humus content of soils . It is , however , only widely practised under certain definite conditions . The crop must be grown as a catch crop between the main cash crops , and consequently the practice is commonly commended in regions where the winters are sufficiently mild and moist to allow the crop to grow during this period . The crop must not compete with the main crops in any way , and in particular not for water , so that this system is not used under dry-farming conditions . Hence , regions having a long growing season , such as regions with mild winters and with a well distributed rainfall , or else an adequate irrigation system , are well suited to green manure crops . The practice is prevalent in the humid tropics and sub-tropics , and in orchards when the growing season extends into the dormant period of the trees ; it is also extensively advocated in the south-eastern states of the U.S.A. , where maize and cotton , both summer crops , are the two main cash crops , and where legumes will grow during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saline soils , because in comparison with fallow , they reduce the evaporation from , and hence the salt content in , the surface soil , for they take their water from the subsoil and shade the surface . Further , when they are ploughed in , their residues will help to increase the availability of phosphates and trace elements to the succeeding crop due to the lowering of the soil pH footnote 1 I ..

Leguminous crops , such as some vetches , peas and clovers , are commonly used for green manuring as they increase the soil 's supply of nitrogen . But these crops will normally only make adequate growth and fix enough nitrogen to make their cultivation worth while if the soil contains an adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the need for this is given in Table 53,1 taken from some experiments made on a soil with pH 5.5 in Mississippi . In this example 28 and 56 lb. of nitrogen in the green manure gave rather more cotton than 18 and 34 lb. of nitrogen in a mixed fertiliser . The nitrogen liberated during the decomposition of the green manure crop can only benefit the subsequent crop if the latter is sufficiently developed to take up the nitrogen soon after it is released and before the nitrate produced is leached out of the soil ; and this period is fairly short , particularly in light soils under warm moist conditions , as the protein of the living green plant decomposes more rapidly than does that in dried or dead plant material . Hence , a long , wet period between the ploughing-in of a green manure crop and the establishment of the following crop , particularly on light soils , can result in much of footnote 1 C. D. Hoover , Proc . Soil Sci . Soc . Amer. , 1942 , 7 , 283.  | the nitrifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil with the consequence that the following crop obtains little , if any , benefit from the green manure . ' On the other hand , the main crop should not be sown too soon after the green crop has been turned in , as the period covering the first flush of decomposition is very unfavourable for germination and the growth of very young plants . Green manures do not usually increase the humus content of the soil , and in this respect differ from farmyard manure . Thus , C. A. Mooers2 found that in a twenty-year experiment in which cow-peas were grown as an autumn catch crop in a continuous winter wheat experiment , the organic matter content of the soil decreased by o ? 1 i pe'r cent , or by about a ton an acre over the twenty-year period on the plots in which the cowpeas , yielding about a ton of dry matter per acre , had been ploughed under and increased by about o ? 11 per cent on the plots which received 4 tons of farmyard manure , also containing about a ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow-pea dry matter , however , reduced the loss of humus from the soil , for the humus content fell by 0.24 per cent on other plots that did not receive either farmyard manure or green manure . Hence , about 20 tons of cow-pea dry matter reduced the humus loss by about 2,600 lb. , whilst 20 tons of farmyard manure dry matter reduced it by 7,000 lb . Green manuring is relatively ineffective for two reasons . In the first place , as already noted , immature green plant tissue decomposes more rapidly , leaving less residue , than farmyard manure . But there is an additional effect , for adding an easily decomposable material to a soil so stimulates the soil organisms that they not only attack the readily decomposable material , but they also decompose in the process some of the more resistant organic matter in the soil . This effect has been unequivocally established by F. E. Broadbent3 using sudan grass as a green manure whose tissues contained a measureable amount of heavy carbon C13 and heavy nitrogen N15 . He added some of this material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of carbon dioxide given off and ammonium and nitrate nitrogen liberated , and from the C13 and N15 contents of these products calculated what fraction of each was derived from the humic matter in the soil . His results are given in Table 54 , and further results are quoted on p. 267 , which show that the presence of the decomposable sudan grass has caused the rate of production of carbon dioxide from the humic matter in the soil to increase threefold , and of mineral nitrogen twofold . This effect footnote See E. M. Crowther in Fifty Tears of Field Experiments at the Woburn Experimental Station , by E. J. Russell and J. A. Voelcker , for a discussion of the causes of the failure of the Woburn Green Manuring Experiment to benefit the soil or the succeeding crop . 2 Tennessee Agric . Expt .

These benefits may be of particular benefit in deciduous orchards , for they have a long dormant season . The practical difficulties in growing these off-season cover crops for green manuring are to get them established without interfering with harvesting or competing with the trees for nutrients before harvest , and to manage them so they are not killed prematurely by the winter sprays and washes used . ' Ploughing in a green crop can have another function that has barely been examined yet . It is possible that the best way of ploughing in straw is to under-sow the corn crop with a green manure crop , probably a legume , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the succeeding crop appears to be enhanced . F. C. Bauer ' has given the results of an experiment in Illinois on the three-course rotation , maize-oats-wheat , in which the effect of under-sowing the wheat with sweet clover and returning the straw to the wheat stubble was investigated . The results for the first twelve years of the experiment were : footnote 1 For an example of their management in English orchards , see W. S. Rogers and Th . Raptopoulos , .7 .

It is a common practice far farmers in several parts of the world who crop their land fairly continuously with a corn or maize crop to under-sow the crop with a legume . Thus , wheat growers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made both to seed itself for the following year and to provide a hay crop ; and Iowan farmers often sow sweet clover or vetch in their maize ) . English corn growers on chalk and light land soils often under-sow their wheat or barley with trefoil , which not only helps to control " take-all " ( Ophiobolus graminis ) in the corn , but also helps to rot down the straw ; for these farmers commonly harvest their corn by combine and plough in the straw . The straw is pressed into the trefoil with a ring roll , and wherever it touches the ground it decomposes , hence it can be ploughed under more easily . The trefoil thus not only helps the straw to decompose while on top of the ground , possibly by keeping the soil surface damp , but also supplies nitrogen for its decomposition when it is ploughed under . Green manuring can take another form in the humid tropics for bush crops such as coffee and tea . Here either the crops may be grown under leguminous shade trees , 2 such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sau ) , for example ; or leguminous shrubs , such as species of Tephrosia , may be interplanted between the bushes . These trees and shrubs are lopped several times a year and the green loppings spread around the bushes and perhaps worked into the surface soil . By this means i o tons or more of green material , containing possibly up to 6o lb. of nitrogen per ton and rich in bases , 3 are provided as a green manure or a surface mulch . This helps to keep the surface layers of the soil , which contain most of the feeding roots of these bushes , footnote 1 I am indebted to Dr. A. G. Norman for this information . 2 See , for example , C. R. Harler , The Culture and Marketing of Tea , Oxford , 1933 , for a short description of this practice . H. E.

Russel found that the nitrate nitrogen content of a soil was about 10 per cent less under a mulch of sweet clover than when it was ploughed The Decomposition of Green Manures under Water-logged Conditions : Paddy Soils The course of decomposition of plant residues depends on the aeration of the medium in which they are decomposing , and though in temperate agriculture , decomposition usually takes place under aerobic or slightly anaerobic conditions , yet under some tropical conditions , such as in wet rice or paddy fields , decomposition occurs under water-logged or fairly strongly anaerobic conditions . The main effect of restricting the oxygen supply during decomposition is to encourage the production of organic acids , such as lactic , butyric and acetic , and of gases such as methane and hydrogen , which are themselves probably the decomposition products of the volatile acids under anaerobic conditions . The typical nitrogen end-product of anaerobic decomposition is ammonia , though if alternate oxidising and reducing conditions occur , nitrogen may be set free from the reduction of nitrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 , illustrate the effects of increasingly severe anaerobic conditions on the rotting of rice straw and on the volume of gas produced . In one set of experiments , he allowed rice straw to decompose at 30 ? C. for six months , and compared the gas production when the decomposition was strictly anaerobic all the time with that when air was admitted either over the top of the rotting material ( moderate anaerobic ) or bubbled through it for five minutes ( mild anaerobic conditions ) once a week . Table 55 shows that increasing the strictness of anaerobic conditions causes the amount of methane given off to increase , of carbon dioxide to decrease , and the hydrogen first to increase and then to decrease , whilst the loss of dry matter and also the disappearance of cellulose , pentosan and lignin is almost unaffected , though losses are higher under aerobic conditions . The table also shows that decreasing the oxygen supply decreases the nitrogen factor , that is , the amount of ammonium nitrogen immobilised : it decreased from 0.54 for aerobic to 0.07 for strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agric. , 1948 , 40 , 11 .

Paddy soils are water-logged for much of the year but the water should not be stagnant ; the soil 's permeability should be sufficiently controlled by puddling to allow a slow percolation of water through it , and the land should be adequately drained to let this water get away . W. H. Harrison and P. A. S. Aiyeri showed that the principal gas produced in these water-logged soils during the decomposition of green crops was methane with only small amounts of carbon dioxide , hydrogen and perhaps nitrogen , and the gases in the water above the soil are almost entirely oxygen and nitrogen . In the first place , they showed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the surface layers of the soil . It contained both bacteria that oxidised methane to carbon dioxide and algae that fixed the carbon dioxide photosynthetically and respired oxygen . Hence , the effect of green manuring under these conditions is to produce oxygenated water , which by percolating slowly through the soil keeps the rice roots supplied with oxygen ; and this appears to be the principal means by which rice roots obtain their oxygen . Harrison later2 put forward an explanation of why the soil gases were so unexpectedly rich in methane and poor in hydrogen and carbon dioxide , for he showed that there were bacteria in the soil that could utilise hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide : a reaction which supplied the bacteria both with energy and a source of carbon , which removed 1.5 to 3.5 parts of hydrogen for every part of carbon dioxide reduced , footnote ' India Dept . Agric . Mein. , Chem . Ser. , 1913 , 3 , 65 ; 1914 , 4 , i . 2 India Dept . Agric . Mein. , 1920 , 5 , 18r.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a reaction of great importance for the oxygen regime around the rice roots , for it not only reduces the carbon dioxide content around them , which in itself reduces their oxygen needs , but also removes hydrogen in a way that makes a much lower demand on the oxygen in the soil water than would be made by the hydrogen-oxidising bacteria which he and Aiyerl showed were present in the soil . The nitrogen regime in water-logged soils has not been fully worked out . Nitrates are reduced to ammonia and gaseous nitrogen via nitrites , and nitrites themselves may accumulate sufficiently to be toxic to crops ; consequently nitrate fertilisers are not used on paddy soils.2 Most organic nitrogen compounds decompose to yield ammonia , but it is not certain if gaseous nitrogen is ever produced during these decompositions : its production is usually characteristic of systems with a widely fluctuating oxygen supply in which nitrates are produced during the aerobic periods and reduced during the anaerobic . Thus ammonia is the typical form of inorganic nitrogen and the typical by-product of bacterial metabolism under water-logged conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as green manures that break down readily to give ammonium salts , are the typical nitrogen fertilisers for these soils . It is possible , however , that if the ammonium concentration reaches too high a level in the soil some may be lost by volatilisation from the soil 's surface under tropical conditions.3 footnote 1 India Dept .

Sci. , 1935 , 25 , 6.  | THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL ORGANIC MATTER The Fractionation of the Soil Humus THE COMPOSITION OF the soil organic matter , and in particular of the soil humus , has exercised the minds of soil chemists from the very beginning . The soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from undecayed plant and animal tissues through ephemeral products of decomposition to fairly stable amorphous brown to black material bearing no trace of the anatomical structure of the material from which it was derived ; and it is this latter material that is normally defined as the soil humus . The great difficulty in all investigations on the composition of soil humus has been that it can not all be separated from the unhumified material . The methods used either separate out only certain fractions or else decompose the humus and separate out compounds which are really artefacts and not present in the soil itself . The early soil chemists were interested in humus . The work was begun by F. K. Achardl in 1786 and by C. Vaquelin2 in 1797 , who found that some of it could be extracted by alkali after the soil had first been treated with an acid . The work was continued by C. Sprengel3 a most successful early investigator in agricultural chemistry , who in 1826 had carried his studies so far that little was added during the next hundred years . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places where bases are lacking from the less acid " mild humus " formed in soils in presence of basic material ; the " acid " is much more stable than the " mild " form , being less easily decomposed to carbon dioxide and water . He prepared " humic acid " by extracting the peat with dilute hydrochloric acid for two hours to remove all bases , washing with water , then extracting with a solution of ammonia in a closed vessel , finally adding to the solution hydrochloric acid to precipitate the humus . It did not , however , come down pure , but contained both clay and ferric hydroxides ; it was therefore redissolved in sodium carbonate solution , filtered and precipitated from the filtrate by cold hydrochloric acid . footnote 1 Crells Chem . Ann. , 1786 , 2 , 391 . For a detailed account of the history of humus chemistry , see the admirable summary of the literature in S. A. Waksman , Humus , 2nd ed. , London , 1938. 2 Ann .

'  | It was now nearly free from ash constituents : it was black , and when washed free from acid dissolved slightly in water ; on electrolysis it travelled to the positive pole , being thus electro-negative like other acids . It formed salts with bases : soluble ones with alkalis , and insoluble ones with alkaline earths and heavy metals . It liberated carbon dioxide from carbonates and silicic acid from soluble silicates ; further , it combined with clay and with iron oxide . When dried , it became shiny black , easily pulverised , and highly absorbent of water , but it was now quite insoluble in water . A similar substance was prepared from woody tissues and plant residues by treatment with potassium hydroxide solution in presence of air ? the oxygen being supposed to play some part . The original method of separating the humus from the soil was based on the power of alkalis , and in particular of sodium hydroxide , to disperse much of this organic matter , and the further fractionation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids and by partial solution in alcohol . The divisions thus made are given in the following diagram :  | O. Schreiner and E. C. Shorey ( S and S ) 1 and A. Schmuck ( S ) .2 These fractions are not , however , pure chemical compounds , and are colloidal sols when dispersed . The following names are still in common use ; humin for the fraction insoluble in alkali ; humic acid for that soluble in alkali but insoluble in acid ; and fulvic acid for that soluble in both alkali and acid . However , humic acid has sometimes been defined as that part of the alkali-soluble acid-insoluble fraction that is insoluble in alcohol . Then the name a-humus has been used for the original fraction . The German workers3 have recently been making extensive use of a modification of this scheme , in which the unhumified organic matter is removed from the soil by treating it with acetyl bromide.4 They consider this reagent only dissolves undecomposed plant material and readily decomposable intermediate products without dissolving any humified material , though it may be necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plant and insect remains to dissolve in it . The chemistry of the reaction has not been fully established ; it is probable that acetyl bromide produces more highly acetylated compounds from undecomposed plant remains than from humified material , and it is these strongly acetylated compounds , rather than the original carbohydrates and lignins , that are dissolved . But this division is arbitrary in that there is no sharp division between unhumified and humified matter , particularly for those materials derived from lignin , and in fact the proportion of the organic matter dissolved can be varied , though usually only within fairly narrow limits , by varying the pre-treatment given to the soil . Springer also introduced a division of the alkali soluble humus into brown and grey humic acids based on the greater sensitivity of some humic components to flocculation by electrolytes than others . The less sensitive brown humic acids are dispersed in 5 per cent caustic soda solution , which is strong enough to keep the grey humic acids flocculated . They give a brown solution which lightens on standing , and corresponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are subsequently dispersed in water appear always to be accompanied by larger quantities of brown , and give grey-brown to black solutions which keep their colour on standing , and this colour can be distinguished chromatographically from the brown without difficulty ; 5 it is probably the characteristic component of Sprengel 's mild humus. footnote 1 U.S. Dept .

This line of thought has recently been developed into a scheme for dividing the soil organic matter up on the basis of what function it plays in the soil rather than of what it is chemically . Thus the Germans ' have introduced the concepts of stable humus ( Dauerhumus ) which only decomposes slowly in the soil and corresponds approximately with the acetyl-bromide-insoluble fraction ; of nutrient humus ( Nahrhumus ) , which decomposes readily and consists of such substances as carbohydrates and proteins , and which corresponds approximately to the fraction soluble in 8o per cent sulphuric acid ; and of reserve humus , which is the dead but undecomposed plant and animal remains that will shortly be converted into the other two types . Another approach to the separation and recognition of the types of material present in the soil organic matter , that has been much used in America , is one developed by Waksman . His method is based on estimating recognisable groups of plant constituents , such as fats , hemicelluloses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes no attempt to determine any group of compounds specific to the humic fraction . His scheme of extractions is as shown on the opposite page . ' He can thus account for about 90 to 95 per cent of the carbon in most soils , but 70 to 8o per cent is in the two large vague groups , soil protein and lignin-humus  --  the first being obtained by assuming all the nitrogen in the sulphuric acid insoluble organic matter is in the form of protein and the latter by assuming all the residual carbon , ' U.

But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances only ? at least , not in their simple form ? for a considerable proportion of the nitrogen in the soil organic matter may be soluble in the hydrochloric and sulphuric acids . Still another approach to the fractionation of humic matter in the soil has been made available by an important observation of J. M. Bremner et al.l They treated soils with neutral solutions of the sodium salts of acids that form co-ordination compounds with calcium and other metallic ions , and found that after this treatment a proportion of the organic matter would disperse in water . The sodium salts of pyrophosphoric , oxalic and citric acids were all about equally efficient , and since the latter two are organic , they are not so suitable as the pyrophosphate . Bremner was later able to show that some of the material dispersed in sodium hydroxide is produced by alkaline hydrolysis of more complex compounds , some of which suffer autoxidation during the process ; hence a proportion of the material dispersed in sodium hydroxide is to this extent an artefact . The various humic fractions obtained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they would not be expected to have the same chemical composition when extracted from different soils . Naturally , they are mainly composed of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and hydrogen , with varying quantities of ash constituents . If the ash content of the organic matter is high , it will principally consist of aluminium and iron oxides and silica ; whilst if it is low , the usual ash constituents of plants will be present in about their normal proportions . Ash analysis is not often carried out , as there footnote Nature , 1 ! ) 16 , 158 , 790.  | are no definitive methods for deciding what part of the ash in a given sample of organic material was a constituent of the organic material , what part was due to any inorganic-organic complexes , and what to contamination of the sample with inorganic soil colloids that had not been properly separated from the organic matter during its preparation . The Composition and Formation of Humus The problems of the composition and formation of humus should be distinct , but owing to our very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition are bound up with those of its formation . The outstanding difference between the carbon compounds in plant residues and in the humic matter of the soil is in the relative importance of cellulose , which is abundant in plant residues , but lacking in wellhumified material . However , a proportion of the carbon in most soils appears to be in pentose and hexose units , mainly xylose and glucose , occurring either as hexosans and pentosans or else as polyuronides based on glucuronic acid . ' But over half the carbon is usually in compounds not based on these units , much of the remainder probably being based on the lignin unit . The humic matter in the soil appears to be derived from two main sources ? the lignins in the plant residues added to the soil , and the products of microbial metabolism , either actual excretions from the living cells , or else structural elements of the cells which are returned to the soil on their decomposition . The relative importance of these two sources are not known , unless the carbon compounds based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metabolism , nor has it yet been rigorously proved that these two sources constitute the predominant part of the humic fractions , though on present evidence this is sufficiently likely to be assumed in this discussion . The lignins alone can not be the sole source of humic material , for W. Sauerlandt has calculated that in normal arable soils the rate of oxidation of humic matter is greater than the rate at which lignins are added to the soil . The conversion of lignin to humic matter involves two processes : an oxidation and an enrichment in nitrogen . The oxidation processes can be followed very roughly as their effect is to increase the number of carboxylic acid ( ? COOH ) groups . This oxidation takes place spontaneously in the presence of air in an alkaline medium , 2 and it ' footnote ' W. G. C. Forsyth , Chem . Indust. , 1948 , 515. 2 For examples of the uptake of oxygen by lignin and partially humified materials , see E. C. Shorey , 1T.S . Dept. .4 ric. , ' Tech .

The effect of this oxidation is that both the base exchange capacity of the material at pH 71 and the amount of nitrogen fixed from an ammonia solution2 increase linearly with the amount of oxygen absorbed . Mattson showed that this reaction is not confined to lignin ; other polyphenols , such as resorcinol , hydroquinone , gallic and tannic acid react in the same way . Further , W. Laatsch3 has shown that actinomycetes in particular , but fungi also , produce quinone and related compounds that behave much like lignin to give , on further autoxidation in the presence of amines and amino acids , substances very similar to soil humus , though these conversions were usually done by the micro-organisms in the course of their metabolism . Finally N. H. S. van Reesema4 has shown that these autoxidised nitrogen-enriched humic-like compounds are very resistant to decomposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the changes that take place as lignin is converted into humic matter . On the one hand , A. G. Norman and his co-workers5 have shown that the base exchange capacity of lignin increases , and its power of taking oxygen from hypoiodite solution decreases , as the decomposition of the plant material , of which the lignin forms a part , proceeds . On the other hand , the effect of the transformation can be determined from its effect on the number of acetyl ( ? CO.CH3 ) , methoxyl ( ? O.CH3 ) and carboxyl ( ? COOH ) groups , on the number of hydroxyl groups that can dissociate hydrogen ions and so act as acids , and on the number of hydroxyl groups that can be acetylated and methylated . Some results of W. S. Gillam6 illustrate the type of information that can be obtained . He used humic acid , i.e. the alkali-soluble acid-insoluble fraction , in the diagram on p. 256 , separated from a prairie , a chernozem and a chestnut soil , analysed them for carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen and oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , their base exchange capacity up to pH 7 , and their buffer curves before and after acetylation and methylation . The object of using these two processes is to replace many of the hydroxyl groups by acetyl or methoxyl groups , so preventing them acting as weak acids by dissociating hydrogen ions . The effect of this treatment on the buffer curve of one of his humic acids can be seen in Fig. 20 , which is redrawn from his paper . At the same footnote 1 H.

It also involves a loss of hydroxyls that can be methylated , due , at least in part , to their oxidation to carboxyls and , in the very early stages of the process , a loss of methoxyls . This work has been extended by W. G. C. Forsyth . ' He fractionated the humic acid fraction by dilute acid hydrolysis into two parts , which he found were present in roughly equal proportions . The hydrolysable part he considered to be composed primarily of carbohydrates and proteins , and the residual humic acid part carries the organic groups already described . This humic acid can be brought into solution completely by nitration , it is quite insoluble in acetyl bromide , and can be reduced to a pale yellow preparation which darkens again on exposure to air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that methylation , acetylation and esterification did not affect its nitrogen content , which suggests the nitrogen occurs as a constituent part of the molecule . The carbohydrates appear to be merely mixed with the humic acid and not chemically combined with it , for a proportion of them can be removed from the humic acid by solvents such as pyridine . The fulvic acids , that is , the alkali-soluble acid-soluble fraction of the organic matter , are present in about the same proportion as the humic acid . G. J. Mulder2 showed they were poorer in carbon but richer in oxygen than humic acid : they contained about 45 per cent of each instead of around the 55 and 35 per cent of humic acid . I. V. Tiurin3 confirmed these results , though found their exact composition depends on the soil type . He further showed that on acid hydrolysis they yielded i o per cent of pentosans and 20 per cent uronic acid , yet they have about the same nitrogen content and base exchange capacity as the humic acid . Recently Forsyth ' has separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique , and has been able to clarify these findings . One fraction , usually only present in small quantities , contains water-soluble organic compounds such as sugars and amino acids . A second contains phenolic glycosides or tannins . A third is a polyuronide based on glucuronic acid and containing d-glucose , d-xylose , 1-rhamnose and another sugar , and seems to have a characteristic composition independent of the soil from which it has been extracted , and is probably of bacterial origin . The fourth fraction is rich in nitrogen , and it contains pentose sugars and organic phosphates. footnote 21gric .

Bremner , ' using the much milder neutral pyrophosphate treatment instead of alkali for dispersing the humic and fulvic fractions , found that the pyrophosphate method gave the same general groups of components in the fulvic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the treatment used . Hence his work indicates that at least some of them may be artefacts produced by hydrolysis and other side-reactions of the original humic material in the sodium hydroxide solution used for dispersion . The third group of substances in the humic matter are the humins which will not disperse in caustic soda . The gross composition of this fraction is intermediate between that of the fulvic and humic acids , and it is possible that part at least may be a polymerisation product of some fulvic with some humic fraction.2 But they also contain undecomposed or partially decomposed plant and microbial residues , and Forsyth3 has found that up to 40 per cent of this fraction may be carbohydrates containing glucose , xylose and glucosamine residues . The conclusions reached from the study of the composition of the various humic fractions can be amplified a little from the results of a few analyses made on the unfractionated organic matter . The two that are most relevant concern the possibility of polyuronides and proteins being present . E. C. Shorey and J. B. Martin " and A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between i o and 30 per cent of the organic carbon in the soil is present as polyuronides . Neither group of workers have isolated uronic acids from the soil , but they based their conclusion on the assumption that the carbon dioxide liberated from the organic matter when it is boiled with 12 per cent hydrochloric acid came from the decomposition of the uronic acids , as in our present state of knowledge this is the only probable source of carbon dioxide recognised in the soils Forsyth 's actual isolation of a glucuronic acid polymer from the soil shows that they are present , but it has not yet been proved experimentally that they really are present in the amounts indicated by the carbon dioxide evolution test . It is possible these polyuronide gums constitute the active humus of Geltser ( p. 417 ) , and the humic-like substances that M. M. Kononova7 working with lucerne roots and W. Sauerlandt8 with straw found were  | produced in the early stages of the decay of the plant tissues before the lignin had begun to be attacked . However , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early products of decomposition has not yet been investigated . The analysis of the nitrogen compounds in the soil has not progressed very far . In most soils only 2 to 3 per cent is in the form of nitrate and ammonia , and the rest is in organic combinations which are very resistant to decomposition . Some of the compounds containing the nitrogen in the soil can be recognised by hydrolysing the soil organic matter with hot mineral acids , such as 20 per cent hydrochloric . By this means R. T. Kojimal showed that about one-quarter of the nitrogen is in combinations that are not brought into solution during hydrolysis , about one-third appears as a-amino acids , one-tenth as ammonia , leaving about one-fifth present in solution in other forms , and J. M. Bremner2 has carried the analysis a little further by showing that at least one third of the nitrogen in the humic acid fraction and one-fifth of that in the fulvic acid is liberated as a-amino acids . The a-amino acids are derived from the hydrolysis of proteins , so that at least onethird of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the ammonia liberated during the hydrolysis may come from acid amide residues of proteins , such as asparagine and glutamine . If it is assumed that all the ammonia liberated has come from these amides then about half the soil nitrogen would be present as proteins . Kojima3 has made some estimates of the types of amino acids present in an organic soil and finds that leucine , isoleucine and valine account for about one-third , the hydroxy-carboxylic amino acids about one-fifth , and the di-carboxylic amino acids about one-quarter of the total amino nitrogen . Aspartic , glutamic and probably hydroxyglutamic acids accounted for about one-half of the di-carboxylic amino acids . The compounds that yield ammonia on acid hydrolysis have not all been identified , but some may be derived from amino sugars in compounds such as mucopolysaccharides . " Amino sugars have an amino group attached to the ring in the hexose unit , and the ones that have received most attention are those found in the animal world . These are 2-amino sugars , such as 2-amino glucose ( glucosamine ) and 2-amino galactose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungi is built out of acetyl glucosamine residues . It has not yet been proved if 2-amino sugars yield ammonia on acid hydrolysis , as those that have been investigated do not , though other amino sugars do . 5 I3remners has shown that both 2-amino sugars and acetylated 2-amino footnote 1 Soil Sci. , 1947 , 64 , 157. 2 Y.

Further evidence is accumulating that many groups of soil micro-organisms produce amino sugars either in gums they secrete or in their cell walls . ' All the nitrogen in the fulvic acid , but only about half that in the humic acid fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the humic acid fraction , namely , that attached to the lignin nucleus , is in combinations that have not yet been identified ; they are not removed by methylation or nitration and are presumably similar to those in which it is held in plant lignins ( see p. 231 ) . Mattson has , however , shown that the maximum nitrogen content of the lignin nucleus increases with its degree of oxidation , that is , with the number of carboxyl groups it contains . One of the fundamental problems in the theory of the composition of soil humus has been to account for the great resistance of the nitrogen compounds to microbial attack ; for they were early assumed to be proteins , and recent work has confirmed that at least one-third of the nitrogen is present in this form . Yet all known proteins are readily attacked when added to the soil . Presumably either the soil protein is inaccessible to microbial attack , being protected by a lignified or humified mantle , or else the hydrolysable groups on the protein are so protected . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the cause of this stability was that humus is an association between lignin and proteins synthesised by the micro-organisms , and this suggestion was revived independently by H. J. Page and R. P. Hobson4 and by S. A. Waksman and K. R. N. Iyer.6 Page and Hobson showed that alkaline lignin solutions can be partially oxidised with ease , and in this state can readily combine with proteins to form stable complexes . Waksrnan and Iyer suggested the reaction was similar to a tanning process , the hydroxyls of the lignins condensing with the amino groups of the protein , and they showed that such compounds were resistant to further decomposition . But these theories will not account for the stability of the proteins in the fulvic acid fraction , for this contains no lignins . It is possible that these proteins are held as exchangeable bases on the surface of clay particles , or even perhaps by the carboxyls of the humic acid , for L. E. Ensminger and J. E Gieseking6 showed that proteins so held were resistant to hydrolysis , presumably because the hydrolysable groups in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnote 1 J. P.

But it is still very uncertain if this is an adequate description of why the soil organisms are unable to readily utilise the available energy stored in the soil proteins . The corresponding problem arises about the uronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as pectin and alginic acid , decompose fairly readily . The answer may lie simply in the constitution of the soil uronic acids , for W. H. Fullers has shown that they are probably by-products of microbial decomposition and have different properties and therefore a different constitution from the plant polyuronides . The cause of the resistance of the soil organic matter to microbial attack is still very obscure . Recent work of F. E. Broadbent and A. G. Norman2 using isotopic nitrogen N15 and carbon C13 compounds , has established the rather unexpected result that merely adding decomposable organic matter to the soil causes a considerable increase in the rate of decomposition of the soil organic matter present , as has already been shown in Table 54 on p. 250 . As a further example of their results , in another experiment they added 1 and 2 gm. respectively of sudan grass to 10o gm. of soil , incubated the soil for eleven days and measured the CO2 produced , and since 2.67 per cent of the carbon in the sudan grass was C13 , they could compute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil organic matter . They found that 49 mgm. of CO2 were produced from the organic matter when the soil was incubated by itself , but that 216 and 329 mgm. were produced from it when 1 and 2 gm. of sudan grass were added . At the same time 418 and 651 mgm. of CO2 were produced from the decomposition of the sudan grass . Thus , for about every ioo mgm. of CO2 produced from the sudan grass by the soil micro-organisms , an additional 40 mgm. is produced from the soil organic matter . So far no quantitative reasons can be given of why the soil organic matter becomes a better source of food for the soil population in the presence than in the absence of readily decomposable organic matter . There are many important practical consequences of this result , if it is of general validity . Thus , if the rate of oxidation of straw or similar organic matter in the soil is being limited by lack of nitrogen , adding a nitrogen fertiliser , by increasing the rate of oxidation of the straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic matter in the soil , and hence also the release of soil nitrogen ? a result verified by Broadbent and Norman in laboratory experiments and by H.

This is in accord with observation , for green manuring has often been found to be incapable of maintaining or increasing the organic matter content of the soil , though it may be an excellent way of adding nitrogen compounds to the soil . Further , this additional decomposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon dioxide and nitrates , but also phosphates and other minerals locked up in the soil organic matter , and it may be that this phosphate is as important as the phosphate in the green manure itself for the nutrition of the crop . Two aspects of the present theory of humic acid formation from the oxidation of lignin with the corresponding uptake of ammonia , have not yet been examined in detail . The first concerns the consequences of the lignin oxidation , and the second the place where it occurs . The greater the degree of oxidation the greater the number of carboxylic acid groups formed , and , hence , unless adequate bases are present the acidity of the organic matter will increase . Further , this oxidised material carries a higher negative charge , and hence may be more easily dispersible . There appears to be evidence that these consequences may be of practical importance in the liming of some acid peats , for if an inadequate supply of lime is given it may lead to a lowering of the soil 's pH and an increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence , the recommendation that enough lime should be added to ensure that the soil is brought through the range pH 4.5-6 as quickly as possible . ' Mattson2 has discussed other consequences of this reaction . Thus chernozem humus , being produced under neutral or slightly alkaline conditions , should be more oxidised and so have a higher base exchange capacity and a higher nitrogen content than podsol humus , which is formed under acid conditions . This is in accord with observation . Thus , A. G. Norman and W. J. Peevy3 found that the lignin material in prairie soils took up much less oxygen from a hypoiodite solution than that from podsolic soils , a result they could not interpret . Again , M. D.

Byersl found that the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the humus of the surface soil of a podsol was about 22 , of a podsolic soil about 12.6 , of a prairie soil about 12.2 and of a chernozem about 9.0 . Again , it can explain the increase of the nitrogen content of humus down the soil profile , to be discussed on p. 272 ; for the higher the nitrogen content , the greater the number of acidic groups and the higher the electric charge on the particles , so the more easily they can be dispersed and leached down the profile .

Page's2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been leached down from the surface and not formed in situ from the decomposition of plant roots , and also that a higher proportion of the carbon of the subsoil humus than of the surface is dispersible in cold alkali . The second important aspect of the theory of humic acid formation by the autoxidation of lignin with the simultaneous fixation of ammonia is the place in the soil where it occurs . Direct experimental proof of where this takes place is lacking , but the observations of foresters , such as P. E. Muller3 and W. Kubiena , indicate very definitely that the gut of the saprophagous soil animals is a very important site for humus formation , for their faecal pellets contain partially humified plant residues . These pellets remain in the soil for a considerable time if there are no earthworms present , and their shapes are characteristic of the animal ? mite , beetle , millepede ? that produced them . This humus forms the insect mull of Muller . But in most soils the principal site of lignin oxidation and humus formation may be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant residues takes place in intimate mixture with fine mineral particles in the presence of a good supply of calcium ions . These problems are , however , discussed again in Chapter 30 . Thus , by way of summary , the present ideas on the constitution of soil humus is that it consists of two parts , intimately mixed , but only in part forming co-polymers . One part is derived from lignin by oxidation and ammonia fixation , which may often take place in the gut of the saprophagous soil animals ; the other part is composed of pentose and hexose units , partly in the form of uronic and possibly amino-uronic acids , and of proteins , and these are probably derived from the metabolic products or the dead cells of the soil micro-organisms , and not directly from the plant tissues . footnote 1 Soil Sci. , 1934 , 38 , 121. 2 J.

The results of this analysis suffer from the serious limitation that they can not be definitely interpreted , as the carbon compounds present in the soil are very heterogeneous : they vary from plant remains in various stages of decomposition through humified material to charcoal . Yet such is the lack of appropriate methods for analysing the soil organic matter that the ratio of the total carbon in the soil to the total nitrogen gives as useful a characterisation of the properties of the organic matter in the soil as any other method yet in use.l The carbon-nitrogen ratio of many normal agricultural and natural soils falls within narrow limits , though because of the complications already mentioned , there can be large variations between soils . Table 58 gives an example of this variability for fifty British2 and sixty-three American3 soils , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variability that might be expected under extreme conditions . But this variability has often been discounted because in normal fertile arable soils , not containing any pieces of charcoal , as many soils do , the ratio is surprisingly constant and surprisingly independent of soil treatment . Table 59 illustrates this latter point , showing how at Rothamsted very different forms of manuring and cropping have only had a small influence on the C/N ratio , although they have caused large differences in the carbon and nitrogen contents . A C/N ratio of around Io is , in fact , very common for English arable soils . footnote For an account of the early literature on C/N ratios , see Soils and Fert. , 1945 , 8 , 135 ? 2 W.

This is , in fact , the problem discussed on p. 235 . But since the soil population attacks the added organic matter to obtain energy from it , and since the consequence of this removal of energy , under aerobic conditions , is the production of carbon dioxide , the total carbon content of the material will be reduced , and if there is no loss of nitrogen , or no production of ammonium or nitrate , the C/N ratio will fall . As a consequence there is no strong connection between the C/N ratio of the added material and the level of inorganic nitrogen in the soil , as has already been indicated on p. 238 . But if the added material is fairly easily decomposable , such as plant remains , the process of decomposition , in providing a residual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will release inorganic nitrogen if the C/N ratio of the added material is under 25 and will remove inorganic nitrogen if it is much above 35 in temperate2 or 50 in tropical regions.3 On the other hand , if the added material is already partially decomposed , as occurs in the deposits that accumulate on the surface and in the superficial layers of undisturbed soils , the process of decomposition will involve a smaller release of carbon dioxide per unit of carbon , and hence inorganic footnote I am indebted to Mr. R.

Hardy ' . has recently given an example of the value of a knowledge of this ratio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton-growing areas of Queensland and the West Indies , if the C/N ratio of the undisturbed soil was below 8.5 in Queensland or below s o in the West Indies , cultivation released nitrates from the soil organic matter too rapidly for good cotton production : it is only on soils with a higher C/N ratio that good cotton is being grown . Certain general relations seem to hold between the carbon and nitrogen contents of a soil and the external conditions . The C/N ratio is typically higher under acid than neutral conditions , as would be predicted from Mattson 's theory of humic acid formation that the nitrogen content of this fraction increases with its degree of oxidation , which in turn increases with the pH of the soil in which it is being formed . Thus low-moor peats or fens and chernozems , formed in the presence of an adequate lime and mineral supply , typically have a higher nitrogen content , and hence a lower C/N ratio , than highmoor peats and podsols formed under acid conditions . H. Hesselman2 found the nitrogen content of forest humus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson and E. V. Staker3 found a very definite correlation between the C/N ratio of some New York peats and their calcium contents ; in fact , their data show that the C/N ratio is more closely related to the calcium content than to the pH of the peat . Again , any conditions that encourage decomposition usually lower the C/N ratio , for the main effect of a rapid decomposition is for much of the carbon to go off as CO2 , leaving the nitrogen in the soil . Thus , cultivating a forest soil typically lowers the C/N ratio , and the C/N ratio of grassland soils under similar conditions of humidity tends to decrease as the mean annual temperature increases , 4 i.e. as the mean rate of decomposition increases . The constitution of the soil organic matter must also vary down the soil profile , for the C/N ratio decreases with depth and may reach figures as low as 4 under some conditions.5 An example of this is given in Fig. 21 , which shows the fall in the carbon content and C /N ratio down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated , but their nitrogen ' content is approaching that of a protein and is similar to that of bacterial protoplasm. footnote 1 Trop .

There is not much data on the phosphorus content of organic matter because of the great difficulty of bringing all the organic phosphorus into solution or suspension without breaking it down to inorganic phosphates .

Simonson2 for seven Iowa soils indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r oo and 200 and the nitrogen-phosphorus ratio between 8 and 16 , though some of their results fell considerably below these limits . The principal organic phosphorus compounds in the soil may not yet have all been recognised . Phytin , which is inositol hexaphosphate , and other inositol phosphates certainly occur . C. A. Bower , 3 working in Iowa , found that about 40 ? 50 per cent of the organic phosphorus could be hydrolysed to inositol phosphates , of which about two-thirds was phytin and one-third mainly the triphosphate . W. J. Dyer and C. L. Wrensha114 also found phytin was present in considerable amounts in a Canadian peat , though R. K. Yoshida's5 results on some Hawaiian soils footnote ' B. Dyer , U.S. Dept .

The second group of phosphorus compounds recognised in the soil organic matter consists of nucleic acid and its nucleotides . Unfortunately it has not yet been possible either to estimate the proportion of organic phosphorus in these compounds , or even to recognise the principal nucleotides present . Thus it is still impossible to say if these two groups  --  the inositol phosphates and the nucleotides contain the bulk of the organic phosphorus compounds present in most arable and grassland soils . No other compounds have been recognised in appreciable amounts though small quantities of the phospholipid lecithin have been isolated . Further solutions can be obtained from soil organic matter containing phosphorus in as yet unidentified compounds , though the proportion of phosphorus in these solutions is small . It is not known in what form the phytin and nucleic acid occur in the organic matter , though presumably most of the nucleic acid must be in nucleoproteins , nor in which humic fractions they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil enzymes as they are readily dephosphorylated if mixed with the soil , that is , they have their phosphate groups split off as inorganic orthophosphate anions . ' This is also shown independently by the fact that these organic phosphates can only be extracted in good yield from the humic material if it is subjected to fairly drastic pre-treatment . However , Dyer and Wrenshall2 found that iron phytate , which they consider to be the principal phytin compound present in acid soils , is much more resistant to dephosphorylation than the free phytin , and C. A. Bower3 found that nucleic acid and nucleoproteins are strongly adsorbed by montmorillonite clays , and when so absorbed are also much more resistant to dephosphorylation . The Sulphur Compounds in the Organic Matter Very little is known about the sulphur content of organic matter or the forms in which it occurs . C. A. Evans and C. O. Rost4 found that the sulphur content of the Minnesota soils they examined varied from about one-hundredth of the carbon content in the prairie soils to between one-half and one-quarter of this proportion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio in the organic matter of some Kazan chernozem and chestnut soils was between Io ? 5 and 1 1.4 , agreeing fairly well with the ratio of 8 ? 10 found by Evans and Rost for the Minnesota chernozems . Thus it appears as if the sulphur footnote ' W.J. Dyer and C. L. Wrenshall , Soil Sri. , 1941 , 51 , i 59 ; H. T. Rogers , ibid. , t 942 , 54.439 . Soil , Sci. , i9.q.i. 51 , 235. n Iowa Agric .

Some of the sulphur presumably occurs as the amino acids cystine and cysteine , which in turn are present in proteins derived from plant residues , though these amino acids do not seem to have been isolated from humic material If these are the principal carriers of organic sulphur they must be present in proteins resistant to hydrolysis . The Properties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil can not be directly determined in the same way as those of clays , as there are no gentle ways of separating it from the mineral particles on the one hand or the unhumified material on the other . Nor have any attempts yet been made to compare the properties of the same mineral soil differently treated to produce soils of widely varying humus content and then to estimate the effect of the different amounts of the various humic fractions on the soil properties . The methods usually adopted to determine the properties of organic matter in soils are to compare the properties either of a range of soils having varied humus and clay contents , though the clay must all be of the same mineralogical composition , or of a series of soils before and after much of their humic material has been removed , as for example by boiling with hydrogen peroxide . ' Further , it is possible that different constituents can be removed in turn by varying the strength of the peroxide.2 Soil humus displays the typical properties of hydrophilic colloids : it can absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil , it can take part in base exchange reactions , and it can be dispersed and flocculated , so can play an important role in crumb formation . It can also act as an oxidationreduction as well as an acid-base buffer . Further , it appears to be amorphous , for the only lines that X-ray photographs of carefully prepared humus preparations show are due to small amounts of graphite that the humus sometimes contains.3 THE ACID PROPERTIES AND THE BASE EXCHANGE CAPACITY OF HUMUS Humic acids separated from the soil , or soils poor in inorganic footnote ' For examples of these methods , see J.

Their acidic properties are due to hydrogen ions dissociating from carboxylic acid groups having a pK near pH 4.6 under acid conditions , and from various hydroxyl groups under slightly acid or alkaline conditions , as already described on p. 261 . No systematic examination has yet been made on the relative importance of these various acidic groups in different types of soil , or on how far they can be altered by varying the soil conditions . Humic material thus differs fundamentally from clay , for it is true acid forming true salts , whilst clay particles merely possess a net negative charge which has to be neutralised by cations . The acidic property of soil humus that has been most examined is its base exchange capacity as determined by some arbitrary method . At one time it was considered to have a definite value for most soils ; thus W. T. McGeorgel and P. E. Turner2 obtained mean values for it from determinations of the loss of exchange capacity and of organic carbon when a range of soils were treated with hydrogen peroxide . But their figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humus ( assumed to be 58 per cent carbon ) , and L. C. Olson and R. H. Bray , 3 using a similar method on other American soils , found it varied from 30 to 280 milli-equivalents . This scatter in the exchange capacity of the humus has , in fact , already been discussed on p. 268 , for it depends on its degree of oxidation , which in turn depends on the pH conditions under which it has been formed . Typical humic acids of low ash content do not display any noticeable amphoteric properties , hence can not possess any appreciable number of dissociable basic groups , such as amino groups . But some humic preparations , particularly those containing iron or aluminium compounds , may contain enough basic groups to be amphoteric4 and to possess one , or sometimes two , isoelectric points . These properties are , however , due to the iron or aluminium present and not to any functional basic organic groups . The soil humus may also act as an oxidation-reduction system , and in so doing will have its buffering power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up oxygen from the air , and Normans that it can give up oxygen to hypoiodites ; as a consequence during oxidation it becomes more acidic and takes up bases , and during reduction less acidic and gives them up . footnote 1 Arizona Agric .

Schloesingl wrote in 1874 that " L'argile possede une certaine tendance a s'unir aux humates du terreau pour former probablement une de ces combinaisions entre colloides signalees par Graham " . He attempted to separate the humus from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then adding ammonium chloride which flocculated the clay , but left much of the humus in suspension . He also found that the quantity of chloride required to flocculate the clay increased with the amount of humus present , a phenomenon that was first investigated in any detail by E. Fickendey.2 Very little is yet known about this combination of clay with humic material . Thus , the humic fractions that take part in this combination have not yet been identified , and until this has been done , all discussions about clay-humus complexes must necessarily be vague . The structure of the mixed clay-humus suspensions have been investigated by various methods . Thus , H. E. Myers , 3 using viscosometric methods , and D. I. Sideri , 4 using optical methods , have concluded that the absorption of humus by the clay induces the formation of mixed clay-humus micelles in which the majority of the clay particles possess a fairly definite orientation . There is no evidence that the organic colloids ever enter into the crystal lattice of the inorganic colloids ; in fact , I. D. Sedletsky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex only possessed the unaltered lines of the clay . But the two colloids can form mixed micelles , which on drying give mixed micro-aggregates of clay and humus . The evidence for the existence of clay-humus complexes in natural soil is mainly based on the properties of the different colloidal sols that can be dispersed from soils by suitable treatment . When a colloidal suspension is obtained from a soil by treating it with a gentle deflocculating agent , as , for example , by leaching it with sodium chloride and then shaking in water , or by shaking it in a dilute sodium hydroxide solution , the suspended particles with settling velocities corresponding to coarse clay and fine silt have appreciable amounts of organic matter absorbed on them which can not be removed by any method of partial flocculation yet tried . But it is not yet known if these particles consist of single grains of coarse clay and fine silt coated with a layer of humic footnote C.X. , 1874 , 78 , 1276. 2 J. Landw. , 1966 , 54 , 343 .

A. T. Tiulini has developed a method for fractionating the clayhumus colloids from a soil by using methods of partial dispersion and flocculation . He considers there are two main types of dispersible soil colloids : one which disperses readily when all its exchangeable ions are sodium and the other which needs a more powerful method . In his early work he referred to the first group as electro-negative , because they could easily be made to acquire sufficient negative charge to disperse , and to the second as amphoteric , because they needed to be treated with sodium hydroxide before they could acquire sufficient charge to disperse . But he later realised that the particles in the second group are not amphoteric : they are merely more firmly aggregated together , hence can only be dispersed by more vigorous means , as , for example , by boiling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaching the soil with sodium chloride , to replace all the exchangeable ions with sodium , and then dispersing it in water . He found that some of these particles held some humic matter sufficiently loosely for it to be removed from their surfaces when they were redispersed in sodium hydroxide . On adding an adequate amount of potassium chloride the mineral particles with their closely bound humic matter were flocculated and the dispersed humic matter remained in suspension . He considered these flocculated particles are the stable kernel of the clay-humus complex and they contain between 2 and 6 per cent of carbon , depending on the soil conditions.2 The second group of particles , which required a more vigorous method of dispersion to bring them into suspension , differ from the first in containing about double the amount of humic matter per unit weight of clay and three or more times the amount of iron soluble in such solvents as Tamm 's acid oxalate . It would be very interesting to test the effect on the humic matter content of these groups of dispersed clay particles by treating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals such as calcium which prevent a part of the humic material from dispersing in water ( p. 259 ) . The value of this method of fractionation has not yet been established , and , in fact , H. J. Atkinson of the Canadian Department of Agriculture seems to have been the only worker outside Russia who has used this method . His results3 confirm those of Tiulin ; thus they both find that the group I colloids are the main carriers of the available nitrogen and phosphates in the soil ; that the fertility of a soil increases with the footnote 1 Soil Sci. , 1938 , 45 , 343 ; and for his recent modification of technique , see Lenin Acad .

The present picture of the clay-humus complex is still very indefinite . There are possibly only two types in the soil , one of which the clay and humus particles are held together by calcium ions , the other in which iron in particular , and possibly also manganese and aluminium , can replace calcium , though aluminium has not yet been shown to be able to replace iron in this mechanism . Now that the technique of dispersing metallo-organic complexes with pyrophosphates and other neutral solutions has been developed , it should be possible with its aid to test how far these metallic ions are in fact responsible for binding the humic to the mineral particles . Tiulin 's group II colloids probably furnish an example of iron acting as a cement holding clay and humic particles together ; and iron , and possibly also aluminium , may be responsible for the binding of the humus particles to the sand particles in the B horizon of a podsol , for the organic matter dispersed from this horizon is rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the p-humus of Waksman ( see p. 256 ) . These complexes , when dispersed in acid solutions , may become negatively charged , that is , act as cations and move towards the cathode during the electrodialysis of soils , 3 but they are not considered to confer a favourable structure on the soil . The clay-humus complex held together by calcium ions is probably footnote 1 Soil Sci. , 1938 , 45 , 347. 2 Soil Sci. , 1944 , 57 , 237. 3 See , for example , B. D. Wilson and E. ' .

This complex is supposed to be largely responsible for the favourable physical conditions found in chernozems , composts and wormcasts . Little is known about the structure of this complex . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grey humic acids appear to be the type of humus required , though the essential properties needed for this formation are not known ; an adequate supply of calcium must be present , though possibly only to ensure that the correct type of humus is formed ; and the alimentary canal of the earthworm is a favourable environment for its formation , but whether this is due to any specific organic excretions or simply because it ensures a thorough mixing of the humus and clay particles in the presence of available calcium is still undecided . There is little experimental evidence available on how far the proportion of the soil 's organic matter in this combination can be increased . On sandy soils additions of clay may be as important as organic matter ; and it is possible that a given quantity of a bulky organic manure can only be converted into the maximum quantity of this type of complex if it is composted with a montmorillonite type of clay before being applied to the soil . ' There is a third organic-inorganic colloid possible , which can be prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised in the field . L. E. Ensminger and J. E. Gieseking2 found that proteins can be strongly adsorbed by bentonites through their basic groups acting as an exchangeable base , and that this process of adsorption renders the protein more resistant to proteolytic enzymes . However , so little is known about the proteins present in the soil organic matter that no theories about the form they occur in and the reasons for their stability against decomposition can yet be considered properly tested by experiment ( see p. 265 ) . The Level of Organic Matter in Soils The carbon compounds in the soil are in a continuous flux : carbonaceous plant residues are continually being added which , by forming the primary food supply of the soil population , suffer a series of decompositions and syntheses . Part of the added carbon is converted into living protoplasm , part into the products of excretion of living organisms and part into forms resistant to decomposition . The main loss of carbon from a soil occurs as carbon dioxide diffusing into the footnote ' Stated by F. Scheffer ( ForschDienst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siegel and L. Meyer ( Bodenk .

They are typically precipitated in the B horizon in the subsoil , though some are washed out , as the colour of rivers flowing through the pine forests of northern Europe clearly shows . The proportion of carbon in these various forms , and the rate of loss of carbon from the soil , depends on the soil conditions ; and if these conditions remain fairly constant the organic matter also remains fairly constant , both in amount and composition ; but if any important change takes place ? such as a change in the plant association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this equilibrium is upset . The organic matter content of a soil increases with the rate at which plant remains are added to the soil , though it also depends on the way they are incorporated with it . Forest soils typically have the bulk of their organic matter close to the soil surface , for the forest litter all falls on the surface , and most of the ephemeral tree roots are concentrated near the surface , so that organic matter can only be brought into the sub-surface layer by worms and other soil animals . Prairie soils , by contrast , have a considerable proportion of their organic matter in the deeper horizons , for not only do they receive grass and other debris on their surface , but many of their grasses produce a deep extensive root system which annually may add a greater weight of organic matter to the body of the soil than the leaves add to the surface . ' The humus , which the decomposition of these roots yield , is thus produced in the deeper layers of the soil . Plate XXVII illustrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa . Arable soils receive organic matter from the residues of the crops growing on them . The crop always leaves behind much of its root system in the soil , but except for some grass and leguminous leys , the actual weight of roots is usually very sma112 ( p. 431 ) . Most crops also leave a stubble and dead leaves , and the larger the crop the greater the weight of these residues , but the main source of organic matter in well-farmed arable soils that carry no leys is the farmyard manure they are given . The rate of decomposition of the organic matter depends on the soil aeration , calcium supply and temperature . The more favourable a soil is for animal life , by being well aerated and adequately supplied with calcium , the more rapid in general is the decomposition : poorly footnote 1 J. Kramer and J. E.

High temperatures also encourage high rates of decomposition ; the soil micro-organisms certainly decompose organic matter more vigorously at higher temperatures , though it has not yet been established if this is also true for the soil animals . The net effect of climate on the processes of addition and decomposition of the soil organic matter for well-drained pasture soilsl in the U.S.A. is that the organic matter content increases with increasing rainfall and with decreasing temperature ? with the former because increasing rainfall favours greater plant growth without having much effect on the rate of decomposition , and with the latter because decreasing temperature both slows down the decomposition processes more rapidly than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synthesis of microbial protoplasm ( p. 234 ) . Shading the surface of the soil will also increase its organic matter content , for this lowers the maximum soil temperature , and in consequence the rate of oxidation of the organic matter . This effect of shading is seen most strikingly in the tropics , for not only is the difference in day temperature between a bare moist soil , and the same soil under a forest or bush cover appreciable , but oxidation proceeds correspondingly much more rapidly at the higher temperature . The effect of ploughing out and cultivating a pasture or prairie soil is to reduce its organic matter content , both because the better aeration produced by the cultivations increases the rate of oxidation of the organic matter , and also because of the lower additions of plant remains that usually accompany arable farming . An extreme example of this effect is furnished by peat and fen soils . These soils have accumulated large quantities of organic matter due to them being so badly aerated through water-logging that its decomposition has been inhibited . Draining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , with the consequence that the organic matter begins to oxidise away and the surface level of the soil sinks ; a rate of sinking of I to 3 cm. a year is not abnormal . This sinking of the soil surface causes very great complications in the management of the area , for the drainage system must continually be deepened , and the cost of removing the water from the drains will continually rise . O. Djurlc2 has given an example from Sweden , showing how this subsidence can be reduced by keeping the land in grazing leys or pasture as much as possible . footnote For a discussion of the , eflcct of climate on these soils , see l 1 . jenny , /actors of Soil Formation . 2 Svenska Vall-o .

Whereas nearly two-thirds of the organic matter has been lost from the continuous maize plots , only about one-sixth has been lost from the three-course rotation . These results show that the organic matter content of an arable soil tends to an equilibrium value depending on the crop rotation practised : for a given soil under given climatic conditions , it is lowest for rotations containing a high proportion of wide-spaced intertilled crops or cultivated fallows , and it increases as the proportion of small grains in the rotation increase , and it increases still more as the proportion of grass leys increase . Fig. 24 on p. 303 shows that this is so for grassland at Rothamsted .

However , on the neighbouring half plot , which only began to receive 14 tons of manure in 1885 , the nitrogen content reached 0.19 per cent in 1914 , and has now stabilised at this figure . The apparent discrepancy between the two half plots is probably due to the fallowing that has had to be introduced into this field for weed control since 1925. footnote 1 For an example of this from the Waite Institute , Adelaide , see G.

During the first fifty years of plot 2B the soil gained annually about 50 lb. of nitrogen and about 500 lb. of carbon , and received annually about 200 lb. of nitrogen and 3,800 lb. of carbon in the manure . Thus , over the first fifty years about one-quarter of the added nitrogen and one-eighth of the added carbon remained behind in the soil as slowly decomposable humus , and this fraction was probably 50 per cent higher in the first twenty years . Crowther has further shown that on the light soil at Woburn , which was cropped to wheat or barley continuously for fifty years , the nitrogen content fell from ( 3 , - 16 to o ? i o per cent during this period if no farmyard manure was given , but it was maintained at about this level when 6 to 7 tons per acre was given .

Again , in some Danish experiments at Lyngby , l where land was cropped to a six-course rotation and some plots given farmyard manure twice in the rotation , the soils retained 32 per cent of the nitrogen added in the manure during four courses of the rotation . Thus , under normal arable conditions in north-west Europe , soils receiving regular additions of farmyard manure retain between one-quarter and one-third of the nitrogen in the manure , in the form of soil organic matter having a C /N ratio of about to . footnote Described by K.

The transformation can probably only take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrite - nitrate and as far as is known these transformations are predominantly brought about in the soil by micro-organisms . THE PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA FROM ORGANIC MATTER The soil microflora typically produce ammonia from organic compounds when they set free more nitrogen from the organic matter on which they are living than they can assimilate into their own protoplasm . Further , ammonia forms their sole important nitrogen excretion product under aerobic conditions , though if the oxygen supply is restricted amines may also be produced . Ammonia production from nitrogen-rich organic matter is thus not confined to a few groups of soil micro-organisms : it is their typical and characteristic nitrogen excretion product . Soil animals , on the other hand , probably excrete either uric acid , as in the insects , or urea as in the mammals . This concept of ammonia production being the nitrogen wasteproduct in the conversion of organic matter into microbial tissue and vital energy ? originally put forward by E. Marchall in 1893 ? is fundamental for understanding the effect of adding different types of organic matter on the mineral nitrogen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dried blood , is added to a soil , about 8o per cent of the added nitrogen is liberated as ammonia , the remainder of the nitrogen being retained in microbial tissue ; but as increasing quantities of a carbohydrate , such as cellulose , is mixed in with the protein , so the amount of microbial tissue that can be built up is increased , with the consequence that the proportion of nitrogen liberated as ammonia decreases until the ratio of carbohydrate to protein reaches a ratio of about 5 : I when all the nitrogen in the dried blood is needed by the inic ? ro-organisms. footnote 1 h ul.:lead . Nor . /te%i. , 1893 ( 3 ) , 25 , 727. ifi1  | There is some evidence that ammonia can be produced in soils treated with toluene , and therefore presumably not by the action of living micro-organisms . This seems to have been first noted by E. J. Russell and H. B. Hutchinson ' . in 1909 , but it has recently been re-examined in more detail by J. P. Conrad , 2 who showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urea and some other amides , presumably hydrolysing them to ammonium carbonate either by the enzyme urease , which is released into the soil from the decomposing plant and animal tissues there , or by a somewhat similar enzyme . Whether uric acid ? the nitrogen excretion product of most soil invertebrates ? is similarly decomposed has not been investigated . NITRIFICATION IN THE SOIL : THE PRODUCTION OF NITRITE AND NITRATE Th . Schloesing and A. Miintz3 proved in 1877 that nitrification , used here to mean the production of nitrate from ammonia , was mainly a biological process by showing it could be stopped by antiseptics such as chloroform ; and this is still the only process that is definitely known to bring about this oxidation in soils . Various claims have been put forward that nitrate can be produced photochemically from organic compounds , but these have not yet been substantiated.4 There seems little doubt that ammonia can be oxidised hotochemicall to nitrite in solution 5 but it -4 - pears that nitrates are more liable to photochemical reduction to nitrites than the other way round . The importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ts , where-it can only be a surface phenomenon , is still undecided . Corbet has also claimed that nitrites can be oxidised catalytically by hydrogen ions to nitrates in the presence of free oxygen if the pH is below 5 , but again there is no direct evidence that this process actually takes place in the field . Our knowledge of the detailed processes by which micro-organisms produce nitrate in the soil is surprisingly scanty considering the importance of this oxidation . The following facts have probably been established : footnote 1 . Nitrate is always produced from nitrite. 2 . Nitrate formation can only go on in the presence of a generous oxygen supply . 3 . The oxidation of ammonia in the soil takes place on the surface 1,7 . Agric . Sci. , 1909 , 3 , I. 2 Soil Sci. , 1942 , 54 , 367 ; Y. Amer . Soc . Agron. , 1941 , 33 , 800 ; 1942 , 34 , 1102 ; Proc .

Hence , increasing the total amount of these exchangeable ions increases the maximum rate of ammonia oxidation.1 4 . The oxidation only goes on rapidly if there is a good supply of calcium and phosphate , and if there is a proper balance of the trace elements iron , copper and zinc.2 5 . The micro-organisms concerned in the oxidation are bacteria . It had until recently always been assumed that nitrite could only be formed from ammonia , and this may well be the sole source of nitrite in the soil , but J. H. Quastel and P. G. Scholefield3 claim to have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce nitrite direct from pyruvic and oxalacetic oximes , and that the organisms carrying out these oxidations can not oxidise ammonia . It is possible that pyruvic oxime is a very fugitive metabolic product in the soil , and if so , it could be the precursor of some of the nitrate formed from the decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds . Strong direct evidence has recently been produced to show that nitrate formation in soils takes place through the nitrite stage . Thus , W. P. Martin4 and his associates found that if ammonia or urea is added to Arizona desert soils with pH above 7.7 , between a quarter and a third of the added nitrogen appears as nitrite before nitrate formation starts . Further , H. Lees and J. H. Quastel5 found that , when circulating a solution of ammonium sulphate through a soil under aerobic conditions , they could delay the onset of nitrate production by adding some potassium chlorate to the solution , and this delay was solely due to stopping nitrite oxidation and not nitrite formation . They showed that this inhibiting effect of the chlorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed with which the nitriteoxidising organisms could proliferate , as the chlorate had no effect on the velocity of oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in the presence of an adequate number of nitrite-oxidising organisms . This inhibiting effect was itself inhibited in the presence of an adequate supply of nitrate . Only chlorate , of all the salts tried , had this effect , and only nitrate , of all the salts tried , could neutralise this specific effect of chlorates . This work , therefore , strongly suggests that , in the Rothamsted soils at least ? and these were the only soils used in this work ? the power of oxidising nitrites is confined to a very limited number of closely related organisms , although it need only prove that the organisms have the same nutritional needs for growth . footnote 1 H.

R2.1.  | There has been some discussion in the past on whether the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite goes through intermediate compounds such as hydroxylamine and hyponitrous acid . R. M .. Beesieyl showed that there is a considerable disappearance of ammonia in the initial stages of its oxidation before any appreciable amount of nitrite or nitrate can be detected ? a result also found by W. P. Martin and his associates2 when urea or ammonium salts were added to alkaline Arizona soils . Beesley suggested that this was due to an intermediate product being produced , and the suggestion arose that it was either hydroxylamine or hyponitrous acid . There are no accurate and simple specific tests for these two substances , though A. S. Corbet3 claimed to have devised one for hyponitrous acid and to have demonstrated that both of these compounds were intermediates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to confirm the presence of hydroxylamine and has shown that Corbet 's test for hyponitrites is not specific4 . Further , H. Lees5 has shown that soils in which ammonia can be rapidly oxidised to nitrate through nitrite are incapable of oxidising hydroxylamine to nitrite when present in solutions sufficiently dilute not to injure the bacterial population . And hyponitrites are so unstable in soils that it is extremely unlikely they could ever be present in quantities approaching that needed to account for the disappearance of ammonium before the production of nitrite ions . Thus if the correct explanation of Beesley 's and Martin 's phenomenon is that an intermediary compound is formed , it must be an organic one . The only agents that have so far been proved to oxidise ammonia to nitrites and nitrites to nitrates in soil are bacteria , but the technique for isolating the organisms responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate is troublesome . Long ago R. Warington , at Rothamsted , 6 obtained bacterial cultures , which must have been very mixed , that would convert ammonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily nitrates , and others that would convert nitrites , but not ammonia , into nitrates ; but he could not isolate these organisms as pure cultures on gelatin . It was left to S. Winogradsky , 7 to isolate the bacteria responsible . He argued that the organisms should be autotrophic , obtaining their carbon from CO2 and their energy from the oxidation of ammonia and nitrite , and that therefore they alone of the soil organisms should grow on silica gel footnote ' Trans .

Using this technique , he isolated an ammonium oxidising and nitrite producing bacterium , which he called Nitrosomonas , and a nitrite oxidising and nitrate producing bacterium , which he named Nitrobacter . He found these bacteria needed free calcium or magnesium carbonate on which to grow and were harmed , in solution cultures , by some organic compounds such as glucose and peptone , though they were stimulated by others such as acetates ' and a decoction of horse dung . He also found that they were slow growing and only formed very small colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other technique . These two bacteria have been found by several other workers who have looked for them , but the technique requires considerable skill and the colonies are very small , about o. l mm. in diameter.2 Most of the characteristics claimed for them by Winogradsky have been confirmed by other workers , though T. Y. Kingma Boltjes3 could not confirm that glucose was toxic , but found that the toxicity of peptone depended on its free amino acid content , suggesting that some amino acid is toxic to them . J. H. Quastel4 has carried these results further by showing that methionine is a very powerful inhibitor of nitrification , inhibiting both the oxidation of ammonia and nitrite . It is still uncertain if Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter are the sole ammonium and nitrate oxidising organisms in the soil . Winogradsky described a second ammonium oxidiser , Nitrosococcus , at the same time as he described Nitrosomonas , and he and his daughter , H. Winogradsky , 5 described several others , but doubt has been cast on the ability of these to nitrify.6 Further , D. W. Cutler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could produce traces of nitrite from ammonia , but it is possible that the nitrite they detected was produced by the reduction of small quantities of nitrates which may have been present in their solutions as impurities . Nitrification only takes place readily in moist , well-aerated soils . It is inhibited by low and high temperatures , taking place very slowly below 4 ? G. or above 40 ? C. , and reaching its maximum rate around Soo C.8 Hence , the proportion of ammonium to nitrate ions increases at low and very high temperatures . Nitrification also requires adequate supplies of available phosphate and calcium , and a proper balance of footnote 1 For some recent work on this , see H. Bomecke , Arch .

Thus , Bornebuschl found that the rate of nitrification exceeded the rate of ammonification in acid forest soils in the pH range 4 ? 5 ' 5 when mull formation was taking place , but not when raw humus is being formed , as shown in Table 63 . This is possibly due to mull soils being richer in bases and in phosphates than raw humus soils , for H. L. Richardson2 has shown that a lack of calcium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starved permanent grass plots at Rothamsted . Typically , the process of nitrite oxidation goes on faster than nitrite production , so that the nitrite level in soils is usually much lower than that of ammonia or nitrates . But conditions can arise , in some desert soils , for example , when nitrite production exceeds nitrite oxidation , with the consequence that nitrites may temporarily accumulate in the soil solution sufficiently to lower the vitality of the crop growing on that soil , so rendering it susceptible to a number of diseases . The cause of this inversion of the oxidation rates is not known , but it is possibly due to the nitrite producers having a lower phosphate requirement at high pHs than the nitrite oxidisers ; 4 and if this is so , it might explain an observation of G. Drouineau and his co-workers ' that nitrite accumulation can take place in soils to which very large amounts footnote 1 Forstl . Forsoegsv . Danmark , 1930 , 11 , 1 . 2 J. Agric .

It is also possible that part of the harmful effect of chlorates on plant growth may be that they stop the oxidation of ammonia at the nitrite stage , so that it is the nitrite rather than the chlorate that is directly poisoning the plant . THE LEVEL OF MINERAL NITROGEN IN THE SOIL The mineral nitrogen in the soil is present either as ammonium or nitrate ions . The nitrates are all dissolved in the soil solution , unless the soil dries out , but much of the ammonium is held on the exchange complex . The total quantity of mineral nitrogen in the soil is the difference between the rate it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the soil population and the rate it is being removed by leaching , by growing crops and by other members of the soil population ; and the proportion of nitrate to ammonia depends also on the rate of oxidation of ammonia to nitrates , the uptake of nitrates by the plant and the loss of nitrates by leaching . Grassland soils have the main proportion of their mineral nitrogen present as ammonia , as is shown in Table 64 , for the Rothamsted soil.l Further , both the ammonium and nitrate levels remain very constant throughout the year , and even large additions of ammonium or nitrate fertilisers only affect them for short periods . Arable soils , particularly if they are not too acid , have a fairly constant but low content of ammonium nitrogen , but a very variable nitrate content ranging from 2 to 20 mgm. of nitrogen as nitrate , per kg. of soil ( i.e. 2 to 20 parts per million of nitrate nitrogen ) for normal soils , but rising up to 6o mgm. for rich garden soils and , footnote 1 H. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 73.  | according to G. ap Griffith , l rising to 10o mgm. for some tropical soils during the dry season . This nitrate content varies throughout the season and , under some conditions which can not yet be specified , from hour to hour.2 Fig. 22 shows the nitrate nitrogen content , throughout the growing season of 1915 , of two parts of the Broadbalk plot at Rothamsted which receives farmyard manure annually , one part being cropped to wheat and one part fallowed.3 Not all the details of these curves can be explained , but the figure shows clearly that the fallow figure soil accumulates nitrates during the spring and summer , whereas the cropped soil does not , and that the fallow appears to have lost all its accumulated nitrates by early winter , presumably due to them being leached down into the deep subsoil . Fallows can , however , only accumulate nitrates under four conditions : they must be kept free from weeds ; there must be decomposable organic matter in the soil ; the soil must be moist , otherwise the micro-organisms can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , otherwise the nitrates will get washed out of the soil as soon as they are formed . Some results of W. E. de B. Diamond , 4 working with tropical arable soils at Ibadan , Nigeria , illustrate these points ; nitrates can only accumulate in these soils during the beginning footnote 1 Comrnonw . Bar .

F. Crowther , ' working in the Sudan Gezirah , has also given a good example of weeds reducing the accumulation of nitrates in a fallow soil . This heavy clay land is commonly fallowed for several years in preparation for cotton , and Crowther showed that cutting down the weeds that grew during the short rainy season , instead of letting them die as soon as the dry season began , increased the nitrate nitrogen in the top foot of soil from 2-4 p.p.In. to 5-10 p.p.m. , and also increased that in the second foot . This led to a 66 per cent increase in the uptake of nitrogen by the cotton and a corresponding increase in the yield of seed-cotton . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the production of nitrate in a soil . The type of evidence used to show this is illustrated by Table 65 , which gives the nitrate nitrogen in the soil of neighbouring plots of cropped and fallow land at Rothamsted.2 But the interpretation of this table is not simple , as no allowance was made for the nitrogen in the living or dead root system of the crop ? a quantity that is extremely difficult to estimate . This deficiency is , however , built up before the crop comes to maturity , for in 1915 the rate of nitrate production is seen to be as high under wheat as under fallow between July 26th and August 17th ? the day after the wheat was cut . A part of this deficit could also be due to reduced nitrate production under the crop due to the extra drying-out of the soil by the crop compared with the fallow , though if this was important one would have expected the deficit to be smaller in 1912 , a year with a wet , late spring and summer and with the plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late spring and summer was drier , the temperature higher and the crop larger . Hence , the crop may have some specific effect in reducing the rate of nitrate production for reasons other than those already discussed ; or there may be an additional process operative in the presence of a growing crop that can lock up nitrates . The microbial population around the plant roots could produce just this effect if they could extract from the root system , or if the roots excrete , an appreciable amount of carbohydrates . Nitrate production is naturally a process requiring a good oxygen supply , hence can only take place rapidly in well-drained soils . Various workers have claimed that even in such soils it can be increased if the soil is kept deeply cultivated , a process which presumably improves the aeration of the subsoil . The experimental evidence on this point J. Expt . Agric. , 1943 , 11 , I. IS . J. Itussrll , ? 7 . Agric .

Losses of Inorganic Nitrogen from the Soil The inorganic nitrogen compounds ? ammonia and nitrates ? suffer several types of loss from the soil . They may be taken up by growing plants , they may be assimilated into the bodies of micro-organisms and so brought back into the organic nitrogen reservoir , they may be converted into volatile compounds and lost into the air , or they may be leached out of the soil . It is only the last two losses that will be considered here . Many bacteria , and possibly some actinomycetes when growing iii conditions of ' a limited oxygen supply , can use nitrates and other  | inorganic ions such as sulphates and ferric ions instead of , or in partial replacement of ; atmospheric oxygen as the hydrogen acceptor needed in their respiration processes . Some common soil bacterial will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus reduced to nitrites , oxides of nitrogen , nitrogen gas , and ammonia , the relative proportions produced depending on the type of bacteria and the conditions in which they arc working . The whole process is sometimes known as denitrification and it contains the only biological process known which returns nitrogen gas to the atmosphere . There is a possibility that nitrogen gas may also be liberated by a chemical process under acid conditions , 2 for nitrites can react with amines to give nitrogen gas , thus figure but there is no evidence this reaction is of any importance in the soil . The conditions conducive to gaseous nitrogen loss in soils have not been worked out in detail , but , unless nitrates are being added to the soil , they must include periods of nitrate formation followed by periods of nitrate reduction , that is , alternating periods of good and bad aeration.3 M. P. Korsakova4 found some bacteria , under suitable conditions , can decompose nitrates almost quantitatively to nitrogen gas via nitrites and some unidentified intermediate compound , as shown in Fig 23 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a high nitrate supply and impeded drainage are the optimum conditions for nitrogen loss by this means . Nitrogen can , however , be lost to the atmosphere in the form of ammonia , and this may be of considerable importance in alkaline soils under hot , wet conditions such as occur in many flooded paddy rice fields.5 The primary condition necessary for this loss is that ammonia production should go on faster than ammonia oxidation ; for as soon as ammonia begins to accumulate near the soil surface in neutral soils it is liable to loss by volatilisation . Water-logging can obviously lead to this condition ? for rapid nitrification needs a good air supply ? but so also can high temperatures . Thus , C. M. Hutchinson6 found with some Indian soils that nitrification can keep pace with ammonification if the temperature is about 2o ? C. ; but at 3o ? C. ammonification goes so rapidly that it appears to inhibit nitrification , possibly because it footnote 1 J. Meiklejohn , Ann . Appl . Biol. , 1940 , 27 , 558. 2 N. W. Barritt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. J. Russell and E. H. Richards ( J. Agric . Sci. , 191 ' 7 , 8 , 495 ) , showed the necessity of this ' for gaseous nitrogen losses from manure heaps . ' Quoted by E. E. Uspensky , Soil Microbiology in the U.S.S.R. , Moscow , 1933 . See , te , r example , W. I1 . Willis and M. B. Sturgis , Proc . Soil Sci . Soc . Amer. , 1945 , 9 , io6. " .11cm . Dept . Agric .

The method of conserving nitrogen under these two conditions is , however , entirely different . In typical alkaline paddy fields the ammonia can only be kept low by adding complex organic nitrogen compounds that are only slowly ammonified ; but under hot , alkaline , arid conditions the loss can also be kept low by using nitrate rather than ammonium fertilisers . Thus , F. Crowther ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen for irrigated cotton on the heavy alkaline Gezirah soil than calcium nitrate , and in fact about 20 lb. of the nitrogen added as sulphate of ammonia seemed to be lost when it was applied as a top dressing , though from the indirect evidence given in his paper it would appear to have been about as efficient as the nitrate , if it had been drilled 6 inches deep instead of being broadcast . T. N. Jewitt2 confirmed that in fact there is a considerable loss of ammonia from this soil when ammonium sulphate is applied to its surface . Nitrogen losses , as ammonia , from soils may also occur under English conditions when readily decomposable nitrogen-rich organic matter is mixed with the superficial layer of the soil . Thus , J. A. Daji , 3 working at Woburn , found that up to 40 per cent of the nitrogen of young mustard or tare plants was lost from the soil in two months , compared with no loss of the nitrogen of mature mustard plants over the same : period .  | Nitrogen can also be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being leached out either into the subsoil or into the drainage water , and this loss can be sufficient to account for the total loss of nitrogen from bare fallow soils under English conditions . As an example , the soil in the Rothamsted drain gauges , the surface of which has been kept free from vegetation since 187o , had lost one-third of the nitrogen originally present in the top 9 inches by 1915 , but as shown in Table 66 , the amount of nitrogen found as nitrates in the drainage water was approximately equal to the loss of nitrogen from the soil , thus proving that this loss of soil nitrogen is mainly clue to the leaching out of nitrates under these conditions . In field conditions where plants are growing in the soil the amount of drainage water is less than on the uncropped gauge , and the loss of nitrate is further reduced by any factor that improves plant growth . On the Broadbalk wheat field , the autumn drainage water from plots receiving sulphate of ammonia alone , and yielding about 11 cwt. of grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitric nitrogen , whilst that on the plot receiving in addition potassic and phosphatic fertiliser , and yielding about 16 cwt. of grain , contains only 8.5 parts per million . In the uncropped drain gauge there is no addition of vegetable matter to the soil , and consequently there is nothing in the nature of easily decomposable organic matter present . Growing plants , and particularly farmyard manure , add this kind of material , and therefore open up the possibility of losses of nitrogen to the atmosphere , as described above . footnote Constructed from data given by N. H. J. Miller , q . Agric . Sci. , 1 gob , 1 , 377 , and E. J. Russell and E. H. Richards , ibid. , 1920 , 10 , 22. 2 After deducting the amount brought down in the rain . No significance should be attached to the difference between the last two columns owing to the assumptions involved in obtaining , and the uncertainties in interpreting , the figure for the weight of nitrogen in the lop 9 inches of the soil .  | Some drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses of nitrogen from soils if they are very well supplied with available nitrogen . J. A. Bizzell ' found that timothy and market-garden crops can cause up to one-third of the nitrogen added as sulphate of ammonia or nitrate of soda to be lost under these conditions . The reason for this loss is still uncertain , though J. K. Wilson2 supposes it is due to the plants excreting drops of liquid containing nitrites and ammonia or other amines which react to give gaseous nitrogen . Table 67 gives an example of their losses , showing how they only occur with luxury consumptions of nitrogen by the crop . ' These losses can also be illustrated on the Broadbalk wheat plot at Rothamsted , which receives annually 14 tons of farmyard manure per acre , supplying 200 lb. nitrogen . After allowing for the nitrogen taken p 300 up by the crop and left in the soil the deficit is enormous , being nearly 70 per cent of the nitrogen added . On the adjoining unmanured plot there is no deficit , the whole of the nitrogen lost from the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similar losses occur on the Woburn plots receiving farmyard manure annually , 2 and F. Scheffer3 has given similar results for rye growing for fifty years at Halle under different fertiliser treatments . Unfortunately , it is not possible to form any estimate of the amount of nitrate washed out by rain-water , and so it is impossible to say what proportion of the nitrogen loss can be accounted for by leaching , and what must be assumed to be due to the volatilisation of ammonia or evolution of nitrogen gas . Similar losses occur when grassland is converted into arable , or when virgin prairie soil is broken up for cropping . Oxidation and nitrification both proceed rapidly : part of the nitrate is taken up by the crop , but by far the greater part disappears and can not be traced . footnote i These plots are almost duplicates , plot 7 receiving too lb. each of the sulphates of soda and magnesia in addition to the 3 cwt. of superphosphate and 200 lb. sulphate of potash . given to plot 13. 2 Fifty rears of Field Experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.

Shutt 's ' . analyses of the Indian Head soil , Saskatchewan , are given in Table 6g . Here there is but little drainage water , yet only one-third of the lost nitrogen is recovered in the crop . H. Snyder has given similar results for Minnesota2 soils , C. O. Swanson3 and P. L. Gainey4 for Kansas soils , and A. F. Bracken and J. E. Greaves for Utah soils. ? This unaccounted loss , occurring when prairie is broken up for arable , mainly occurs in the first few years of cultivation. ? Thus , E. S. Hopkins and A. Leahey , ' continuing Shutt 's work at Indian Head , found that in the next sixteen years almost the whole of the loss of soil nitrogen could be accounted for by the nitrogen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the nitrogen content of the soil is high , for Myers ? and his co-workers at Kansas showed that this loss of nitrogen was proportional to the nitrogen content of the soil in excess of its equilibrium value for the rotation adopted ; thus for the wheat and barley rotations used , nitrogen losses only occurred if the nitrogen content of the soil exceeded o ? 1 o per cent . Gains of Nitrogen by the Soil Soils are always losing small amounts of nitrogen by one or more of the processes so far described ; they must possess , therefore , some  | methods for gaining it to balance these losses . Arable soils in the temperate regions , if allowed to revert either to natural forest or to pasture , rapidly gain nitrogen and organic matter . On Broadbalk field , for example , a third plot adjacent to the two quoted in Table 68 carried a wheat crop in 1882 which was never harvested : the plot was allowed to revert to natural prairie by cutting out all bushes and trees at regular intervals . A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vegetation consisted of 6o per cent grasses , 15 per cent miscellaneous herbs and 25 per cent legumes , mainly meadow vetchling ( Lathyrus pratensis ) . The gains in nitrogen and organic matter during this period were considerable , as shown in Table 70 . The nitrogen is all in organic compounds , for the nitrate and ammonia remain at low levels ? the nitrate well below that of arable land and the ammonia a little above it . The gain in nitrogen in a neighbouring field , Geescroft , which carried clover in 1885 and was then allowed to go derelict , is also given in Table 70 . This soil contains much less calcium carbonate , has about the same mechanical analysis , but it is much worse drained and lies water-logged for long periods . It also had a very unkind tilth for a number of years previously . In 1904 the grass Aira caespitosa composed 86 per cent of the plants present and legumes were almost entirely absent , composing only o ? 4 per cent of the plants present ; yet its annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of the Broadbalk plot . In the same way land laid down to pasture increases in nitrogen content : the typical nitrogen content of Rothamsted arable soils is about o I I per cent and of old grassland about 0.25 per Cent , and footnote J. Agric . Sci. , 1905 , 1 , 241.  | H. L. Richardson ' estimated it takes about twenty-five years for half this gain to take place , as is shown in Fig. 24 . The most important process increasing the nitrogen content of agricultural soils is that brought about by bacteria living symbiotically in the nodules of leguminous plants , as discussed on p. 323 : a good clover or lucerne crop will add annually over 1 oo lb. of nitrogen per acre to a soil , a quantity which can be measured without much difficulty . Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is probably not confined to legu- nitrogen-fixing crops ; it is probably also brought about by bacteria living in the root nodules of some trees of the subtropical genus Casuarina , 2 and in leaf-knots on some tropical shrubs of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Pavetta leaves are in fact used as a nitrogenous green manure in Ceylon ? and on the tropical monocotyledon Dioscora.5 These leaf-knot bacteria appear to differ from the root nodule bacteria by being able to fix nitrogen when grown on simple media in pure culture . Thus , Rao found the leaf-knot bacteria on the Rubiaceae growing in mannitol could fix 10 to 15 mgm. of nitrogen per gm. of sugar decomposed . Nitrogen fixation is also  | brought about by an actinomycete living in root nodules on alder , l and possibly by fungi living in some ericaceous plants , 2 and in ryegrass.3 All these statements are , however , in urgent need of verification using modern experimental techniques . The soil may gain nitrogen by three other possible means . Rainwater contains ammoniacal and nitrate nitrogen . N. H. J. Miller4 found that at Rothamsted the rain carried down about 4 lb. per acre of combined nitrogen annually , and workers in other parts of the world had previously obtained quantities varying from 2 to 20 lb. per acre . Soils may be able to fix some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhar and his co-workers in India have repeatedly claimed that nitrogen fixation occurs more rapidly in soils to which molasses , or other decomposable carbohydrates , have been added when they are exposed to the sunlight than when kept in the dark , 5 that a light dressing of cow manure added at the same time increases the efficiency of the carbohydrates , and that at least half the gain in nitrogen that takes place in the field when such materials are added to tropical soils must be due to photochemical action . This mechanism has not generally been accepted as important , but it is possible Dhar was dealing with conditions that allowed nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae to develop on the surface of his soils , and that they were responsible for the photochemical nitrogen fixation which he found . Soils also contain free-living nitrogen-fixing organisms . So far only three groups have been generally recognised to have this power : ( r ) facultative anaerobic bacteria of the Clostridia group ; 6 their nitrogen fixing power in pure culture varies with the species used and with their nutritional history7 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixation were not then known . They are probably of importance in forest soils , s and may be of importance in other soils in symbiosis with aerobes ; ( 2 ) aerobic bacteria of the genus Azotobacter , of which five species have been recognised ? chroococcum , beijerinckii , vinelandii , agilis9 ? which is probably only an aquatic form ? and indicum . The first three appear to have very definite pH require-  | ments , not being found in soils below pH 6,1 whilst the last has been found in soils at pH 4.5 in Dacca in India and in Burma , 2 and R. A. Altson3 appears to have found the same organism in Malaya . The conditions under which this organism lives in acid soils are not , however , understood , for H. Katznelson4 found that it would not grow in acid New Jersey soils of pH 4.3 or 5.1 , but would survive if lime was added ; though H. L. Jensen5 found it would fix nitrogen actively in the absence of calcium ; ( 3 ) some bM.ie-green algae of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several other groups of bacteria , and some fungal genera , may possess this power ; 6 and it is becoming increasingly desirable that these claims should be reinvestigated , using culture media containing the appropriate growth-promoting factors and minerals , and using air enriched with either heavy nitrogen N15 , or radioactive nitrogen N13 , which allows nitrogen fixation to be determined with much greater certainty than hitherto ; ' for until these claims have been disproved it is possible that in some soils the nitrogen supply is maintained by organisms other than those now recognised as nitrogen fixers.8 The chemistry of the nitrogen fixation process is still not known . The three organisms that have been investigated in detail ? blue-green algae , Azotobacter and the nodule bacteria ? may all use the same process . All three use an enzyme reaction that is suppressed in the presence of carbon monoxide or hydrogen gas , 9 and all three , as well as the nitrogen-fixing Clostridia , only fix nitrogen if supplied with small quantities of molybdenum , 10 though larger quantities of vanadium may possibly allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-green algae fix nitrogen if supplied with nitrates or ammonia . " The first product of nitrogen fixation is not known for certain , but presumptive evidence is that it is ammonia which then reacts with a-keto-glutaric acid to give glutamic acid.12
