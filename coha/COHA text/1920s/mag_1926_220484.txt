Down in the Texas Baptist belt , where Fundamentalism flourishes under the humid ( often illiterate ) phrases and hot war-whoops of a **28;6805;TOOLONG , Rev. J. Frank Norris , the prevailing belief among the brethren is that whatever Baptist Norris does is done for the Lord , and is by Him blessed . Last week Rev. J. Frank Norris killed a man . <P> In Manhattan three years ago , Dr. Norris attracted attention by predicting from the pulpit of John Roach Straton , amidst wild gesticulations , that " within one hour " the sin-steeped city would be demolished . The man Mr. Chipps , whom Norris destroyed , had come into his sanctum , the church-study , to dissuade Dr. Norris from attacking his friends . <P> The Doom 's Day apostle of righteousness likewise entertained the soldiers , during the War , with his wrathful denunciations of the Y. M. C. A. for abetting the evil practice of cigarette smoking . Dr. Norris , incorrigible , escorted Chipps to the door . <P> Then again , in No-Ape Tennessee , Heretic John T. Scopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hyperorthodoxy of the Baptist tsar from Texas . Mr. Chipps , according to Dr. Norris and his disciple , L. H. Nutt , refused to leave the parson 's premises . <P> Baptist Norris with prodigious ire blasted the Modernists some time ago with a sentence , in scareheads on his Fundamentalist-Baptist Searchlight : " Judas Iscariot , when he betrayed his Lord with ' Hail , Master ' on his lips , went and hung himself , but these modern Judases Liberals continue to occupy the pulpit and use the name of Christ and live off the money of orthodox people . " Dr. Norris reached for a desk drawer . Pious Parson Norris was indicted in 1912 at Fort Worth for perjury and arson in connection with the burning of his church . Disciples did not desert him , rather increased in number . He has soaked Texas evangelical prospects in a religious fervor approaching fanaticism . Dr. Norris drew a pistol ; shot . Mr. Chipps fell . Dr. Norris had sent three bullets into him . He died in an ambulance . <P> Ecclesiastic Norris has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesmerized faith . The Sabbath following the murder or manslaughter , he preached to a great audience in the warm First Baptist Church of Fort Worth . He walked uprightly at liberty under a $10,000-bond profferred by his congregation . As the disciples sweltered within the House of God , 700 voices sent hymn upon hymn ( " There is Power in the Blood , " " Shall we Gather at the River , " " Standing on the Promises of God " ) reverberating to the roof , while two pianos , psychologically caressed by relaying pianists , furnished additional emotion . <P> Finally Divine Norris rose from behind the pulpit , leaned forward . His text : " There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus . " ( Romans 8 . ) <P> After the sermon , supplicating hundreds sought him out , saying unto him their congratulations , touching his robes , admiring the prophet . To them he called for conversions and five came and were redeemed . And they embraced him and he them . He pronounced his faith risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus . "
