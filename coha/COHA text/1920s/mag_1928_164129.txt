Smith v. White . In Kansas , Editor William Allen White of ' the Emporia Gazette exercised his pen and his tongue to tell Kansans exactly how many times Nominee Smith had voted in the interests of the saloon , the gambling den , the bawdy house . Nominee Smith quickly recognized Editor White 's source of information to be one Rev. O. R. Miller , a pamphleteer whom the Nominee denounced as " a parasite living on the people of the State of New York ... an 18-carat professional faker . " <P> Nominee Smith answered Editor White 's remarks item by item and then announced that he would answer no more erroneous attacks upon his legislative record . Editor White stood corrected but added : " The undertakers are looking wistfully right now at three members of the United States Supreme Court , and with Al Smith as President we should have in that Court . . . three distinguished , learned , respectable lawyers . . . who would declare the Eighteenth Amendment unconstitutional before a cat . . . could wink her eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tammanies of our great cities . . . . Shall Smith Tammanize America , or shall we Americanize Smith 's Tammanies ? " <P> Smith to Farmers . The Indiana Farm Bureau Federation asked to know what Nominee Smith 's procedure on the agricultural problem would be if he were elected . That was an easy one : It did not require the Nominee to reply with a full-bodied solution of the farm problem . He replied that if elected he would at once call farm experts and formulate a concrete plan for presentation in his first message-to-Congress . <P> " I Do n't Know . " A Cuban news-gatherer asked Nominee Smith what his stand was on the Platt Amendment. * The Nominee replied : " I do n't even know what the Platt Amendment is . ... In the course of the campaign all those matters will be taken care of . " <P> Second Stroke ? Having obtained General Motors ' Raskob for his national manager , Nominee Smith was reported to be seeking General Electric 's Young-Owen D. Young , board chairman of the General Electric Company-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . That would be a second stroke in the effort to show the country that there are big business brains beneath the Brown Derby . <P> " Tough Meat . " Nominee Smith often plays golf with Alfred Emanuel Smith Jr . Last week he was asked if his son was easy to beat . " Not by a long shot , " answered the Nominee . " That baby is tough meat ! " <P> <P> *An amendment to the Army Appropriation Bill of 1901 providing for Cuba to be given autonomy , but with a clause in the Cuban Constitution recognizing that Cuba is under U.
