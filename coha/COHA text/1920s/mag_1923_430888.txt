CENTURIES never begin or end at the proper date : the seventeenth died in 1715 and the eighteenth prematurely in 1789 ; what we call the nineteenth century extends from 1815 to 1914 and is the century of Marcel Proust . No other novelist has described its latter years more faithfully . He makes no mention of battles , political campaigns , world exhibitions , visits of crowned heads ; but in their place and with a better sense of relative values he records those small and actual changes in private life to which the changing century gave birth . The invention , not of electricity , but electric parlour lamps , not of automobiles , but taximeters . Anti-Semitism spreading after the Dreyfus affair . Fashion : skirts which expand or deflate , changing mannerisms of speech , palms in their Chinese jardinieres carried from drawing-rooms to make place for the severity of gilt and lacquer . Out of such details he builds a civilization which differs minutely and essentially from that of 1920 or that of 1875 , and which alters imperceptibly from year to year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical novel . At the same time it could be classed as autobiography : it is the story of a hero who , in most respects , is Proust himself ; who spends his youth in a provincial city and his manhood in Paris ; who is received in society ; who does little , in general , but observe a life in which he is too sickly to participate . Remembrance of Things Past has also been called " a laboratory of morals , " " the story of the rise of a family . " It is a comedy of manners as elegant and artificial as Congreve , and it is a Shakespearian tragedy expanded hugely : embracing all of these categories it is limited by none . Incidentally it is the longest novel of modern times . Its every dimension , every member is brobdingnagian . Paragraphs extend over several pages ; a sentence contains three hundred words and a single chapter eighty thousand ; the completed whole , with its million words at the least , is divided into eight books each of which would make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of something as episodic , fragmentary as a  | thousand years in face of eternity . Du cote de Chez Swann ( Swann 's Way ) A l'Ombre des Jeunes Filles en Fleur , Le cote des Guermantes ( I and II ) Sodome et Gomorrhe ( I , II , and III ) Le Temps Retrouve : from 188o till the war , from book to book and decade to decade the novel marches on , endlessly . Its publication in France , still uncompleted , has extended already through nine years , but the American version should appear more rapidly . The task of the translator , although long and responsible , is none too difficult . Proust writes a prose which is less French than international ; it can be rendered into English phrase by phrase , almost word for word ; approximately that is what Mr Moncrieff has done . Except for a few pages of conversation translated uncolloquially , except for a dozen obscure phrases which he misunderstood , his version of Swann 's Way gives the same effect as the original . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . . . . In spite of the hugeness of Remembrance of Things Past there is something modest about the conception of it when compared with many shorter novels . It is no attempt to anatomize genius , like Jean-Christophe ; no Odyssey of Modern Times . Neither is it France , or Three Decades of the Nineteenth Century ; in spite of its historical value it does not even claim to be France During Three Decades of the Nineteenth Century . Simply , it is what one man remembers : the history of one man against a limited social background . Everything is modest except the length , and the length is responsible for its greatest imperfection . Remembrance of Things Past lacks unity . Once I wrote : It is not a work of art , but a gallery in which the separate portraits are works of art . The judgement was true and unjust , for the gallery itself is savantly arranged . Swann 's Way is an introduction , a sort of catalogue to the portraits exhibited by Marcel Proust . In the first of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to subject in a fashion as capricious as memory itself and thus , inconsequentially , presenting situations which he will touch only lightly at first and then leave hanging in suspense , like broken chords , till the distant end of the novel . The second chapter approaches the story from an entirely different angle . It is the history of a love-affair of  | Charles Swann , an affair which began and ended before Proust or Proust 's hero was born , but which had unending consequences : Swann is a sort of foreshadow of the hero , and his adventure a brief parallel , a synopsis of the whole novel . The device is masterly . In the third chapter Proust begins the orderly recital of his memories ; they will march through the seven books which follow , while , one after another , the chords which he had sounded tentatively in Swann 's Way will be resolved . If the plan is excellent the author is not always faithful to his plan ; he forgets it , making excursions into strange territory ; the reader more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remembrance of Things Past is not a work of art , but a gallery in which . . . The painter and his subjects change continually . Every seven or ten years a man undergoes such complete alteration that he might as well be a different person . This is at least true of men of exceptional intelligence , a quality which no one could deny either to the purring social lion of Sodom and Gomorrha or to the little , little boy of Swann 's Way , the boy who lay awake all night when his mother forgot to kiss him . They have intelligence and a name in common , but nothing else : there is not a hair , not a molecule of the finger-nail that is the same . And if Proust as hero has changed , Proust as author has altered more dangerously ; he becomes , in his later volumes , drier , wittier , more brittle than before ; he describes events which he saw accurately , heard brilliantly , but did not , as in Swann 's Way , touch , smell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senses which are inarticulate and fundamental ; it goes deeper than reason ; it has magic . It has the magic of things created : a brand-new world with smells and tastes of its own and ditches where you can make authentic mud pies . In that world is a city , newly created and aged as if by some chemical process ; a city with complete households of servants and masters , crooked definite streets , a church which overshadows them ; and there is evil and pity and pain . You might almost take it for a city of the world you know already , but its objects are brighter and more definite , existing under the white sun of logic . Proust has created an aristocratic society which is vastly more interesting than any which could exist . He has created a great painter , an ambassador , a homosexual baron , actresses of two gen- erations , a great philosopher . We believe in them as types because they are individuals . But chiefly we believe in Swann , Charles Swarm , Jew and bourgeois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales , rejected lover of Odette . He , the arbiter of elegances , followed her to gambling houses or questionable balls ; he waited outside till a friend appeared to carry her a note ; he waited ; there was no answer ; the gas-light flickered ; guests passed more and more rarely into the unapproachable and infernal hall . He waited and expected nothing , consoling himself with the thought that pity and love and knowledge had entered his life again : with his knowledge and his pain and the new belief they gave him in the importance of all life , his life , he bore some resemblance to a first reader of Marcel Proust . The " secret " of Proust is simply that he uses his five senses not as mere recording instruments , but as servants to his intelligence . It is hardly an illuminating secret . However , this directing intelligence of his ( one is forced to mention it so often ) has its own modes of operating which go a longer way towards explaining the qualities of his work . Proust is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts ; not in any philosophical or mathematical sense , but in the scientific ; his novel is a sort of analytic organic chemistry . He decomposes living things ? a smile , a career , a reception ? into their constituent elements so as to define them more clearly . When we speak of analysis in connexion with a novel we think of something dead : " holding an autopsy over an idea , " " analysing the guts out of it . " The effect of Proust 's method is entirely different ; he makes things live . He describes , for example , a great actress in the role of Phedre , analysing not so much her manner of interpretation as the effect which personally he received from it . He decomposes his emotion into its most minute details , and at a certain point one of these minutiae , a detail which corresponds with the reader 's own experience , allows him to enter the procession of Proust 's ideas , to partake of them , to re-create the whole living emotion in himself . Proust 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis . You can not analyse a river , but you may analyse a bucket of water drawn from the river . Proust extracts from his subject , which  | is the stream of personal consciousness , a series of situations which exist like separate bucketfuls of water ; no two of them are quite alike ; he analyses each of them in turn and in this manner creates a simulacrum of his stream of consciousness . This time it is not really a stream . The situations do not move ; it is only by the superposition of one situation on another that he gives the illusion of motion , as in a reel of films . He says , in conscious vindication of his method : " What we suppose to be our love , our jealousy are , neither of them , single , continuous and indivisible passions . They are composed of an infinity of successive loves , of different jealousies , each of which is ephemeral , although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity , the illusion of unity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves , these ephemeral jealousies , and analyse each of them in turn . Charles Swann loves a woman of the half-world : that is the subject of the famous second chapter of Swann 's Way . This main situation is decomposed into ten . Thus , Swann meets a circle of new friends ? falls in love ? attains his love ? adjusts his life thereto ? visits the Verdurin circle a second time to meet a rival ? becomes jealous . . . . One situation follows another ; each is brilliantly analysed into a multitude of minor situations which are defined in turn ; however , between one situation and the next there is an hiatus which , without being noticeable at first , becomes glaringly evident on a second reading . Situations do not really succeed each other for Marcel Proust ; there is a causal , but no temporal connexion between them . Past and present , anterior and posterior , exist for him simultaneously as in the omniscient mind of the Deity imagined by St Thomas Aquinas . This peculiar sort of vision which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of situations which exist simultaneously , is the commentary and explanation of his style . He sees everything at once . Therefore he tries to pack as much as possible into every single sentence : explaining , qualifying , expanding , piling adjective on adjective and clause on clause till the receptacle overflows . His sentences are paragraphs and his paragraphs chapters ; however , it  | is not the paragraph , not the chapter even , but the situation which is the real unit of his work . He is apt to define his situations at incredible length : he analyses a kiss on the cheek in ten thousand words and spends most of a long volume on a dinner party . Apparently he is prodigal of words , but he wastes none of them . Two households with their miniature civilizations meet and mingle in the kiss , and the dinner is not so much a page from the history of French society as that very history . Sometimes a description by Proust reminds me of one of those abnormally long stage directions in which Shaw analyses the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar notations on the furniture , gives a brief history of the characters , catalogues their mannerisms ; however , he extends these observations to limits beyond Shaw 's ambition . At their conclusion the stage is set for anything that may occur : murder , theft , bigamy , we are prepared to taste the fine and particular flavour of any event . There is none ; at least our senses , blunted with melodrama , can realize no event . But events are something else to Proust : a smile is an event ; so is a careless lie , a comprehension , a slight change in attitude whose consequences develop indefinitely into new situations which are analysed in turn , decomposed into others . . . and so the book expands to seemingly all the breadth of life . The nineteenth is Proust 's century : all the congregation of his friends and imitators can not advance him into the twentieth , nor can his personal admiration for Saint-Simon carry him backwards to a seventeenth century which he imagines , perhaps , to be more congenial . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apollinaire or Louis Aragon ; his age is the one which produced Symbolist poets , Henry James , Debussy . He has translated Ruskin into French ; he studied and imitated Meredith ; he can be dated . In France , where literary generations succeed each other almost decennially , he belongs not even to the last generation , but to the one which preceded it . He developed the ideals of that generation so unexpectedly and to such depth that he became independent , in a sense , of time ; however , if any age can claim him it is certainly not ours . Observe the life of Proust , so different from the ideal of contemporary writers . He spent most of it in bed , in an interior room  | hermetically sealed to prevent drafts ; they say he could feel a breath of air three rooms away , and it would set him coughing . He rarely saw the daylight . His work-room was lined with cork to deaden every noise . Flowers brought on his asthma and were prohibited ; women equally , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct evening clothes , to attend a reception in the Faubourg Saint-Germain . Hatred for natural objects ; fastidious ill health ; attraction for everything artificial : his life was the sort which might have been imagined by Huysmans or in the Yellow Book . At least it possessed the forgotten virtue of leisure , a leisure which he used to develop his uncontemporary and unique sensibility . He came to enter so completely into the minds of his friends that before they visited the almost invariable sick-bed of his later years , even before the visit was planned , he knew its hour and its day ; to him the tinkling bell which announced a caller was only a confirmation of something he had projected a long time before . They say he greeted death as a sort of importunate and expected guest . Some months ago he was already saying : I have only so much or so much time to live ; can I finish it ? A few days before he died his novel was finished , as nearly finished as such a work can ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleshed skeleton was complete . He asked afterwards that all its eight books be brought to him . " Find the passages where I have spoken about death . It seems to me that I should know it better now . I want to rewrite the death of Bergotte . " His own death was only a process of externalization ; he had turned himself inside out like an orange and sucked it dry , or inscribed himself on a monument ; his observation , his sensibility , his affectations , everything about him that was weak or strong had passed into the created characters of his novel .  |
