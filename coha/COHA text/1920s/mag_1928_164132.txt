Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Corp . was there too . <P> Mayor Walker , touring the West in the interests of the Brown Derby , visited Hollywood last week . Abruptly , unexpectedly , he took the Messrs . Schenck and Mayer , though not by name , as the text for a sermon to the cinema industry . He warned it to be nonpartisan . He reminded it that public officials such as himself had power over Sunday theatre laws , for example . He said he hoped that cinemen " are not so enslaved that they can be handed over " by two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry " dabble in politics " and choose the losing side it would be " crushed . " <P> The cinema industry was astonished . Producers marveled that so spry a product of the peepul as James John Walker should have failed to appreciate how dangerous it would be for cinemakers to provoke the prejudices of their gum-chewing public , by showing political bias on the screen . They marveled that so shrewd a person as Mayor Walker should have underestimated the shrewdness of the cinemen . The Messrs . Schenck and Mayer called Mayor Walker 's warnings " extremely amusing . " Cinema Tsar Will H. Hays ignored the incident .
