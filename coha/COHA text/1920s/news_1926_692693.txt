txt Evidence accumulates that the general strike in England was blundered ? into rather than deliberately planned . The coal miners thought , or said , that they had been locked out ty the owners . So they went on strike . This was blunder number one . The owners had simply posted in a few districts the scale of wages which they would be prepared to pay after the Government subsidy expired . There was no lockout , and Prime Minister BALDWIN was ready to continue the negotiations for a settlement , and to allow the subsidy to run on for two weeks more . Even before the coal strike was effective , the Trade Union Council threatened a general strike by Monday at midnight if the coal owners did not give way . This was blunder number two . It was also plainly , in intent , a gigantic bluff . The labor leaders did not really expect to carry it out . In fact , they were actually conferring with the Prime Minister ; and talking about ways and means of recalling or postponing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number three was made . This was the unauthorized act of trade union members in preventing publication of The Daily Mail . When news of this reached Mr. BALDwiN , he threw up his hands . If unions could thus get out of control and resort to a course in violation of their contracts . at the same time dealing a blow at one of the most prized of English liberties , the freedom of the press , he felt that he could not go on . Hence his demand that the order for a general strike be immediately and unconditionally canceled . It is because the general strike was thus due to blunder piled upon blunder that there is about It such a sense of unreality . Even the labor leaders who ordered the strike and defend it confess that it is not what it seems to be . They protest that it is not in reality an attack upon the Government , or an attempt to set up a dictatorship of labor in its stead . But this is a defense hardly more than verbal . Whatever they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going straight and stubbornly ahead upon a course which , if they succeed , will mean a revolution , or at least the destruction of the present Govern-li This is why Prime Minister 13. kurtvix can not retreat . So long as.1 the order for a general strike is left in effect , he is bound to regard it as a challenge to orderly government , and to use every means at his cornwand to attack ' and defeat It . Thus it Is a series of blunders on the part of his opponents which have driven this most reasonable and conciliatory of public men into an attitude of unyielding insistence upon the prime condition of peace which he has laid down . Let this oeco be complied with , and there is no doubt whatever that Mr. BALDWIN and his Government would meet the trades unions more than half way in settling the controversy . STAN ?
