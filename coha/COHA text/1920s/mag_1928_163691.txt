Twelve men had spanned the North Atlantic in heavier-than-air machines : no woman had succeeded . Great interest , therefore , centered on the flight of Miss Amelia ( " Lady Lindy " ) Earhart ( TIME , June 11 ) when at length her trimotored Fokker Friendship left the water at Trepassey , Newfoundland , headed toward Britain . Would she disappear from sight , sharing the fate of Mrs. Frances Wilson Grayson , the Hon. Elsie Mackay , Princess Lowenstein-Wertheim ? Would she turn back as Viennese Lilli Dillenz had done ? Would she be forced down as was Ruth Elder ? <P> Doubts were resolved , wonder ceased when the wires flashed word from Wales that Pilot Wilmer Stultz had guided the Friendship safely to a landing in the Burry inlet on the north side of the Bristol channel . Observed " Lady Lindy , " casually : " We are short of gasoline . " She was right . The plane had used the last gallon of fuel . <P> <P> * Alcock , Brown , Lindbergh , Chamberlin , Levine , Byrd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Hunefeld.
