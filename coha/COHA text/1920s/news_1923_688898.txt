Mr. Wylie says : " One of the wells will be located north of Cerro Azul No. 4 , about half way between that well and the Toteco border . where the company 's Cerro Azul No. 16 well is producing more than 9,000 barrels of oil a day , never having shown any water . " Cerro Azul No. 28 , which was drilled a.mile and a half west of the present line of production , is producing oil of 17 Baume gravity . It is a cold oil , whereas all oil we have previously obtained in the southern fields has had a temperature of about 140 degrees fahrenheit and an average gravity of 20.6 . This well came in at a depth of about , 2,850 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Wylie predicts that a production of 100,000 barrels a day can be continued for several years to come .
