Every now and then , someone in Washington " speaks out of turn . " Immediately , the rest of Washington is agog and remains so until it has decided whether the outspoken one is a fool , a publicity seeker , a self-important ass or a wise and forthright fellow . <P> It happened last week . Representative Fred Albert Britten of Illinois , chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the House , took it upon himself to cable Premier Stanley Baldwin of Great Britain and suggest that a select committee from the House of Commons meet with the Britten committee , " preferably in Canada after March 4 , " for " friendly discussion " about applying the much-vexed principle of seapower equality between the U. S. and Britain to all warships unaffected by the Washington treaty of 1922 . When Secretary Kellogg heard about it he as good as called Mr. Britten a fool . " I refer you to the Constitution and the laws , " he said . The Constitution , of course , vests the direction of U. S. foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a criminal offense for any citizen without the Government 's sanction to correspond with any foreign power with intent to influence either country 's conduct " in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States . " Anticipating some such move as Mr. Britten 's , the State Department has lately been circulating copies of the Logan Act in quarters where it might be necessary . <P> Mr. Britten 's reply to Secretary Kellogg was : i ) that he had not contravened the President 's power over foreign policy , since he did not seek to change a U. S. policy but to further the policy of Anglo-American naval equality long-since laid down ; 2 ) that the Constitution charges Congress to provide , maintain and regulate the Army &; Navy , and 3 ) that he had not violated the Logan Act since the subject for discussion was neither a " dispute " nor a " controversy . " " My proposal has to do with peace , " Mr. Britten observed . <P> Many a political pundit , especially the editorial writers of Eastern newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They tartly accused him of publicity-seeking . They said he was trying to show off because he had just become chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee . They reminded people that he was the Congressman who wangled the Army-Navy football game out of the East and onto Soldier Field , Chicago , two years ago-a " publicity stunt " if ever there was one . Moreover Mr. Britten had been notoriously a Big Navy man . His volte face could only be meant as a grandstand play . The political pundits on the sidelines blushed for their country . <P> To such criticism Mr. Britten might have replied that 1 ) he had long loomed as large on the Naval Affairs Committee as its last chairman , the late Representative Butler of Pennsylvania ; 2 ) that publicity-seeking is not necessarily reprehensible , depending entirely on what you seek to promote , yourself or a good idea , and 3 ) that one is not necessarily a Big Navy man out of sheer blood-thirst , that Big Navy men might gladly become Little Navy men if all other Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
