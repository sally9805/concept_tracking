To make his second major speech of the campaign , John W. Davis traveled from his Manhattan headquarters down to Seagirt , N. J. , as a guest of Governor Silzer of that State . He spoke first of Wilson , then of the Oil and Veterans ' Bureau scandals , of the Fordney-McCumber tariff , of Foreign Affairs , of the Ku Klux Klan . <P> A Previous Visit . " This is my second appearance at Seagirt . You will not be surprised if I find my memory turning at this time to the circumstances of my earlier visit . It happened on a hot July day , twelve years ago . I was one of a party of 200 or more who tramped in the dust from the station to the Governor 's house at Seagirt . At our head marched that grand old Roman , Champ Clark , then the Speaker of the House of Representatives . We were calling on a Governor of New Jersey who had just received the Democratic nomination for the Presidency . Most of that company , including myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our errand to assure him of our hearty support and to place ourselves at his service . The impressions of the day were summed up for me by one of my colleagues as we tramped back to the waiting train . Said he : ' When that man comes to Washington there will be a leader in the White House . ' " <P> Corruption . " In 1913 , the lobby was scourged from Washington ; in 1921 , like a flock of unclean birds hastening to the feast , it gathered from the four winds and descended upon the city . The Little Green House in K Street was set up for sinister purposes but partly disclosed . Its occupants and their friends soon proved that they lacked neither zeal nor appetite . <P> " First of all came oil . At the head of the buccaneers as they marched along rode the Secretary of the Interior . And after oil , the veterans . Here was a rare field for enterprise . A year and a half after Congress had appropriated $33,000,000 for building purposes , only 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those in a hospital purchased readymade . If it be true that public interest in these things has waned , is it not a public duty to see that it is revived before the day of judgment comes ? <P> " If the fact is that the public resources have been squandered , is it any answer to say that a budget system has been installed ? If unfit and corrupt men have been put and kept in office and left to their devices , is it a sufficient defense that the Administration was not actually desirous of dishonesty ? If the wounded veteran has been defrauded of the care that was his due , is there any comfort to him in the fact that Congress made lavish appropriations ? " <P> Tariff . " The tariff afforded an opening to hosts of privilege for an assault less direct but far more devastating to the public pocketbook . We are told that America in 1921 was threatened from abroad by an ' impending avalanche of suddenly cheapened merchandise ' from which it was narrowly saved by the beneficent action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
