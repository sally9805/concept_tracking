THE so-called " Baby Bill " has been repealed by Congress ! That is , the famous Sheppard-Towner Act , the " Act of November 23 , 1921 , for the promotion of the welfare and hygiene of maternity and infancy " has been repealed . This does not seem to be clear in the minds of many people . The papers spoke of " the bill " as having been " approved . " And the Editor of Good HOUSEKEEPING wrote me with satisfaction that he had noted in the newspapers that " the bill had been approved . " This is an erroneous impression . There was approved " a bill , " a bill for a small appropriation to carry on the work until 1929 , with the proviso that at the end of that time , upon June 30 , 1929 , the Act itself shall be , and is , repealed forever ! The Maternity and Infancy Act was a permanent act . By refusing to appropriate money for it , this session of the Senate could have crippled it temporarily . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to kill them , was to repeal their bill . And the Senate repealed it . And the House concurred in the Senate 's action . And the Act is repealed . In the face of the vicious filibuster organized in the Senate , this was the best that could be done for the Act by its friends . But in saying that this was the best that could be done , there is no use to gloss over the plain truth that the Act itself was , and is , actually repealed . This means that if anything is ever done by the United States for mothers and babies , an entire new law will have to be enacted ! In my opinion this will be done only when the mothers and babies come into the Senate and do it themselves ! And from the gratuitously scurrilous remarks made about the Children 's Bureau during this filibuster , I should also say that the children had better mobilize at once , or their Bureau will speedily be put out of existence in the same way that the Senate put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ear witness , I should say that strange , unnatural , sinister forces were threatening the Children 's Bureau . As an unbiased observer , I should say that the only way to keep certain Senators from putting the Children 's Bureau out of existence is to put those Senators out of political existence first ! And , Women and Children and Babies ? for it is to you that this article is really addressed ? believe me when I tell you that your tears and cries , your tenderness and charm , will not make any mark upon these particular Senators . They are without knowledge of what hearts are for . They do not care anything for love or beauty or You . All these men care about is to take the Kingdom and the Power , and let the mothers and the babies have the Glory ! The only thing mothers and babies can do to these Senators is to vote , vote , Vote ? against them ! Every woman with a baby , vote against the man who votes against-her ! Vote against the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vote in somebody who is for you , and not against you ! And again ,  | Mothers and Babies , I have come to this " hardboiled " conclusion because I sat in the Senate gallery for thirteen hours , and heard these men talk against you , sneer at you , and vote against you ! I should never have believed it without seeing it . And you never would have known it , had I not just happened to be there to tell you . These things are usually glossed over or put in little , misleading paragraphs . But I am going to write this story of the Senate filibuster against the mothers and babies at length , just as it occurred . It is a long , long story , so settle yourselves to read it . And I am hoping you have more comfortable seats than the one I had for fourteen hours in the Senate gallery . I WAS very busy , that first day of the filibuster against the mothers and babies . And I knew the Senate was very busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mothers and babies as quickly as they could and get on to their other work . It seemed a simple thing to me . It seemed simple to me because , until I got in there where the Senators were talking , and heard what they said , I had n't any idea anybody would be against mothers and babies . I only thought I would run into the Senate and stay half an hour , and that would be enough . And I stayed five hours that first day ! And still the Senators had not done anything for the mothers and babies ! Of course , I soon saw that some of the Senators were against the mothers and babies . So I set myself to stay and watch them ! And after five hours that first day , I went back the second day and stayed all afternoon and until night , nearly nine hours . And still the Senate of the United States had not done anything for the mothers and babies ! And then , at " 8 o'clock and 25 minutes tem .. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried the Baby Bill . They had taken thirteen hours to talk it to death , and they took about two minutes to bury it . I was there the whole time , and saw the way they did it . And this was the way : The Obsequies Began IT WAS Wednesday , January twelfth , in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and twenty-seven . It was " 12 o'clock meridian . " as the Congressional Record quaintly states it , and a foggy day . I was sitting in the Senate gallery , in a good seat ? a front seat , where I could see . The Vice-President announced that the Senate " resumed the consideration " of the bill authorizing appropriations under the Maternity and Infancy Act . I was well pleased at their starting right off promptly on the business in hand at 12 o'clock meridian . But after that start the first thing suggested was that perhaps there were not enough Senators at their desks to do anything ! This annoyed me quite a bit , for all the Senators must have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll-call and a good bit of discussion , it was decided that , after all , enough Senators were present to begin on the mothers and babies . So I leaned forward expectantly , thinking Senator Sheppard would get up and say they would now pass the appropriation for the Sheppard-Towner Bill ! And Mr. Sheppard was there in his seat and ready . But a messenger came in from the House of Representatives . And on his account the VicePresident had to stop the mothers and babies and sign a bill authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to take a silver service set off the cruiser Minneapolis and give it to the city of Minne-apolis ! I did n't see how that could be helped , and I I supposed it was necessary . And then the Vice-President had to go on and sign a bill for a bridge to be built across the Tombigbee River in Alabama !  | This really put me out , as time was flying . And I wanted to get on to the mothers and babies and get out of the Senate to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends that had to be attended to about Fall and Doheny. and about a coal strike for April to which the last coal strike we had would be " a mere flea-bite " ! Naturally it was hard to ignore the coal strike , but what about the mothers and babies ? I thought . And then different Senators had to read different pieces from newspapers . I never did understand why they were allowed to read them right then . But they did it , from newspapers , say , like " The Lynchburg News , " quoting poetry about " God give us men ! " and " Ill fares the land , to hastening ills a prey , Where wealth accumulates , and men decay ! I really like poetry . And at first I was touched to see these men turn , even in the midst of their work , to such a gentle and tender thing . But after quite a bit it began to dawn upon me that if the Senate ever did leave off rambling about , and get down to brass tacks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sitting on the tacks ! And they were ! Assorted Remarks Then the Presiding Officer " laid before the Senate " a lot about finance and the " chaotic condition of the radio . " And then somebody remarked that so many Senators had got tired and left that there were n't enough now to do anything about the mothers and babies any-way ! So somebody went and got some more Senators , and the roll was called again . And Mr. Sheppard began to talk to the Senate in earnest on the Maternity and Infancy appropriation . But just then Mr. Ransdell of Louisiana said that he had read an interesting piece in a newspaper about the prosperity of the South this year . And he asked if this piece could be allowed to be printed in the Congressional Record . And all the Senators politely allowed Mr. Ransdell to have it printed , as it was not at their expense anyway , but at the expense of the taxpayers at home . But some of the Southern Senators did not think that the South was really prosperous this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ransdell about it . And then , for some reason I could not understand at all , the World War was all talked over , and also the farmers of America . And Mr. Bratton of New Mexico said he thought the soldiers ought to be paid something by the Government outright , but that he was not criticizing anybody . And Mr. Smith of South Carolina said something about , if he had ten minutes to avoid death , what he would do . And he quoted a poem about " The toad beneath the harrow knows . " And I thought maybe the toad beneath the harrow did know , but I knew I did n't know , and I did n't think Mr. Smith knew . And then Mr. Stewart of Iowa asked Senator Sheppard politely if he would mind if the mothers and babies waited a minute while he reported about a bridge at Demopolis , Alabama ! And that was already two bridges in Alabama that day ! So Mr. Sheppard said politely to go on about Demopolis , but let that be the last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But Mr. Borah kept talking about a Turkish treaty , and Mr. McKellar thought something about Tennessee , but Mr. Smoot of Utah did n't think so , and so they did n't . Then immigration was taken up . But the Secretary of State , and the Secretary of Labor . and the Secretary of Commerce had written something saying they could n't be responsible for anything , under the circumstances . So immigration was put down . And then Mr. Blease of South Carolina , who was against the mothers and babies , talked .  | And Mr. Bingham of Connecticut , who was against them also , kept putting in . So Mr. Blease talked all the rest of the day . What he talked about was something that had nothing to do with anything . So nobody could ask him any questions about it , and he just talked on . And Mr. Sheppard said that since there was no more time to talk that day , could he just have something printed in the Congressional Record about the mothers and babies ? And they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , he said , tomorrow the Senate would have to " remain continuously in session " ? which meant night and day ? until something was done for the mothers and babies ! So Mr. Blease said , if that was the case , he would " propound a parliamentary inquiry . " And the inquiry was , whether he could be allowed to begin at 12 o'clock meridian , the next day , and keep the mothers and babies waiting as long as his breath held out ! And because of some rule the Senators have among themselves , they were obliged to tell Mr. Blease that he could do so . And Mr. Blease did . Dialogue Verbatim I SHALL not attempt to keep readers in their seats while I tell in detail what happened the next day , as I kept in my seat in the Senate gallery for nearly nine hours . Suffice it to sum up those nine hours and say the Senators did nothing about the mothers and babies . But in a few minutes at the end of that time , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! To make this repeal clear to everybody , here is some of the concluding dialogue of the Senate itself , which speaks for itself : Mr. Broussard ( of Louisiana ) : . . . I should want to insist that the law shall be repealed in 1929 . Mr. Lenroot ( of Wisconsin , spokesman for the Republican Party ) : That is exactly what this amendment proposes to do . Mr. Broussard : It will not do that , as I understand . Mr. Lenroot : That is exactly what it will do . Mr. Lenroot : . . . It provides that the entire Act shall be of no force and effect after June 30 , 1929 . Mr. King ( of Utah ) : . . . As I understand , the amendment is a complete repeal of the Act . Mr. Sheppard ( of Texas , who had fought for the bill with all his legislative acumen and experience , and who now had to give up , defeated by the venomous filibuster which for two days had preceded this dialogue ) : The Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after June 30 , 1929 , and the cooperative work authorized by that Act will then I cease . " SO , readers , like him who preached the funeral oration of Caesar in the Roman Forum , I come to the forum of Good Housekeeping , not to praise this bill , but to bury it ! For the Senators were not content to cripple the Baby Bill . They killed it . They repealed it forever . I was there . And I heard them . And they did it . And it is done . And these men not only talked the Mothers and Babies bill to death . The extraordinary and sinister thing was that they sneered and jeered while they did it ! For hours , that last day , I sat in the Senate gallery , with little lunch and no dinner , and listened to the sneers and the jeers . I do not know why the Senators sneered at the Children 's Bureau . And I do not know why they sneered at the mothers and babies . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard what they said . And this is some of it : IThen the nearly nine hours of the last day were over , when the filibuster had killed the Mothers and Babies bill , Senator King of Utah laughed cynically and said : " I was only on page 30 of this book I was  | reading aloud . It has 150 pages , and I was going to read them all ! " I do not know why Senator King laughed because he had killed the bill for the protection of maternity . I only know that those were the last words said in the Senate about this bill . I only know that these words , spoken with a contemptuous grimace of a handsome , satirical face , were a strange , unnatural hymn of hate over the burial of the Baby Bill . I only know that these strange words were the flowers thrown on little white coffins lowered into little graves , graves not six feet deep and six feet long , friends , but only as long as a newborn baby 's crib . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . And yet it was Senator King of Utah who at this time , and in this way , and in these words I have recorded , said the last word over the Baby Bill . Putting It Up to the States AND now that the Federal Government refuses after 1929 to help the mothers and babies , are no more babies to be born ? . They are to be born just the same ? . Then who is to extend the aid heretofore given by the Federal Government ? The individual State governments must now make the appropriations which the august Senate has refused . The august Senate has made appropriations of money , generation after generation , to teach young America how to raise hogs and chickens and steers . But the august Senate has now refused , even for one generation , to appropriate money to teach the young parents of America how to have children . Is it , then , that the Senate expects the young married people of America to think that wise breeding brings fine farm stock , but the stork brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to go on thinking that fine farm stock comes from fine heredity and fine environment , but that fine human beings come out of the everywhere and into the here ? No ! If the Senate will not allow the United States to carry on the work for the protection of maternity and infancy , the individual states must carry it on alone . And the prospective , parents must require this of the individual states . For prospective parents realize today , for the first time in the history of the human race , their responsibility toward their prospective offspring . They realize that the children do not ask to come to this world , but are invited , and that the invitation entitles them to the best there is in this world . The young people of today ? to the surprise of some of the Senators of the passing generation ? demand just as much for their children as they do for their stock ! A great deal has been said by the passing generation about the lack of ideals in the younger folk of today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the truth . They demand to know the truth about everything they can find out the truth about . They demand to know the proper preparation for the reception in this world of their children , the proper procedure of their arrival , the proper protection of maternity and infancy . And , fortunately , the truth about the hygiene of maternity and infancy can be taught in a comparatively simple , organized , uniform , safe way . Maternity and infancy have , in fact , occurred with sufficient uniformity for certain hygienic rules to be formulated about them , and for the proper application of those rules to bring about the proper results . It is not a rhetorical exclamation then , but a statement of a fact , that only the devil knows why those filibustering Senators were against having the prospective mothers of America educated in these uniform , scientific rules of maternal hygiene . And why the filibusterers of the august Senate spat instead of spoke the words " the Baby Bill , " is a mystery none can know until hearts are unlocked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | But spit the words they did , as though babies were vipers . It has been said , first , but surely without foundation , that some of these " filibusterers " were urged on by the Medical Association . It has been said , but surely without reason , that the doctors of America were afraid , if rules of health were made public , if rules of health were given out free , that doctors would lose their livelihood ! But that is absurd , an , insult to doctors whom we all revere , and it can not be accepted as a reason for the filibuster . It has been said , second , that some of these Senators were instructed by the men of their states to stand up for economy , and that they only happened to hit upon the mothers and babies to economize on ! That may be true . If true , it is indeed short-sighted . For as soon as the mothers and babies realize what has been done to them , they are absolutely certain to economize on these Senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said , third , that some of these filibusterers were not against the mothers and babies at all , but were only against the Federal Government being for them ! It seems that these Senators meant it was none of the Federal Government 's business if their particular states neglected their own mothers and babies . They seemed to mean that their own states had a right ? States ' Rights ? to " treat ' em rough , and tell ' em nothin ' " ! These States ' Rights Senators said they did not believe in uniform legislation , or uniform information , about maternity and infancy . They said they were afraid , if babies were born in a uniform way , they would all be alike , and that they wanted the babies in their states to be different from the babies in other states ! What these States ' Rights Senators really meant , who knows , but this is what they said . Senator King of Utah insisted that bearing children should not be uniform , but that each state should invent some different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion has not yet been adopted by the mothers . Fatherhood may be ? and , one has heard , actually was until fifty years ago ? a little different in Utah from other states . But motherhood is the same there . In general , children are not born in any original way , but in a uniform way , in spite of States Rights ! Also Senator Blease said in the Senate that he did not believe in uniformity of maternity and infancy . But all over South Carolina , even as Senator Blease talked , the little Democrats were coming into the world in the same old uniform way . Senator Broussard of Louisiana believed in States Rights in the matter of maternity and infancy . Senator Broussard thought the Sovereign State of Louisiana ought not to be compelled to have children just as Senator Sheppard 's state had children . But while the Senate talked , the mothers of Senator Broussard 's state were going right on presenting him with little Louisianians , just as the mothers of Texas were presenting Senator Sheppard with little Texans ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filibuster against birth ? Is it , indeed , that any gentleman of the Senate could think back , think back , think back , to any filibuster he ever did win with his mother ? Is it that any gentleman of the Senate could think back to any filibuster he ever did win with his baby ? But still this article is not to praise the bill for the welfare of mothers and infants , but to bury it ! And yet , after June 30 , 1929 , children will still be born , probably . And yet after June 30 , 1929 , if children are born , the mothers must still learn to protect themselves and their children . The doctors say they will furnish all the necessary information to the prospective parents ? And that they will furnish it for fees the poorest can pay ?  | The doctors are referred to the statement in one of Senator Sheppard 's speeches , that in recent years the death-rate of mothers and infants in the United Slates was the highest of any nation in the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies died in these United States in one year , of easily preventable causes ! Where were the doctors with their information while this was happening to us ? The best one can say is that the doctors meant well , but they needed help . And now they must have the help . There must be money appropriated for the purpose of this help . The appropriations must be not only now ? until June 30 , 1929 ? but always , as long as children are born ! The Senate has said that after June 3o , 1929 , there shall be no further cooperation of the Federal Government in this work of protecting maternity and infancy . Therefore the states must now make the most of Federal cooperation in the two years to come , and must be prepared to take entire charge for themselves afterward.  |
