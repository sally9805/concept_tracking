He who finds and restores a lost thing in Germany is legally entitled to a reward of 10% of the value of what has been restored . <P> Therefore a Berlin taxi driver brought suit , last week , against a stingy " Polish " businessman who refused to give him more than 50 marks ( $11.90 ) , when the honest chauffeur found and restored $37,000 in unregistered , negotiable securities . The reward now legally demanded is 16,000 marks ( $3,700 ) . <P> Though the stingy businessman 's name was concealed , last week , it is natural for German reporters to dub him " Polish , " just as Paris and London dailies hang their best anonymous stories on " an American , " often when some prankish Argentine or tippling Russian is to blame .
