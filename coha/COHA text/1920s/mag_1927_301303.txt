They barnstormed the tabernacles of Canada , China , Australia . The man died in 1911-a month before Roberta Star Semple was born . The widow pet-named her baby " Star of the East .

She prospered ; owns property worth approximately $1,000,000 ; is now coaching her daughter in the profession . <P> Roberta Star Semple is tall ; has a soft voice and a clear laugh .
