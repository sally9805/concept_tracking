In 1906 the Church of Christ , Scientist had 635 churches and 85,717 members . Last week the results of a new census were published ; they showed that the Church of Christ , Scientist , during what has been a period of decline or passivity for many other Christian denominations , has now increased its membership to 202,098 and the number of its churches to 1,912 . <P> Coincident with the reports of the success enjoyed by this enterprising faith , were reports of a book which has been written about its founder , Mrs. Mary Baker Glover Patterson Eddy . The name of the book is Memoirs of Mary Baker Eddy ; its author was Adam H. Dickey , who during the closing years of Mrs. Eddy 's life , had been her private secretary . <P> In Mr. Dickey 's book there are astonishing stories about Mrs. Eddy . He explains how she was " fond of dress , " how she manicured her nails every morning , how her house , in the sedate Boston suburb of Chestnut Hill , was fitted with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be summoned . Mr. Dickey relates how Mrs. Eddy requested her disciples to care for the weather . " During some severe New England winters our leader would instruct her workers they must put a stop to the snow which she regarded as a manifestation of error . . . . " <P> He tells the extraordinary tale of the resurrection of Mrs. Eddy 's footman and disciple , Calvin Frye . Frye was found one evening , " unconscious , speechless , eyes closed , apparently breathless , with no pulse and no indication of life . . . . " Frye was placed in a rocking chair . Mrs. Eddy stood over him , in the stuffy room , and said loudly : " Calvin , this cause needs you . Mother needs you and you must not leave . . . .

These enemies were the " mortal minds " most energetic in attacking her beliefs ; they hung like a pack of phantoms around her neat house in Chestnut Hill and she could hear their painful voices screaming in the dark . Once she went for a drive with Mr. Dickey and said this to him on their return : <P> " The enemy have made a law that it hurts me to go on these drives . . . . I do not take these drives for recreation but because I want to establish dominion over mortal minds antagonistic to belief . " In the evenings , after dinner , Mrs. Eddy would sit in the window of her house , staring out at the people who went by . There was tremendous enchantment for her in the tragic and anonymous parade that passes forever in front of all the windows in the world . <P> There came at last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . and asked , in a deep earnest voice , ' Mr. Dickey , I want you to promise me something , will you ?

' <P> " I answered , ' Yes , Mother , I will . . . . I swear before God . . . . ' "
