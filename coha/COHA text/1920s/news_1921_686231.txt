txt Called before a Congressional sub-committee investigating war expenditures today . Brig . Gen. Charles G. Dawes of Chicago said three times that ho was ' not going into politics , thereby squelching the idea that he would become Secretary of the Treasury in the Harding Cabinet . In one of these statements he said he did not wish to enter the Cabinet . When he appeared to testify he said to a newspaper photographer who stopped him outside the House Office Building : " You do n't need my picture . Tin not a candidate for any office ; i do not intend to become a public officer and I 'm not going into politics . " This afternoon , while he was testifying before the sub-committee , he deplored what he said was a tendency to withhold credit from the British for their work in the war . He said the attempts of certain Irish-Americans to check this praise made him " sick . " " I 'm an American , " he said , " and ? ' m not ashamed to praise the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable about them . But I say it . I 'm not in politics , and I 'm not going into politics , thank God : " In the course of a five-hour examination , Mr. Dawes , who was Chief of Supply Procurement for the army in France , struck with sledge hammer blows at critics who had tried , he said , to detract from the glory of . the great achievement by picking flaws and parading trivial faults 3,000 miles away . At times the air was thick with a streak of oaths for which the witness frankly confessed he had neither apology nor excuse . Mr. Dawes was called by Democratic members of the committee to rebut testimony relating to waste and extravagance and particularly with reference to liquidation of American accounts in France and sale of surplus stocks to the French Government . Answering charges that food and clothing supplies might have brought more than the $400,000,000 paid by France , Mr. Dawes turned sharply upon one of his questioners , Representative Bland , Republican , Indiana , and shouted : Says England Lost by Delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool argument that forced Great Britain to hold onto its stocks and attempt to drive a hard bargain . The stuff is there today , rotting . You can not discuss an ex parte question 3,000 miles away . There is no use to try and throw mud when you Were not there to know conditions . Bngland lost billions of dollars by listening to that sort of talk , listening to a lot of people who were afraid of muckrakers at home . They rare raising the devil in England now because England did not sell its supplies when we sold . " Mr. Dawes said as a matter of fact he thought France was charged too nuch . " Here you come now and charge , " he " that we should not have sold iugar . The War Department ordered he sale . The sugar went in a lump of with the junk . Everything was econd hand . We got $400,000,000 for it . Are liquidated every account , and we did t because a lot of big men quit their iwn jobs and went over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till has pending claims that date back o the Revolutionary War . It was a fig job and we are proud of it . In finding fault and hunting responsibility ? u do n't have far to go . Pershing was he Commander-in-Chief and his shoulere are big enough , thank God , to ear it . " Mr. Bland questioned Mr. Dawes about xcessive prices paid for equipment and laterial . " Sure we paid , " he said , " We did n't icker . Why , man alive , we had to win le war . It was a man 's job . We would ave paid horse prices for sheep , if the jeep could have pulled artillery to the ? ont . The man like Johnson there , " a said turning to the Chairman of the mimittee , ' ? was standing at the front be shot at . We had to got him food nd ammunition . Oh , it 's all right now i say we bought too much vinegar and lo many cold chisels , but we saved to civilization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain . " I am no more ashamed to stand up ! re for England than for the United States , " said Mr. Dawes , jumping front his chair and racing around the little committee room . " I thank God that in a crisis like we had there were no bickerings between the English-speaking people . England took over 40 per cent . of our troops . Of course Pershing gave them five . divisions , but it had to be done to save the allied line . " The line of questions shifted constantly , but all the time it came back to prices and vast stores on hand when the armistice was signed . Then diplomats were mentioned . " The diplomatic system of appointing men with pink tea experiences in war . time . " said Mr. Dawes , " was a rotten failure . Sharp WAS all right , but the rest of them were utter failures . It vas all due to the appointment of society men  --  pink tea fellows . Why , we could n't get anywhere . ? Ve had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the diplomats could n't do in three months . " Mr. Dawes also paid his respects to open diplomacy . " Let me illustrate , " lie said . " We needed 80,000 artillery horses . They were in the fields and it was harvest time in France , and everybody : laid there would be a revolution if we attempted to take them . It was my job to get them , and it was my argument that we could not get our men to the front without horses . Unless we got them the Germans would break through . We did n't talk prices ? we just pulled them out of the field . Of course . that sort of stuff could n't be printed . " " What did you get for your horsey when they were resold to France ? " he was asked . 1 do n't know , " he replied , " but the place was low . Of course it was . The horses were taken from the field . It is easy to find fault . Easy to say -. ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there and I think your viewpoint would be different . " Before the supply service was coordinated , everybody , Mr. Dawes said , was pulling in different directions . " We have got the same trouble here , " he added , " with ten Cabinet officers each trying to get everything for himself , regardless of the common welfare . The President ought to stop it . " Mr. Dawes said mistakes were made . Discussing the subject of unified control over the Allies , finally accomplished by the selection of Field Marshal Foch . General Dawes said that the morning after the final agreement on this , " that traitor , Colonel Repington , published it in Time London Morning Post . They let him off with a fine of ? 10,000 , but he ought to have been shot . " The witness declared that General Pershing was always willing to submit to unified control ? " to do anything for the common good . " " The British carne to it , " be said , " after four Years of jealousies , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , they should have done in the first year of the war . It 's just the same with these Government departments down here . They are all jealous of each other . Unless you get an axe you ca n't get them into one common plant " President Harding should hold an axe over the head of a Cabinet member and chop his head off if he should try to spend money on a plan of his own without a co-ordination of the varaaus Governmantal activities . The Government needs a complete reorganization and needs it badly . " DAWES 'S NAME IS OFF LIST . Harding Hopes to Have Him and , Hoover Head Commissions . Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , Feb. ** that come to Republican leaders from those in touch with President-elect Harding Indicate that a revision of the Cabinet slate has eliminated Charles 0 .
