' I must have memorized the lines from the Howells novel in some literature class , in the days when quotations were required as a daily rite . Forgotten in the intervening years , one day in prison I found myself repeating the words . I take them again , perhaps as a shield , while I explain that in this chronicle I make no plea for personal consideration . I committed a crime ; I have no desire to minimize its seriousness . The State meted out its penalty ; I tried to meet it honestly and bravely .

My incarceration of several years was passed in a prison which is ranked as ' one of the best in the country .

I had become familiar with the rasping , screaming voice in which the head matron issued her commands and with the stupid , brutal discipline of a deputy warden who was frequently somewhat intoxicated . I had sat at a table , furnished with chipped granite-ware dishes , ? never sterilized , ? where half the diners were a menace to their neighbors . I knew the purposeless , endless , daily work ; the purposeless , hopeless life . I ventured the opinion that any sane person would judge my present dwelling-place the most loathsome spot in the interstellar spaces . The defense was prompt . ' Well , Miss ? ought to know .

The average visitor or inspector who goes through an institution of this nature sees the buildings , a degree of cleanliness and sanitation , men and women silently working .

At the front of the building are the usual spectacular flower-beds , maintained at considerable expense and infinite care for the benefit of the passers-by . There is a library ? an inadequate one ? and a school ? also inadequate . An inmate may hold subscriptions to several magazines and receive practically an unlimited number of books ; he may , at his own expense , take correspondence courses with the State University 's extension department . Each of these things represents altruistic effort on the part of former wardens or members of the State Board of Control , and one who has suffered enforced confinement must have a lively appreciation of the effect of these balancing , normal influences . But valuable as these ameliorating efforts may be , they are not , in the slightest degree , a solution of the penal problem . are morally more or less white .

' And why pamper a lot of criminals that the courts have gone to the expense of convicting ? ' The modern penologist is not a sentimentalist ; he is a scientist . He feels a degree of responsibility as to prison conditions , but his chief interest must always be in the personality of the offender . Now those who incur punishment have been aptly divided into three classes : Those whose offenses are isolated and are the result of sudden temptation or extreme emotional states ? ' the accidental criminals . ' - Those whose offenses are the consequence of an inherent lack of self-control . Those who , being as it were short-circuited by adverse circumstances from the main herd , have chosen the adventure of ' living without the law . ' I should undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk of moderate means ; my father was a professional man , kindly and honorable . I had a happy childhood and a pleasant youth . Graduating from one of the great universities , I became a skillful worker , a useful member of society . I was very eager to have my life count for something worth while in the sum total of things . I was leading an irreproachable , conventional existence when I made my one horrible mistake . Then came the interlude of prison incarceration . Gone were the amenities of life , the out-of-doors I had loved so well . Beyond the iron gates waited my father , bent with grief , with no reproaches for the anguish I had brought him , only that patient paternal love that has always passed understanding . But I am not to attempt another De Profundis . My story has interest only as it shows something of the economic and social side of prison life . There were twenty-five women inmates of the prison when I entered , and all ? the feeble-minded , the alcoholic and drug addict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dement , the docile and the vicious , the weak and the strong , the highly nervous and the stolid ? all were under one prison dis-r eipline . The prison was , for a few , a : - ) haven of rest ; others endured it stoically ; for some it was continuous unspeakable torture . A year of punishment would not mean the same to any two individuals . To Violet , a big healthy animal with innumerable jail and prison episodes in her past , twelve months behind bars meant a rest and recuperation , al-hough it probably was inconvenient to be separated from drink . When she went back to her kind there would be no stigma , no ostracism . With frail little Gloria it was different . If you know Mrs. Wharton 's Glimpses of the Moon you will recall the golden lady whose many lovers were taken quite as matter of course by her husband and friends . Gloria 's lover was not taken so Complacently by her husband , and she was serving a sentence on an adultery charge . What might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratum may be in another a crime punishable by penal servitude . To my surprise I did not find anyone in the group about me who conformed to my previous ideas of the criminal type . I began to take stock of the conventional prejudices and unfounded beliefs that had been mine when I was a respectable member of society . In the first place , I had never thought clearly enough to differentiate between the legal concept ? the individual convicted , sentenced , imprisoned for crime ? and the metaphysical concept of the offender against the ethical code , the incarnation of sin doomed quite naturally to punishment . Contradictory to but nevertheless associated with these Hebraic notions were memories of the annals of the Jukes family , some vague impressions of the theories of Lombroso . I persisted in the idea that there was a criminal type , different from the main group of human beings . Off in another part of the mental storehouse were the sinners and criminals of fiction and history ? Raffles , Arsene Lupin , and the women of that fascinating species . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of Tess of the D'Urbervilles , pathetic little Hetty of Adam Bede , Hester Prynne , Dahlia Fleming , Lady Macbeth , Hamlet , Peter Ibbetson , and , because the story as written in the Book of Kings has always seemed to me the one perfect biography , David , the shepherd king , who for love of a beautiful woman put Uriah at the front of the battle . Perhaps it is disconcerting to think that the man whose poems are sung every Sunday in the orthodox churches , had he lived in this century , might have been held on a manslaughter charge and been the theme of yellow-press stories . Because of the genius of Hardy , Meredith , and the other authors , these folk had motives and dossiers which I understood perfectly . They were vivid personalities ; the criminal was an abstraction . With amazement and bewilderment I was finding it necessary to reject most of the popular fallacies which I had regarding crime ; those idle theories seemed quite unrelated to the grim facts of this appalling situation . I found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither deathbed confessions nor uneasy consciences asserted themselves to clear those who were unjustly suffering . I learned that the woman serving a forty-year sentence was not necessarily forty times as dangerous as the woman serving one year . What every penologist knows ? and no one else does ? is that disorderly living does far more injury to a community than the few crimes which earn for their perpetrators long terms of penal servitude . If Tess had been restored to society she would have been an asset , not the menace that a diseased , vicious prostitute might be . The modern penal system is credited with several aims besides the elemental punitive one . First : it acts as a deterrent to incipient crime ? a logical reason ; but it might be worth while to ask why it is , and under what circumstances , that the certainty of punishment does not deter individuals from crime . Second : society demands , for its protection , segregation under restriction of its highly antisocial members ? a valid , universally recognized right , but one which implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an asset to society he should be allowed to retake his place therein . Third : a penal system should be remedial , reconstructive , reformatory . My information of what has been accomplished in the institutions designated as reform schools or reformatories has been acquired through reading only , but as to what is being done toward ' re-formation ' in one of the best prisons in the country , what preparation the woman convict receives to prepare her for a successful rehabilitation when the period of incarceration is past , my knowledge is painfully accurate . There was nothing that could possibly be construed as reformatory or constructive in my prison experience ; nothing that would help one to meet the terrific problem of facing life later and earning a livelihood . Some of the saddest memories of prison life are those of the outgoing prisoners . A woman would always know to a day how much time remained of her sentence . There would be joy when it was a year , six months , one month . But toward the end , especially with those that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fear of going back into a hostile world . It was not unusual for a woman to go out who had no friends or home to receive her ; no certainty of employment . She was usually an unskilled laborer , with only the few dollars given her by the State to support her until work could be obtained . And it is superfluous to add that it is not easy for an ex-convict , no matter what her story , to obtain work . The statistics that give the percent . ages of recidivists are astounding to the uninitiated . This prison rated forty-five per cent and it is the lowest figure I have seen quoted for any penal institution . I am inclined to think this percentage is underrated . After what I have seen of the mediaeval methods of treating the prisoner , and since I know something of the difficulties of life after one has left prison , I wonder that the percentage is not one hundred . During my incarceration one poor chap was released after twenty years ' imprisonment . Three days later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner of the inner yard , having crept back ? nobody knew how ? past the guard and over the great wall . The matron who told me of the incident considered it a tribute to the beneficent atmosphere of . the place , whereas it was , of course , a ' proof how utterly the unnatural prison-life unfits one for this modern , complex existence . Sadder was the story of the man who , after waiting years for a pardon , went mad less than a week after his release . It is upon the return to the world that the test comes , not only of the prisoner but of the prison . If the purpose of the prison is to prevent crime as well as to punish the criminal , some account should be taken of the means of restoring the delinquent to society . I and these other women have failed somehow ; but with few exceptions we shall return to our communities . Do you expect us to come back better or worse for the arid , soul-wrecking years ? Are we coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untaught , unskilled workers ? Is there anyone to help us make the first difficult adjustments to a normal life ? Please do not readjust your halo and say that someone ought to have attended to these things . No one has ? or will , until there is a more general understanding of the basic facts regarding corrective institutions . It is easier to get accurate information regarding the ex-prisoner 's purse and economic status than it is to ascertain her mental and spiritual reaction to the imprisonment . Her conduct will be governed by her mental life , and the future conduct of an offender is a matter of certain importance . When a woman is put in prison , unfortunately she remains a human being , with all the instincts , emotions , reactions of a creature who is alive . The routine and discipline of the prison shut down on normal action and on this instinctive and emotional life , and hold the woman in a constant state of emotional stress and conflict . I believe the aftermath of the years of abnormal mental repressions , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the most serious consequence of prison life . Consider the fact that we were not allowed to go out of doors for ten successive months ? from the middle of September until the following July . During the midsummer months , when the heat was most intense , we were allowed out of doors but two hours and a half during the week : two hours on Saturday afternoon ; a half hour on Sunday . ( How we dreaded Sunday ! ) That is one bit of prison discipline . Souls need sunshine and fresh air just as much as bodies do . I first saw the other women prisoners on a Saturday afternoon , when permission was granted for the two hours out of doors . Huddled against the shade , of the great stone wall was a group of women the like of whom I had never seen before . There were no beautiful , thwarted adventuresses , no regal Clytemnestras or Lucrezia Borgias , no lynx-eyed Raifiettes . There was the sorriest company of human beings imaginable : haggard middle-aged women ; young girls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals , delinquents , offenders against the majesty of the law , were really here not so much because they were wicked ' as because they were physically handicapped , mentally defective , products of an inferior environment . I found unskilled workers , illiterates , foreigners unacquainted with the life of a new country . The majority were penniless ; many were friendless . There were economic , pathological , sociological causes for the failure of these women to be assets instead of the liabilities they unquestionably were to their communities . And these pariahs , these pathetic outcasts , products of poverty and misfortune in many cases , were the dead and poisonous matter , foreign and dangerous to the social body , ' of which the sociologist speaks . There were a few who had long sentences , but the most would return to society after an incarceration of one or two years . There was no thought given as to how the human beings who had to bear years of this unnatural life were to survive it ; no consideration as to the problem of rehabilitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on benches in the shade of the great wall ; a guard , gun on shoulder , paced above them , a matron sat in front of them . The women were dressed in faded , patched blue dresses ; to me they all appeared old , bedraggled , hideous ; it did not seem possible that I could ever mingle with them . Vainly I said to myself that I was infinitely more guilty than any of them , because I had had the training , the advantages of birth and environment that should have made impossible my crime ; that my clothes were as hideous as theirs . But I could not go near them . However , my isolation was of short duration ; first came Selma and Margaret , then Violet , Sally , and Fannie ; one by one , the entire group drifted over and surrounded me . They were very curious , although they meant only to be . friendly , but the vociferous sympathy was distasteful to me then . Later I came to know and like and be deeply interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curiosity , gossip , generosity , in about the same proportion as outside prison walls . Never have I seen people who loved to sing as did these women . Their only song books were some Moody and Sankey hymnals , evidently bequeathed to the institution years before . The head matron played the breathless little yellow organ , and as she evidently deemed it ungodly to strike a lively tempo on Sunday , the women sang Rescue the Perishing , ' Go Bury Thy Sorrow , ' to the slowest time I have ever heard . The most dolorous hymns were without exception the most popular . My friend , the little assistant-matron , was musical and sang very well , but the matron jealously held her prerogative as music master . A friend sent me some song books , compiled for community singing , and on Saturday afternoons , when we could not go out of doors , we gathered around the organ and sang . How the girls loved it ! ( Have I said before that the women prisoners , regardless of age , were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now see Marie , so pimply and soiled , closing her eyes in ecstasy as she swung into the chorus of ' Love 's Old Sweet Song ' ; and the saffron-tinted Ellen adored Ye Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon , ' which with joyful abandon she sang exactly off key , although I am sure she did not have the vaguest idea what a brae of Bonnie Doon might be . And Margaret ? she must have been a dear girl once , with her pretty reel-gold hair and bright brown eyes ; now she was stooped and haggard . They call me a criminal drunkard , ' she gravely explained to me . Margaret loved ' America the Beautiful . ' To think , ' she said in a scandalized tone , ' I never knew that song ! If you ' 11 learn it to me before I go , I ' H give you my Easter lily . ' Her Easter lily was her most cherished possession ? a bedraggled remnant in a battered tin can . It would have been an excellent and practical thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have stayed in the sewing-room after supper to sing , under the direction of a competent leader . They could have learned the fine and dignified religious hymns for the Sunday service , the beloved folk-songs , and some of the better vivacious popular music . It would have been a brief period of respite and happiness , and surely a Christian State ought not to begrudge that . I was always amused by Violet , a disreputable old soul who in a former existence must have been a pirate . We all admired Violet for an Oliver Twistish performance . On wash days a lunch of dry bread , syrup , and the indescribable coffee was served . The syrup was always heavily watered , but this morning it was water slightly tinctured with syrup . ' Pass the water , ' said Violet in her stentorian tones , pointing to the syrup jug . Of course she was promptly reported to the deputy warden and locked in her cell for two days , with orders that she was to have nothing to eat . She was at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed Elijah might profitably have envied the efficient , if mysterious , manner in which Violet was kept supplied with food . And it is with a smile that I recall dusky Lily Belle who , in spite of her name , was a very incarnation of Topsy . On Christmas Eve a lusty wailing was heard from Lily Belle 's room . The night matron hastened to investigate . What in the world is the matter , Lily Belle ? ' she asked . I 'm crying because ? is crying , ' was the reply . The matron came to my door , and I assured her that I was quite calm . Lily Belle 's vociferous grief stopped instantly . Well , I thought I heard her crying ' cause she was here at Christmas time ? and she ' s been good to me ? so I cried , too . ' A nice tribute of friendship , was it not ? There were two methods of amusement furnished by the State : the moving pictures , which were occasionally shown Sunday afternoons , and a phonograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners of cinema privileges ; but if the officers were good-natured we sometimes saw one movie each month during the winter . Sentimental plays with very , very happy endings were most popular , and the comedies wherein the actors threw dishes and furniture at one another , fell indiscriminately from mighty cliffs , housetops , balloons , and telegraph poles into startling predicaments , were hailed with howls of laughter . Roars of mirth invariably greeted anything not comprehended . A war play was shown in which an American army officer , maddened by the tortures which his wife , captured by the Germans , had undergone , retaliated with a revenge that was unique and sickening in its pictured detail . The tragedy was mistaken for a burlesque comedy , and as the intensity deepened the mirth increased , until , when the awful climax was reached , my neighbor was wiping tears of delight from her cheeks . Another time I was interested in the tense interest of Estelle , who sat at my left . Now Estelle was a connoisseur in prisons , having served sentences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lives long enough she will probably work through to San Quentin . In the screened play there was a hot pursuit of a thief and , as Estelle had been the object of numerous similar pursuits , I thought her sympathy would be entirely with the culprit . But instead her reaction was quite the conventional one . ' Get him , ' she muttered , as a detective appeared ; ' Catch him , ' when the police dasled in ; and when the guilty one was driven off in a patrol wagon she subsided , content . The phonograph played for two hours every Saturday and Sunday night , and was not altogether a blessing . The collection of records was limited and mediocre , and to one who had musical discrimination it was agony to have to listen to some of the blatant tunes played over and over again , year after year . Thinking to be philanthropic , I asked to have some records of a higher standard sent to me . Their reception was interesting . Tosti 's Serenade , ' sung by Gluck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' Viennese caprice ' was received with silent tolerance , but Galli-Curci 's Valse Song ' from Romeo and Juliet was always the signal for hearty laughter . As the lovely voice rose with incredible delicacy and brilliance to the dramatic climax , it would be drowned by roars of Gargantuan mirth . Two talking records were very popular , and everyone always laughed exactly in the same places : as Cohen spills his soup , and when Uncle Josh first ate ice cream at a remarkable ultrafashionable New York reception . Custom never staled , age never withered , the infinite variety of these jokes . IV Women offenders as a class present several distinctive points which make them and their redemption ? if there be a possible redemption ? a problem unlike that of the male delinquent . In the first place , the average of intelligence is much higher in the men 's prison than in the women 's . There are always men of good mental capacity and fair or even superior education on the list of male criminals . There were few women of average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more who served sentences in the course of my own durance only two besides myself had attended a secondary school . I was the only woman with more than a high-school education , the only one trained for a profession . Of course there are obvious reasons for this difference of mental type : the woman of the higher class , social or mental , is not subject to economic stress or temptations as is the man ; she is less adventurous ; she is more fearful of overstepping the conventions . If she does break the law she is not so liable to conviction as a man . My statistics have an approximate accuracy , although my methods of compiling them might annoy a scientist ; but as every State publishes annual or biennial reports of its corrective institutions , these can be consulted if exact information is desired . I have not the general , classified knowledge such as a biologist might have of the Coleoptera ; I knew these delinquents as a woman knows her neighbors . I have written the names of all the women I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then made my deductions from this list . I can remember just one hundred and four individuals . Three of these were serving life sentences ; five others , sentences varying from six to twenty-five years . Two were incendiaries . Three had been found guilty of perjury . About thirty were guilty of some form of theft , most often petty larceny . One girl had been sentenced for four years for stealing a dress valued at twenty-five dollars . That same month two other young girls had been sent to prison from another court for theft of clothing valued at less than fifty dollars , for which they were to serve nine months . Number 20012 had forged a note , but she was an accessory to crime rather than a principal ; she would not have had the initiative to do the thing alone . By far the heaviest percentage of convictions was on the adultery charge . More than fifty per cent of the women with whom I came in contact during this period were held on this or relative charges , which would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants of the women 's prison who were members of an ancient profession . Before the conclusion is reached that prison is exactly the place for the prostitute , it might be logical to ponder several things . It is annoying to consider that there are at large in society individuals just as guilty of antisocial conduct as some of its convicted members ? a fact which condones no offense , but which must be taken into consideration if the penal problem as a whole is studied . Further , fifty prostitutes must have been a very small percentage of the members of their calling in the State ; the segregation of such a minority could hardly be considered a remedy of the social evil . In this State the penalty for the offense under discussion varied from one to three years , so that society had but a brief respite from the presence of this group . What is of the utmost importance is that these women , practically without exception , would return to the same sort of life after they left prison . The more intelligent would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were few intelligent ones . The prostitute is not to be dismissed with a clever epigram or with a con- demnation of her wickedness ; she is distinctly the product of poverty , bad environment , inferior human stock , sometimes ? but infrequently ? of misfortune . The pathetic creatures that get into prison have none of the allure or picturesqueness of the demimondaine featured in popular plays on the New York stage . I saw but one of this type ? Pearl Puhr . When the exotic Pearl came to us she was delightful to look upon , with her chic frock and an exquisite coat built on the lines and with the color which bespoke a good maker . Pearl had dignity , assurance , poise . She told of her car of excellent make , her talking machine of the latest de luxe model , her child in an Eastern school . She had been the head of a large and flourishing establishment . ' I asked her why and how the fall from all this comfort and luxury . She was tremendously disgusted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took all of my girls down to vote for the Democratic candidates , and the Republicans got in , and they had us pinched because we voted the wrong way . Now , if we had never voted ? ' I may have this story confused as to detail . Possibly Pearl voted for the Republicans . However , someone , Democrat or Republican , had pity on her plight , and within two weeks after her entrance to prison she was released on a writ of error ? the only case where I saw the writ of error used . The Wassermann given when she entered showed a positive test . She had never denied the nature or the prosperity of her trade . If I should follow the episode of Pearl with that of Harriet , a young girl who had left high school in her first year to marry , and a few months later to elope with a book agent , ? arrested within two days , sentenced within a week , ? silly , irresponsible , unmoral , sweet-tempered , never vicious , you would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only that justice be enforced , but that the prison may serve a useful purpose . V I regret that I have not a pen facile enough to give you clear portraits of these women I knew so well . I do not want to write sob stuff ; there were unjust sentences ; two innocent women were imprisoned ; there was brutality ; but these things are of minor importance . Any attempt at a solution of the penal problem must always be centred about the individual delinquent , and until there is an intelligent attempt to learn why the woman has failed , until an effort is made to make her wholesome and self-reliant , physically and mentally , to make her antisocial life not worth while , all talk of prison reform is idle . The old idea of the offender is the metaphysical one , based upon the theory of the freedom of the will and the infallibility of the conscience . The will was a general director of conduct ; the conscience was an infallible consultant in deciding between what was right and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volition , like any other phenomena , as subject to natural laws , inevitably the results of definite antecedents ? heredity , education , environment , all previous experiences . A psychical phenomenon must have just as definite a cause as would a physical phenomenon , and one must understand the facts in each case . This later theory is so universally accepted that it seems superfluous to quote it ; but the fact remains that practically all penal servitude is based on the older theory that we who have offended are deliberate trangressors and therefore merit condign punishment . Perhaps I did ; but not all of these others . Number 20001 came to prison dressed in her best , a percale bungalow apron , which had been freshly lawn . dered when she left the jail eight hours before for the trip across the State on dusty railroad trains . She was much distressed over her untidy appearance when she arrived . Nineteen years old , fair mentality , good-natured . Her family manor had been an old box-car , refitted as box-cars sometimes are for residential purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a dress which was being made in the sewing-room for a girl who was about to leave . Now these going-away gowns , although practical , are not anything to get excited about , but to Number 20001 a wonderful possibility arose : ' When I go away can I have a new dress ? ' When she left prison she had her first new dress , but she had been taught no trade and shown no way to earn honestly other new frocks . Number 20002 had the appearance and pertness of a Paris street gamin . She was pretty except that her two front teeth were missing ? a loss which caused her deep despair . How to obtain money to have these missing teeth replaced was the one problem of her life . She met it romantically and , let us hope , satisfactorily . She wrote a suitor that if he would send the money to pay for the new incisors she would marry him when she was free . She told of a hard , barren childhood , as the drudge in a farmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ten years old . No , I never went to school . I wish you could learn me to read . It 's fierce being on the street-car when you ca n't read the signs . And you know how them street-car conductors talk , so that you ca n't understand them . If I ai n't never been that way before , I do n't know where to get off . ' And she left prison without learning how to read the street-car signs . Number 20004 was a big Polish woman , a widow of thirty-five , the mother of three children to whom she was devoted , an excellent cook , an indefatigable but inefficient worker , erratic to the last degree , an illiterate , with the mentality and unmorality of a seven-year-old child . When I was housekeeper in the matron 's home , Number 20004 was assigned as my assistant . Ours was an exciting friendship ; on Monday she would love me to distraction ; on Wednesday I was her bitterest enemy ; by Saturday the chances were even as to whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One . She broke every rule in the institution and was never punished . She said to me one day , ' The reason the matron hates you so is because you are quiet and polite . Act like you was a fool ; she likes that ! ' And a demonstration would follow of servile obsequiousness . But even to evade the matron 's frightful tongue I could not stoop to that . Number 20004 would sometimes become greatly aggrieved . " T ai n't fair ; I learn you how to make swell pie-crust ' nd gravy ' nd such things what I can . You should learn me how to read in English ; then I could read them swell receipts ' nd get a swell job in a restaurant . ' One day she picked up an advertisement that had an attractively colored picture of gold-and-brown biscuits . R-o-y-a-1 B-a-k-i-n-g P-o-w-d-e-r , ' she slowly spelled , following the letters with her chubby finger . ' That says , " Parkin ' House rolls .

' She left before our school was started , but it is doubtful whether she would have had the concentration necessary to learn to read . Number 20005 was of the small and exclusive class known as ' model ' prisoners . One did not earn this distinction ? nor deserve it for any perceptible reason . The implication was that the model prisoner had never been reported for the further degrees of punishment ; the title was supposed to designate docility and abject submission to the endless code of rules . In reality a model prisoner was either a high favorite with officials or else of so negligible and colorless a personality as to be practically invisible to the eye . Number 20005 had ponderous feet that stumbled and blundered along , a big clumsy body , above which , to one 's surprise , was a handsome face ? a face that would have been strikingly beautiful had it been lighted by personality and intelligence . There were strong regular features , thick , lustrous brown hair , and large dark eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her education ; confidentially she told me that she wanted to learn how to use big words , the popular conception there of a higher education ; but the poor dear could never get beyond the first part of the Third Reader , although she pored over this with endless patience .

She loved to help me with my flower garden , and the dexterity with which she transplanted the young plants , her interest in each one , were pleasant to see . ' Whatever I plant grows ; see ! ' And it did . She braided quaint old-fashioned rugs ; she was a wizard with the flatiron , the warden 's finest laundry work always falling to her share . She earned one cent a day , and although outside of prison she had five children it never occurred to her to ask for more . She was a model prisoner .

One day he disappeared and Number 20006 , who was decidedly of the clinging-vine type , transferred her brood and her affections to another man with whom she lived without benefit of the clergy ? hence the prison sentence . Some of the children were parked in a charitable institution and others with charitable folk throughout the county . Number 20006 was toothless , anmmic , undernourished ; her knowledge of housewifery or sewing was practically nil . One does not have to be a rabid prison-reformer to realize that she needed nourishing food , instruction in the responsibilities of maternity , artificial teeth , and a working knowledge of the basic household-arts , instead of the barren drudgery of penal discipline . I was always fond of Number 20007 , a little German woman whose worthless husband had left her with several children to support . She showed me her wedding picture ? she stiffly happy in an atrocious veil , he resplendent with a red carnation in his buttonhole . He was a fine man , ' she said ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many children . ' This woman had earned her living by scrubbing and cleaning two saloons . She stole some money , ? ' I needed it something fierce , ' ? was caught , convicted , sentenced to a year in prison . Her children were put in a charitable institution during her incarceration . She was a tireless worker , good-natured , kindly . After her sentence expired , she returned to the city with ten dollars in her purse , no job , a branded criminal . Would it not have been more wise and merciful if the State had sent Number 20007 back to her flock with a trade , with some craft or knowledge that would make her self-reliant and self-supporting ? Consider the story of Number 20008 , a lovely young creature , slender and lithe and frail , with a skin like ivory and gorgeous auburn hair . Her people had been nice small-town folk in a West . ern state . She had met and married a good-looking stranger with charming manners . Later he proved to be a member of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank robbery . She herself had been involved sufficiently to draw a light sentence . She had accepted the standards and the cheap cynicism of the man she loved , but basically she was still the honest small-town girl . Of all my pupils she was by far the most superior , keenly appreciative and responsive . Had the stage directions been just a little different , she might have been a beautiful and talented college girl . She talked to me many times of her future . ' I do not mind this much , because I had rather be near my husband than any place else ; but I do wish that I could be using this time to prepare myself to be selfsupporting after I leave here . ' Number 20009 would have been classed by the old school of penologists as a confirmed criminal ; the modern psychiatrist might interpret her mental processes otherwise . Born in Sweden , she migrated to the United States when a young girl . Meagre education ; employed as a house servant ; married ; one child . She had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty larceny . She took much pride in telling of these exploits and of her adroitness in theft ; offered to tutor the younger girls in the gentle art ; had a mania for collecting things ? bits of ribbon , bright paper , books , scraps of cloth , from which she would make amazingly clever bits of fancywork . She was an expert seamstress and a good cook ; worked constantly with a nervous energy that made one pity the poor , frail body . Fifty years old , she looked seventy , except that her hair was brown , abundant , and well cared for . She was very generous . At Christmas she gave me an elaborate pincushion , made entirely from materials which she had stolen from me ! Immaculate , almost austere in her personal habits . I asked her why she stole when she was able to earn a good living by sewing or doing housework . ' Always I would think , " Now I have got a good place and these folks are good to me and I can always have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would just make me take it . This last time I was orking for a lady and she was good to me , and I said , " Never again . " And she had a parasol that I thought was the homeliest one I ever saw ; and I stole that parasol , and some of her stockings that were too big for me , and some money ? and here I am . The judge said he could give me two years or ten , and I told him to give me the ten years . Now I will die here , I hope . I ca n't make myself behave when I am outside . ' She had lived in the state less than two months when she was arrested . The taxpayers will have to care for her for ten years . Although I had lived for several years with women whose past experiences might seem to warrant it , I had heard no obscenity and little profanity ; but when Number 20010 came a reign of terror began for all of us . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . The intelligent matron , who was responsible for several radical improvements , was genuinely interested in the girl , only twenty-three years old . The newcomer had previously run away from a girls ' reformatory and had been traveling with a street carnival when arrested . The matron tried to direct the young thing 's tremendous energy and vitality into useful channels , and the girl tried to respond . For several days she would be docile and work energetically ; then an explosion would follow that shook the very stones in the hardened walls . With confinement she became increasingly irritable and unmanageable , and it was finally necessary , for the protection of the matrons and the other inmates , to have her permanently locked in her cell . Fortunately ? or perhaps unfortunately ? her sentence was a short one . She was diseased ; unquestionably there was mental aberration ; but she went forth more dangerous to the community than a burning brand thrown at random . If , instead of the stereotyped term of punishment , the psychosis had been dealt with intelligently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twelve months but when she was healthy , physically and mentally , and ready to be a useful member of society , the prison would have been performing a function quite different from its present one . Perhaps Number 10001 should have headed my list , as she was the oldest inhabitant ? eighty-four years old ; she had been in prison since she was fifty . For thirty-four years she had lived under the silence system of a rigidly disciplined penitentiary where daily , almost hourly punishments were being meted out for violations of this code , but she remained the most fluent conversationalist I have ever heard . I do not know whether this was because she was a woman , or because talking is a human trait not to be overcome in so short a time . Several years before my arrival she had been granted some species of respite and had gone to live with her son . She was not welcome , ? probably illtreated , ? and had come back to the prison as a place of refuge . The girls were always kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be received only on holidays or when one was allowed to have a visitor ? were always shared with old Number 10001 . She received many little gifts from the girls , but these were always given away immediately , because Number 10001 also enjoyed the /tile of benefactress . She thriftily gave where returns were surest . As a steady contributor , I was the recipient of many presents : bizarre bits of fancywork , much-thumbed religious mottoes in German ; little cracker animals , her ; gift of gifts ? it meant self-sacrifice to ' give one of these away . Number 10001 had lived for eighty-four years on an interesting sphere in an interesting universe . Races of men had flourished and declined ; men and women had lived , and loved , and hated , and worked , and played , and died . The world held African jungles and American skyscrapers , mountain peaks and Blackburnian warblers , clever books and beautiful music , molecules and theorems and political parties , fossils of dinosaurs , and etchings , and sonnets , and great bridges ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of Number 10001 . Of the store of knowledge of the human race , of any traces of intellectual curiosity , her mind was as barren as that of an animal . She was very pious , and would expatiate endlessly on religious themes . The old apple-trees in the prison yard had come from seed that she had planted when she was a newcomer there , and it was she who had planted the four peonies , the bleeding heart , the two rosebushes ? the only attempts that had ever been made to introduce beauty into the sterile space . That there is among delinquents a high percentage of those of inferior or subnormal intelligence is now a matter of almost universal information . It does not follow that delinquency and the inferior mind are synonymous . But realization of the generous percentage of those mentally handicapped among offenders ought to suggest that punishment is not the correct idear , ' as Mr. Salteena puts it . And this insight into one determining factor of crime suggests others ? alcoholism , bad environment , poverty , bad heredity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies offenders at first hand , there comes a realization of the weakness of any general causation-theory , because instead of exact general classifications there will be Monica and Helene and Martha ; and when one tries to fit them into these predetermined pigeon . holes it can be done only by a manipulation of facts . One loses sight of Monica and her problems and finds only an automaton that does not bear much resemblance to the real and likable woman . And it is this real woman we must know , if we wish to help her .
