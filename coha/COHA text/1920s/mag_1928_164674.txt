The State Department 's activity this summer almost suggests that Secretary Frank Billings Kellogg functions best when the rest of the Government is , for the most part , away from Washington . Last week , with plans nearly matured for the multilateral treaty signing which is to crown his regime , Secretary Kellogg announced definite progress on the long-tangled China problem . In Nanking , a tariff treaty was signed by the U. S. , granting de facto recognition to the Nationalist regime of the Chinese Republic ( see p.23 ) . The Navy Department prepared to withdraw from Chinese waters some of the 56 U. S. warboats now there under command of Admiral Mark Lambert Bristol . <P> Secretary Kellogg notified the Republic of Panama , where people were being jailed by scores last week in preparation for a presidential election , that the U. S. had received complaints , but perceived no disturbing evidence , as yet , of electoral frauds in Panama . As in the rase of Nicaragua , the U. S. has a treaty right to see that Panama has fair elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
