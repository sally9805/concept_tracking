txt RADIO PROGRAMS . Plea for Those Who Balk at " What Public Wants . " To the Editor of The New York Timea : The high wires on the roof of a greatpowered radio plant , etched against the sky , give a sense of the infinite  --  the same sense that church spires somehow never fail to bring  --  and that many a church service does not . A sense of the future is in these wires , too , a feeling that we are upon the threshold of stranger things than either philosophy or physics ever dreamed of . But when  --  oh , when  --  will this new super-power be used as the vehicle for other things than the commonplace , the trivial ? " Ai n't It a Shame to Steal on Sunday ? " ? upon one radio program last week must , of course , have had a wide appeal , and I am aware that most radio sets are installed in homes because the males of the family want to hear the baseball scores at a minimum expenditure of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who balk at " what the public wants " lipten in ? Surely we should be allowed our turn . " Bits From the World 's Best Literature " radthed the other evening sounded like a step in the right direction , but many of us would like a longer stride . When will Julia Marlowe ( or a voice like hers , if such a voice there be , which I very much doubt ) read us Shakespeare by radio ? Thousands would enjoy it and through it the millions might be converted to Shakesperepropaganda of a , very safe and sane sort . The result might even cast doubt upon Mr. William H. Brady 's classic of the theatre-ticket broker who said : " Honest , Bill , I ca n't sell Shakespeare ! " What a triumph if we could sell Shakespeare by radio ! ALISON KEYES . Brooklyn , N. Y. , June 1 , 1922.
