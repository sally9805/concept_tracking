txt Plans to tie up the bonus are under consideration by the Ex-Service Men 's Anti-Bonus League and a committee of lawyers has been appointed to determine whether injunctions can be brought against the Secretary of the Treasury , the War and Navy Departments and the United States Veterans ' Bureau with a view to preventing the payment of a single dollar or the issuing of a single certificate of insurance . These plans , made secretly at a meeting held last Wednesday , became known Yesterday when Captain Knowlton Durham , National President of the League . admitted that a taxpayer 's action to test the constitutionality of the law was contemplated and that if it was brought 4,000,000 ex-service men and women might not get the bonus for years if ever . The meeting , which brought together the National Administrative Board of the League , was held at the Columbia University Club . Captain Durham presided and others who attended were Charles H. Baetjer , Richard S. Buck , Colonel Benjamin F. Castle , George Brokaw Compton , Charles Curie , Boudinot Keith , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. 0 . Rothschild and Theodore S. Watson . It was called to decide whether the League should disband , in view , of the passage of the bonus bill over the veto of President Coolidge . It resulted in a decision to continue to fight the bonus . The discussion centred on the possibility of bringing a taxpayer 's suit and a committee was appointed to take the matter under advisement . That committee consists of Colonel Henry L. Stimson , exSecretary of War ; Allan C. Orrick , Mr. Compton , Mr. Curie , Mr. Keith and Mr. Rothschild . May Test Constitutionality . The proposed suit is so novel that members of the committee who were reached last night were disinclined to discuss It . Captain Durham , however , regretting that the matter had become known , made the following statement : " At the request of the Administrative Board , I am asking all members of the board who are lawyers to let me have their preliminary opinion upon the question of the constitutionality of the Bonus law . It is the puropse of the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Committee shall decide upon the advisability of originating a proceeding to test this question . The matter was discussed at the meeting of the board , and it was the unanimous decision of the members present that if there should appear to be any justification for such an action the league should proceed at once to take the necessary steps to determine the matter in some appropriate court proceeding . " Section 8 of Article I. of the Constitution of the United States gives the Congress power to ' pay all debts and provide for the common defense an general welfare of the United States . ' It also gives the general power to raise and support armies and to provide and maintain a navy . Having in mind that the States reserve to themselves all powers not specifically delegated to the Federal Government , we are considering whether Congress , under this General Welfare clause , can appropriate billions of dollars to the use of one class of its citizens upon the theory that thereby it is promoting the general welfare of the country . " Many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The law as passed purports to be an act to adjust the compensation of World War veterans . but only those are entitled to its benefits . who held the rank of Captain or under . Thus it does not even apply to all those in the class . " It is not comparable with pension legislation . Civil War pensions have always applied either to disabilities received in service or general disability irrespective of service or old age benefits . No pension law for able-bodied : veterans of the Civil War was approvon until 1907 , when it was applied to those over 62 years of age . " Many of us believe the bonus was not a legal obligation because when the War Risk Insurance bill was passed it was distinctly stated that it was in lieu of pensions . The then Secretary of the Treasury wrote to the President as follows : ' It ought also to check any future attempts at service pension legislation . ' Before the House Committee oil Interstate and Foreign Commerce , when the bill came tip for a hearing , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pensions . ' " As the bonus was not a legal obligation the question arises as to whether it was a moral one . We doubt whether Congress has the right under the Constitution to give away four billions of the to xpayers ' money without restric ' Um to part of a class in such manner aa it decides in its own good judgment . It is not comparable with land grants and we do not believe it is for the general welfare of the country . " F .... vpect to Block Machinery . Should the action be brought ? not only ' will it be carried through to the Supreme Court , but its effect would be immediately to stop by injunction all preparations for the payment of the bonus . Under the law the United States Veterans ' . Bureau is authorized to begin issuing insurance certificates on Jan. 1 , 1920 , and to begin cash payments on March 1 following . That this may be accomplished the bureau and the War and Navy Department ? are planning to add 2.300 clerks to tro : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enjoined from doing the work and the departments would be prevented from spending between $8,000,000 and $9:000.000 for administrative costs for the first year . The machinery would be effectively brought to a standstkll and veterans would not get their bonus at all unless the law was held to be con ; stitutional.
