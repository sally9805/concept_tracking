Two weeks ago Mrs. Kahn of California , one of the two widows* in Congress , made her maiden speech , ( TIME , May 10 ) . Last week , perhaps spurred on by Mrs. Kahn 's reception , perhaps en-heartened because Mrs. Kahn had broken ground , the other Congressional widow , Mrs. John Jacob Rogers of Massachusetts , who last year was elected to the seat vacated by the death of her husband , made her Congressional debut . <P> She spoke for a bill to extend hospital benefits to disabled World War veterans suffering from chronic diseases without positive proof that such diseases were acquired in the service . Her bill came up on the " consent calendar . " ( This calendar is composed of measures which it is thought may not arouse opposition . The bills are read by title by the Clerk . The Speaker asks whether there is objection to " present consideration . " If there is one objection the bill goes over . If not , the bill is rattled off by one of the reading clerks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clerk read the title of the bill ( " H. R. 10772 , a bill to amend the World War Veterans ' Act of 1924 " ) . Mrs. Rogers rose : <P> " Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent to address the House for three minutes on this bill . " <P> Mr. Blanton of Texas was immediately on his feet : <P> " Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that the lady have five minutes , under the circumstances . " <P> The Speaker pro tempore ( Mr. Snell , Chairman of the Rules Committee ) evaded the issue , saying : " The lady* is recognized . " <P> " Mr. Speaker and Members of the House : . . Death will take its toll of service men and women if we do not pass legislation for their benefit . Applause . Death waits for no man or no woman . It does not even wait for Congress . <P> " Congress sent our men to fight nine years ago , and I think a good many of the men are still here who voted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted to send them there that many would never return , and that many would come back to live a life far worse than death ; live in pain and sickness and horrible mutilations . If this bill is not passed , many men will die . . . . " <P> Mr. Blanton : " Will the lady yield ? " <P> Mrs. Rogers : " Certainly . " <P> Mr. Blanton : " It is a good bill . It is needed by the disabled veterans . Does the lady know why it should not be passed ? " <P> Mrs. Rogers : " I do not . " <P> Mr. Blanton : " I do not see why it should not be passed . " <P> Mrs. Rogers : " To illustrate what I mean , I will tell you the story of Carl Bronner , a boy who not only gave both of his eyes for us , but who gave both of his hands for us . <P> The story was told with great emotion . <P> In spite of applause the bill was not passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro tempore : " Is there objection to the present consideration of the bill ? " <P> Mr. Begg : " Mr. Speaker , reserving the right to object , to make a statement , I appreciate- " <P> Mr. Blanton : " Mr. Speaker , I demand the regular order . " <P> Mr. Begg : " Mr. Speaker , if the gentleman from Texas is so ungentlemanly as to do that , he may go ahead and do it . " <P> Mr. Blanton : " The gentleman from Ohio knows that he is unparliamentary when he says that . "
