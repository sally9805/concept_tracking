( See front cover ) <P> In Paris last week , artistic Frenchmen worried over a report that members of the Comdie Franaise were to make talking cinemas for U. S. producers . French cinema exhibitors worried more over the news that all representatives of U. S. producer-members ( Paramount-Famous-Lasky , Warner Bros. , Fox , United Artists , Universal , Radio-Keith-Orpheum , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) of the Cinema Syndicate de France were resigning in protest over the new French law , effective in September , limiting the importation of foreign-produced films to four for each French film exported . <P> In Hungary , cinemaddicts learned that they would have no talking cinema before next May . <P> In Australia , it was being insisted that U. S. talking cinema producers should give Raycophone , Australian talking mechanism fair play in competition with U. S.-made talking mechanisms . <P> In England , cinema producers , long on expenses and short on production , blamed U. S. talkies for all unhappiness . <P> Hollywood buzzed and bubbled over the Equity ( actors ' union ) attempt to keep actors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , announced a forthcoming super-talkie , titled Show of Shows , featuring John Barrymore and Al Jolson together for the first time on any stage . <P> Thus Talking Cinema , youngest world industry , thrived lustily , showed symptoms of forcing its parent , Silent Cinema , and its grandparent . Legitimate Drama , back into the sparser portions of the entertainment field . <P> Springing directly from the Silent Cinema , the Talking Cinema is controlled mainly by strong Silent Cinemen . Great film names , with sound and without , are Fox Film Corp. , Paramount-Famous-Lasky Corp. , Warner Bros. , United Artists . Yet one potent Talking Cinema company backs its speaking present with no silent past . This company is opulent , many-branched Radio Corp . of America . In Photophone it has its own talking mechanism . In RKO Productions , Inc. , it has its own production and distribution company . In General Electric and Westinghouse Electric it has tremendous laboratory resources . During 1929-30 there will be made 30 full-length and 52 short Radio pictures , all of which will talk , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear Richard Dix , Rudy Vallee , Rod La Rocque , Owen Moore , Bebe Daniels , Betty Compson . Writers will include Ben Hecht , Charles McArthur , Eugene Walter , Via Delmar . Thus among great film companies must be ranked Radio Corp. , and to the list of cinema tycoons must be added the name of short , stocky David Sarnoff , Radio Corp . ' s Vice President and General Manager . Inasmuch as Radio Corp . has in the past conducted many a merger , and since , like all young industries , Talking Cinema is much in the merger state , many have been the rumors that Radio Corp . will soon absorb one or another of its competitors . All such rumors Mr. Sarnoff , just back from Europe , last week denied . He was particularly emphatic in denying published reports that he had made a hurried trip to Chicago where , last fortnight , a Radio-Keith-Orpheum convention was in progress and a rumor was rampant that RKO was trying to buy out Paramount-Famous-Lasky.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
