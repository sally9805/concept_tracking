txt With the kaleidoscopic abruptness that characterizes changes in the Chinese civil war picture come indications that Marshal CHANG TsoLIN , the Manchurian war lord who for the last few months has been living like an emperor in the Forbidden City in Peking , may be driven back to Mukden . Although the extent of his sway in North China has never been altogether clear , it has been generally accepted that in his capacity of " generalissimo " of the Northern armies he was at least able to hold Peking and the Province of Chihli . It is still too early to predict his fall , but the fact that dispatches from Peking are again being censored and that it is reported from Tientsin that part of his heavy artillery is being evacuated from the capital indicates that his hold is weakening . The advance on Peking is along the line of the Peking-Kalgan railroad . This is the route which the so-called Christian General FENG followed when he abandoned Peking to CHANG TSO-LIN last year . FENG took with him to Kalgan most of the locomotives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandeer . These have presumably remained at Kalgan and are now in the service of the war lords who are advancing on ' eking . The technical and strategical advantages would seem to lie with the aggressors , but there is no trustworthy information about the troops at their disposal or as to the state of their supplies . Present indications are that the movement is the result of an agreement between FENG and Governor YEN of Shansi Province . Inasmuch as the last named leader has for years refrained from participating in the civil War and has , instead , devoted his influence to creating and maintaining an orderly government in his province , new developments may be expected if his activities spread . Peking gossip has it that his power has been undermined by the " Reds " and that he has taken up arms as a last resort . It may be that , having remained modestly within his province for so many years . he has at last been fired by the same ambition that has been the downfall of all Chinese war lords  --  to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHANG TSO-LIN , who has always had many supporters in the foreign colony in Manchuria cn account of the excellent order which he preserved there , has never been successful when he has gone out of his own territory . Before he made up his mind to take Peking last year it was the common saying in Mukden : " If only the Marshal will not cress the wall ! " ( 1 . e. , if only he will stay in Manchuria ) . Not only was it felt that his absence would be costly for Manchuria , but also that he was not a big enough man to dominate North China If he now goes back to Mukden , it will not be surprising to see him pass out of the picture and his power fall into the hands of his chief assistant , YANG YU-TING . So disrupted is China politically and so fragmentary the remains of the " Nationalist " party that a shift in the control of Peking does not at this time appear to have any particular significance . Even if Governor YEN of Shansi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite the disjointed remains of the Southern Nationalists , there is little likelihood that the new combination will endure longer than those that have gone before it .
