txt That Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , Assistant United States Attorney General , who has attacked before religious bodies the candidacy of Governor Smith , will . continue her speechmaking under the auspices of the Speakers ' Bureau of the Republican National Committee was decided beyond any doubt today by Representative Walter H. Newton of Minnesota , . Chairman of that bureau , and James W. Goad , Western manager of the Republican National campaign . In an interview with newspaper men at which Mr. Good and . Mrs. Willebrandt were present . Mr. Newton not only affirmed that in making the speeches which Governor Smith has charged roused religious prejudice against him Mrs. Willebrandt Was acting under the auspices of the National Committee , but stated that she would keep several speaking engagements in October , some of them being in border States . Mrs. Willebrandt herself reiterated that his stand on the prohibition issue and not his religion led her to work for Governor Smith 's defeat , and she indicated that her future speeches would follow the lines she has hitherto followed . Appears for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the morning , appeared at Western Republican . headquarters about 1 o'clock to meet them following a two-hour conference with Messrs . Newton and Good. - Previously she had dictated . a two-sentence statement tor publication , in which she contented herself With the assertion that she had no apology to make for her addresses and that her position was clearly set forth in them . But flanked by Representative Newton and Mrs. Good , and with a stenographer recording the interview , she explained her position at length . " Have you been making your addresses as a free lance or under the auspices of the Speakers ' Bureau and do you intend to continue making speeches throughout the country ? " she was asked . Mrs. Willebrandt turned and faced Representative Newton with the air of one who demands either recognition or repudiation . " I think , " she replied , " that I will let . Mr. Newton answer that for me . " Representative Newton squared his shoulders , threw back his head and unequivocally endorsed his colleague . Mr. Newton 's Endorsement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Speakers ' Bureau of the Republican National Committee , " he said enthusiastically . " She has engagements in several States already , including Kentucky and Tennessee during the month of October , and if her official duties will permit the release of more time ; she will make more speeches . The fact of the matter is , the demands for Mrs. Willebrandt 's time from ? the various States far exceeds the number of dates that I can place at the disposal of the State Chairman and that demand comes from every part of the Middle West . " " Do yell intend to continue along the same line that you have been doing ? " she was asked . " In reply to that I can only state , " she answered , " there is nothing ' in a single-speech of mine or utterance of mine , publicly or privately , that could , ' with the slightest degree of fairness , be twisted into the con // // struction of arousing the religious prejudices , or abuse of Mr. Smith or anybody else on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to dodge behind his own church .. . . . " I personally have too high a respect , the Catholics with whom I have worked . not to feel ' sorry to see a prominent Catholic like Mr. Smith attempt to create a notion in the public mind that the criticisms that are directed to him by . drys and by people who are opposed to Tammany are aimed at his church . He knows they arenot . He laid himself open to thole : two sources of opposition and he i has no right to insinuate that his : , church should bear the burden of that attack . " " Do you regard prohibition as the real issue of the campaign ? " " I think Mr. Smith has made it an issue . It is not a normal political issue . It is a moral issue in this country .. The Republican Party did not make it a political issue . The Democratic Party did not make it a political Matte . Mr. Smith dragged it out into partisan politics and now seems to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral forces that have fought this thing for fifty years will not come out to defend it . " " Would you have been as tremendously interested in this campaign if the question of prohibition had not come np ? " " I should say that I am interested in the . Republican campaign . My own history will show that for years back . " " But have n't your speeches of late been largely devoted to the topic of prohibition ? " " I suppose that is inevitable . I am a sort of personification of prohibition . I do a great many other things in the Department of Justice . In fact , I argued more cases in the Supreme Court last year that were not prohibition cases than prohibition cases , but more publicity seems to result ' from what I am doing along prohibition lines , from my natural prohibition responsibilities than from anything else ; ' just like you people are asking me prohibition questions more than anything else . So , when I make a political speech , I am not dodging the prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this campaign . " In response to a query about her future speaking dates Mrs. Willebrandt referred inquiries to the Speakers ' Bureau , professing not to be familiar with them . She intended , she said , to return to Washington this afternoon .
