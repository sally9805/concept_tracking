txt Like Issmc 's Brand , Professor ALBERT BUSHNELL HART clamors for all or nothing . Addressing the International University Extension at Vienna , he declared that there has been fighting and bloodshed In the world every day since the League of Nations has been in existence ; that the League has not solved and can never solve the problems confronting it . Presumably Professor HART is an evolutionist , believing that mankind has struggled through vast biologic ages in an effort , still uncrowned , to adapt itself to and thus master its environment . At Harvard he is accepted as a historian . Yet it has apparently , escaped his attention that our own comparatively simple problem of a League of Nations , the United States of America , baffled us through a decade of chaos , and that we then achieved the bare outlines of our Constitution as if by miracle ; that even so we were obliged to leave the two crucial questions of slavery and secession to be settled by civil ' war , and that there are still great constitutional problems unsolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
