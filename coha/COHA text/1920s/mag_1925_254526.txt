The epic poets , through some chance , in all their accounts of the battles of champions , have neglected to supply the world with an adequate story of a battle between a crusader and an efficiency expert . Yet that , too , has striking dramatic possibilities ; and observers were , last week , inclined to the view that the country is about to be treated to an example of such a conflict-a battle between a man with a cause and a man with simply an aim ; between an indignant voice and well-directed force ; between Roy Asa Haynes and Lincoln C. Andrews . <P> For four years , the champion of the Prohibition Army has been a crusader- Commissioner Roy Asa Haynes . But now an efficiency expert has arisen to fight with him for leadership . Lincoln C. Andrews , new Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in charge of Prohibition enforcement , looked upon the work of the crusader and found it ineffective . Mr. Andrews is a General ( a title he acquired in military service ) and promptly he set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district commanders in place of the present 48 sub-commanders ( TIME , July 6 ) , a policy to which Crusader Haynes could little object , as it was aimed directly at the capture of the Holy City . <P> But when General Andrews proposed to do away with the corps of trumpeters and heralds and replace them with combatant troops , then the old crusader rebelled , crying that no crusading army had ever done battle without music and proclamations . And the efficiency expert made answer that the crusade was nothing , but the capture of the Holy City was everything . All this came to pass last week . To begin with , General Andrews demanded the resignation of Miss Georgia Hopley , whom the crusader had brought with him from Ohio . Miss Hopley 's resignation was demanded because she was receiving a salary of $2,500 a year and expenses for going among women 's organizations and with a silver tongue creating a sentiment for Prohibition enforcement . Previously , Secretary Mellon and Commissioner of Internal Revenue Blair had indicated that , although they had no objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any place in the department . Last April , Mr. Blair insisted that Miss Hopley resign . Her resignation was not forthcoming . But when Mr. Andrews came upon the scene , he simply announced that Miss Hopley had to go . <P> Mr. Haynes protested . Most of Ohio 's politicians protested . For Mr. Haynes and Miss Hopley are close friends of the Anti-Saloon League , whose home and stronghold is Ohio . Hoke Donithen , Coolidge pre-Convention manager in Ohio , protested ; C. C. Crabbie , Attorney General of Ohio , voiced his disapproval . Senator Willis , ponderous Ohioan , who hopes some day to follow the exalted path that the late Senator Warren G. Harding trod before his death , paid a personal call on Mr. Andrews . Anon , all the protesters came out by the same door where in they went .
