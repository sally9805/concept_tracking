Schwartz described as the " biggest ring of automobile thieves known to be operating . " " This investigation , which has been under way for two weeks , is still going on , " Mr. Schwartz said . " More indictments will follow . We are just beginning . " The indictments , which charge conspiracy and violation of the National Motor . Vehicle Theft act , are based on information gathered by detactives and from confessions of two of the accused , that have convinced the investigators that automobile thieves not only sold automobiles before they stole them and while rightful owners still were enjoying them , but also that the robber mechants obtained false bills of sale , owners ' licenses and license plates before the cars were stolen .

Suspected officials thus far are in New Jersey . But the inquiry is developing wide ramifications . It now includes investigation of a large automobile firm in Manhattan , which has been said by one of the accused to be dealing in stolen cars . The history of the theft of a Cadillac from Eugene Schwarz in East Orange , N. J. , and its sale , as charged in the Government 's case , furnishes an excellent illustration of the amazing boldness with which , it is asserted , thieves worked . As outlined by Assistant District Attorney Schwarz this is the story : Ginsberg met Grogan in Fallsburg a few weeks ago . Ginsberg wanted to buy an automobile " cheap , to use in the hacking business . " Grogan made an appointment for Ginsberg to meet him in New York . In an uptown saloon Ginsberg was introduced to Stephens . Ginsberg said he wanted a particular make . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shown . It was too small , Ginsberg said .

Ginsberg , as tile Government 's case has it , and as the confessions show , then went to the Secretary of State 's office and got for himself an owner 's license and license plates . That Was on June 7 . Eugene Schwarz , over in East Orange . still was driving in his car on that day ? or , . at least , lie had it to drive in . Meanwhile , according to the Govern- ment 's information , Stephens went over to East Orange to see Flynn . Flynn showed him the license numbers of the auto and then Stephens said , it is asserted : ? " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care if you do , it 's insured , " is quoted as the reply of Flynn , who then was acting as chauffeur for Schwarz .. Early on the morning of July 8  --  the day after the license and license plates had been obtained -- the license plates were put . on the auto in place of the proper New Jersey ones , and the automobile started for New York . Stephens , who is 20. and Ginsberg. who is 21 , were in the automobile In Gramercy Park at noon on July 8 when Detective Sergeants Owens . Naun and Reran of the Automobile Squad of Pollee Headquarters arrested them , but not before a chase in which the detectives fired three revolver shots . In the auto was a set of tools for erasing factory numbers on automobiles and another set for putting new numbers on automobiles .

All four pleaded not guilty . Tench , in his statement later to Mr. Schwartz , however , said that he bought a car from Grogan through Stephens for $350. lie said that he thought this car was " too pretentious " for him to have , so he gave it back to Grogan , receiving in exchange another auto . The first car , according to Government officials , was found in a garage in Manhattan , where they assert they can prove it was stored by Grogan . This car , they add , was stolen from Richard Brown of 785 Broad Street , Newark , N. J. With the second car , they continue , went a false bill of sale . In his reported confession Tench is quoted as saying he knew the numbers had been changed on that car and that it had been stolen . Flynn , in a statement , said he knew of two other autos that had been stolen . Assistant United States Attorney Schwarz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the thieves before they started to drive off in them in Jersey because no Jersey policeman wouhl think twice about stopping an automobile with the license plates . of another State . He further said that some automobile thieves specialize in stealing only particular makes of cars  --  selling them " on the hoof , " as it were , very frequently . They find out what a customer wants . Then they get it for him . " But , " he added , " we are on the trail now , and we are going to stick until we 've ended this wholesale trading in stolen automobiles. "
