" Blum , you 're a jolly good fellow ! <P> " BLUM , YOU 'RE A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ! <P> " BLUM , YOU 'RE A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ! <P> " THAT , nobody can deny ! " <P> Ralph D. Blumenfeld sat down , flushed , last week at a banquet in London , when the above quoted chorus was chanted heartily by five British Cabinet ministers , * several earls , a great many editors , and Michael Arlen . <P> A quaint feature of the banquet was that , although Mr. Blumenfeld was born in the U. S. , not one-tenth of 1% of his fellow countrymen have the slighest idea who he is . Londoners know that " Blum " has been editor of the Daily Express since 1904 . He came to London from Manhattan in 1887 under orders from the late famed James Gordon Bennett to report Queen Victoria 's first Jubilee . British tradition insists that " Blum has been in London ever since " ; but that is an error . Actually he was Superintendent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new century opened did he become News Editor of The London Daily Mail . <P> Since then Mr. Blumenfeld has become , if not a " power , " at least a virile , pungent force in Fleet Street , which he described , last week , as " that street of golden adventure which has been so long my home . " <P> During the banquet a telephone connected with Manhattan rang ; and Chancellor Churchill answered it : <P> " Hello New York , " he said , " this is Churchill . You have a message for Blumenfeld ? Will put him on to speak for himself . " <P> Nominally the banquet was " to celebrate the completion of Blum 's 40 years in Fleet Street .
