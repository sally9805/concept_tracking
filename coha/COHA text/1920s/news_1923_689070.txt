txt Architects and engineers interested in the remodelling rather than the demolishment of High Bridge won a victory yesterday when they appeared before the Board of Estimate with their plan which is designed to save 5300,000 for the city . Although Mayor Hyman had asserted at the beginning of the hearing that he would permit no further delay , he later granted the request of the engineering experts to put the matter over for another week . In the interim the Commissioners and engineers of the Department of Plant and Structures and the Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity will study the proposal . " We certainly feel we have won a great victory , " said William B. Roulstone of 61 Broadway . representing the Parks and Playgrounds Association and several architectural and engineering associations , at the conclusion of the hearing . " If a vote could be taken it would be seen that practically everybody in New York opposes the remelted of High ' Bridge from its present position . We are very much encouraged by . the granting of another week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects and engineers will be found acceptable . " Mr. Roulstone explained to the board that the committee headed by Edwin S.-Jarret , and including Ralph Modieskl , Don Barber , Lincoln Bush and Daniel E. Moran . had developed a plan for the remodeling of the bridge at a cost of $716,000 , whereas the cost - of removing it and digging a tunnel to convey Croton water to Manhattan would be approximately $1,500,000 . This . " said Borough President Ed ' ward Riegelmann of Brooklyn , " is a dollars and cents proposition . The board has decided to move the bridge and make it an addition to Riverside Drive and preserve it in all its beauty and historic splendor . " " This thing has been going on now long enough , " interj'ented the Mayor . and we will lose the appropriation from the United States Government unless we take immediate action . I am going to vote to take action today . " Merritt H. Smith . Chief Engineer of the Department of Water Supply , answering a question of Mayor Hyman , explained that High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last three years . William J. Dilthey , an architect at 120 Liberty Street , member of the American Institute of Architects and other similar bodies , said the general sentiment air over the city and in architectural and engineering societies was for the retention of High Bridge . Reconstruction of the present structure . as planned by the committee , has met with the approval of the War Department , he stated . " The War Department has told me this will settle the whole problem and they are surprised that the city has n't before this adopted Such a plan , " he said . Borough President Riegelmann asked the experts and their representatives if it were possible , from an engineering standpoint to remove the bridge to Riverside Drive , as recommended by the Committee of the Whole of the board . " In my opinion , it can not be moved , " declared Fred La.vis. a consulting engineer at 25 Broad Street . " Nowadays . " Mr. Dilthey contended , " nothing is impossible . But it would be far too expensive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit their plans to Commissioners Whalen and Hayes and return at the next meeting of the board on Friday . At that meeting an even stronger plea against removing the bridge is expected to be made .
