Maureen Orcutt broke 82 , women 's par , three days running ; Glenna Collett played the first nine in even fours , three days running , last year 's woman champion ; Miriam Burns Tyson , went out in the first round ; Marion Hollins and Dorothy Campbell Kurd stayed for the third round . A mob of female golfers failed to qualify and spent the ensuing days of the Women 's National Championship Tournament waddling around the course at Hot Springs , Va. , patrolling the gallery . This last was composed largely of strangely corpulent old men . There was nothing very exciting about the first days of the Women 's National . <P> Favorites seldom finish in golf tournaments . There are too many chances for them to lose and 18 holes are not enough to inevitably determine superiority . But , at Hot Springs last week , there were six onetime champions in the medal play and several more future champions . One of these many favorites , it was safe to say , would win the finals . Such proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mashie better than any other woman golfer , came up against Glenna Collett in the last round . <P> Collett is a gallery player ; she gets distance from the tees and sometimes throws it away with her putter ; she walks along as though she were singing to herself ; like Bobby Jones , her grim determination frightens her opponents and beats them before the match begins . As Bobby Jones beat Perkins 13 up in the Amateur at Braeburn , Collett beat stocky little Van Wie 13 and 12 in the Amateur at Hot Springs . <P> Four other women , Hurd , Fraser , Curtis and Hoyt have won the Amateur three times . All of them succeeded for the third time when they were older than Collett , who was born in 1903 on the day her father , a famous bicycle rider , won his greatest race at the Paris Velodrome . Some of the women at Hot Springs would doubtless have liked to be cool to the daughter , my dear , of a man who used to be a bicycle jockey . Glenna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a woman whose fathers won their money without the aid of their sporting instincts . When she drives about in her blue Mercer , a police dog named after a wolf in a story by Ernest Seton Thompson , Lobo , sits up beside her ; she leaves her fox-terrier at home .
