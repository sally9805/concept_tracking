txt As a result of the failure of operators generally in the Mexican field , to bring in important new wells , the situation is regarded as unfavorable The failure of wildcat operations combined with increased taxes is making the companies more doubtful as to the future , and is the reason why American oil companies are now buying Californian crude oil to replace Mexican crude which they formerly had . Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey has practically quit new operations in Mexico . It has lost almost its entire output in the south fields , getting only a few hundred barrels a day . Its refinery and sea-loading station have been closed down and pipe lines are being taken up in the southern fields . Its tankage there is also being knocked down . Some of this equipment is being moved to the Panuco or heavy oil fields in the hope of getting some production there . This company has taken a severe loss on its operations in Mexico .                 @ @ @ @
