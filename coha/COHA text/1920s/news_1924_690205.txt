txt James A. Foley last night succeeded Charles F. Murphy as the leader of Tammany Hall . He was elected by the Executive Committee of the Tammany organization . virtually unanlomusly , after hours of uncertainty , and his election was hailed with rejoicing , not only in the meeting of the committee , but throughout the Hall and in the Tammany club houses everywhere in Manhattan . Fighting every step of the way Foley . whole wife was much opposed to his taking the leadership , finally gave way when Governor Smith and National Committeeman Norman E. Mick not only exerted their influence but practically told the Surrogate that he owed it to the organization And to the friends who had helped him shape his career to take the job . In every sense of the word Foley was " drafted " except that be agreed to accept before the normal election was held . Election ' Virtually Unanimous . The election of Foley was made on the report of the special committee of seven appointed last week to canvass the situation and ascertain the wishes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee , of which Frank J. Goodwin , leader of the Third Assembly District , was Chairman . was to persuade- Foley that he should take the leadership . This committee reported last night and when the roll was called on adoption of the report there were twenty-two and one-third affirmative votes and one-third of a vote in the negative . The onethird vote was made up of the one-sixth of a vote of John F. Curry , co-leader of the north end of the Fifth Assembly District , and the similar vote otv his woman leader , Martha Byrne . Following the announcement of the result Warren Hubbard of the Eighteenth Assembly District offered a resolution to this effect : " - The members of the Executive Committee of Tammany Hall pledge their allegiance and loyalty to the Hon. James A. Foley . the duly elected leader of our organization . " This resolution was passed unanimously , Curry explaining that his opposition had not been personal In any way , but was based solely on his belief that the leader of the organization should be one of the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee report follows : " Pursuant to a resolution adopted at the meeting of the Executive Committee on May 8 , 1924 , we , the committee therein named , respectfully report : " 1 . We held a meeting as authorized in said resolution . " 2 . All but one of the members of the Executive Committee appeared before us and expressed their views as to Mr. Murphy 's successor . " 3 . It was practically the unanimous opinion of the seventy members of the Executive Committee that the Hon. James A. Foley . Surrogate of New York County , was the proper person to succeed Mr. Murphy . " Your committee unanimously recommends ' the selection of the Hon. James A. Foley to succeed the Hon. Charles F. Murphy , deceased , and that he shall be elected Chairman of the Executive Committee and that Hon. William Allen be Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee . " The speeech-making that ensued , all of which was laudatory of Foley , consumed more than an hour . Among those who talked were Nathan Burkan , The , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips , Martin McCue and Charles ICulkin . It was agreed that the Goodwin committee should act as a committee of notification , to officially inform Mr. Foley of his selection today . Pleases Powers En Tammany , Politically the selection of Paley pleases virtually all those in power in Tammany Hall , and a great many influential Democrats who are not in the organization . It is not expected to prove pleasing to Mayor Hylan , who opposed Foley and issued a statement Ito that effect last week , or William ' R , I Hearst , who , on at least one occasion , has opposed Foley ' and made much of the fact that he was the son-in-law of Charles F. MillPhy . When the Executive Committee went into session at 9:20 o'clock last night , having taken a recess from the afternoon , it was definitely known that Foley had finally agreed to accept . The news was reflected in the faces of those who had been hanging about the Hall all afternoon and evening aid it spread rapidly . At Foley 's house , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy in East Seventeenth Street , three guards were stationed at the gate to keep callers away and the announcement was made that the Surrogate ' was exhausted and had retired . At 4 o'clock in the afternoon it appeared highly improbable that Foley would . be the leader . For hours Gin committee-of agidoh Goodwin- awing-Oin - SURROGATE JAMES A. FOLEY , Chosen by Tammany Last Night to Succeed Charles V. Murphy. . , head bad been arguing - with the Surrogate . He remained adamant , as his personal friends had said he would . Conflicting Reports Are Spread . The Goodwin committee was supposed to report to the Executive Committee at 4 , but it was- twenty minutes later before the Executive Committee was called to order . Before it met Goodwin reported to Foley and some of the others that Foley had not finally said " No " lent had promised a decision at 8 o'clock in the evening . The meeting of the Executive Commit-I tee-did not last more than two minutes . An adjournment was taken until 8:301 o'clock . Then three *reports spread . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had agreed to accept , and the third and correct one that he was witholding a final decision . It was between the hours of 5 and 8 that the heavy artillery of the Old Guard in Tammany , insistent on Foley 's election , was brought up . Phil Donahue , Treasurer of the organization and one of the closest friends Mr. Murphy had , argued personally with the Surrogate . Later in the evening Mr. Mack , who is one of the war horses of the Democratic Party in this State , went to the Foley home and told Foley how important it was to the Smith boom and to the Democratic Party generally that Tammany should have a leader as soon as possible and , above all , that it should form a united part of the Democratic Party in the State . Sought to Avoid Strife . It was also impressed on . Foley that While it might be true that Judge 01-vany could be elected in the course of the ensuing few hours , it was not true that he could get anything like a unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued , there would be a split . dissatisfaction , factional strife , bitterness and all the things that might well go toward hampering the organization during the forthcoming Democratic National Convention and thereby militate seriously against the chances of nominating Governor Smith for President . According to one report in Fourteenth Street , Governor Smith called in person - at the Foley home . There seemed to be little ground for this report . It is " Understood , however , that the Governor : did communicate with Foley and urge , aim to take the leadership . ' Whether there was any quaiification. as for instance , an agreement that Foley should get out of the leadership before the next municipal campaign , should he Wish to do so , could not be learned last night . There is reason to believe , however , that Mrs. Foley maintained her opposition to her husband taleng the leadership and that the prospect of the municipal campaign was one of the ; Things which swayed her . . Many of the Tammany district leaders and about two hundred of the captains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the eve'Ring , completely at a loss . Without . a leader , it was clear these men did not know what to do . They were a sad faced looking lot , too , when it was reported that Foley would not accept . Tom Foley Brings the News . The first definite word to the contrary ' they got came from Tom Foley . who returned from Surrogate Foley 's house shortly after 9 o'clock . He said a. few words to one or two men as he came in and in a minute a line had formed of men who wanted to congratulate the elderly leader . The crowd at once realized that Surrogate Foley had been won over by his namesake , at least In a Measure . Then the meeting of the Executive Committee was called nearly an hour late , and the Goodwin Committee reported . There were sounds of applause and some cheering from the closed room . The speechmaking then began and there were frequent bursts of applause . Occasionally there was what sounded like a discordant note . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Foley and opinion was divided as to whether Curry would actually carry his fight into the meeting With the certain knowledge that Foley would be chosen , no matter what he said . Judge Olvany had many friends and boosters in the Hall both during the alterncon and in the evening . They did not hesitate to push the clefts of their candidate vigorously when the report spread that Foley had declined finally . It then appeared that Olvany would be electea in the evening , or else there would be an adjournment until Monday . Had Olvany been put ' across , it was freely prophesied , there would have been a wide split in the organization and little chance of his mending it in the near future . May Resign as Surrogate Today . Foley will have to resign as Surrogate at once . He will probably take this step today . as there is no time to be lost and he must assume his duties as leader immediately . His salary as Surrogate is $15.000 a year , but there is an additional S2,540 that comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries and , to date , the leader , of Ta:nmany has not been paid a salary . There was talk yesterday of changing this custom . It is considered mere likely , however , that Foley will re-enter the practice of law , in which ' ie was quite stieccesful . He can do this and still be leadef of Tammany . The man who thus succeeded the mantle of Charles F. Murphy , who was the stepfather of his wife , is tall , straight , slight , and has an exceedingly pleasant personality . lie is very democratic and well liked . He is an excellent lawyer and has a-record in public , life that is strikingly different from the records usually credited to Tammany men . At the same time he is a dyed-inthe-wool organization man . Foley was born on the east side , fortytwo years ago , in a house in East Nineteenth Street . but , a- few blocks from where he now lives . His father , who held a minor public office , had been active in district politics for forty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broker , and five sisters . He has been in public life for about sixteen years . He served six years in the Assembly , six years in the State Senate , and he was elected Surrogate of New York County in 1919 by a plurality of 5.000 in a year when scarcely another Democrat was successful at the polls . The young man was educated at City College and the New York University Law School , and from the first has been rated as a lawyer of exceptional ability , a keen student and a man of excellent judgment . As Surrogate he has had occasion to pass on some extraordinarily important matters . The Eno will case , which had been in the courts for seven years and involved many millions of dollars , passed through his hands . The Webb estate was another of the larger cases that passed through his office . He has been fortunate , too , in that his decisions have been upheld almost without exception by the  --  higher courts . As a legislator Foley made a record which was most heartily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover of Tammany Hail . He was responsible for the first home rule measure and for many welfare bills . He was also responsible for the reduction of telephone rates in at least two instances , and It was he who was responsible for the transit bill which first put John H. Delaney on the Transit Commission . He made an excellent showing in the Constitutional Convention , and when he was a candidate for Surrogate he was endorsed by the Bar Association .
