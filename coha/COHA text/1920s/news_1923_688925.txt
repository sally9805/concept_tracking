txt While gas stocks reflect passage by state legislature of the bill providing a $1 gas rate in New York City , such legislative action in no way deducts a single dollar from asset value of the two companies most concerned , Consolidated Gas and Brooklyn Union Gas . Neither does it cause liquidation of their holdings by investors who are aware of the actual worth of their properties , that the market value is far below the cost of the properties and that no public body , legislative or otherwise , can enforce a rate unless it is equitable . Strength in the position of the gas companies is two . fold : they are capitalized far below their . asset value and the U. S. Supreme Court , in the 80-cent gas case and N. Y. Telephone case , has taken a firm stand against confiscatory rates . ' ? Consolidated Gas Co. ' s 1922 annual report showed for the first time all assets in consolidated form , which totaled $512,792,259 of which the cost of plants and land stood at $460,342,881 . Following- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par common shares at $50 , early this year , the company had outstanding $153,352,780 par value of funded debt and preferred stock . Dedueting this from total asset value there remained $359,459,489 as asset value of the 3 , - 000,000 common shares . This represented an equity of $119.81 a share , or nearly double current selling price of the common stock . Brooklyn Union Gas 1922 report showed $72,166,507 total assets . From this there is to be deducted $28,579,000 bonded debt and $4,125,013 other liabilities leaving a balance of $39,482,494 of actual assets as equity for the $18,000,000 capital stock . Applying the 180,000 shares of stock to this there was an equity of $219 a share , about double current selling price of $109 a share . Neither of these valuations take into consideration anything but actual cost . As President Cortelyou pointed out in his annual report . properties of Consolidated Gas could not be duplicated for less than $750,000,000 while President Jourdan 's estimate of reproducing Brooklyn Union 's properties is $110,000,000 . Progress of the $1 gas bill through the legislature indicated clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish casts , investments , etc. , in arriving at a fair rate . No public hearings were held to permit presentation of the companies ' side . Should the bill become a law by Governor Smith 's signature , it could not only be attacked on the grounds of confiscation but also that it is discriminatory . The bill provides for a rate of $1 in New York City alone , leaving rates in all other communities to the state commission .
