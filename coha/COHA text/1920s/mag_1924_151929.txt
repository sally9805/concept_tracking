A novel laboratory has been created in the Canal Zone . When the Canal was built , Gatun Dam was erected across the valley of the Chagres River . The result was the creation of not only a deep-water channel from the Gatun locks to Gaillard Cut , but also a great lake , some 164 square miles in extent , which developed from the drowning of the lands on both sides of the main channel . This body of water is known as Gatun Lake . <P> When the dam was completed and the waters of the Chagres backed up , flooding the valley , the higher eminences of the foothills of the Cordilleran mountain chain rose out of the waters as islands . While the waters were rising , the animal life of the tropical valley took refuge on the higher ground on the shores and islands . On the latter this life is now isolated . Naturally , a wide variety of life is collected on some of these small islands . <P> Gov . J. J. Morrow , of the Canal Zone , brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan &; Co. ) , set aside Barro Colorado Island , one of the group , as a natural preserve for the wild life of the region .
