MAGIC words have been a part of every language since man first uttered intelligible speech . You might , if you choose , start with " Abracadabra " and go right through the alphabet to " Zazam . " All of them , sometime in the world 's history , possessed a potent magic . Now fix the word " Americana " in your mind . Sooner or later , as the saying goes , you 'll meet up with it ? and when you do , if you have n't already formed a speaking acquaintanceship , you 'll admit that it is packed with a magic that is real ; a magic based upon the sound foundation of fact . Some years ago a certain New York attorney wrote a book about glassware made by Henry William Stiegel in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , during the third quarter of the eighteenth century . He published only four hundred and twenty copies . This edition was calculated to supply for all time the demand for a book on so obscure a subject . The price of the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for 1914 . In those days good specimens of the glassware dealt with could be picked up for a few dollars . Even a blue sugar bowl made by " Baron " Stiegel could be bought for twenty dollars . Today that sugar bowl is worth five hundred dollars ; and Mr. Hunter 's book is worth one hundred dollars a copy . This is merely an example of the magic wrought by that one word , " Americana . " It is our national self-consciousness at work . And it works through an army of men and women known as " collectors . " The age-old hoarding urge in a new setting and in a new world . Perhaps you are a collector . If you are not , the law of averages will prove that your neighbor is . And in this country many collectors have largely forsaken the things of Europe and the Orient , and demand  | Americana , the stuff having to do with the history of America . They apply " history " a bit sketchily . It does n't matter much whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clocks or cradles ? it is history , a record of the past . We are , strictly speaking , neither an ancient nation nor living in a land of ancient civilization . Our history may be said to begin with 1491 , but settlements of importance did not occur until England and France began to colonize here . Americana collectors want the relics of these first settlers and their descendants , and they gather them up , even unto the " hand-medowns " of the tenth generation ! Thus begins the magic of Americana . It takes the kitchen chair of a century ago and places it , frankly a thing of hickory and pine , in the living-room , where once mahogany dared only enter . It takes the crude wood spring seat off a New England wagon and , with a few lusty scrapes to remove the paint and a few lustier rubs with wax to refurbish , places it in the hallway , by the fireplace . It rips the paneling bodily from a farmhouse in Massachusetts and places it on the twentieth floor of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of catalogues ; it creates dealers , traders and " confidential agents . " It creates a new word here and a new word there , and permits the antique shop to rival in numbers the old book stores . If this is not magic , then magic existeth not and never did . The American collector insists upon . Americana ; he insists so strongly that he is by way of forcing the production of fates . The furniture of Chippendale and Heppelwhite may go begging ? but the last dollar is bid on a table by Duncan Phyfe of New York or a highboy by William Savery of Philadelphia . It matters not if one of the early . Popes owned the beautifully illuminated missal known as Lot Number Eleven ; Lot Number Twelve is a decorated eighteenth-century hymn book from a Seventh Day Baptist monastery in Pennsylvania ? and the bidding will be fast and furious . The art ? or the absence of it ? in a print by Paul Revere or Amos Dolittle means nothing . It is " Americana " ? bone of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketbook goes flat even at the mention of a print by Revere ( and it must be a pretty-well-filled one if it does n't ) there is still the opportunity to buy Currier and Ives . What cares the collector , fiercely driven by his hobby , that Currier and Ives prints are almost contemporary with the 1850 's ? " Americana " has barely been whispered over them , yet they have acquired a reputation that , even if a bit unsavory , is still a reputation . How thoroughly democratic ! Time was when Currier and Ives prints decorated the harness-room , the wash house , the bar and the oyster saloon . They were the pictures of the masses , the tabloids of their day . Like its aristocracy , America scans not too closely the genealogy of its collectibles . Which does not mean that fine things were  | not done by the early American craftsmen ; the cabinetmakers , silversmiths , artists , builders and printers who supplied our ancestors with the necessities of life . Ben Franklin 's " Cato Major " is a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . collars you have to pay for a copy . The prints from the shops of Yeager and Morgan and Webster of Philadelphia are beautiful in drawing and in color . That is why a print of the ConstitutionGuerri ? re battle published by Webster , August , 1813 , may cost you as much as a little block of railroad shares . The Windsor chair as developed and refined by the local cabinetmakers is a masterpiece of symmetrical construction . It is good to look at light , yet sturdy and strong . Good Windsors ? the rarer types ? are scarcer than the mahogany of Sheraton , and often more costly . Nobody cares if they were made for use in the kitchen , and that dragging them over sanded floors has rubbed half an inch off their normal height . Into the dining-room they go ? at five hundred dollars per hall dozen . One of our great collectors once jokingly remarked that if I was willing to sell my house he knew where I could buy an American court cupboard . He did n't stretch matters much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken seriously by steel barons and motor magnates . Just a short distance this side of court cupboards , in age at least , we come to gate-leg tables . With a thousand dollars in your pocket you can go and buy ? a couple . Certainly  | not more than three . They have advanced tenfold in price in less than a score of years . The entire two thousand per cent mark-up may be credited to the magic of " Americana . " No matter if nearly all the old American silver is in bond , so to speak ; there is still pewter . And when the pewter is all gathered up there will be tin . Stiegel glass is already worth its weight in precious metal . Have collectors stopped buying glass ? No . They have turned to Sandwich , the stuff your grandmothers used for " every day , " and to the whisky flasks of ante-bellum days . Late Windsors and Hitchcock chairs now fill the dealers ' floors . The Brewsters , the Carvers and the early Windsors have been gathered up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with old iron that junkmen used to pick up for a few cents a hundred pounds . The junkmen , incidentally , picked up quite a lot of it . It was scrapped ? the good and the bad ? melted dow : and lives perhaps today in the form of railway spikes or water pipes . In this case the junkman first waved the magic wand . He made good old iron scarce . the merest tyro in economics will tell you that a diminished supply and an increased demand mean an upward trend in prices . In Colonial days ? and even later , for that matter ? when a man built a house he dealt with individual craftsmen . A forgeman or blacksmith was commissioned to do the hardware ? the latches and the locks and the hinges . He delivered more than so many dozen of this and that . He delivered a craftsmanship into which he  | had wrought his personality , his art . He was proud of his work and skill with hammer , chisel , anvil and forge ; proud of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record that one Peter Brown , a blacksmith of Philadelphia , was so diligent at his calling that he acquired a fortune and set up a coach . Upon the doors of his carriage he had painted his " arms " ? two sturdy ones pounding hot iron on the anvil . And over the crest was his motto , " By This I Got Ye . " This pride of craft , and perhaps the fact that in America a mere blacksmith could make a fortune and ride in a coach , caused an English strolling musician to write home in wonderment at the coach and its peculiar " arms . " Wealthy blacksmiths may have been exceptional , but there was money in our infant iron industry . The furnace and forgemasters of Pennsylvania founded immense fortunes on the output of furnaces whose capacity was but a few tons a day . The first run of iron was unfit for forging , consequently it was rue into molds and made into pots and kettles and plates for stoves . The latter were often molded with Biblical scenes and phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masonic emblems . What price old stove plates ? these old " cast-iron bibles " ? Fifteen dollars for common ones ? well rusted ; to two hundred for good ones ? in fine condition . They make hearthplates . They are quite at home among square-cut flagstones . They are splendid for firebacks . Restoring old houses , and the junkman 's vandalism , has turned the remaining supply into precious metal . Old wrought-iron hinges are naturally at a premium . There are always doors to be fitted , and no others take the place of wrought " H " and " HL " hinges in an old house . Perhaps if you 're lucky you may find a pair of the latter type at a price comparable with that of a set of reproductions . Otherwise you may pay out the price of a pair of theater tickets and a dinner , just for a pair of hinges for the livingroom door . But " H " and " HL " hinges are only the poor relations of the hinge family . There are butterfly hinges , rattail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts and arrow points ; hinges with the dark beauty of an Edouard silhouette . These may be , for the sake of convenience , classed with semiprecious stones . Wrought-iron door locks are even a tougher proposition . They are scarce ; even the most sophisticated antique dealer will admit the fact . There is no fixed value ; no standard price on them . Find them and be content ; the price mattereth not . And latches are not to be despised . Even though they were used much instead of locks we must have one for every door ? latches whose value seems to depend entirely upon the decorative features of the handle , the shape of the thumbpiece and the length of the bar . If the pin and latchstring have been preserved even a latch set may soar to unusual heights ? in dollars . In Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , near the historic old town of Ephrata , a little bit of wood and old iron is carefully preserved . It is a box taken from the side of a " Conestoga wagon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley that carried the commerce of this nation overland before the days of railroads and canals . The hinges are " butterflies " on one side and " scroll and tulip " on the other . The hasp is exquisitely wrought in openwork , showing hearts and crosses and circles . An openwork band encircles the box proper just below the sloping lid . Wrought in it is the name of the maker , and the date , 1803 . That box today is worth several hundred dollars . Dated old iron is worth a premium over the undated . Dates prior to ' Soo almost double the tariff . A piece both dated and stamped with a name ( presumably the maker 's ) is a joy forever ? to the fellow that discovers it . It is said of the early settlers that when they were ready to abandon their first habitations , they burned them to the ground and then salvaged the ironwork . Today , whether burned by accident , or demolished by intent , the ironwork of old houses is salvaged in toto . Not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces are carefully removed , later to be sold at a good price . The enthusiasm of the collector does not stop at building hardware in his gathering up of old iron . He collects practically everything the early blacksmith was called upon to make ? all the useful and ornamental things in the household and on the house and barn , and many of the tools and utensils of the butcher , baker and candlestick maker . The smith was an important man in early days . He wrought artistically , all the time making life easier for his fellow man . Door hinges and latches will no longer be old hardware ; they will be " specimens , " " examples " or " types . " One 's front door may become passe , one 's back door famous . Romance will be combined with utility . A footscraper will be admittedly a thing of beauty and a shutter hinge a joy forever . The day of joy in craftsmanship has for many trades gone forever . And the stuff that our old furnacemen and forgemen fashioned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much old iron . Theirs was a labor of love and of lusty pride . They fashioned art with but few motifs of decoration , yet no reproduction , even if done on a most exacting scale , can show that fine spirit the early blacksmith put into his work . Every year " Americana " puts on a new price tag . The things that were junk yesterday are worth saving today ; well worth having tomorrow ; and will be valuable next week . Attics , undisturbed for half a century , often prove a treasure trove when the contents are sent to the auction-room . And year after year the sentimental value of Americana increases .  |
