Charles H. Markham , 65 , for 16 years president of the Illinois Central , had a new position made to order for him last week-Chairman of the Board of Directors . He had been ill for four months and his associates , " desiring to preserve his health and his services for the I. C. , " voted Lawrence Aloysius Downs , now head of the Central of Georgia Railroad , to succeed him as president . <P> Railroad men have a way of being self-made . Lawrence Downs is thoroughly a part of this tradition . After graduating from Purdue he went to work as a rodman for the I. C. , rose steadily through the engineering department . A heavy man , mentally and physically , his particular talent is a blunt , wholehearted affability which endears him to all members of a profession in which this gift is the norm of social intercourse . " Handling men , " he has said , " is largely a matter of getting them to like you . " Charles Markham has said the same thing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was president of the Illinois Central . Presidents Fish , Markham , Downs-successively they built their lives into a railroad . <P> Once there were steamboats on the Mississippi . Writers , thinking about those boats , fancy a certain gallantry , lost now , in the passengers who used them ; the names of the boats , too , were beautiful and proud-The Anna Linington , Belle Zane , Magnolia , The Doubloon , The Fashion , The Great Republic .

' But who shall say that another age , because it happens to be over , is prettier than our own ? The proud boats carried produce as well as gallantry ; the niggers who fiddled helped , in their off moments , to carry bales aboard ; and when the boats quit the river it was because a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . Some Eastern financiers had built the Illinois Central . <P> The undertaking flourished from the first . The river boats offered little competition and had pretty well disappeared by the time Edward H. Harriman was looking for a Chicago entrance for his Union Pacific trunk line from Council Bluffs . He had bought his way into the Illinois Central which Stuyvesant Fish controlled . Now Mr. Fish was a gentleman who tempered empire building with elegance ; he did not believe that a person of quality need handle a railroad less gracefully than he would a cravat . His cigars , acumen , and the atmosphere of success and imported cologne that enveloped his person charmed all the southerners with whom he had occasion to come in contact . But he made one blunder . He quarreled with Mr. Harriman , was fired .
