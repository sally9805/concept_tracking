ARMY &; NAVY <P> Spring was coming to Washington with a rush . Sap was rising . The Japanese cherry trees encircling the Tidal Basin in Potomac Park were about to burgeon . A soft greenish sentimentality was adrift in the air . Ulysses Simpson Grant III walked out of the long flat Navy building , sniffed the sweet air , drove to the Tidal Basin , examined the cherry tree buds with the expert eye of a lieutenant-colonel of engineers . Then , in his official capacity as Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital , he predicted that these famed trees would blossom forth in all their double-flowered , pinkish loveliness on April 5 . <P> Great was the rejoicing in the wake of this forecast by the cherry trees ' public custodian . Last summer the heavens had opened to pour upon Potomac Park a deluge of almost Biblical proportions . For days the cherry tree roots had stood in rotting slime . Their leaves browned , fell off . They were , apparently , dead . But now they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring visitors to Washington to gaze in gabbling ecstasy . Great , among Washington 's hotelmen and shopkeepers , was the name of Grant who fostered this renaissance . <P> Spring has brought to Col. Grant other problems .

The Colonel was graduated from West Point in 1903 , did the usual round of foreign duty , married the daughter of Elder Statesman Elihu Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no U.S. Grant IV . In the War he was a member of the U.S. General Staff Corps , on the official fringe of the Paris Peace Conference . <P> In Washington he rules a great domain . To begin with he is the President 's official landlord , charged with the maintenance of the White House . He is a potent member of these Commissions : Arlington Bridge , National Capital Park &; Planning , Public Buildings , District of Columbia Zoning . His predecessor , Lieutenant Colonel Clarence O. Sherrill , retired in 1926 to go and be Cincinnati 's $25,000-per-year city manager , a post he still fills to the greater glory of Cincinnati and himself . <P> Last week as chairman of the Inaugural Committee , Col. Grant wrote letters of appreciation to many distinguished persons , thanking them for their attendance in Washington March 4 . Lamentably , one such letter went to Governor Henry Stewart Caulfield ( Republican ) of Missouri . On March 4 , Governor Caulfield was putting in a normal working day at Jefferson City .
