In the U. S. are 27 warehouses in which 15,000,000 gallons of liquor are stored . The liquor is private property held for legal sale as medicine . In bonded storage the U. S. stands stern guard over it , with agents to gauge its quantity , to test its quality , to control its withdrawal for drug-store purpose . Last week its was revealed in Chicago that some 50,000 gallons of such closely-guarded liquor had somehow gotten out of government bondage . It was the biggest " escape " of its kind in the history of Prohibition . <P> In Sibley Warehouse reposed between 3,000 and 4,000 barrels , 50,000 cases of ten-and twelve-year-old Bourbon . Protecting it were 31 , government gaugers and storekeepers . Some 250 dry agents could come and go in the warehouse premises . Craftily , more than 500 barrels , 2,000 cases were tapped , their fuming contents siphoned out . Back inside was poured a concoction of colored water and alcohol which would show the proper proof to deceive gaugers but which even a " sick " person would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extractions at Sibley Warehouse had been in progress , evidently , before their full extent was disclosed to Commissioner of Prohibition James M. Doran , who , last week in Washington , sat frowning at an 84-page report . At ' legger prices , the liquor theft , directly under the nose of U. S. agents , amounted to some $2,000,000 . <P> The agents logically came under suspicion first . A Grand Jury was asked to fix the blame . Nor did the government consider the owners of the lost liquor , the holders of the warehouse certificates , altogether blameless . Many of them were supposed to be onetime saloon keepers who had not wholly lost interest in liquor sales . <P> The other 26 liquor warehouses throughout the land were hastily checked by the U. S. agents , in search of similar escapes from bondage.
