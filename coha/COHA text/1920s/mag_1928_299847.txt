The American Club at Paris last week entertained a twitterer-Lieut-Col . Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla . Many present had known him in the U. S. He had been a co-worker with the late Ferdinand de Lesseps on the first attempt to dig a Panama canal . That project ( by the French Campagnie Universelle du Canal de Panama ) failed and Capt . Bunau-Varilla tried to persuade the U. S. to build a sea-level canal along the surveyed route . That was 27 years ago . Four years ago he was again in the U. S. This time he wore a wooden stump for his right leg shot off during the War . And again he urged a sea-level canal-alongside the present-Canal , one to cost a billion dollars ( TIME , Jan. 28 , 1924 ) . The U. S. War Department has his recommendations on file . U. S. businessmen occasionally wondered if the old engineer was alive . He was , and at 69 still shrewd and witty . <P> At Paris last week he twitted the U. S. clubmen on their distaste for water . Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost anywhere in France . <P> To American Club members he retold how he had helped make eau potable a wide reality in France . It began at Verdun , during the War . Water was polluted ; typhoid threatened the troops . He invented an automatic device to pump hypochlorite of soda into the drinking water . Two and a half to five pounds of hypochlorite liberated enough chlorine to kill the germs in one million gallons of water . <P> After the War first Rheims , then Carcassonne , then 200 more French cities adopted his chlorination methods . Lately Spanish , Portuguese and Venezuelan communities have done likewise .
