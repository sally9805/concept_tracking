Of all the birds of heaven , none is more moral than the stork . Monogamy is his rule and practice . Year in and year out he cleaves to the original wife of rooftree or in the cornice of a South European villa . So faithful and contented is the admirable stork , indeed , that he was long ago judged fit to represent the mysterious agency that brings the patter of tiny feet to human abodes . Pet storks are commonly named " Cato , " after the eminent Stoic . <P> But not until last week were ornithologists particularly conscious of a truly extraordinary feature of stork ethics that is familiar folklore among European peasants . Storks enforce their code of sex morality by vigilant communal action . Ornithologist Annie France-Harar arrived in Berlin from a stork-studying trip to Greece and described the actual execution of a stork adulteress by 50 of her incensed neighbors . They met in the air over her nest , where she sat trembling with full knowledge of her sin and the penalty . Down they swooped upon her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bits . Miss France-Harar 's colleague , one Surgeon Orthman , vouched for her story , adding that he had seen three such executions within the year , in each case upon a female stork , giving rise to the assumption that a double standard prevails , unfaithful stork husbands-if there be any such- going scot free . <P> Scientists wish they knew more about the family life of the whale . So retiring is the creature that none can say surely if he takes a single wife or a seraglio . Englishmen sailed lately from Hull for the South Atlantic to find out , by peering and prying and firing identification tags into whales found together . If polygamous , male whales will be rewarded with protection that their kind may increase and multiply .
