It is always good fun to compute the output of the Ford Motor Co. , the centre of U. S. business romance . The Wall Street Journal from time to time publishes some crumbs of Ford information which its agents pick up in Detroit . That is where these statistics of Ford 's year production came from , that the paper published last week : <P> 1921 928,750 <P> 1922 1,232,209 <P> 1923 1,915,485 <P> 1924 1,790,278 <P> 1925 1,798,123 <P> 1926 1,447,915 <P> The figures for 1926 are frankly based on the presumption that only 40,000 cars were made in December because the Ford plants worked but ten days during the month . In November the output was only 91,708 cars . However , had November and December production kept to the average of 131,620 cars for each of the first ten months of the year , even then the total would have been merely 1,579,448 . <P> Whether a proper analysis or not , the 1926 situation gives one explanation for the offer the Ford Co. made its dealers last week . For $60 the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its condition , in first class running order . It will reupholster and repaint such a car , rebuild the motor , and then guarantee the whole job for three months . Thus a dealer can offer high value for a broken down 1925 Ford on a trade-in or he can sell remade cars at bargain prices .
