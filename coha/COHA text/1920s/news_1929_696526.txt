txt The Bank of England , its store of gold drained by French purchases to the lowest point of the year . has made en arrangement whereby a credit of about 8250,000.000 can be established here at a few hours ' notice . Invocation of this credit is thus made possible as a final recourse toi Inset the situation arising through the controversy between . the British and French Governments over the division of German indemnity paymeets under the Young plan . A credit of this or any amount does net ceist at this time , but , through the egrecntent which has been made . the Dank of England may cable to the Federal Reserve Bank at New York and within twenty-four hours the credit will be established . The Bent cf England therefore stands in the came position as if the credit were actually on the books . Gold to Be Available .

The New York Federal Reserve Bank would not extend the credit directly . but would be the medium through which an unnamed group of New York banks would jointly create the credit .. These banks were described as having assembled funds in readiness for extension of the credit . All that would be required would be a cable from the Bank of England to the Federal Reserve Bank and some telephoning from the latter organization to the interests which have agreed to join in the credit . How the credit would be used by the Eank of England would be at the discretion of that institution . It could be used in the exchange markets to keep up the price of sterling , which has had several declines this year , cr it could be used to rebuild in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the decrease in London 's gold reserves from a high level for the year on June 13 of ? 164,211,000 to a low for the year of ? 141,431,000 last week , and the increase in the Bank of France 's gold reserves to a , record level for all time of 38.109,000 , - 000 francs last week , has given concern to the Bank of England and the British Government , there has been another factor which has caused alarm . This has been the flight of the pound sterling to America . It was said in banking circles yes-I terday that , largely as a result of apprehension over the possible taxation and other fiscal policies of the Labor Government , British investors1 and capitalists have been sending ' , their funds in an increasing amount of late for investment and speculation in this country . This has been an important factor in the lowering of sterling below the gold shipment point and the consequent export of the metal on a substantial scale to New York . New York has received $48.000.000 of gold from England this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A banker who discussed the matter yesterday said that the Bank of England is prepared to exercise moral suasion to halt this flow of capital to the United States , and if British capitalists live up to tradition , they will heed such an admonition from the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street . In fact , it is believed , here that the Bank of England will go to great lengths to avoid calling on New York for credit . The very fact that such a credit can- be asvembled instantly is likely to serve to prevent speculative operations for a further fall in sterling . The present situation resembles somewhat the one that existed when Great Britain went on a gold basis in 1925 . Then the Federal Reserve Bank at New York undertook to sell gold on credit to the Bank of Eng- land for a period of two years , but not in an amount exceeding $200 , - 000,000 .

It was pointed out yesterday that Paris is in a position to embarass London through the former city 's ascendancy to a leading role among European capitals in respect to liquid holdings . France is now one of the most prosperous countries in Europe . its income from tourists alone being authoritatively estimated at between $300,000,000 and $400,000,000 annually . It has been said in European dispatches that France has put the weight of its resources behind a move to embarrass Great Britain in its financial arrangements and this view was subscribed to in banking circles here . Philip Snowden , Chancellor of the Exchequer , stirred the Hague conference in recent sessions by saying that under the Young plan Great Britain would receive an inadequate amount of what Germany will be required to nay . Rapid Decline of Reserve . The position of the Bank of England has been watched with anxiety by bankers here and abroad for several weeks . Following the arresting of the gold movement to this country earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising its rediscount rate to 5if .. per cent , the British bank of issue built up its gold reserves to ? 164,200,000 in the ? middle of June . Since then , however , gold reserves have dropped rapidly , due to heavy withdrawals by France and Germany , and now stand at ? 141,431,158 , the lowest point reached since the resumption of the gold standard in 1925 . This depletion of the Bank of England 's gold reserves has been accomplished largely through a series of withdrawals for French account . The movement was halted by an improvement in the position of sterling with relation to the franc recently , but while it lasted shipments of from $5,000,000 to $15.000,000 crossed the Channel almost daily . It has been expected for some time that the Bank of England would be compelled to advance its rate , and the action of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in lifting its rediscount rate last Thursday has made such . a move imperative , in the opinion of local bankers .
