txt The Commonwealth of Australia conversion loan of $100,000,000 proved completely successful . as expected , and it was closed three and one-half weeks before the maturing date with an oversubscription of $8.900,000 . There was a rush of applications in the closing stages . and some large cash subscriptions were received . Conversion applications totaled $69.120.000 and cash subscriptions $44,780,000 . Approximately ** applications were received , indicating the wide appeal of the loan , and of these 16,000 represented cash subscriptions and 18,000 conversion applications . The Australian banks underwrote this loan on a commission of 2it Sc . On this occasion their underwriting fees are clear profit . On the $180,000,000 conversion loan floated in 1927 they were left with $62.000,000 undersubscribed , and a large proportion of this is still in their hands . In all recent loans the Australian public has preferred the shorter period of maturity when an option has been given ; and in this case more than SO ' of the applicants chose the seven years ' period rather than the 14 years ' optional period .

It now will be possible to use the loan receipts for the whole amount due without recourse to the sinking fund . A surplus of $3,850,000 will be applied to other loan redemption . Conversion of War Loans No previous Commonwealth loan has been closed so far ahead of the date originally fixed . The $335.000,000 conversion war loan floated in 1925  --  the largest hitherto issued by the Commonwealth  --  was successfully filled a week before the maturity of the old bonds , and in the same year a loan of 527.000,000 was closed a week before maturity date because the full amount originally announced was not required Apart from these two cases extended time has been given for loans . During the past five years the Commonwealth has successfully dealt with the conversion of 51,140,000.000 war loans originally raised in entirety in Australia : conversion operations were conducted in the Commonwealth . no portion of the amount being raised overseas . Renewal of this large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Australian public to discharge their obligations and their confidence in the soundness of the investment in Commonwealth government bonds . There will be a short respite during the ensuing two years . as the only Commonwealth loan requiring conversion before 1930 is 514.030,000 Gs maturing in May.1 1929 . It will probably not be necessary to make a public issue in respect of this loan ; redemptions are expected to be made from sinking fund . In the following two years the responsibilities of the Commonwealth treasury will , however , be considerable . In March , 1930. a $53,295.000 67 , - loan raised for Commonwealth and state purposes matures , and in December of the same year a $309.590.000 6r. war loan must be redeemed . The treasurer will thus have to meet obligations in 1930 amounting to $362.885.000 , the largest sum hitherto required for conversion in any one year . In 1931 the Commonwealth must convert a 5/. : 5- war loan of $130.000.000 and other loans totaling 516,835.000 , all maturing in December .

In the current year the total approximates $100,000.000. of which Victoria is responsible for 804 250,000. largely a 550.000,000 5- , loan . All the state loans maturing in 1928 were raised in Australia . In 1929 the states will have to convert a much larger amount-5139,500,000 in Australia and 564.500,000 in London . Victoria is again responsible for the largest amount-590.000.000 . Queensland is responsible for most of the London commitments . State obligations for conversion in 1930 will be even greater than in the two previous years ? $200.000 000 in Australia and $19.000.000 in London New South NS ales has the largest proportion -- $77.250,000 , all in Australia . Successful organization of these large conversion operations in the next three years will require careful financing , and no doubt the Australian Loan Council is giving consideration to the problem . As result of such a large cash subscription to the recent loan , holders of the maturing issue who declined to convert will be paid off .

They have hitherto- attempted to obtain the isque price of 081 : . , but as the bonds cost the banks only 96'k a wide margin is left at current market levels . There has been some interest in financial circles at the large accumulation of Australian funds in London . According to the last weekly return the Commonwealth Bank had $105,500,000 on call in London , increase of $17,500.000 in two weeks . No doubt the figures were affected by the accumulation of the proceeds of recent Commonwealth London and New York loans , and they will be further increased by the liquidation of wool bills , now that the wool selling season has commenced .
