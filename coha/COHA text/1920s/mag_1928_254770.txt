The young men supplied their own epigraphs . One of them wrote : " After graduating I spent a thoroughly delightful summer traveling abroad with Davis and R. Noyes and , returning in September , started to work in the National Commercial Bank of Albany . . . . <P> " In the spring of 1910 , I left Albany to come to New York to work in the financial department of J. G. White &; Co. , engineers and contractors , who do a large financial business as well , and have stayed with that company to date .

That was in 1915 . After one year he became a vice president in charge of the bank 's bond department . He developed the securities business so amazingly that the bank created a subsidiary-the Guaranty Co . The young man became its president . He also became a director in many a powerful company such as Bethlehem Steel Corp. , B. F.

Nor could many talk to him last week , for he was hunting quail in the South with President William Chapman Potter of the Guaranty Trust Co.
