In capitalistic Washington , State Department officials stuck to the story of the ogre that is Bolshevism , refused passports to Socialists , rebuked far-away Mexico for communistic tendencies . In Chicago their archenemy , Comrade Charles E. Ruthenberg , master-Bolshevik , eyes hope-haunted with a thousand failures , lay still , died . Throughout the U. S. tiny bands of comrades mourned . " He was , " said the Daily Worker , communist newssheet , " the sole outstanding figure who carried over into our party the very best traditions of the pre-War socialist movement ... We expected to write soon that he had gone to prison because of his loyalty to the cause of the workers . . . . But death does not release its prisoners . " Editor Linson of the Chinese Nationalist Daily , news organ of the Kuomintang ( Chinese Nationalist Party ) , wrote : " We are very sorry that such an able man as C. E. Ruthenberg leaves us so soon . " Editor Olgin of the Hammer eulogized : " He looked like a rock . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " <P> Born of a Cleveland longshoreman , Comrade Ruthenberg found in elementary school and business college education enough to climb in rapid strides from factory worker and clerk to newspaper correspondent and editor . In 1909 he took to his heart the pink flag of socialism ; held it there while it turned perceptibly red . <P> Nine times he waged unsuccessful compaigns for political offices ( State treasurer , Mayor , Governor , U. S. Senator ) . His political creed : Gain office in the legislatures of capitalism to carry on the war for a peaceful revolution within their very walls . <P> In 1917 , jail , the " capitalistic bastille , " threatened . The great War broke out ; on a soap box in the Public Square , Cleveland , Comrade Ruthenberg shouted , " War is mass murder . " He was indicted , sentenced to one year in jail . <P> Comrade Ruthenberg was ever in the toils of the law . At the time of his death an appeal was pending in the U. S. Supreme Court from an indeterminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Bitter , humorless , antagonizing more than he converted , Charles Ruthenberg split the Socialist party in 1919 , became leader of the small Communist wing , while the late Eugene Victor Debs remained leader of the Socialists . Comrade Ruthenberg 's ultimate purpose was " revolution without violence " ; he advocated strikes " because they are a dress rehearsal for the revolution " which he hoped would free the workers from capitalism . <P> He died alone , at 44 , shadowed by broken hopes , crying , " Let 's fight on ! " His comrades , echoing his cry , shouted of new vigor , new conquests to Communism . They saw one more hope , one more strong leader gone from a cause which , in the U. S. , is , at least for the present , hopeless , leaderless.
