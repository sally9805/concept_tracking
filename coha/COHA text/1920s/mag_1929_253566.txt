The painting of a buxom brunette called La Belle Ferronire was still displayed , last week , in a Manhattan courtroom . Was it the work of Leonardo da Vinci ? To this question Georges Sortais , French connoisseur , had answered YES , and the owner of the painting , Mrs. Harry J. Hahn of Kansas City , had believed him . But Sir Joseph Duveen , potent millionaire art dealer , had murmured NO , thus preventing the sale of the painting to the Kansas City art museum . Therefore Mrs. Hahn had sued Sir Joseph for $500,000 ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . The trial involved comparisons with the famed and very similar La Belle Ferronire in the Louvre , also perhaps a Leonardo . To this question Connoisseur Sortais and Mrs. Hahn answered NO , Sir Joseph Duveen answered YES . Last week this notable trial continued . <P> Duveen . For four days Sir Joseph had been a harried witness . He had flayed the Hahn picture , testily calling its left eye " dead , " " very dead , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the whole damozel with one more coating of scorn . " She is a fat person ! " he gibed . " A peasant type . " Then he joyously pointed to a reproduction of the Louvre Belle . " This is a great lady of the period . " Reverting to the Hahn painting he described the shoulders as flabby , the arms as puffy , the breast as lacking modeling , the embroidery as untrue to Leonardo 's period . " The hair ! " he exclaimed , " That 's not hair-that is mud ! ... If an artist paints wood it must be wood , not steel . If he paints hair it must be hair , not mud . " <P> The Hahn Lawyer , stalwart S. Lawrence Miller , grinned . " In short , " he suggested , " she has a face like a mask and the rest of her is like a balloon . " <P> " Exactly ! " cried Sir Joseph . <P> Hug . Into the courtroom came J. Conrad Hug , the Kansas City art dealer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Joseph . A withered , white , frail little old gentleman , he told how he had arranged the sale of the Hahn painting to the Kansas City museum for $250,000 , how the Duveen dictum had quashed the bargain . He said that he dealt in picture frames , paintings and etchings . Sir Joseph 's lawyer , Louis S. Levy , was quick , acid . " The picture frames are a very big part of your business , are n't they ? " Mr. Hug 's murmurous answer was lost in his throat . Soon afterward he went away , assisted by bailiffs . <P> Chernoff . The next witness for the plaintiff was Vadim Chernoff , a blond Russian expatriate , a painter of ikons . Excitedly , with an accent like a musical comedian , he dilated for an hour on Renaissance pigmentation , explained both how and what colors were used . He called the Hahn painting " translucent , " and the Louvre painting " dirty . " Technically he was wise , but Lawyer Levy confounded him with questions on art history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever , been sought in weighty controversy . Sir Joseph chuckled as the Chernoff lecture began . Later he gazed into a newspaper with obvious boredom . When M. Chernoff gave his opinion that the Hahn painting was a Leonardo and that the Louvre painting was not a Leonardo , Sir Joseph mumbled : " By Jove ! Sacrilege ! "
