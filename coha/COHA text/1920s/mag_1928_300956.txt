JINGLING IN THE WIND-Elizabeth Madox Roberts-Viking ( $2.00 ) . <P> <P> In cadenced prose Author Roberts has written two substantial U. S. novels that have feeling and sound sense . Whether she wearied of her impeccable artistic performance ; or whether moving to New York from her Kentucky mountains proved too kaleidoscopic ; or whether the critic lives up to his proverbial reputation for obtuseness , Jingling in the Wind is utterly meaningless potpourri of pleasant enough bits of satire , glimpses of nature , young men in love . A 21st century substitute for Prometheus is Jeremy , rainmaker , who journeys to the rainmakers ' convention . On the way the motorbus is stalled , and each passenger tells an inferior Canterbury tale ( the title of the book is also from Chaucer ) . Distinction is reserved for the format of one tale : only those words are set down which Jeremy , dreaming of his love , happens to catch . Stripped of verbosity , the skeleton is a good model for conversational monologists.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
