txt In his annual report , President LOWELL of Harvard commends a recent trend away from " the older system of instruction " in which the educational unit is a " numerical credit " and toward a system under which the educational unit is " the individual student . " The statement is less remarkable for its truth , obvious and indisputable though it is , than for the fact that it still requires to be made . By numerical credits , of course , President Lo WELL means tabulated records in the office of the Dean . These show how often each undergraduate has cut lectures , what marks he has achieved in hour examinations , mid-years and finals , and how often hitherto he has been summoned for suspicious conduct . When a personal conference Is involved , the numerieals are not so much credits as discredits . The good Dean scans the tabulation , and when he looks up it is with a clouded eye . The whole atmosphere , in fact , is likely to be clouded , for there is generally a queue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , in brief , the only official contact is disciplinary . If the student survives his numerical discredits , he tacks the Dean 's postcard summons on his study door . When he has collected a goodly number of these , his comrades love him , as De.sdemona loved Othello , for the dangers he has passed . If he avoids dangers and pages only his examinations , he has virtually no official contact with the Faculty . He is happy as a nation that has no history . To President LOWELL the older system means standardized education , a mass production that is easy and cheap but without quality . There is no such thing as . machine-made cultore . As the thumb of the potter should mark the pot , so the mind of the teacher should intimately touch and transform the mind of the taught . Concretely , President LOWELL stands for the friendly and continuous contact of the tutorial system of instruction and for the degree that is awarded on the basis of a ' general examination . " So long as the individual student 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on numerical credits for lectures attended and on pesky hour examinations . The good Dean 's eye will be relieved of its perfunctory clouding . The bad student will no longer be able to flaunt his delinquencies on his study door . Even the results of annual examinations will not count as . numerical credits determining whether , and with what frills , a degree shall be granted . A single , comprehensive test will reveal not so much what the student remembers as how well he has absorbed it into his mentality and is able to express and apply it . The virtues of the English honor schools and honor examinations have been observed through many decades . If we are thus tardy in making them our own , it Is not altogether because College Faculties are slow in the uptake . The new system of instruction is as much more expensive as It is more truly educational , and the willing donor has an inhuman predilection for business schools and scientific laboratories .                 @ @ @ @
