Adopted by King Alexander I , last week , were two frightened , sad-eyed little Raditches . They are sons of Opposition Deputy Paul Raditch , who was foully assassinated ( TIME , July 2 ) in the Skupshtina ( Parliament ) by a Government Deputy . <P> The great Stefan Raditch , uncle of Paul , and Leader of the Opposition , was the assassin 's primary target but received only a bullet wound in the stomach from which he was said , last week , to be " rapidly recovering . " <P> Public indignation finally forced the resignation of the Vukichevich Cabinet , last week ; and King Alexander offered the Prime Ministry to Stefan Raditch , who wrathfully rejected the offer , thus leaving the situation perilously embroiled .
