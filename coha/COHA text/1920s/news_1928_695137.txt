Trepassey . Few persons saw the gilt-winged Fokker monoplane descend on the Welsh coast , but this evening , . when friends rushing . from Southampton brought Miss Earhart ashore , she was the recipient of so enthusiastic a reception by the 2,000 inhabitants of this town , that it seemed for a few minutes as if she would not outlive her triumph . Eager Crowds Imperil Aviatrix . The arrival of the Friendship was ' the greatest event this remote district has had since the end of . the World War when the town 's boys came home .

" You must , remember , " the local Police- Chief . said apologetically , " that our- people never saw anything to compare with this . I advise you to remain here ' until we get extra police . " The Friendship 's crew were ' marooned within the walls of the Frickers Metal Company an hour and a half before police reinforcements arrived and cleared a way to two motor cars to ? take them to a distant hotel where rest , food and sleep could be obtained after their arduous ' journey .

Except for the first hour over the Atlantic after leaving the rugged shores of , Newfoundland , the fliers never saw sea or land until they had winged their way to the Fastern Irish coast . They flew through fog , rain and snow most of the time , fighting for altitude and clearer weather , but they came fast with the wind behind of twenty to thirty miles . per hour , peeding them on . - They probably had plenty of gasoline left , when they descended , to reach Southampton  --  seventy-five gallons  --  but viere struggling in the midst of dense fog , and knew they were somewhere off the southern coast of , Britain . With their object attained  --  that of making Miss Earhart the first woman to complete a transatlantic crossing  --  they decided to take no further risks . They will go on to Southampton tomorrow .

Both ejaculated their joy at their success and chuckled . together over the moments in mid-ocean when they seemed dubious of the outcome . Miss Earhart , who came through her experience in fine condition and spirits , struggled against weariness to narrate her experience before she , too , sought sleep . The adventurers , after five false starts in the Harbor of Trepassey , succeeded in lifting the plane only after dropping fifty gallons of gasoline and cutting down the supply to 700 gallons as against 1,000 they had meant originally to carry . Even with the lightened load they barely lifted the plane skyward with two motors cut out because dashed with spray , but soon they were lifting its weight gradually along the Newfoundland coast till Stultz felt sure the engines were running smoothly .

They headed for the open sea in excellent weather only to run into continuous fog after an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane , they were enabled to soar 5,000 to 11,000 feet , where most of the way above the clouds they traveled amid a sea of blazing stars , heading , it seemed , into a series of rainbow rings . They received bearings twice from a ship before the radio was out of commission , and encountered bad weather until over- Queenstown , Ireland . There they saw ships and tried to drop notes to find their exact location , but failed to obtain an answer . Stultz turned correctly southward , however , and headed toward Southampton . Meanwhile , headed by the Hon. Mrs. Frederick E. Guest , backer of the flight , with her husband , Captain Guest , a member of Parliament and international polo player , and Raymond Guest , former captain of the Yale polo team , there was a large gathering at Southampton awaiting the fliers ' arrival . A plane bearing Captain Guest cruished intermittently from noon till 3 P. M. on the lookout .

After hours of anxiety , during which the plane was believed overdue , the watchers at Southampton received the welcome word at 2:45 P. M. that the Friendship was down on the Welsh coast . Race to Coast by Plane and Auto . A race to reach her by plane and high-powered automobile began instantly . A seaplane carrying Captain H. H. Railey , European director of the flight , and THE NEW YORK TIMES correspondent , was the first to drop alongside the ocean fliers in Loughor estuary after a three-hour jaunt cutting across Southern England . There were still traces of fog which cut the ocean journey short , but flying low the occupants of the seaplane descried the gilt wings of the Friendship bobbing at a buoy off-. shore here . A final run by motor boat brought the fliers in sight . As Miss Earhart looked from the open doorway of the fuselage and recognized one of her visitors as Captain Railey , he , ending a two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shout of jubilation and let it float off down the tide . There was an exultant reunion . After a consultation it was decided by Stultz to taxi the plane into the shelter of the Burry Port quays and there the hospitable attack of the Welsh throng began . Before it was ended Miss Earhart had appeared thrice , in the manner of royalty , at a window of the zinc factory to acknowledge the cheers of the dense crowd below ; had been served with tea by the wife of the factory foreman and finally battled and tricked her way to a roadside inn near the village as darkness was nearing and the clock struck 9 . She had been thirty hours en route to her first comfortable resting place . " Tired and hungry , but cheerful , " she commented , lounging in her wooly coat and breeches and stout leather boots . " And we got here all right . There was n't any race with Miss Boll , but , of course , I 'm glad to be the first woman across . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to come ashore after the Friendship had alighted at Burry Port . He declared he was dead tired and explained that he had only enough gasoline left to enable the Friendship to taxi another ten miles . " No one was more thankful than I was , " he admitted , " to see the Welsh coast . We had a very bad trip right through and most - of the way I was flying blind . I was at the joystick throughout the whole trip and had considerable difficulty in keeping on my course bemuse of the fog and rain . After realizing that we were getting short of gasoline I resolved to come down as soon as a favorable opportunity offered . " Then I saw the estuary , which I now know to be Burry Port , and after circling to make sure everything was clear I landed on the strip of water and fastened up to a buoy .

Well , I do nt ' want to discuss it at the moment . It was n't a pleasant experience , although everything went perfectly . I had to steer solely by the instruments , and luckily none of them went - wrong . We flew at a fair height , but flew blind . When we approached the Welsh coast I had to come down to the ground to see where we were . " " Tremendous Triumph , " Says the Hon. Mrs. Guest . Captain Guest , who was formerly Minister of Air , and the Hon. Mrs. Guest , who partially financed the Friendship 's flight and originally intended to participate in it , were at Southampton when the news arrived that the plane was down at Burry Point . " I regard the flight as a tremendous triumph , " Mrs. Guest said , " and hope it will be another link in the chain of Anglo-American friendship . That is why I named the machine ' Friendship . " Sir Samuel Hoare , Air Minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London : Please accept and convey to Miss Earhart and Wilmer Stultz and their companion the Air Council 's warm congratulations on the successful completion of their Atlantic flight .
