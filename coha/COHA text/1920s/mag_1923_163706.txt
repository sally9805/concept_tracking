Oscar W. Underwood , after four months abroad , returned to this country . In Alabama the State Legislature , which convenes in the middle of July , awaited the Senator 's reply to its request that he become a candidate for the Presidency . He is rated a conservative , a " moist " ( as opposed to " wet " ) and an advocate of an active foreign policy . <P> Before the Alabama Senator went south to address his state legislature , he paused in Washington long enough to deliver a statement attacking the Administration 's foreign policy . At once his attack was hailed as the first step of his race for the Democratic nomination , which he is expected to make . He declared in part : <P> " Never in our history as a nation have we occupied a more negative position in the affairs of Europe than today . . . . Our Governmental arm seems paralyzed so far as help in that direction is concerned . . . . There are more causes of war existing in Europe today than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As for a World Court , " it is a wise and progressive policy that is needed and not the laggard motion of a court of law ! " <P> William G. McAdoo , it is anticipated , will reach the Democratic Convention with far more votes than anyone else , but political prognosticators persist , as they have done for some time , in declaring that Mr. McAdoo will not be able to gain any votes once he enters the Convention - because all those who are not for McAdoo are very much against him . It follows , if that is true , that he can not get the nomination , for which a two-thirds vote is necessary . Nevertheless , supporters of McAdoo are not downhearted . Recently Samuel B. Amidon , Democratic National Committeeman , sailed for Europe . He is one of the leaders in McAdoo 's campaign . A large dinner was given in Manhattan for Mr. Amidon , and many McAdooans assembled . It appeared from their discussion that their problem will be to corral delegates from several of the larger states . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will be very difficult to get delegates from states like New York , Illinois , Massachusetts , Wisconsin , Missouri , Kentucky , Pennsylvania , to accept a totally dry candidate .
