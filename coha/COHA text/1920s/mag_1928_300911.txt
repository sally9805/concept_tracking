Like most city-builders , they were shortsighted who built up Manhattan Island . The high , rocky , sunset edge of the island has been allowed to fall into the hands of cheap-johnny apartment builders and tenants . It was a natural development , however , because , like the swampy eastern edge of the island , the upper bank of the Hudson was less accessible than the island 's spine . Also , because the Hudson 's bank is the island 's natural dock and shipping side . Wharves , warehouses and railroad tracks thrived there and stretched up the island before society or even social convenience made competitive demands . The commercial coagulation on Manhattan 's western bank is no stranger than Cleveland 's hideous , eastern waterfront , Cincinnati 's and Pittsburgh 's smoke-draggled riverbanks or Chicago 's fuliginous south shore . <P> As cities grow , however , cities awaken . Chicago has taken its shore lines in hand , built new land with sandsuckers and made a new outer-driveway to the south as well as a made-land drive skirting Lincoln Park on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scow-ridden reaches of the Chicago River . And last week New York City 's Board of Estimate finally approved plans for a driveway , which will ameliorate land values as well as living standards , up the western shore of Manhattan Island from Canal Street to 59th Street . A linking boulevard from 59th Street to 72nd Street , where Riverside Drive begins , had already been approved . Construction of the whole was authorized to begin with the New Year and promised in completion for July 1 , 1930 . <P> The plan is to elevate a motor concourse above the railroad right-of-way now labelled Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues and commonly , because of accidents , called " Death Avenue . " Ramps to the superstructure will occur at 22nd , 44th and 57th Streets . The whole will cost some $13,500,000 ( graft excluded ) . One boom in Manhattan riverside real estate has already occurred recently , on the Harlem River bank around 80th Street , under the leadership of Vincent Astor . The new concourse was expected to carry the boom from east side to west side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
