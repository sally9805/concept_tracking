" It is , of course , gratifying to Federal authorities that this campaign against sources of supply and higher-ups in one of the most ' difficult sections for enforcement in the United States resulted in the arrest of these prominent violators .

The charge against Foley and the four brewers was the outcome of an investigation that began , in a small way , last June and assumed " interesting " proportions two months later . When , according to the Government 's complaint , Foley became friendly with Saul Grill , a special prohibition enforcement agent , and his partner , Patrick T. Roche . The Government charged that Foley introduced the agents , and two others who were assigned to investigate , to the brewers one at a time and that the brewers began to shower the agents with automobiles , expensive holiday jaunts and substantial cash presents . One of the first bribes , according to the Federal complaint was of $2,500 passed over during a quiet drive through Central Park . The agents , in an effort to make their , evidence ironclad , engaged the hotel suite so that the bribers could do their bribing in comfort . Pay day , according to the agents , was every Thursday and the bribers and the agents would have what amounted to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . As the Government men told ft ; the New Jersey brewers early in the year began to view with alarm the increasing business done in this city by Pennsylvania breweries . The Pennsylvania makers of the real stuff were shipping in barrel after barrel of the beer and the Jersey beer began to suffer . The bribe rate per barrel , according to the agents , was $1 to $2 each . Colonel Hayward said that his office and the other Federal agencies for prohibition enforcement in this city were informed of the conditions in . New Jersey . Colonel Hayward said they heard " that the Jersey brewers were paying graft for protection and were willing to pay it anywhere . " Yeliowley 's Men Engaged . The Federal District Attorney conferred with E. C. Yellowley , formerly in charge locally and now Chief Prohibition Enforcement Agent , and the result was a decision to have some of Yellowlee " s most trusted men investigate . " The prohibition agents , " said Colonel Fayward , " got in touch with Hugh alcQuillian . Chief of the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the graft . " Saul Grill , one of the general prohibition agents and a man with a. reputation for thorou " hness , was chosen to make the approach . Grill was the agent who recently went to Canada . negotiated a deal for thousands of cases of Scotch , decoyed the sellers to this city and arrested them . He also got the evidence that resulted in the raids on Broadway rendezvous . Grill looked the ground over and then Roche and Special Internal Revenue Agents Earl R. Barnard and William M. Danninger were assigned to be " corrupted . " The four Government detectives went to work in earnest then . They charged that their meeting with Foley was arranged for by Jersey politicians and that when the " agents agreed to furnish protection for real beer " to the Jersey brewers , Foley was introduced to Katz , known as Major Katz by virtue of a Quartermasters Corps commission during the Spanish-American war . One by one , according to the agents ' sworn statements , they met the other brewers . The agents agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trip across the ferries and that every single consignment of Pennsylvania beer they heard about would be promptly seized . It was arranged that payments of from $1,000 to $6,000 to the beer protectors were to be made weekly and on the basis of $1 a barrel at the Hotel Pennsylvania headquarters . Spread of Jersey Beer . The scheme of " protection " worked well and Jersey foam was quenching the thirsty in September in many saloons. restaurants and " speak-easies " in the metropolitan district . The " corrupted " agents and the brewers , according to the agents ' stories , entertained each other right royally at the weekly business meeting when reports showing the spread of Jersey beer and the complete evaporation of the Pennsylvania article were delivered . In the weeks when the $84,000 was being paid over in good money the agents were in constant communication with their superiors and a safe down in Colonel Hayward 's office last night held all of the money alleged to have been paid over . This will be used as evidence against the accused men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dream of a Jersey beer monopoly , " they apparently thought that they were not doing enough for the supposedly bought agents . So they began to take their fictitious friends on long automobile trips . When one of the agents dilated on the delights of automobiling from roadhouse to roadhouse he and his partner received presents of machines of an expensive make . Then there were " feasts " at inns near New York . One of these little entertainments cost $1.000 at a well-known Westchester County resort , according to the agents . It was during these entertainments when the article of industry flowed freely , supplemented by something stronger , that the brewers unbosomed themselves to their " protectors. " $800,000 Payments Reported . Colonel Hayward said that the agents reported conversation in which the l'elvers had admitted paying $800,000 last year to prohibition agents in New Jersey for-protection and the prevention of Pennsylvania beer transportation across Jersey to New York State . The brewers said , according to the agents , that politicians as well as Jersey agents were getting paid . As showing how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that in one period of a few weeks the financed Jersey agents had held up eighty-seven motor truck loads of Pennsylvania beer . In the same period , the brewer was quoted as saying , the agents let 80,000 barrels of real Jersey brew trickle this way . Continuing in this fashion to collect evidence , the agents reported at stated times to Colonel Hayward and his two assistants . Maxwell S. Mattuck and J. A. Millard . Several days ago the Federal prosecutors began to put their findings before the Federal Grand Jury and soon after 1 o'clock yesterday , just before the Grand Jury was discharged for this term by Federal Judge John C. Knox , a number of indictments were handed up . One of the indictments wail ordered sealed and as soon as it had been accepted by the Court the Federal agencies , including the Internal Revenue sleuths and the general prohibition agents , began to close in on the hotel suite . Roche and Grill in expectancy of their " pay day " wept to the suite early yesterday . They were tipped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of the brewers to arrive had an added touch of cordiality in it . This brewer got to the hotel about 11 o'clock yesterday morning . With his arrival additional agents were dispatched to take up posts in adjoining rooms . No dictographs or other detection paraphernalia were employed at any stage of the investigation . This precaution , it was explained , was not neces-e sary sinc sects talked reel and at all " Imes andusp the agents'f werye always careful to have at least one corroborating witness around when the talk got interesting . One by one the men wanted drifted into the lobby of the hotel . By 3 o'clock all but one of the men named in the indictment had appeared at the hotel . When one of the agents commented on this man 's tardiness the telephone in the suite rang and the missing one reported that he had been delayed but was hurrying right over . At 4 o'clock , led by and P. G. Merrick , Divisional Chief Enforcement Agent , the arrests began . The men were not arrested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in pairs from the suite on their way out . According to agents the week 's payroll of $4.500 was handed over durin " the afternoon to Agent Roche . In automobiles that had been kept waiting outside the hotel , the prisoners were taken to the Federal Building and arraigned . Colonel Hayward and Mr. Mattuck appeared to present the complaint ' against the men . Foley was the last one arraigned . He , like the others , was outwardly unruffled . The men were all exceedingly well dressed and seemed to take their plight as a matter of course . Major Katz , Butler , Kuller and Seeber were the first to face Commissioner Boyle . Due to delays at the Federal Building , it was not until close to o'clock when the first of the prisoners heard the complaint against them . The complaint in the case of Major Katz and the three others was sworn to by Agent Roche . He charged that on May 1 , 1923 , and continuously up to yesterday , the prisoners conspired and confederated to violate the prohibition law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence Agent Grill " to omit and fail to report violations of the National Prohibition act in New York and New Jersey by the Paterson Brewing Company , Peter Breidt Brewing Company . Hygeia Brewing Company and Rising Sun Brewing Company . " Tells of Bribe Payments . Roche swore that Major Katz on Oct. 4 gave $8,000 to Grill as a bribe . He alleged that Butler gave Grill $2,000 on Oct. 3 , and that on Oct. 15 Grill was paid $2,000 by Kulier . On Oct. 13 , according to Roche 's complaint , Grill got $2,000 from Seeber . Foley was included in this complaint . Of him , Roche swore : " In furtherance of said conspiracy and to effect the object thereof , at the Southern District of New York and within the jurisdiction of this court , on or about Oct. 13 , 1923 , the defendants , Harry Foley , Edward Butler and George Seeber , did meet at the Hotel Pennsylvania against the peace of the United States and their dignity and contrary to the form of the statute of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Roche who also made the charge against Eifinfein , Zaeharoff and Greenfield , the last named a prohibition agent . According to Roche , the accused men offered $500 to Agent Grill to go to Chief Merrick and have the latter transfer Agent Crabbe from his post at the alcohol warehouse in West Street . Greenfield , then on duty in Jersey , was suggested as the man who should succeed Crabbe . Roche and Grill went to Chief Merrick and told him of the plan . Merrick at once agreed to transfer Crabbe and put Greenfield in his place . Merrick also detailed a man to watch Greenfield . The complaint also alleged that $3,500 was paid to Greenfield to influence him in his official duties so that alcohol could be illegally withdrawn from the warehouse at will . Grill swore that Greenfield approached him with the $500 so that Grill , who had a reputation as an " under cover man , " would not interfere . The charge against Goldman and Schwartzmann , disclosed on their arraignment , was an alleged bribe of $500 to Grill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed . Roche , in making this complaint , swore that the defendants had paid him $2,500 to enlist him in behalf of the same end . As quickly as the prisoners were arraigned they were escorted to the room of United States . Marshal William C. Hecht , where bail was arranged . Each of the defendants left without a word in response to newspaper men 's questions . Dennis Collins , President of the Peter Breidt Brewing Company , of which Butler is Vice President , said that he personally knew nothing of the matter . Collins is President of the People 's National Bank of Elizabeth and is City Controller . " This is all a surprise to me , " he said , " and I do n't know what to make of it . I did n't . even know that Butler was in New York City . I have not been active in the business for the last two years and Butler has been doing all the work . " Reporters who sought information about Mr. Seeber were referred to his Elizabeth attorney , Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the lawyer , " would stamp this story as absurd and ridiculous . " The political fortunes of Foley were linked closely with- those of Senator Edwards at one time . Foley was a lawyer in Jersey City when Edwards was practicing law . They became fast friends . Foley was active iii the campaign that resulted in Edwards 's election as Governor and became Secretary to the Governor . During the Governorship Foley continued in that capacity , but resigned when Mr. Edwards was elected to the Senate . Foley 's appointment as Superintendent of Weights and Measures for New Jersey followed soon after his resignation of the secretaryship . Major Katz 's family has lived in Paterson fur years . Bernard Katz , his father , was a close friend of Garnet A. Hobart , Vice President under . SEIZE 125 BARRELS OF BEER . Yellowley Agents Capture Trucks Trailed From Jersey . The first result of the breaking of the alleged agreement between accused New Jersey brewers and Prohibition agents came last night when agents on the staff of Chief E. C. Yellowley seized 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fiftieth Street . Two of the agents who had tricked the owners of the beer into believing they had purchased " protection , " were riding the trucks when the seizure was made . The trucks were trailed across the Forty-second Street ferry to the point of seizure where Prohibition Agents Morgenstein and Hanley halted them . " What have you in these trucks ? " " Beer , " chorused the drivers , who were then charged with transporting liquor . The prisoners were Herman Gass of 57 Mount Hope Avenue , the Bronx ; Thomas Smith 375 Cook Avenue , Paterson , N.
