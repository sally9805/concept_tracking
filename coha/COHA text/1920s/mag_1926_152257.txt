UPROOTED - Brand Whitlock - Appleton ( $2 ) . You see them wherever you go but especially in Paris and on the Riviera-the uprooted ones , the people without a country , This is not a realistic book about them , for it is full of happy endings , special cases . Yet you can imagine , or you know , what might have befallen a callow , spirited filly like Betty Marsh-whose taste of the wide World during the War made Macochee , Ohio , intolerable and took her back to run her chances among the big hotels , casinos , studios and half-soled , titled Romeos-if she had not finally fallen into the hands of a successful artist and a genuine British dowager . You know what end awaited Mrs. Katherine Mandeville Richardson , the U. S. diplomat 's relict , if she had not had the fabulous good fortune to hook the childish millionaire , Samuel Gummidge Bunker , after trickery at roulette had failed her . You even know that not all artists are so comparatively happy , chivalrous and well-heeled as Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Agnes Drayton . The chances are that Author Whitlock knows too , after eight years as U. S. Minister and Ambassador to Belgium ; knows so well that upon his return to novel-writing he finds it less painful , and though less truthful , more pleasing , to make a fiction of uprooted folk who either learned to flourish without soil or were replanted where they belonged . <P> Brand Whitlock would be a good man to write an Uprooted laid right in the U. S.-the uprooting of small-town folk and their transplanting , with various degrees of success , in big cities . He was born at Urbana , Ohio , 57 years ago , becoming a political correspondent on the old Chicago Record-Herald , and later an assistant to Illinois ' Secretary of State at Springfield , what time ( 1893-97 ) he tutored in law . Then he went to Ohio , passed its bar requirements and began practicing in Toledo . That town welcomed his vigor and independence , soon ( 1905 ) electing him mayor over four other candidates and re-electing him in three successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his literary work , began in 1902 . In 1912 , he added to his list of seven published stories and essays , The Fall Guy , an interpretation of U. S. life that was dramatized with large success only a couple of seasons ago . His ministry in Belgium began in 1913 and he was working on J. Hardin &; Son ( published 1923 ) when war broke out . Belgium ( 1919 ) is one of the finest , most understanding documents ever made by a stranger within any one 's gates .
