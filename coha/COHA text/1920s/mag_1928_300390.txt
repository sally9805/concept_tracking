At Harvard Law school are some 1,500 students . Of these some 375 will be given degrees . Of these some 30 or 32 by high academic achievement are on the board of the Harvard Law Review , of which only one is President . Revealing was a check made last week of the careers of the last 15 of these Presidents . <P> Although all students who graduate from Harvard Law School have fair measure of legal standing in the disillusioned eyes of practicing lawyers , it is the President of the Harvard Law Review at whom they cast glances not appraising but accepting , not supercilious but nearly reverential . Enviable is the position of the President of the Harvard Law Review ; he may practically choose what potent law firm he will serve after graduation . Similarly Presidents of law reviews and journals at other law schools achieve in varying degrees the quasi-Olympian privilege of being able to choose , instead of having to ask . <P> The last 15 Presidents of the Harvard Law Review and their positions are : 1914 , Boykin C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York ; 1915 , Robert P.
