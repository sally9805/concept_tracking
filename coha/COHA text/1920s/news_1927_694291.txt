txt A charge that the new De Witt Clinton High School , the city 's largest . public high school , now under construction , is marred by ? faulty foundation work has been made by Acting Mayor Joseph V. in a letter to Superintendent of Schools Dr. William J. O'Shea , it became ! known yesterday . Although wiitten several days ago , the letter was not disclosed by either Mr. or Dr. O'Shea for fear of alarming unnecessarily parents of children who are to attend the school on its completion , but the information leaked out . Meanwhile Dr. O'Shea had ordered a cessation of construction on that part of the building involved in Mr. 's attack , reported the matter to the Board of Education , and directed the Superintendent of school Buildings , William H. Gompert , architect in charge of all new cOnstruction , to inspeet ' the high school and make a detailed report . Yesterday afternoon the Board of Education went into executive session at the end of its regular meeting to discuss Mr. 's charges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberation the members decided to visit the school themselves to investigate . President George J. Ryan and Commissioners William J. Weber . Arthur S. Somers , Ralph R. and Christopher C. Mollenhauer , with the Superintendent of Schools , Dr. O'Shea , and District Superintendent John S. Roberts , all drove to the new  --  building on the Jerome Park Reservoir site in the Bronx . Objects to Bases of Columns . The ? particular .. oints criticized by Mr .. are the concrete ' bases1 of three steel columns in the northeast wing of the building. , The three columns stand in line . It is the centre one , known as No. 31 , with which Mr. found most fault . Acting Mayor charged in his letter that in several cases columns were ? placed eccentrically ? on the concrete bases , although the plans had specified that they were to he concentric . ? The letter read in part : . " In the . new De Witt Clinton High School the eccentric placing of columns on concrete piers was noticed in several cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on piers . This condition was especially bad in Column 31 , where the grillage overhung the ' concrete pier by two inches , thereby causing the figured load of 152 tons , which exists in this column , to be carried by a pier appro'ximately 86 per cent . of the area estimated and shown on the drawings . " I am informed that this is a dangerous situation which should not be allowed to ' continue . " The members of the Board of Education found that the - bases of the three steel columns in question had not been set squarely in the middle of the concrete piers , but somewhat to the side . In the case of column 31 there appeared to ' be a slight projection of the steel over one side of the concrete , pier . On the other side , however , the concrete foundation extended for a considerable ' width beyond the steel , this base having been made larger than the others because it ? had to- he extended deeper to reach bedrock . Board Sees.No Danger . While ' one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job might be criticized on the ground that it did not " appear workmanlike , ' they all agreed in the opinion that the construction was perfectly safe . " The building will last a million years , " said one of the commissioners . Work on this particular section of the building , however , will not be continued until after a thorough examination ? has been made by engineers . President Ryan ? said he thought the board would call in experts of reputation outside the school system to make an independent investigation . " No pains or expense will be spared , " said Mr. Ryan , " to make the building safe beyond a possibility of danger to the children whom it will house . " Both President Ryan and Dr. O'Shea were anxious to assure parents of children throughout the city that the board would not subject pupils to any danger . The school , which is to be the largest in the city , is to cost $3,000. - 1000 and to seat approximately 6,000 pupils . It is to be four stories high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the site will provide ample space for recreational purposes . As yet the steel construction work has not been completed . The attack by Mr. follows several others he has made against the Bureau of Construction of the Board of Education . They have been directed chiefly at William Gompert , who was made chief school architect and head of the Bureau during the HyIan Administration at a salary of $25,000.
