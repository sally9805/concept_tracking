It is history now , they say , that the Harvard crew last week took the lead at the start with powerful , lunging strokes ; that Yale was a length and a half behind before the three-mile ( three quart ers ) mark was reached . Then Yale began to row with all the human efficiency that Coach Edward O. Leader had taught . <P> Slowly , like an irresistible maritime creature , the Yale boat moved up almost on even terms with Harvard . Suddenly , No. 6 in the Yale boat " caught a crab " ( cut the water at the wrong angle , upsetting the rhythm of the crew ) . <P> The Yale boat floundered , paused , began a new and desperate rhythm-but Harvard was too far ahead and too powerful to be caught . Harvard won by three-quarters of a length-its first varsity crew victory over Yale since 1920 . That night , there was toasting of Coach Edward Brown , whose first year at Harvard was crowned with the fruits of the Thames .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
