txt There will be no compromise of the 5.5-3 ratio of capital ships , as Proposed In the American naval limitation plan for the United States , Great Britain , anti Japan . This was assured today , when Great Britain seconded the emphatic stand taken by the . United States , in the face of Japan 's plea for a greater allowance of capital ships , that the only way to stop the mad race for naval supremacy is . to stop building warships and to adhere to the existing relation of naval strength . Great Britain , following a confer . once between Secretary Hughes and Mr. Balfour , let it be known that she will support the Hughes proposal to retain the existing capital ship ratio of the three naval powers unreservedly . Kato Asks Modification . Mr. Hughes has conferred on the subject With Admiral Baron Kato of Japan , who asked that Japan be granted a little more than 60 per cent of battleship power . This conference is said to have cleared the atmosphere regarding the American program from a Japanese standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfactory agreement reached on reduction of naval armaments . There is a suggestion , however , that some concession may be made which might change the reduction plan with respect to capital ships without altering the ratio . Japan 's suggestion that she be allotted a little more than 60 per cent is said to be based primarily upon her desire to save the new dreadnaught Mutsu , now nearing completion. , Each May Keep One . If Japan Insists upon saving the Mutsu she may be permitted to keep the ship . But if Japan gets the Mutsu the United States will be permitted , under the revised plan , to keep the new Colorado , a 32,600 ton ship , with eight sixteen inch guns . England , under such an arrangement , would be accorded an additional capital ship , now scheduled for the scrap heap . Thus would the 5.5.3 ratio be maintained , but each or the powers would have a little More naval strength .                    @
