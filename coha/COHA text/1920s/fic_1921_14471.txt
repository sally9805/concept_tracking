TIME : The day before tomorrow . SCENE : A clear space under a railroad bridge . On either side , solid blocks of stone rising into the dimness , frame the picture . At their bases are a few scanty bushes , bleak and leafless . Within there is a suggestion of stonework that makes the walls . At the right side , against the stone , there are two railroad ties that make a sort of bench . The entire scene is played towards the front . The obscurity which completely hides the rear of the stage is lightened only by the fire . All the entrances are made from this darkness . The voices of Red and the Kid when outside are heard as from above . The play begins in the darkness of a rainy night in early spring . A moment after the curtain rises , a long , low whistle is heard from above . There is a pause . Then it is repeated and the voice of Red is heard speaking cautiously . RAMBLIN RED Yer there , kid ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no answerAi n't here yet . He is heard coming slowly down in the darkness . Presently there is a spurt of a match , and he lights a bit of a candle . In the dim light is discovered a slim boy 's figure lying prone on the railroad ties . He wears a pair of khaki trousers and an old black coat too large for him . A gray cap is pulled down over his eyes . Red , who is an older man , dressed roughly , with a battered hat pulled down on his reddish hair , stands at left rear a moment regarding himAsleep , dry and comfortable and asleep , and me cold as hell . Wot yer think of that ? Hey , Kid . The boy does not stirKid ! ! He shakes him roughly. p. 3 THE CONNECTICUT KID rising with a sudden startComin ' , sir . Recognizing Red and recollecting himself with a sort of sheepish little laugh , half relievedOh , you . I thought  --  I thought  --  I was  --  RAMBLIN RED Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I told yer . THE CONNECTICUT KID The train must have been late , Red . I had to wait . Gee , it was an awful long train , rumblin ' , rumblin ' over my head . Seemed like it never was going to get by . And then the track walker  --  Red sets candle on ground , far left , half front . RAMBLIN RED He did n't see yer , did he ? THE CONNECTICUT KID Sure he did n't see me . Was n't I glued to these here ties like I growed here ? I guess I know enough for that . RAMBLIN RED sarcasticallyYer are naturally bright , that 's all . Did he put the flash on yer ? THE CONNECTICUT KID Not a flash , just walked along . He was whistlin ' . It sounded good . RAMBLIN RED Ah , you and yer sound . Got the wood ? THE CONNECTICUT KID All I could , but it ai n't much . Everything so damn wet . He has taken some wood and brush and heaped them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation of the fire . The Kid lights it but it will not burn . Y'ai n't any paper on yer , have yer , Red ? p. 4 RAMBLIN RED Say , what kind of a side partner are yer , anyway ? First yer go to sleep and then yer ca n't get the fire goin ' . And me wet and cold as a dog . I was to get the grub , was n't I , and you was to have the fire ready , was n't yer ? Hell of a fire yer 've got . THE CONNECTICUT KID blowing on a few of the fast vanishing sparksCa n't make it burn . RAMBLIN RED Next time I wo n't join up with no more kids . I might ha ' been in Springfield by now , but this draggin ' along and restin '  --  THE CONNECTICUT KID You was awful good when my foot got sore and I do n't know what I 'd a ' done tryin ' to make Springfield alone . Five days ! That 's a long hike when yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hate to be by myself now . RAMBLIN RED Oh , quit the talk and get that fire goin ' . Yer 've got some paper yourself . THE CONNECTICUT KID You mean  --  the letter ? RAMBLIN RED Sure I mean the letter . Yer 've been readin ' it enough times to know it by heart . Oh , I 've see yer when yer thought I was n't lookin ' . Come on , Connecticut , I 'm cold . THE CONNECTICUT KID Well , Red , yer see that letter  --  RAMBLIN RED Oh , your lady friend 'll write yer another . p. 5 THE CONNECTICUT KID It ai n't a lady friend . He draws from an inside pocket a letter . He takes something from inside the envelope quickly and puts it back in his pocket againWell , I guess yer right . I do n't need it now ,  --  It ai n't as if I was all by myself , and besides  --  He crumples it up and places it under the wood , lighting itBesides , I do know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's yer fire . RAMBLIN RED looking at the Kid with meaningAn ' yer did n't have to use it all either . THE CONNECTICUT KID uneasilyYes , I did , all but  --  RAMBLIN RED All but the money . I seen it , and yer ca n't deny yer 've got it . God , yer a peach . Money in his pocket all the time and him never letting on ! Lettin ' me beat it for a hand-out and him takin ' his share . Lettin ' me be hungry and him with his money and enough to buy plenty for us both . When that soft old guy at the mission give me the two bits , oh , you did n't mind comin ' in on it like a good pal . Pal ! I wish't to hell I 'd never joined up with a tight like you . THE CONNECTICUT KID Listen , Red . I meant to tell yer an I thought maybe y 'd guessed anyway when I told yer I was going back east from Springfield . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yer see , just before my time was up in  --  in that place there , I wrote home and my mother sent me this to come on as quick as I could . She did n't have very much , but it was enough  --  from Springfield . I know I did n't tell yer , but yer see it was n't as if it was mine exactly . Yer see how it is , do n't you , Red . p. 6 RAMBLIN RED Sure I see . With a hard laughThe little jail bird 's goin ' back to his nest . I suppose yer countin ' on a brass band at the station and Welcome Home wavin ' over Main Street between the drug store and the Post Office . That 's what yer always count on  --  the first time . THE CONNECTICUT KID I ai n't countin ' on nothin ' . Only gettin ' there , and bein ' with folks that do n't believe I done it . RAMBLIN RED She do n't believe yer done it ? THE CONNECTICUT KID She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote in the letter and why she sent the money , so 's I could come back . RAMBLIN RED It 's all right about her , maybe , but how about the others ? The boss at the factory , where you go to get your job : the man that owns the grocer 's store when he asks you where you was working last ; as if he did n't know ! Think he is going to trust his team to a man that 's done time ? And how about the others that yer used to know ? Think they 're goin ' to want to know yer any more ? I guess me and the Connecticut Kid 'll meet on the road again . THE CONNECTICUT KID I ai n't never thought of that . I ai n't never thought of nothing but just getting back . But I 'll show ' em . I 'll show ' em and I 'll show ' em now . p. 7 RAMBLIN RED For God 's sake what yer ' goin to do ? THE CONNECTICUT KID risingI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first train back east . I 've been too long already . RAMBLIN RED Sit down ! Ah , sit down , kid . Be reasonable . It is foolish to go now . It 's forty miles if it 's a step and yer 've been on the road all day . We 'll start early . There 's plenty of time and plenty of trains , and with money  --  why , it 's a cinch . THE CONNECTICUT KID I want to go now . I 'll show ' em . RAMBLIN RED But yer ai n't forgot there was a favor yer was goin ' to do for me in Springfield , have yer ? Yer ai n't goin ' back on a partner like that . THE CONNECTICUT KID I suppose I might as well wait till the morning . And what 's this yer want me to do for yer in Springfield ? Y 've been awful good to me , Red , and I ca n't forget it . Lettin ' me come along with yer and helpin ' me out like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me when I was sittin ' there ' long side the track  --  a little laughI was scared I guess . Kind o ' funny in my head . Thinkin ' there was somebody behind every bush waitin ' to bring me back to the pen again . I used to run hard as I could , just away from nothing , till I hurt my foot . I know I ought to have told you about the money , but I did n't know how . It seems like boastin ' , but when I get back home  --  p. 8 RAMBLIN RED That 'll be all right , when yer get back home . But here 's somethin ' would please me better'n a post card with " Greetings from Circleville " printed on it . THE CONNECTICUT KID What is it you want me to do , Red ? I ca n't touch the money , but  --  RAMBLIN RED What 'd I want with your money . This is something different . It 's this way . I got a friend waitin ' for me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me 's framed up a little job there on an old guy that 's got more than 's good for him . There 's a reason why me and my friend ca n't do much goin ' round in Springfield . A pretty good reason . What we want 's a nice young feller , a feller looks like he 's just out of a hospital , to make a few inquiries for us . THE CONNECTICUT KID I ca n't do it , Red . Honest , I ca n't do it . I ca n't run no risk of the pen again , and besides  --  I want to go straight . RAMBLIN RED Pen , nothin ' ! There ai n't a Chinaman 's chance of it . And there ai n't nothin ' wrong takin ' somethin ' from somebody that stole in the first place , is there ? But you wo n't have nothin ' to do with that part of it . Why , you 'll be sittin ' on velvet and half way to Circleville before , anything happens . Yer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like it . It do n't sound straight . p. 9 RAMBLIN RED Who are you to be askin ' if it 's straight or not . That comes good from a man just out of the pen . THE CONNECTICUT KID But that did n't make me a crook . I tell you , I did n't do it . RAMBLIN RED Just what I said the first time and the second time , too . But the Judge always seen it different . Can the bluff , Kid . THE CONNECTICUT KID It ai n't a bluff . It 's true . RAMBLIN RED in mock amazementSay , yer too good for this life . What brought you here , anyway ? THE CONNECTICUT KID Oh , I got laid off and I heard about the harvest job , so I came out . Afterwards I got sick and all my money went . Then ,  --  the trouble came . But I did n't do it , Red . I swear  --  RAMBLIN RED quicklyAll right , all right . But yer 'll help a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yer just the one that can . I knew it the first minute I see you . Y 'll do it ? For a pal ? THE CONNECTICUT KID If yer sure I can do it straight and there ai n't no risk ? RAMBLIN RED Sure . Not a risk . Do you think the Ramblin ' Red 's takin ' any risks  --  again ? Not a chance , Kid , not a chance . p. 10 THE CONNECTICUT KID Well  --  if you 're sure . ShylyYer 've been pretty good to me , Red . RAMBLIN RED Oh , cut it out . I want to eat . Find any grub ? Spider said he 'd leave some here , but he always was a liar . THE CONNECTICUT KID There was some tea in a can in the place yer said and a chunk of bread . Did n't they give you anything at the house you went to last ? RAMBLIN RED with a short laughThe lady said she was a Ohristian and did n't believe in tramps . " Excuse me , lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name . Not a tramp  --  a migratory worker . " Well , us for the bread and tea . THE CONNECTICUT KID I 'll go to the spring and get the water . Its your turn to take it easy by the fire . He goes out with the can . The fire has begun gun to sink and Red moves about finding bits of brush and wood . He brings them to the fire and the flames leap up again . In the sudden light Red looks in the direction of the place where the Kid has been sitting and sees something that attracts his attention He makes a sudden movement and picks up a roll of bills from the ground . RAMBLIN RED Christ ! The Kid 's wad ! He bends down near the fire counting itA five , another five , ten and and a ten . Thirty dollars . Well ! He smilesEasy money . Just picking it up . Sits down with a sigh of satisfactionI guess you ai n't goin ' to be none too good for that Springfield job , Kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid 's letter . He takes it up and slowly deciphers the writing on it . " No difference what you  --  " " waiting  --  you come back . " " Welcome " He throws the fragment into the fire again with an exclamation , half of contempt . I guess they wo n't hang that " Welcome Home " banner across Main Street just yet a while . He takes the money from his pocket and counts again , and then looks into the fire smiling with anticipation . The Kid is heard whistling a gay tune outside . Red puts the money hastily away . The whistling sounds nearer and in a moment the Kid enters p. 11 RAMBLIN RED That 's right . Tell ' em all we 're here . Ask ' em in to supper and spend the evenin ' . What yer makin ' all that noise for ? THE CONNECTICUT KID Oh , there 's nobody ' round , Red . Not a light , not even a star . It took some lookin ' to find that spring . RAMBLIN RED It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fire wo n't stay forever . THE CONNECTICUT KID Gee , you 've got it hot enough here . Too hot for a coat Unbuttons his coat . Before he slips it off he puts his hand into the inside pocket . He gives a cryIt ai n't there ! He looks at Red dazed . RAMBLIN RED What ai n't there ? THE CONNECTICUT KID My money ! My money ! It 's gone ! I had it here showing it to you , just before I went out . He goes to place where he had been sitting and begins to search wildly . No , no . It ai n't here . He rises and faces Red . Red , you got it . Give it back to me . Give it back to me or I 'll  --  I 'll kill yer ! His hands are working . RAMBLIN RED What yer talking about ? How 'd I get it ? Why , I ai n't been near yer . Besides , what 'd I want with yer lousy money ? p. 12 THE CONNECTICUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to fool me . Give it back to me , Red . Give it back . I just ca n't stand thinking I 've lost it . RAMBLIN RED I ai n't got it , I tell yer . Why , yer know I ai n't been near yer since yer showed it to me . THE CONNECTICUT KID slowly . Yer  --  ai n't  --  got  --  it ? RAMBLIN RED So help me , I ai n't , Kid . THE CONNECTICUT KID raising his clenched hands in a sudden tense gesture of despairOh , God , it 's lost . The money that was going to bring me home ; it 's lost . RAMBLIN RED How 'd yer know it 's lost when you ai n't half looked for it , standing there like a movie actor . Why do n't yer go hunt for it ? THE CONNECTICUT KID Where 'm I goin ' to find it ? RAMBLIN RED Well , it ai n't here . Look for it outside . Yer went to the spring , did n't yer ? THE CONNECTICUT KID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was leaning over , or along the track . I 'll take the candle and look for it every inch of the way . Takes candle from left of Red and disappears. p. 13 RAMBLIN RED Take plenty of time , Kid . Look careful . He replenishes the fire and it blazes up again . He crouches beside it . He 'll forget all about it . He yawns and relaxes in sleep . The Other One enters slowly into the circle of light . He is a man of early middle age , bearded , and rather pale . He is dressed in the rough dress of a working man . There is a soft black hat on his thick hair . He comes to the firelight noiselessly from behind Red and stands so that his shadow is suddenly thrown upon the wall opposite . Then he remains motionless . There is a pause . Red drowses , unconscious of his presence . A slight sound from the fire rouses Red , who looks up and sees the shadow . RAMBLIN RED Found it , Kid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , it ai n't . Who  --  who  --  are you ? THE OTHER ONE Oh , just a man on the road like yourself . He speaks very slowly and quietly . RAMBLIN RED settling back relievedWell , as long as you ai n't the track walker or a bull , it 's all right . What yer want ? THE OTHER ONE Nothing but what you can give me . I 'm cold . p. 14 RAMBLIN RED Guess the fire 's free , stranger . Sit down . He indicates the Kid 's place . The Other One comes to it and sits . THE OTHER ONE I 'm glad to rest . I 've come a long way . RAMBLIN RED Silver Mine , maybe ? THE OTHER ONE Yes , and beyond that , a long way beyond and I 've got a long way to go too . RAMBLIN RED Where are you bound for now ? THE OTHER ONE Springfield . RAMBLIN RED Springfield ? That 's funny  --  so 'm I. THE OTHER ONE giving him a long lookSuppose we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , what 's the game ? You comin ' in here tonight and lookin ' at me like that . Who are you , anyway ? THE OTHER ONE I told you . Just a man on the road , like yourself . RAMBLIN RED impatientlyOh , I know all that , but it ai n't enough . What 's yer job  --  yer business ? THE OTHER ONE I can do many things ; but I was a builder mostly . p. 15 RAMBLIN RED Was ? Lost yer job , eh . And goin ' to Springfield fer another ? THE OTHER ONE Yes , I 've got a job waiting for me in Springfield . Like you . RAMBLIN RED laughingI guess it ai n't the same as mine , stranger . Mine 's  --  special . THE OTHER ONE It 's a good thing to have a job when you can do it well . RAMBLIN RED You bet your life I 'll do mine well . In my business you 've got to do it well or you wo n't get another chance  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same everywhere . There 's only one chance for everything . It comes and it goes again . It never comes back . RAMBLIN RED You 're right , bo ! My motto , too . Take it when yer find it , I sez . THE OTHER ONE That 's right . PauseAnd give it , too . Only one chance for that . RAMBLIN RED doubtfullyWell , I ai n't one of these here philanthropists . THE OTHER ONE with a little smileLooks like you were to me tonight . RAMBLIN RED John D. and the Rambling Red ! Sounds good . No stranger , guess again . I ai n't givin ' nothin ' away an ' nobody gave nothin ' to me. p. 16 THE OTHER ONE searchinglyHave n't they . You 're sure ? RAMBLIN RED defiantlyWhat 'd they give me ? Hell of a lot . Kicked me out and then shut the door when I tried to get in again . Shut it and locked it both sides . THE OTHER ONE In the same tone in which he first questionedIs that all ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sorry for me , maybe . THE OTHER ONE still slowly and looking straight at RedYou give a great deal when you 're sorry for some one . You have to . Sometimes  --  everything . RAMBLIN RED suspiciouslySay , what you puttin ' over on me , a sermon ? And what did yer come in here for anyway ? It looks queer . THE OTHER ONE You called me , Red looks quickly updid n't you ? RAMBLIN RED Nobody called yer . Who would ? You must have heard the Kid I guess , hollerin ' outside . THE OTHER ONE Is he in trouble too ? Your friend ? RAMBLIN RED Sure . Six months . In the Pen . p. 17 THE OTHER ONE And the door is open now unless Red gives a quick glance at the Other One , unless somebody shuts it . Is that it ? RAMBLIN RED surlilyI ai n't got nothin ' to do with him . Just happened to meet up with him on the road . THE OTHER ONE " Just happened ! " What a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance all right . THE OTHER ONE Where is your friend ? RAMBLIN RED The Kid ? Oh , he 's looking outside there for something he thinks he 's lost . THE OTHER ONE Is he going to find it ? RAMBLIN RED How do I know ? THE OTHER ONE He will if he looks long enough . RAMBLIN RED Seek and find laughs . Sounds like a Sunday School text but it ai n't true . THE OTHER ONE No , not yet , but it will be . It always happens for everyone if he looks long enough . It was a long time before I found my chance for  --  my Springfield job . RAMBLIN RED slowlyI guess everybody 's lookin ' for somethin ' . p. 18 THE OTHER ONE Yes , everybody . For the same thing too . RAMBLIN RED The same thing ! Me and the Kid and the soap-box preachers , and you ? THE OTHER ONE The very same thing  --  softeronly they do n't know it . RAMBLIN RED Say , you 're so wise , what 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they think it is . The fire has burned down and the place has grown almost dark . RAMBLIN RED with a little startIt makes me feel queer the way you talk . And the fire 's down and the dry wood 's all gone too . What did I let the Kid take my candle for ? THE OTHER ONE Never mind yours . I have another . We 'll light mine . He takes a large wax candle from his pocket and lights it at the dying fire . RAMBLIN RED It sure gives more light than mine did . Goes over to get candle . They meet at centre , back of fire . Red puts candle down on ground , left half frontI 'm obliged to you , stranger . Giving the Other One a puzzled lookAi n't there something you want from me ? p. 19 THE OTHER ONE Yes . I am hungry , very hungry . RAMBLIN RED I 've only got some dry bread , but you 're welcome . He gives the other a bit of bread which is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices his hands . God ! look at yer hands . Who did that to you ? THE OTHER ONE hastily drawing them backA friend . RAMBLIN RED He must have been a bad up . What did he do it for ? THE OTHER ONE Money . RAMBLIN RED He must have wanted it awful bad , and it must have been a lot . THE OTHER ONE shaking his head a littleIt was only thirty  --  dollars ! RAMBLIN RED incredulousHe give you those for thirty dollars ! THE OTHER ONE He did not know how much they would cost . RAMBLIN RED And yer say a friend did that ? THE OTHER ONE Who else could leave scars like those ? RAMBLIN RED viciouslyI hope yer punished him good and plenty . p. 20 THE OTHER ONE nodding his head with a little smileYes , I punished him . RAMBLIN RED one step forward with interestHow ? I 'd like to know what 'd yer do to pay him back for those ? THE OTHER ONE Oh , I forgave him . RAMBLIN RED in blank amazementWhat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make it out . Yer punished him by forgivin ' him . Why , nobody does that . THE OTHER ONE Yes , that 's why they go on doing the same old things  --  just because nobody does . RAMBLIN RED puzzled , scratching his headIt 'd be a queer way of doing it . Little laughAnd it would put a lot of folks out of their jobs . SlowlyI wonder  --  if  --  it  --  would  --  work . THE OTHER ONE Does the other way work ? RAMBLIN RED You mean  --  me ? THE OTHER ONE You , when the door was locked and you could n't get back . RAMBLIN RED sullenlyI never had no chance to try your way . p. 21 THE OTHER ONE with a touch of cagerness in his voiceBut suppose  --  just suppose it had been given you . RAMBLIN RED Aw , what 's the good of talking ' ? They do n't give no chances where I come from , and they do n't take none , either . But yer ai n't eatin ' , stranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread they have in their hands to eat . As they do so , Red glances at The Other One , whose face is in the firelight , and gives a sudden exclamation of surprise and awe . Why  --  why  --  it 's  --  He laughs a little sheepishly recovering himself . Funny ! It seemed  --  just then  --  like I 'd seen you before . THE OTHER ONE Maybe you have . We 're both on the same road . RAMBLIN RED still looking at him as if not hearing himIt was a long  --  long  --  time ago . With a change of voice . Pshaw ! It could n't be that  --  yet what 's your name , stranger , if you do n't mind telling me ? THE OTHER ONE smilingOh , I have many names . RAMBLIN RED quickly I know  --  same here , but I 'd like to think about you with a name . p. 22 THE OTHER ONE Why not , then , call me  --  " The Other One . " RAMBLIN RED " The Other One ? " Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you and the Kid and the Other One . RAMBLIN RED Say , what 's the Kid got to do with it ? THE OTHER ONE He has everything to do with it . RAMBLIN RED He ai n't nothing to me , I tell yer . I ai n't nothing to him  --  just  --  THE OTHER ONE leaning far forward , looking at him straight . Thirty dollars ? RAMBLIN RED Thirty dollars ! The Other nods and sits back , relaxed . Just the same as  --  Points to hands of the Other One . Oh , I give it up . Yawns  --  slumps down . . I guess I 'm getting dippy with sleep . These all-day hikes gets yer tired . More and more drowsily . I guess  --  I 'll  --  just  --  shut  --  my  --  eyes a minute  --  just a minute . He lies down facing fire and is quickly asleep . The Other One leans farther and farther forward , watching Red as he slumps to the ground . After a moment The Other One sits back , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Red with a long comprehending look which has a touch of triumph in it . Then he walks backward and disappears into the shadow of the rear of the stage as noiselessly as he came . There is a pause and the Kid comes in . He stumbles a little , and comes slowly and dejectedly to his old place . He pays no attention to Red , but leans forward for a moment looking into the embers of the fire , and then as if sure of his being unobserved , lets his head sink upon his arms , folded with clenched hands across his knees . There is a slight convulsive movement and then he is quiet again . Red stirs , and raising himself on an elbow , looks across at him. p. 23 RAMBLIN RED quizzicallyAsleep , Kid ? THE CONNECTICUT KID hardly moving , and speaking in a muffled , husky voiceNo . RAMBLIN RED In the same half-bantering toneGuess you did n't find it . THE CONNECTICUT KID You know I did n't find it . RAMBLIN RED Maybe you did n't look long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KID Raising his head angrily I did look for it , every step of the way there and back , but it 's lost for good . RAMBLIN RED still banteringlySure you did n't find it there , Kid , ' cause  --  it was here . He pulls from pocket and tosses the money across to him . Take your thirty dollars . THE CONNECTICUT KID seizing the money and counting it . Why it is my money ! RisesRed ! Red ! where did you find it ? Tomorrow I start to go back . RAMBLIN RED snarlingYou 'll start tonight  --  now . THE CONNECTICUT KID Why , ai n't you comin ' , too ? p. 24 RAMBLIN RED In the same tone I am not ! He lies down again , feigning sleep . THE CONNECTICUT KID But the Springfield job you wanted me for ? How about it ? RAMBLIN RED raising himself on one elbowThe Springfield job 's off , see ? Think I 'm goin ' to trust to a dope who ca n't hold onto his own wad ? THE CONNECTICUT KID uncertainlyI 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like leavin ' you this way . RAMBLIN RED Oh , you get the hell out of here . I 'm sick of youse kids . He lies down again . The Kid looks at him a moment hesitatingly but seeing no movement , he throws back his head as if catching a deep breath . of relief , and goes , leaving Red huddled , apparently asleep by the fire . When the Kid has really gone , Red rises suddenly on his elbow and looks to make sure . He turns , sitting on his haunches , and smiles a mocking smile , nodding deprecatingly . Me ! The Ramblin ' Red ! Well , what do you think of that ? He gives up the question as apparently impossible to answer , and reaching for The Other One 's candle beside him , makes as though to blow it out , when he hesitates . Then he puts it down carefully , still lighted , and lies down again , facing the candle , and in a moment his deep breathing proclaims he has fallen asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stranger 's candle , which burns steadily beside his huddled , unconscious figure.
