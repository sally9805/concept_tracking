txt The house ' of lords passed tonight the remaining stages of the judicial proceedings bill . which forbids newspapers from publishing the details of divorce cases . Tho bill as passed by the house of commons on Saturday last provides that the proprietor , editor , master printer , or publisher of any offending paper will be liable to four months ' imprisonment and a fine of $2,500 . The lords inserted an amendment to safeguard the printer of legal pleadings ; therefore the bill must go back to the commons , but it will be passed and receive royal assent tomorrow . Lord Burnham attacked the bill , saying divorce cases would be fully reported in America and the colonies , and the newspapers of these countries would have a new circulation in England . The bill will not affect the importation of foreign papers carrying details of foreign divorces unless they are indecent .
