Typographically uninteresting , written in the stiff , undeviating style of all worthy financial announcements , an advertisement , which measured 8 inches long , three columns wide , made known last week without obvious effort to do so , that John Davison Rockefeller III had made his debut on a directorate . Said the notice , printed in Manhattan dailies : " To serve adequately the banking needs of the Harlem section of New York City , the Dunbar National Bank of New York . . , will open for business September 17 , 1928 . ' ' It said the bank was " established particularly to serve the business and personal banking interests of Harlem , John D. Rockefeller III . Ignorant of one of the pet Rockefeller philanthropies , a superficial observer might wonder why a Rockefeller , a Herbert Lee Pratt ( Standard Oil ) , a Henry Elliott Cooper ( Equitable Trust Co. ) . should be interested in a comparatively puny bank whose capital was announced as $500,000 , whose declared purpose was to serve Harlem 's Negroes . <P> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunbar National Bank for his son 's first financial activity. * The Paul Laurence Dunbar Apartments , named for the Negro poet ( 1872-1906 ) , and built by Rockefeller money , will house the bank . <P> The significance of Rockefeller Jr . ' s choice of the Dunbar National Bank is in the long list of gifts which he has made toward the betterment of Negroes . Tuskegee , Hampton and Fiske have been given many a million ; the Spelman Seminary , Negro girls ' school in Atlanta , Ga. , another beneficiary , gives a leading clue to Rockefeller Jr . ' s largess . Rockefeller Jr . ' s maternal grandmother was an eager opponent of slavery , helped form a link in the underground railway which slipped escaping slaves to freedom . Rockefeller Jr . ' s mother was Laura C. Spelman ; in honor of the Spelman family the Atlanta school was founded . <P> President of the Dunbar National Bank is Joseph D. Higgins , 36 years a banker , onetime ( 1914-23 ) Federal Reservist , former vice president of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directorate . He is Harvard-graduated Roscoe Conkling Bruce , son of the late Roscoe Conkling Bruce , onetime U. S. Senator from Louisiana . <P> * Rockefeller III . a Princeton senior , spent the summer in Geneva working as a $40-a-vveek assistant in the information bureau of the League of Nations .
