The Agent General of Reparations , Seymour Parker Gilbert , stopped fashionably in Rome last week at the Hotel Excelsior . One morning there called for him a twinkling limousine in which sat a scrubby bearded Roman of alert , engaging mien . Soon Agent Gilbert stepped into the limousine and sped away for a day of motoring and converse with Finance Minister Count Giuseppe Volpi , famed co-negotiator with Secretary Mellon of the Italo-U . S. debt settlement ( TIME , Nov. 23 , 1925 ) . <P> Later , the scrubby bearded Count formally presented Mr. Gilbert to Signor Mussolini . There was much talk-about what ? <P> Agent Gilbert avoided denying to newsgatherers that he came to sound out Italians upon possible future modification of the Dawes Plan . He is known to favor assigning to Germany a definite total reparations debt in place of her present sliding commitments to the Allies . Moreover Agent Gilbert is thought to lean toward the scheme for raising money to fund most of the German indebtedness in cash , by placing on the market huge blocs of German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> What Agent Gilbert did definitely say , last week , , was that any contemplated revision of the Dawes Plan is still " in the phase of study , " and that " no extraordinary or decisive results " are to be expected from his present visit to Rome . He went on to reaffirm his oft repeated statement that the revision of German liabilities at a definite and presumably somewhat reduced figure would not necessarily involve a similar readjustment of Allied indebtedness to the U. S. Said Agent Gilbert , in the manner of President Coolidge : " The reparation question is an entirely independent problem concerning only European nations and has no relation to the debts of the various countries to the United States . " <P> To enliven the cautious conversations at Rome , last week , came a fire eating , swashbuckling editorial from L'Impero , an arch-Fascist news organ which performs the sometimes useful function of a watch-puppy which can bark but not bite . Barked L'Impero : <P> " At the end of 1918 Italy should have marched on Vienna , and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered populations should have been forced to sacrifice their production for a century , if necessary , in order to indemnify the victors . This is what Germany did in 1870 , and she was quite right . The Allies , instead , allowed America to betray them in 1918 , and they were quite wrong . <P> " Instead of the disastrous economic crisis which now crushes the whole of Europe we should have economic crushing only of the conquered peoples . This is what historical justice required . It would be just to give up German reparations only if such a step were made dependent on America and England letting France and Italy off the sums owed them . " <P> In telling contrast to these blatancies , came news that Signor Mussolini was unusually active last week in participating in a series of quiet conferences with visiting foreign statesmen , which began when he received Turkish Foreign Minister Tewfik Rushdi Bey in Milan ( TIME , April 16 ) . Further august visitors received last week were Prime Minister Count Bethlen of Hungary , Foreign Minister August Zaleski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and German Finance Minister Dr. Heinrich Koehler.
