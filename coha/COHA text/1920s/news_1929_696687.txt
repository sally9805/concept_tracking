txt MEYERLING TRAGEDY UNSOLVED Scene of the Supposed Murder-Suicide Now a Nunnery To the Edger of The NSW York Times : The Meyerling tragedy is still a most fascinating mystery . Upon my recent trip to Vienna , I visited the hunting lodge , now the Carmelite nunnery , where the room in which Crown Prince Rudolph died is preserved as a chapel , an altar on the spot where the bed formerly stood . The monastery of Heiligenkrenz was also visited , and the little cemetery near by where the girl , " whose only crime was love , was buried like a dog . " Her mother has had the spot . cover6d with a large stone slab surmounted by a handsome cross with this inscription : " Mary Frelin v. Vetsera , geb . 19 MEirz 1871 , gesi : 30 Januar 1889 . ' He cimes forth like a flower and is cut down . ' Job 2 : 14 v. " Had the affair been a suicide pact , Mary 's body could have been given to her family for decent burial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . When such great secrecy prevails there must be some very strong reason why truth may not be told . Countess Larrish in her book , " My Past , " tells us that Rudolph was on the verge of insanity from drink and drugs ; that a drunken orgy was held in the lodge that night , that the doctor who examined Mary 's body told her the girl had been shot in the face and back . Louise of Tuscany , in her book , " My Own Story , " says that a gardener formerly employed . at Meyerling told her he entered the lodge the morning after the tragedy to find the room in wild confusion , the tables and chairs being overturned , while on the floor , under the cover , of the billiard table , lay the nude body of a woman bleeding from revolver wounds . Louise 's father , who saw the body of the prince , said that broken glass protruded from the crushed skull and that three fingers of the right hand had been cut off . Rudolph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cobourg arrived , the drunken orgy was on , and Mary was dragged into it . She pleaded for " theprince 's protection , perhaps in liver terror crying out that even death was preferable . Rudolph , intoxicated , infuriated at tl - situation , his reason tottering , suddenly went clean off and shot the girl in the face as she clung to him and again in the back as her body fell . Then he turned on her tormentors , who , calling to the valet and game-keeper for assistance , sought to disarm the madman . Rudolph fought with all the strength of the insane . Losing his revolver , he drew his hunting knife , and in wresting this weapon from him , three fingers of the right hand were severed . To get the mad prince under control , Count Hoyos dealt him a fatal blow over the head with a bottle of wine . The royal family was in a panic . They called the tragedy " a hunting accidet , ' ? " a suicide , " " tell the public anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cost the prince 's crime must be concealed . Mary 's two uncles were ordered to take her body , fully dressed , at night , in a cab to Helligenkrenz , and to support the corpse between them in such away as to make it appear that the baroness still lived . At the monastery I heard how the body was marched into room number eight of the public house , where a carpenter had prepared a rough box . At 2 A. M. the monks , carrying the coffin on their shoulders , proceeded up the road to the cemetery , where a burial was hastily made and a few prayers said . " She was royalty , so they never spoke of it . " The Vetsera family was told to leave Austria at once and Mary 's death was then reported from Venice . Franz Josef dared not let the Austrians know the real story lest they turn against him . To prosecute the guilty persons or even to accept Count Hoyos 's offer to take upon himself the murder of the prince and go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reason for every crime is a woman . They were certainly right in this case . The four men who were at the lodge , intensely loyal to king and country , evidently took an oath never to tell the facts , so the secret has been kW .
