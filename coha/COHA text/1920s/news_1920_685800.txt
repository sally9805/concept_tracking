txt The proposal of Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western Railroad to capitalize its surplus and distribute a stock dividend is clo , ely connected with the provision in the Transportation Act which recommends larger combinations of railroads where the interest of the public can he served . The Interstate Commerce Commission will " as soon as practicable prepare and adopt a plan for the consolidation of the railway properties of the continental United States into a limited number of systems ? ' ( Sec. 407 of Transportation Act . ) The commission has not revealed when it intends to address itself actively to this problem . The first rearrangement may not be announced for many months . The exercise of this power is sufficiently imminent , however , to cause much speculation among railroad men . It is probable that the majority of railroad officials favor some sort of combination of their own choosing to one which may he recommended to them by the commission , despite their undoubted belief that the commission intends to use its new powers in the most constructive way . Even though most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their cry number indicates that the subject of larger railroad combination is receiving wide consideration . The Lackawanna has formed at least the main outlines of a plan for such an extension of its system . Its /maid of managers . forseeing that the time may come when the Lackawanna will he urged into combination with some other system to its disadvantage , have decided to fortify the road The Lackawanna management probably argues that its wealth and ability to operate a larger railroad property entitle the road to more consideration than it might receive from the commission , if the commission should choose to be guided chiefly by mileage . The first step in the Lackawanna 's plan is begun and requires only the consent of the commission for its completion . It is in reality the first of sivcral steps  --  capitalization of its surplus and segregation of its coal properties . The next step will be the disposal of the segregated coal properties , presumably by distributing stock of a new coal company , by offering the stock to railroad shareholders at an attractive price , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The virtual reorganization of the company will then be completed , the peculiar technical prevention of its acceptance of the Pennsylvania Constitution will be removed , and it will be ready to expand . How Lackawanna will choose to effect this expansion is by no means apparent . With an increase in capital stock , an exchange of securities with some other road would he possible , but the evident intention of the company is to distribute all of the additional stock to present shareholders . If the company chooses to sell its coal lands , additional railroad property can he purchased with the proceeds of the sale . Another way would be the purchase of additional railway property by an issue of bonds . The Lackawanna 's freedom from funded indebtedness makes it exceptionally able to extend its system in this way . Officials of the Lackawanna believe , however , that , so far as the intent of complying with the recommendations of the Transportation Act is concerned , the purpose of expansion could be fulfilled by leasing additional lines rather than by actual purchase . The greater part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . Lackawanna has been spoken of frequently in connection with the Eric and the New York , Chicago S. St. Louis , commonly known as the Nickel Plate . It is plainly unlikely that Lackawanna would voluntarily bring upon itself such a burden of debt as that under which Eric labors , despite the recent improvement in Erie 's prospects . As for the Nickel Plate , the Lackawanna management is not believed to favor extension of its lines west of Buffalo . Both Lackawanna and Lehigh Valley receive n large amount of freight from six lines entering Buffalo from the West . If either of these roads should extend westward from Buffalo and become competitors of these lines , it seems highly probable that the amount of freight routed to them from these western lines would he considerably diminished . Negotiations between Lackawanna and another road for a consolidation are now pending . It has been suggested that this road may be the New York , Susquehanna &; Western , controlled by Erie . but no such intimation has been forthcoming from Lackawanna officials . It is believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of its expansion within the next month .
