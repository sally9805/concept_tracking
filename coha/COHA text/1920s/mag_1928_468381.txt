IWISH I knew , " writes a forty-six year-old woman journalist in reply to a question as to her reasons for not marrying . " If there could be such a thing , I should say I was ' marked ' for spinsterhood . I think marriage is always best where possible , but , although eight fine men have proposed , not one of them appealed . " One of a family of twelve children , brought up by a mother " who taught us to face things and conquer them , " this woman is now teaching a motherless thirteen-year-old nephew " the things he should have learned years ago . " " He cries and resents it , but I tell him it is like winds and waves , grain growing , ocean currents , radio ? just life 's interesting fact . " A sane woman from her paper and , reading it , one also wonders why . From the time , more than sixty years ago , when college doors were thrown open to women , the opinion has been rather widely prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimonial chances . Answers from a relatively large group of unmarried college women may tell us what part , if any , in their own failure to marry they believe was played by their academic training . Geneticists are pointing out the danger to the race if inferior stocks go on reproducing their kind in increasing proportions while the birthrate of the better stocks is declining . The various schools of eugenics may not yet know , and certainly do not yet agree , as to the how and what of the transmission by human beings to their offspring of various characteristics , physical and mental . But the layman going to agricultural fairs andflower shows does not need to be convinced that there is something in heredity , and that it is a good thing to pass on goodness and beauty . Heredity must be at least as important to humans as it is to plants and animals . On the other hand , psychiatrists and students of child behavior are stressing increasingly the importance of environment , particularly to the young child . His whole future life , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell us , on the surroundings of the first few years . Some go so far as to maintain that his behavior patterns are irrevocably fixed in the pre-school period . Be that as it may , again the layman believes in the importance of environment . Far be it from me to maintain that the college woman invariably comes from the better , more desirable stock . So far as I know , no study has been made which would give us data for such an opinion . Observation and acquaintance with many college women for many years lead me to believe , however , that on the whole the families from which they come are of the better type , representing better than the average health and intelligence . Great economic efficiency resulting in wealth , and the type of intellect that produces genius , are not necessary ingredients in the type of families which it is socially desirable to reproduce . From the point of view of eugenics It shall maintain until it is otherwise proven that it would be a good thing for the race if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry and produce chil-dren . In the matter of ability to furs . a proper environment for her offspring , the argument for the motherhood of college women can safely , it seems to me , be made even stronger than for heredity . One of my college professors , a woman , used to say that a girl could not graduate from Vassar and be a complete fool unless she had a perfect genius for it . A young woman who has been trained for four years in habits of observation , reasoning , deduction , and adaptation to other people ought to be able to adjust herself to the requirements of home making , to getting on with her husband , and to learning the latest on the subject of child hygiene , physical and mental , better than one not so trained . There are , of course , exceptions . Accurate statistics of marriages among college women are not available . An analysis of the sociological returns at various dates from the alumnae of a considerable number of both co-educational and women 's colleges shows that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences of percentage between the two types of institutions are not great enough to be significant , and that there is a slow increase in the percentage of marriages . There is not conclusive evidence that there is more than chance in the fact that in a few selected localities where the number of men exceed the women there is a slightly higher percentage of marriages . II The reasons most commonly given for failure of college women to marry are , first : During four of the most important years girls are removed from the society of eligible young men .. This is partially true if they attend a woman 's college . Second : They either enter college with a desire for a career or during their college course become fired with some specific enthusiasm . Third : Having received more than the non-college woman in the way of training of powers of observation and reason , they are more . ikely to be critical of men and less likelyto fall in love blindly . Fourth : Being prepared to earn an honest livelihood , they need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attends college is likely to be personally unbeautiful , unattractive , and dowdy . Sixth : Men as a class do not care to marry women who may prove to be their intellectual equals or superiors . Probably there is a certain amount of truth in each of these contentions . It is doubtful if any careful study has ever been made as to the truth of any of them . Perhaps none can ever be made . Certainly , the last two reasons given do not lend themselves easily to statistical surveys . But resorting to " straws , " it was reported recently that a foreign musician having given a concert at one of our eastern women 's colleges was being shown the campus and buildings . As they passed a group of jolly , laughing girls , he turned to his escort and remarked , " Are all your college girls so pretty ? Are there no homely college girls in America ? " Of course it may be answered that this article is dealing with a past generation , not the present ! New Student News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of California have completed a study of the comparative matrimonial advantages of the dumb ' and bright girls , and their conclusions show the grades of the married students to be a shade higher than of the unmarried , " and the holders of Phi Beta Kappa keys are equally divided between married and single women . As to the validity of other reasons generally cited for failure of college women to marry , let a group of unmarried college women speak for themselves . Those speaking arc twelve hundred women from whose answers to a questionnaire on the sex life of the normal unmarried college graduate out of college for at least five years this material is taken . In the group are eight hundred and thirteen graduates of women 's colleges ; three hundred and thirty-five of co-edurational colleges or universities ; forty-eight who did undergraduate work at both ; and five who did not answer as to type of college . Two hundred and thirty-four have the M.A. , and thirteen the M.S. degree ; sixty are Ph.D . ' s , and thirty-two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sorbonne in the group . In age the range is from two infant phenomena who entered college at 13 , graduated at 17 , and were 22 at time of reply , to one woman of 68 . The mode is 30 , and the average age 36.8 . Twenty-one per cent are under thirty , and 46.2 per cent are from 30 to 39 years of age . There are 77.1% of the entire group who report good or excellent health at time of reply , and 78.3% who call themselves happy . ( Sixty-eight failed to answer this question . ) Only 81 individuals declared that they were actively unhappy . The others were neutral or " fairly happy . " Only 53 of the entire number have never been gainfully employed . Occupationally , as might be anticipated , the educational group is far in the lead with 617 individuals , including several deans of colleges , college professors and instructors , principals of public and private schools , one city superintendent of schools , and teachers all along the line to kindergartners . Social service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional women 60 , with medicine in the lead ; librarians 52 , business women 43 , secretarial and clerical workers 79 ; and then in decreasing numbers practically every occupation open to women . Of these , 65.1 per cent express the belief that they are successful . Another smaller percentage say , " Other people call me so , " while the remainder are ready to admit that they have not reached the goal of success . On the whole , we have here a highly educated , busy , healthy , happy , and fairly successful group of women , more or less trained to express themselves in writing , 1077 of whom have told us whyfrom their own point of view they have never married . One hundred and twenty-three of our total ( 1200 ) failed to answer the first of the following group of questions : ( a ) Will you give the reasons why you have liot. married ? ( b ) Do you regret that you have not married ? Why ? ( c ) Have you ever been engaged ? ( d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect to marry if you meet the right man ? Table I shows the reasons of the 1077 who answered . So far as is possible , we have refrained from interpretation , but in many cases it has been necessary to sum up in a phrase the gist of a longer answer . When there was any question as to where an answer should go , it has been settled by the combined wisdom of the five of us who are working on our questionnaires . Over and over in studying and classifying the reasons I have wished that instead of anonymous replies I had names and addresses and the power to , summon before me the women who had written the papers , and having them in my office had the ability to secure the " transference " so much talked of by psychoanalysts and , in addition , had the knowledge so to examine them as to get behind the face value of the returns . Some of them do not need any particular getting behind . Such , for example , as ill-health , financial family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen young women who are engaged now and never in love before . The largest number , three hundred and five , say in substance they never met the right man . A good many of these have been engaged , many have had proposals . None of them cites lack of opportunity to meet men , ill-health , dislike of the marriage relation , or any obvious reasons given by others . H we knew all about them , probably some of them would be classified with the fourteen who admit they were too particular , critical , or cautious . But we could not stop there Why were they too particular , critical , or cautious ? Was this the result of " childhood conditioning " or of their college training ? Did caution " run in the family , " as one woman says spinsters do in hers ? One of this group feels it is just chance that keeps the right man out of her way . She , in common with a good many others , will marry if he comes . " Was never asked-never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second phrase explains the first , but why did n't they want to be asked ? That would obviously get us nearer to the real reason of failure to marry . Eighteen women say they have no desire to marry . " Marriage never appealed . " Why does n't it appeal ? The fifty-five who were never asked do not give us any clue as to what in their judgment was the deterring cause of this backwardness on the part of their men friends . In brief , we could go over the entire list of reasons with why ? why ? why ? Nothing short of careful individual study could get behind the alleged causes , so obviously we must go on from here unsatisfied , awaiting further exhaustive personality studies which one day undoubtedly will be made of normal as we now have them of abnormal women . Next on the list to the 305 who never met the right man is a group of ninety-seven women who fell in love with men they could not marry . Some of them were on the active list at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell why . " He is already married , " Z9 cases . " He does not reciprocate , " Z4 cases . " He died , " 10 cases . " He married another , " 7 eases . Differences in race and religion , 3 cases . Unexplained " circumstances separated , " 4 cases . " Differences in personality and social status , " and " He was not a college man " ( the women felt it would make for unhappiness ) , two eases each . " He was unable to marry , " unexplained ; and , " He was found to be sexually promiscuous , " 3 cases each . Eight reasons are given by TABLE II one person each , such as " misunderstanding , " " he proved untrustworthy , " " he was divorced and lied about it , " etc. , etc . Table II shows that 339 of the women have been engaged and 56 were engaged at the time of reporting .  --  In Table I , we find that in thirty-three cases the fiance had died and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-health had prevented marriage . In 54 cases the engagement was broken and the women " never loved another . " In these 54 cases the reason for the breaking of the engagement is given as follows : The completed table of reasons brought two surprises . Only 22 women gave " desire for a career " as the one reason for not marrying , though it was mentioned as one of the reasons in several cases where more than one was named . Fifty-two women gave " lack of opportunity to meet men , " as the one cause . In a considerable number of these cases the woman graduated at a co-educational college or university . Several stated that the lack of opportunity came from entering the teaching profession in a strange town with no social connections . A number engaged in various forms of business said that , though they met men daily in a business way , there were no social opportunities . These balance the women who have fallen in love with married men , their employers , or business associates . On the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the often expressed opinion as to the responsibility of these two factors in producing spinsters . The group of thirty-six who have been listed as prevented from marrying by " childhood conditioning " offers good illustrations of the importance of early environment . A few themselves use the phrase " childhood conditioning . " Most of them tell something of the circumstances , as for example , a woman physician of thirty-one , graduate of a woman 's college , who writes : " I think I have a strong homo-sexual tendency and that the women I have loved have satisfied my need for affection and companionship . " Had she stopped here , we should undoubtedly have classified her among those whose homo-sexual experiences prevented marriage , but she goes on : " My mother and ray college president roused and stimulated my sex antagonism . As a child and young girl I hated my father and his attitude toward my mother . This feeling my mother unconsciously fostered , and I decided that all men were alike and marriage had nothing for me . I was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this attitude meant and its cause , and at that age one is too old to experiment . I have never been attractive to men . No man has even been in love with me . I want very much to be married and am sorry that my earlier viewpoint was so warped both by my mother and the ardent feminist attitude the older unmarried woman who influenced me during my college life . " This is from a college teacher of thirtyight " Until six years ago marriage teemed to me something ugly . Until ; hen I had never known two really happy narried people . As a child , I was severely frightened by the unhappiness ) f my parents . " For the past six years his woman has had a very unhappy love ife . She is now confronted with the iroblem of sex relations without mariage . She wants a child badly . Still another : " My mother , who had a Lumber of children , succeeded in dryingup sex in several of us from a combination of unconscious dread of it and old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university , aged thirty-two , writes : " I was not trained to plan for marriage . I was given false information which led to suppression of sex instincts . I was taught to avoid dancing , spooning , and all personal contacts . I am considered successful and happy , but I am putting up a bluff . " Another writes : " This is hard to tell , but I think the chief reason is that I saw great unhappiness in my own home between my parents . At times they did not speak to each other , but always a good front was put up and even intimate friends thought it a happy household . My sympathies were with my mother . At the same time my closest playmate as a child and young girl from eight . years to eighteen or twenty was the child of a widow of comfortable means . Her home seemed heaven in its peace and happiness . I spent a great deal of time there . From my earliest recollections , from three or four years of age , I associated trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most loving to me , and is an extremely lovable person . I particularly came to associate happiness with my chum 's manlcss household . The unhappiness in my own home increased , and a resolve gradually grew up in me not to let myself grow fond of any boy , for fear of getting into the unhappy situation my mother was in . Only once was it difficult to hold to this , only once was I strongly attracted to a man . I have lived away from the strain of my parents ' home for ten years and have gained perspective ? and see the old troubles with a juster eye , and see fault on both sides . Therefore , some sympathy has come this late for my father too . Some of the old antagonism for men has gone as I have become more sympathetic with my father , and succeeding years of course have softened the hardness of youth . I do not believe that the indifference and coldness that I built up as a shield has been thrown off , however . " Included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call " father fixation , " as in the case of the woman who gives as her reason for not marrying , " devotion to an ideal father " ; and another who has " been waiting to find as fine a man as my father . " And as a final illustration of influences during childhood , we give the experiences of an older woman who says she grew up with the sense that certain things were bad . She early learned to indulge in auto-erotic practices . She became morbid as she grew older , largely on this account . She blames her parents for lack of oversight , for not gaining her confidence , and for lack of proper instruction . She always preferred girls to boys . She sums up with a statement that very well expresses the attitude of many of the older women toward the type of " college crush " that is not carried to extremes . " In college , maturing , there was a constant finding of congenial spirits , with considerable expression of affection by kissing and embracing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I remember being very much offended at a girl who said it was not love . I felt that marriage was not for me , because I might carry on to children the bad tendencies that had appeared in my own childhood . But of these things I never spoke to anyone . Men either did not attract me at all naturally , or was so inhibited that all the tenderness in me went out to girls and women . to those days we had no knowledge of such matters , and while some things may be eternally and immutably sex manifestations , to the ones who found in them the natural expressions of love for others , they were such expressions , not sex perversions , it seems to me , however sentimental such a view may be called by the scientific mind . I incline to wager that the future scientist will find some attributes human , belonging to both sexes , that are now gummed up with Freudian terms . " Last winter the presentation of the play , " The Captive , " and the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of homosexuality which before that time had never been made a topic of conversation in polite society . Many adults , particularly women , claimed they did not know such a condition existed . In answer to the question as to why she had failed to marry , 17 women replied that it was due to their relations with other women ; but in another section of the questionnaire dealing with " intense emotional relations with other girls or women , " 22 women stated that this relationship had been one influence in causing them to remain single , while 41 others stated that it was possibly a factor . Among the reasons each given by one person are the following : " The real reason is my own selfishness . " " The nicest men are already married . " Agrees with St. Paul that " he who marrieth not doeth better . " She adds : " I have no more interest in sex than in leprosy . " " I never stayed in love Iong enough . " From a young psychiatric social worker : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of a woman who says of herself : " I am rather an extreme case of the type of woman who does not marry . " She writes : " I really do n't know why , for after all , it is n't quite conclusive to say no one has asked me . My guess is that the reasons are physiologic , psyehologic , sociologic , and economic . ' " After a fashion , " she regrets not having married and believes that even yet if tin right man appeared she might say " yes . ' She goes on : " The marriage relation anc institution are such a mess ; I consider the institution in a chaotic transitiona state . I hate to miss any life experience yet I 'd probably have driven my hus. band to drink or loathed the humdrum . ' The thirty-three women who giv4 more than one reason are interesting because probably they approach thi truth more nearly than many of thos4 who give only one . There follow a fey of these replies : A graduate of a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbing work , and who is both healthy and happy , writes : " Perhaps an early distorted view of sex life gotten from girl playmates gave a subconscious repulsion to marriage . I was never in love . Other reasons are love of my home , which is unique and beautiful , my mother 's need of care , and the desirability of my management of family property . " A teacher of thirty says : " First , ambitious parents pushed me to give my whole attention to school and college work so that I had no time to play with boys before I went to college . My parents kept me at home very strictly . Second , I was isolated for four years at a woman 's college . Summers were spent at camp with girls . Third , when I came out of college , I was shy in the presence of men . Also , since I had learned about prostitution , I felt physically awkward with men . Fourth , I began to be successful in my profession ( teaching ) . Personal ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is now thirty ) , I have had less personal ambition and more eagerness for motherhood . But I find that the men who are congenial are already married , and often to very stupid women . Sometimes I reel rather bitter about this . " In both of these cases influences of Ithildhood and adolescence were at work : o prevent marriage . In the following case the " father fixa ; ion " motive appears . " My reasons for *allure to marry are : First , an unusually sappy home and a devoted sister . Seemd , I have no desire to marry for the ake of marrying . The right , man did not appear and I would marry no other . Phird , I wanted to find as fine a man as ny father . " Three concise replies are as follows : he first one , " Bashful , critical of most len ; not very attractive to men ; deoted to my family ; too busy . " The acond , " No opportunity to meet men ; tmily responsibilities ; absorbing profcsional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been afraid of boys and men . As a young girl the woman I thought the most of preached the doctrine of woman 's independence of man . Later , I saw the disasters of married life . " And there is the tale of a woman teacher who has been engaged three times . The first time her parents opposed it . He went away , and she grew away from him chiefly because she realized that she could not endure the hardship and poverty that would result if she persisted in marrying him . Next she was engaged to a widower with children who interfered and succeeded in breaking up the match . The third was the real love of her life . He was married . She was his wife 's friend . She loves him still . Lastly , there is a reply which might be transcribed in verse form : " 1 have a good job ; I earn a good living ; 1 am contented and happy ; Why be encumbered ? " This reminded me of something I tried for some time to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese girl in the advanced English class of a Christian College in China . The students were asked to write a sample of free verse . She produced this : " God is my father ; The earth is my mother ; Heaven is my home ; Why bother ? " It might be an answer to our question ! Five hundred fifty-nine women , or fifty-two per cent of those who replied to the question regret that they have not married . One hundred and forty-four more regret " sometimes . " Only about a third have no regrets . Table IV gives the reasons for regrets . Perhaps we have been too meticulous in the classification but there are reasons . There is some significance in the fact that V7 women regret the lack of children , while only 10 ' 2 specify a husband . " Home " is named by 70 individuals . " A richer , fuller experience , " is quite possibly the same thing as a " normal life " in different words , as is also the belief that she " would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as , for example : how far is the underlying natural feminine desire for children a factor in the changes in social mores respecting sex relationships which are developing under the greater economic freedom of women ? And on the other hand , to what extent will the increasing spread of knowledge of limitation of offspring affect the situation in relation to greater social tolerance of extra-legal relationships ? The twenty-one women who give each an individual reason say among otherthings : " Marriage seems more worth while than digging around to maintain your own life . " " I have no future . " " Would like to have had my children younger " ( age 34-engaged ) . " Would have been less one-sided . " " In my case an early marriage would have prevented much superfluous knowledge . " This latter is one of the cases where a woman has fallen in love with and yielded to her employer . Another writes : " I crave the perfect life which my father and mother have known , such a perfect supplementing as Cabot describes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old maids . " " Shall have more difficulty in marrying as the years go on . " " It is better to be nearer the age of one 's children . " Apparently she expects to have them though she does not say so . Those who regret " sometimes , " do so for the same reasons as those whose regrets are constant . Two hundred and ninety of the 371 who do not regret tell why . Their answers are more individual and harder to classify than the reasons for regretting . Sixty are happy and content uncler existing conditions ; 34 are absorbed in their work and other interests , while prefer freedom and independence . Ob . servations of the marriages of other : cause a number to rejoice that they an not in like case , while those who gavt ill-health as a reason for not marrying an glad as time goes on that they did no venture . A number are satisfied witl their women friends . Some of the individual reasons fo feeling no regret are : " The men whi have asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far it is not God 's " Feel that the right man is waitin , somewhere . " " The men I used to g with would bore me to death now . " " believe that the unmarried woman ha just as definite a place in the world as th married woman . " " The women of m family usually marry after 30 " ( age " There are plenty of chances in futui incarnations . " " I am too ernotionall unstable . " " I have learned a heap about life that I would n't otherwise have learned . " " I do not waste time in regrets ; I have left it in God 's hands . " " I am not fond of children . " " I feel very strongly that some of us can be far more worthwhile in the business and professional world than living with most men ? anyone can do that . " " I have never yet met a man I 'd be willing to have as the father of my children . " One who declares herself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not married . Children are hostages to the existing order . One wants them to have advantages and makes compromises for their sakes one would never make for one 's own . " And so on for a total of one hundred and seventeen individual rationalizations of contentment with the writer 's station in life . III In concluding the discussion of the iata supplied by our group of women , we all attention to the rather surprising ' act shown in Table 11 that only eight- , en per cent of the 1106 women replying . o this question declared unequivocally hat they would not marry under any ircurastances . These one hundred and tinety-seven women include those who re in ill-health , most but not all of the /omen over fifty , some of those who ave family obligations , some but not all f the homo-sexuals , and all those who islike marriage as an in'stitution . Those dm say " perhaps " include those who ! . e light ahead , as does the young ! ocher who says " perhaps , when the location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who ould like to marry " when I am free " ; lose in love with married men who may free some day , or those who fear the neliness of the future , and some of the der women who , abundantly able to Lre for themselves financially , crave the rtainty of intellectual congenial corntnionship for their declining years . On the whole , it appears that in this group of unmarried college women , at least the large majority have no deeply rooted sex antagonism nor aversion to marriage . From a study of their papers I believe they would agree that marriage is the normal life of women , whatever may have been the exception in their individual experience . The only generalization that can be made as to why they failed to marry is that it is impossible to generalize . Yet we can summarize within limits . For example : It would appear that college women do not lack for attractive traits when only one in twenty states definitely that she has never had offers of marriage , and over a third have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . Lack of social opportunities to meet men have been the lot of very few On the whole , the picture is one of opportunity . The rarity with which desire for a career has been the only cause to prevent marriage is rather surprising , as only one in fifty makes this statement . Unexpected also is the infrequency of revolt against marriage caused by unfortunate childhood impressions . An English sociologist of international fame , commenting on the material gathered by our questionnaires on the sex life of normal women , says " It . is a valuable history of a group of women rapidly passing off the stage . " The twenty-one per cent of our women who were under thirty at the time of reply may resent being shoved off the scene so summarily , but if all one reads and hears is only partially true , there have been great changes of attitude and opinions among the women graduates who have come out from college these Last ten years . To have made this story more complete , we should have heard from them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the man 's side . Why did not the right man appear ? Will twelve hundred college men married to women not college graduates please come forward and give their reasons for so slighting our alummr ?
