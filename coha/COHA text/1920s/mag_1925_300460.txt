Lashed by equinoctial gales in and out of harbor along the Greenland coast , the ships Bowdoin and Peary , homing from Etah with Commander Donald B. MacMillan , <P> ( TIME , June 22 et seq. ) , last week crossed icy Davis Strait to Jack Lane 's Bay , Labrador . The Bow-doiris forecastle was awash , a 400-lb. drum of gasoline had been swept overboard , a rare specimen or two collected by Naturalist Walter N. Koelz had been lost ; but all hands were well and happy to be in touch once more with their home continent . The Peary , with the expedition 's Navy seaplanes lashed on deck , had fared similarly . Nosing on southward , the Bowdoin ran aground , snapped her mainsail gaff in a sharp squall . At last the buildings of the Grenfell Mission loomed on the shore of Battle Harbor . After a brief stop there , the pilgrims pushed off on their journey 's last leg for Wiscasset , Me. , bringing with them no news of a new continent below the Pole , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glacier-ridden Arctic fastnessess , and scientific data for future aerial polar exploration .
