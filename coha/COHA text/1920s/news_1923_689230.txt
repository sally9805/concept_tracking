txt One of the men best posted in Massachusetts politics was asked to describe for the Boston News Bureau the relations between Calvin Coolidge and William M. Buller . He replied : - " Coolidge never says anything , but he is always reaay to receive advice and finally acts on the information received and his own principles . Once having taken a position his attitude is one of unyielding purpose . " He moved slowly in the police strike but once having taken a position in backing up Commissioner Curtis and telegraphing his famous message to eGompers nothing could swerve him from that position . His stand was reflected in the message to the head of the American Federation of Labor : ' There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody , anywhere , any time . ' " That is Calvin Coolidge . He has always stood for law and order . His adherence has been absolute and firm to the law of this country and the Constitution and he has never been a follower of isms  --  socialism , bad unionism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the future , particularly in the forthcoming Republican convention , if he could possibly belie his reputation and search after the ' " ism " vote he would not get it because it would prefer one of its own kind . Therefore , looking ahead a year , if Coolidge is a candidate he must be a candidate supporting the principles of the Constitution without attempt to get around them for votes . That has been his history . COOLIDGE 'S FRIENDS " Coolidge 's friend to the world is Frank W. Stearns . That is so . Stearns loves Coolidge as Calvin Coolidge ; anything Coolidge does ti right . But Coolidge 's political adviser , his guardian and the man who is ' wising up ' Coolidge even today is William M. Butler . " Let me go back a few years . Calvin Coolidge received his early political ? training from W. *Stray Crane . Crane taught him the value of silence ; the uselepsness of promiscuous interviews and dashing into print . He taught him the of words well - expressed and ' none- wasted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolidge possesses today . Crane brought Coolidge up to the standards that he , Crane , lived by , politically , socially and legally . Coolidge was his own expression . " William M. Butler and Senator Crane were closer than the world will ever know . Butler was instructed in the late years of Crane 's life to bring Coolidge up to the Crane-Butler political standards . " Butler is today the chief adviser  --  virtually the only political adviser  --  Coolidge has . Stearns is his personal friend . BUTLER 'S AMBITION " There has always been in Butler 's mind an ambition to become United States Senator . Just a week before Harding died , 1 understand Butler and Channing Cox had luncheon and at that luncheon Cox agreed to announce later that he was not interested in the United States Senatorship , but was keenly interested in seeing Butler given the candidacy to oppose Walsh . " Harding 's death has made a difference . Butler knows he can have the Attorney Generalship from Coolidge if he wants it . Daugherty will resign ; that is positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Butler , thinks that Henry A. Wyman of Boston would make the best Attorney General . I would not be surprised to see this announcement made later . " There will probably be only one or two resignations from the Cabinet this year . But after next January , 1 look for szveral . Confidentially Weeks will probably not be in the Cabinet very late in 1924 . He will offer his resignation and it will be accepted . " In all political parties men high up will cooperate but they will be rivals . Crane and Lodge and Butler and Weeks would cooperate , but they were for years representative of rival ambitions . " Lodge and Coolidge are friendly , as they meet . They are bitter rivals politically . COOLIDGE FOR RIGHT " You can eliminate Weeks from consideration in the senatorial fight with Walsh . Weeks does not want the job . He is sick of the war department and is content to he active in the direction of Republican policies politically rather than as an office-holder . " Coolidge 's machine in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running condition ' by William M. Butler . It is composed more of the younger Republican element . But it functions perfectly and notwithstanding Coolidge is today President that machine is being enlarged and prepared for 1924 . " But ' Calvin Coolidge today is different from the Coolidge of 1921 . He has had two and half years of experience . He is a student ; he has not missed a single event of political , economic or social importance in Washington . He has been the silent marvel of Washington . He has gone along alone ; the newspaper men never had anything to do with him . He had to be introduced to them when he called them in last week . He has seen the Cabinet function ; he has seen the Senate operate ; he knows who the workers are in both bodies of Congress . He has stored up much knowledge and broadened his vision . " He wo n't make many mistakes ; he believes in no compromise between right and wrong . He is for the right and the law and the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically ? . William M. Butler .
