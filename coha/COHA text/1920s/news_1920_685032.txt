txt The gold miners of the United States are asking for a subsidy again , this time a novel one . They are proposing that for five years an excise tax of $10 an ounce shall be levied for their ' benefit on the gold used in the arts . The plea comes when the arts are drawing their supply from the bank reserves . These are none too large and are daily depleted by exports of gold sent to countries which have not the power of drawing gold in the present condition of the exchanges . For example , Argentina has taken from this country this year forty millions gold , although the exchange is now below the shipping parity . We owe Argentina either gold or goods , but we should not now be sending gold under ordinary conditions . The suggestion is that the gold is sent on orders from some country which is paying its debts with our specie , having none of its own , and yet being in such trade relations with Argentina that it must pay Argentina , although it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports in connection with the request for a tax on the gold used in the arts Is to show that there are no differences in dollars , In whosesoever hands and for whatever uses . In normal times the currents of gold are as free as the currents in the sea or the ether , and sometimes as difficult to explain . . In normal times there is an economic check on such currents which does not exist now , when there is such an excess of substitutes for gold , domestic money , and such crosscurrents in international trade that the only country of commercial importance which allows free exports of gold may find Itself called upon to pay debts collectible in sterling whenever ordered to dt so by either side of the trade . There would be no objection , if we could collect the gold owed to us , but orders to export gold on sterling debts come to us precisely because sterling is no longer gold and England can not pay us what she owes . This is something to think about at a time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reduction of bank credits by fifteen to twenty millions . Deflation on that scale . and beyond control , is not wanted even by sternest critics of inflation . - Another and perhaps better present reason for disliking the miners ' request for a tax for their benefit is that the effect would be to make aI distinction between their dollars and the dollars of everybody else , The bullion is the miners ' bullion , but the dollars are the people 's dollars , not the miners ' dollars . If either dollar is to be exchangeable for more goods , it ought to be the people 's dollar . At least both dollars ought to be worth the same in goods . The miners ' request for a grant in aid of mining might equally be made by anybody who finds dollars buying less goods than when gold was mined more cheaply . . Everybody else is told to work harder in order to make dollars buy mere goods , and that counsel is good for the miners . A tax to be paid to the miners amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their benefit and giving them a profit by the inflation of the goods value of the dollars- paid to them . The inflation of the miners ' dollars is objectionable at a time when inflation has lightened the ' worth of the people 's dollars in goods , se/etch in effect is the same as lightening the weight . The weight of the dollar should not be increased nor lessened for anybody 's benefit or on any plea . It does not follow that we alone ought to leave the gold market free when all other commercial nations are controlling it . No other nation is subsidizing gold and all nations are ob ... jecting to more taxes . The customary expedients are licenses and embargoes . There is no serious objection to making jewelry dearer at a time when too much is spent for it , and too much of it is of that cheap sort which wastes the gold , as fine jewelry does not . A license on the use of gold used in the arts would tend to keep it in the bank reserves and would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new gold would preju-. dice the miners by preventing them from realizing the premium on the coin value , and would be discrimination against their industry . Permission to realize that premium would be less objectionable than a tax for their benefit and would not prevent ptitting ourselves on ? a parity with other nations which have stopped the payment of gold . There are apparent objections to that and it is not yet necessary , but it is not premature to suggest that thought should be given to the subject .
