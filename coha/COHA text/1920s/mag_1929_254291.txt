Grim Plutarco Elias Calles , Minister of War , sat in the public dining room of a hotel at Torreon , Mexico , last week , methodically chewing . Generals and businessmen leaned over the table , talking excitedly . General Calles , scowling , continued to eat . <P> The chief general of the rebel forces , Gonzalo Escobar , had just fled from Torreon before the advance of Calles and his three federal columns . Theirs was the victory , but it was a hollow one . The wily General Escobar had looted five Torreon banks of $510,000 before he left . General Calles could see the outraged banks from where he ate , their windows broken , their vaults violated and bare . <P> The news was flashed to President Fortes Gil in Mexico City . <P> Cried the shocked President , " Escobar and the others are just common criminals ! " The U.S. Government promised to search all Mexicans crossing the border for looted gold . <P> Courtly Prelude . With General Calles at Torreon in the north , rebel commanders made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck at Mazatlan , the chief Pacific port of Mexico , northwest of the capital . The leaders of this thrust were General Ramon ( " Sacristan " * ) Iturbe and heavy-jowled Francisco Manzo . Advancing from the north and obscurity they took their place in the news . Halting the army of about 5,000 men , " Sacristan " Iturbe entered a telephone booth and called General Jaime Carillo , defender of the seaport . <P> " In accord with the order ; of Generals Manzo and Cruz and Topete , " I said General Iturbe curtly , " I invite you to enter into arrangements for the purpose of avoiding bloodshed . " <P> " Although I have no authorization , " Carillo answered , " and my honor as a soldier does not permit me to enter into discussions with such individuals that have lost all military decorum , I accept , nevertheless , these exchanges under condition that they refer to your unconditional surrender ! " <P> " Then as that is your attitude , there is no way for us to submit any propositions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours Mazatlan will be in our power at the cost of not a few lives . " <P> " Mother of God ! I have been able to hold my patience in the face of your shameless and cynical words , but not desiring to listen any longer I hereby draw to a close this conversation . " <P> A report of this courtly prelude to battle was forwarded to Minister of War Calles , and the battle was on , horse , foot and artillery . <P> At the height of the uproar , with both sides deadlocked , the federal gunboat Progresso steamed into the harbor and furiously pumped shells in the direction of the rebel lines . <P> Risking everything to capture the city before relief arrived , " Sacristan " Iturbe sent an infantry charge along the beach to force the harbor fortifications . Again the rebels were beaten back by machine gun fire . <P> A radio message came from U.S. Consul William P. Blocker during the height of the fighting : " My death is false . Please deny such a rumor . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . <P> <P> * So called because of his religious leanings . Governor Fausto Topete of Sonora , rebel state .
