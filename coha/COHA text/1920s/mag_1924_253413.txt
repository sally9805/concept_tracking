If one were to pick an ideal name for a Democratic Boss* in New York City , how would one go about it ? First , one would want something patriotic . George Washington ? Excellent ! Then something Irish . Olvany ? Nothing better . <P> The new boss of Tammany , therefore , is Judge George Washington Olvany . He succeeds the late " Commissioner " Charles F. Murphy ( TIME , May 5 ) . <P> After a committee of seven Tammany leaders had considered in private for an hour , the Executive Committee of the entire organization ratified the subcommittee 's choice of Judge Olvany . The vote was 22 ? to ? . The one-third vote was cast by two leaders of a single district . <P> The election was peculiar . Technically , there was no office vacant . There is no official post of boss , or " leader , " to use the political euphemism . The supreme and autocratic ruler of the organization exists through usage and necessity . He dispenses patronage , makes up tickets , handles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Consequently the election took the form of passing this resolution : " That Hon. George W. Olvany be and hereby is , elected to succeed Hon. Charles F. Murphy , deceased , and to perform all the duties formerly discharged by him . " <P> Judge Olvany was born on Pike St. , lower Manhattan , the son of a bricklayer . Thus he began in the Tammany tradition . He graduated from New York University Law School ( not quite traditional ) and became a lawyer . For 26 years he has belonged to Tammany . Six months ago Governor Smith made him a Judge . <P> Now he is six feet tall , hearty , only 48 years old . He is a master of silence like his predecessor , Murphy . Unlike Murphy , he is also a persuasive speaker . This is not entirely an advantage . James Bryce in his standard work** declares : " It is , of course , a gain to a Ring to have among them a man of popular gifts , because he helps to conceal the odious features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and winning the applause of the masses who stand outside the circle of workers . However , the position of the rhetorical boss is less firmly rooted than that of the intriguing boss , and there have been instances of his suddenly falling , to rise no more . " <P> Judge Olvany looked upon the future in no such sinister light . Said he : " The call of the New York County Democratic organization , as voiced by its Executive Committee , though unexpected , is too strong to resist . Within the next few days I shall resign as Judge of the Court of General Sessions and undertake to carry on the work so ably , unselfishly and successfully* performed by Charles F. Murphy for more than twenty-two years . " <P> A colloquy followed with a reporter . <P> " Will you follow the policies of your predecessor , Mr. Murphy ? " <P> " I could not follow a better man . " <P> " Well , we hope you will be a little easier to interview than Mr. Murphy . " <P> " I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were five bosses of Tammany . Previously Tammany had been what it still calls itself , a " Society . " The first of the bosses made himself Dictator . After him the others were Emperors pure and simple . Their careers and characteristics were well summarized by Samuel McCoy :
