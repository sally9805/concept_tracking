A FRONTIER <P> The dying fires of the Polish-Lithuanian boundary dispute over Vilna do not signify that the heat is dead . An armistice agreed upon by both sides is only a lull in the hostilities that have been adding their quota to wrecking the peace equilibrium maintained with such immense difficulty in Europe . <P> Only a few days ago Lithuania was shelling the Polish front and many casualties have been reported . It is to Poland 's credit that she has refrained as far as possible from taking any steps calculated to aggravate an already serious position . As the final decision with reference to the demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania rests with those governments , it is at least comforting that they had the good sense to come together with the intention of trying to settle their dispute by peaceable methods . <P> In 1920 a dispute arose over the boundary line and a neutral zone was agreed upon , pending final settlement by the Council of the League of Nations . It was not until February 3 of this year that an equitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions from the League occupied that part of the neutral zone allotted to them , but met with stiff resistance from the Lithuanians . Strictly speaking , Lithuania has incurred financial and economic penalties by resisting the decision of the League , although the time is hardly opportune for the enforcement of such punishment . From a legal point of view , however , neither country is bound to accept outside arbitration . <P> The usual rumors are current stating that Soviet Russia is causing the dissension . This time , however , there is some foundation . Tchitcherin , Soviet Foreign Minister , in a note to the Lithuanian Government offering mediation , says : " My government is disturbed over the new complications arising between Lithuania and Poland . " This is legitimately regarded as a bid for power by the Russians . Poland has , however , refused to accept Bolshevik mediation ; so , after all , Tchitcherin may be looking for other means to secure his end .                   @ @
