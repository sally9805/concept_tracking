txt With the approach of the twelfth Christmas which readers of THE TIMES have made a happy one for the persons included in the Hundred Neediest Cases , we feel morel than ever justified in the conviction that our great service of this annual appeal is to the givers . It is a commonplace of sociology that by far the greatest amount of help given to those who have fallen below the level of self-support comes from those who are themselves just above that level . The very poor help the destitute because they know from close observation , perhaps from past experience , what destitution means . Most of us do not ; however we deplore our own hardships , we have no ' conception by experience , and rarely by direct observation , of just what destitution means . But no one who has read the histories of the Hundred Cases can fail to understand that all about us , at our doors , are people living in constant fear of absolute want . For the Hundred Cases represent that fraction of the great population just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness ' or ac- . cident cripples the breadwinner . No citizen who ' wants an intelligent understanding of the society he lives in can afford not to read these stories . That more and more people are reading them , and with effect , is shown by the fact that the total number of contributors this year is so great . Though the large individual gifts have not been so-numerous as in past years , there have been many small contributors ; and this means that many people have studied attentively , and with practical results , what poverty actually means to its individual victims and to society . Some years ago a philanthropist offered a million dollars as a standing endowment of this charity , the income to go every year to the relief of the Hundred Neediest . The offer was refused , because THE TIMES believed that this would do away with the greatest benefit the campaign now offers . The difference between , say , fifty thousand dollars from one contributor and five dollars each from ten thousand contributors - is the ' difference between one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can to alleviate them , and ten thousand men - and women who are g , : iy ! ing ? , their own thought and attention toll ? be , raisers !

Twelve years after the idea was originated here , there art thousands of the neediest cases of various American cities which find relief ai Christmas time ; and correspondingly there are many thousands of generous people who at Christmas time pause to make some personal study of the problem of poverty about them , and retain that active and beneficent interest thereafter . At this writing , the fund is about $30,000 short of the amount required to meet the need of the 25 cases accepted by THE TIMES from the six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount necessary to permit some very deserving people on the certified list to share in this year 's fund .
