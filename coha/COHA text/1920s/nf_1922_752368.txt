LANE @# @# I INTRODUCTION Youth  --  Education  --  Characteristics @# Although Franklin Knight Lane was only fifty-seven years old when he died , May 18 , 1921 , he had outlived , by many years , the men and women who had most influenced the shaping of his early life . Of his mother he wrote , in trying to comfort a friend , " The mystery and the ordering of this world grows altogether inexplicable . ... It requires far more religion or philosophy than I have , to say a real word that might console one who has lost those who are dear to him . Ten years ago my mother died , and I have never been reconciled to her loss . " Again he wrote of her , to his sister , when their brother Frederic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his last illness , " Dear Fritz , dear , dear boy , how I wish I could be there with him , though I could do no good . ... Each night I pray for him , and I am so much of a Catholic , that I pray to the only Saint I know , or ever knew , and ask her to help . If she lives , her mind can reach the minds of the doctors . ... I do n't need her to intercede with God , but I would like her to intercede with men . Why , Oh ! why , do we not know whether she is or not ? Then all the Universe would be explained to me . " From those who knew him best from childhood , no word of him is left , and none from the two men whose strength and ideality colored his morning at the University of California  --  Dr. George H. Howison , the " darling Howison " of the William James ' Letters , and Dr. Joseph H. Le Conte , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along my skyline , " Lane said of such men . To Dr. Howison he wrote in 1913 , when entering President Wilson 's Cabinet , " No letter that I have ever received has given me more real pleasure than yours , and no man has been more of an inspiration than you . " The sealing of almost every source of intimate knowledge of the boy , who was a mature man at twenty-two , has left the record of the early period curiously scant . Fortunately , there are in his letters and speeches some casual allusions to his childhood and youth , and a few facts and anecdotes of the period from members of his family , from school , college , and early newspaper associates . In 1888 , the story begins to gather form and coherence , for at that date we have the first of his own letters that have been preserved , written to his lifelong friend , John H. Wigmore . With many breaks , especially in the early chapters , the sequence of events , and his moods toward them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day before he died . All the later record exists in his letters , most of them written almost as unconsciously as the heart sends blood to the remotest members of the body ; and they come back , now , in slow diastole , bearing within themselves evidence of the hour and day and place of their inception ; letters written with the stub of a pencil on copy-paper , at some sleepless dawn ; or , long ago , in the wide-spaced type of a primitive traveling typewriter , and dated , perhaps , on the Western desert , while he was on his way to secure water for thirsty settlers ; or dashed off in the glowing moment just after a Cabinet meeting , with the heat of the discussion still in his veins ; others on the paper of the Department of the Interior , with the symbol of the buffalo  --  chosen by him  --  richly embossed in white on the corner , and other letters , soiled and worn from being long carried in the pocket and often re-read , by the brave old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists . This is the part of the record that can not be transcribed . Franklin Knight Lane was born on July 15 , 1864 , on his father 's farm near Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , Canada , the eldest of four children , all born within a few years . The low , white farmhouse that is his birthplace still stands pleasantly surrounded by tall trees , and at one side a huge , thirty-foot hedge of hawthorn blooms each spring . His father , Christopher S. Lane , was at the time of his son 's birth a preacher . Later , when his voice was affected by recurrent bronchitis , he became a dentist . Lane speaks of him several times in his letters as a Presbyterian , and alludes to the strict orthodoxy of his father 's faith , especially in regard to an active and personal devil . In 1917 , when in the Cabinet , during President Wilson 's second term of office , Lane wrote to his brother , " To-night we give a dinner to the Canadians , Sir George Foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Under-Secretary of External Affairs , who , by the way , was born in Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , and says that he heard our father preach . " But it was from his mother , whose maiden name was Caroline Burns , and who was of direct Scotch ancestry , that Franklin Lane drew most of his physical and many of his mental traits . From her he derived the firmly-modeled structure of his face ; the watchful Scotch eyes ; a fine white skin , that weathered to an even brown , later in life ; remarkably sound teeth , large and regular , giving firm support to the round contour of the face ; and the fresh line of his lips , that was a marked family trait . A description of him , when he was candidate for Governor of California , at thirty-eight , was written by Grant Wallace . Cleared of some of the hot sweetness of a campaign rhapsody it reads :  --  " Picture a man a little above the average height ... with the deep chest and deep voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigness and strength of the hands ... the clear eye and broad , firm , and expressive mouth , and the massive head that suggests irresistibly a combination of Napoleon and Ingersoll . " These two resemblances , to Napoleon and to Robert Ingersoll , were frequently rediscovered by others , in later years . The description concludes by saying , " That Lane is a man of earnestness and vigorous action is shown in ... every movement . You sit down to chat with him in his office . As he grows interested in the subject , he kicks his chair back , thrusts his hands way to the elbows in his trouser pockets and strides up and down the room . With deepening interest he speaks more rapidly and forcibly , and charges back and forth across the carpet with the heavy tread of a grenadier . " As an older man this impetuosity was somewhat modified . What an early interviewer called his " frank man-to-manness " became a manner of grave and cordial concentration . With the warm , full grasp of his hand in greeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That , and his rich , strong laugh of pleasure , and the varied play of his moods of earnestness , gayety , and challenge , are what men remember best . Lane 's native bent from the first was toward public life . His citizenship was determined when his father decided to take his family to California , to escape the severity of the Canadian climate . In 1902 , Franklin Lane was asked how he became an American . " By virtue of my father 's citizenship , " he replied , " I have been a resident of California since seven years of age , excepting during a brief absence in New York and Washington . " In 1871 , the mother , father , and four children , after visiting two brothers of Mrs. Lane 's on the way , finally reached the town of Napa , California . " They came , " says an old schoolmate of Napa days , " bringing with them enough of the appearance and mannerisms of their former environment to make us youngsters ' sit up and take notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topped by handsome black velvet and silk plaid caps . However , these costumes were soon discarded , for at school the children found themselves the center of both good  --  and bad-natured gibes , until they were glad to dress as was the custom here . " The " Lane boys , " he says , were then put into knee-trousers , " and Franklin , who was large for his age and quite stout , looked already too old for this style , " and so continued to be annoyed by the children , until he put a forcible end to it . " He ' licked ' one of the ringleaders , " says the chronicler , and won to peace . " As we grew to know Franklin ... his right to act became accepted ... . There was always something about his personality which made one feel his importance . " The little California community was impressed by the close intimacy of the home-life of the Canadian family  --  closer than was usual in hurriedly settled Western towns . The father found time to take all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them starting off together for a day 's hunting and fishing . But it was the mother , who read aloud to them and told them stories and exacted quick obedience from them , who was the real power in the house . There were regular family prayers , and family singing of hymns and songs . This last custom survived among the brothers and sister through all the years . Even after all had families of their own , and many cares , some chance reunion , or a little family dinner would , at parting , quicken memory and , with hats and coats already on , perhaps , in readiness to separate to their homes , they would stand together and shout , in unison , some song of the hour or some of their old Scotch melodies with that pleasant harmony of voices of one timbre , heard only in family singing . Lane had a baritone of stirring quality , coming straight from his big lungs , and loved music all his life . In the last weeks of his life he more than once wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester , a few days before his operation , he reassured an anxious friend by writing , " My brother George is here , with his splendid philosophy and his Scotch songs . " His love and loyalty to past ties , though great and persistent , still left his ideal of loyalty unsatisfied . Toward the end of his life he wrote , " Roots we all have and we must not be torn up from them and flung about as if we were young things that could take hold in any soil . I have been  --  America has been  --  too indifferent to roots  --  home roots , school roots . ... We should love stability and tradition as well as love adventure and advancement . " But the practical labors of his life were directed toward creating means to modify tradition in favor of a larger sort of justice than the past had known . Resignation had no part in his political creed . " I hold with old Cicero ' that the whole glory of virtue is in activity , ' " comes from him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's biography he wrote , " What a fine life  --  all fight , interwoven with fun and friendship . " Illustration with caption : FRANKLIN K. LANE WITH HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS , GEORGE AND FREDERIC All the anecdotes of his boyhood show him in action , moving among his fellows , organizing , leading , and administering rough-and-tumble justice . From grammar school in Napa he went , for a time , to a private school called Oak Mound . In vacation , when he was eleven years old , he was earning money as messenger-boy , and at about that time as general helper to one of the merchants of the little town . He left in his old employer 's mind the memory of a boy " exceedingly bright and enterprising . " He recalls a fight that he was told about , between Lane " and a boy of about his size , " " and Frank licked him , " the old merchant exults , " and as he walked away he said , ' If you want any more , you can get it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so he could not have been quite twelve years old  - -  that Lane started to study Spanish , so that he might talk more freely to the ranchers , who drove to town in their rickety little carts , to " trade " at the stores . In 1876 , the family moved from the full sunshine of the valley town , with its roads muffled in pale dust , and its hillsides lifting up the green of riotous vines , to Oakland , cool and cloudy , with a climate to create and sustain vigor . In Oakland , just across the bay from San Francisco , Lane entered the High School . Again his schoolmates recall him with gusto . He was muscular in build , " a good short-distance runner . " His hands  - -  always very characteristic of the man  --  were large and well-made , strong to grasp but not adroit in the smaller crafts of tinkering . " He impressed me , " an Oakland schoolmate writes , " as a sturdy youngster who had confidence in himself and would undoubtedly get what he went after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engrossed in the other boys , " when they walked down Twelfth Street , on their way to school , they had their arms around each other 's shoulders , discussing subjects of ' vast importance . ' " His capacity for organized association developed rapidly . He had part in school orations , amateur plays , school and Sunday school clubs . Many of these he seems to have initiated , so that , with his school work , his life was full . He says somewhere that by the time he was sixteen he was earning his own way . His great delight in people , and especially in the thrust and parry of controversial talk , held him from the solitary pleasures of fishing and hunting , so keenly relished by his two younger brothers . One of them said of him , " Frank ca n't even enjoy a view from a mountain-peak without wanting to call some one up to share it with him . " He writes of his feeling about solitary nature to his friend George Dorr , in 1917 , in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A wilderness , no matter how impressive or beautiful does not satisfy this soul of mine ( if I have that kind of a thing ) . It is a challenge to man . It says , ' Master me ! Put me to use ! Make me more than I am ! ' " About his " need of a world of men , " he was equally candid . To his wife he writes , " I am going to dinner , and before I go alone into a lonesome club , I must send a word to you . ... The world is all people to me . I lean upon them . They induce thought and fancy . They give color to my life . Thrown on myself I am a stranded bark . " ... His love for cooperation and for action , " dramatic action , " some one says , never left him . In his last illness , in apolitical crisis , he rallied the energy of younger men . He wrote of the need of a Democratic program , suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , " he adds , " put up the plan and ask them what they think of it  --  tentatively  --  just a quiet chat , but START ! " And about the same matter he wrote , " The time has come . Now strike ! " To a friend wavering over her fitness for a piece of projected work , he said drily , " There is only one way to do a thing , and that is to do it . " Late in life , the summation of this creed of action seemed to come when he confessed , " I can not get over the feeling that we are here as conquerors , not as pacifists . " And words , written and spoken words , were to him , of course , the instrument of conquest . But the search for the fit and shining word for his mark did not become research . In a droll letter , about how he put simpler English into the Department of the Interior , he tells of finding a letter written by one of the lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , that was " so involved and elaborately braided and beaded and fringed that I could not understand it myself . " So he sent the ornate letter back and had it put into " straightaway English . " His own practicable English he believed he had learned through his newspaper training . He first worked in the printing office of the Oakland Times , then became a reporter for that paper . He went campaigning and made speeches for the Prohibition candidate for Governor in 1884  --  before he was twenty-one . The next year he was reporting for the Alta California , edited by Colonel John P. Irish , himself a fiery orator , of the denunciatory type . Colonel Irish recalls that he was at once impressed with the " copious and excellent vocabulary " of his ambitious reporter , who was , even then , he says , " determined upon a high and useful career . " In a letter to Colonel Irish , in 1913 , Lane wrote , " That simple little card of yours was a good thing for me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing business and carried me back , about thirty years , to the time when I was a boy working for you  --  an unbaked , ambitious chap , who did not know where he was going , but was trying to get somewhere . " It is interesting to notice that in youth he did not suffer from the usual phases of revolt from early teachings . His father was a Prohibitionist , and Lane 's first campaign was for a Prohibition candidate for Governor ; his father had been a preacher and Lane , when very young , thought seriously of becoming a minister , so seriously that he came before an examining board of the Presbyterian church . After two hours of grilling , he was , though found wanting , not rejected , but put upon a six months ' probation  --  the elders probably dreaded to lose so persuasive a tongue for the sake of a little " insufficiency of damnation " in his creed . One of his inquisitors , a Presbyterian minister , went from the ordeal with Lane , and continued to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , at some turn of the talk , the clergyman abandoned his position and said carelessly , " Well , Lane , why not become a Unitarian preacher ? " The boy who had been walking the floor at night in the struggle to reconcile the teachings of the church with his own doubts  --  knowing that Eternal Damnation was held to be the reward for doubt of Christ 's divinity  --  was so horrified by the casuistry of the man who could be an orthodox minister and yet speak of preaching as just one way to make a living , that he swung sharply from any wish to enter the church . The strictness of the orthodoxy of his home had not served to alienate his sympathies , but he was chilled to the heart by this indifference . He remembered the episode all his life with emotion , but he was not embittered by it . He was young , a great lover , greatly in love with life . Illustration with caption : FRANKLIN K. LANE AT EIGHTEEN In 1884 , when he entered the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular student . " I put myself through college , " he writes to a boy seeking advice on education , " by working during vacation and after hours , and I am very glad I did it . " He seems to have arranged all his college courses for the mornings and carried his reporting and printing-office work the last half of the day . College at once offered a great forum for debate , and a richer comradeship with men of strong mental fiber . Lane 's eagerness in discussion and love of large and sounding words made the students call him " Demosthenes Lane . " In his letters it is easy to trace the gradual evolution from his early oratorical style into a final form of free , imaginative expression of great simplicity . Meanwhile , as he debated , he gathered to himself men who were to be friends for the rest of his life . The " Sid " of the earliest letters that we have is Dr. Sidney E. Mezes , now President of the College of the City of New York , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship for Dr. Wigmore , Dean of Law at the Northwestern University , in Chicago , dates almost as far back . In college , Lane seized what he most wanted in courses on Philosophy and Economics . " His was a mind of many facets and hospitable in its interest , " says his college and lifelong friend , Adolph C. Miller , " but his years at Berkeley were devoted mainly to the study of Philosophy and Government , and kindred subjects . He was a leading figure in the Political Science Club , and intent in his pursuit of philosophy . Often he could be seen walking back and forth in a room in the old Bacon library , set apart for the more serious-minded students , with some philosophical book in hand ; every line of his face expressing deep concentration , the occasional light in his eye clearly betraying the moment when he was feeling the joy of understanding . " In two years , not waiting for formal graduation , Lane was back in the world of public affairs that he had scarcely left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School work , and passed his Supreme Court examination in 1888 , in much less than the time usually allowed for the work . By the time he left the law school , " a full fledged , but not a flying attorney , " his desire for aggressive citizenship was fully formed . In fact , the whole active campaign , that was his life , was made by the light of early ideals , enlarged and reinterpreted as his climb to power brought under his survey wider horizons . The sketchiest summary of his early and late activities brings out the singleness of the central purpose moving through his life . His first fight , in 1888 , for Ballot Reform was made that the will of the people of the State might be honestly interpreted ; later , in Tacoma , Washington , he sided with his printers , against his interest as owner , in their fight to maintain union wages ; once more in San Francisco , he took , without a retaining fee , the case of the blackmailed householders whose titles were threatened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , cleared title to all of their small homes ; he joined , with his friend , Arthur McEwen , in an editorial campaign against the Southern Pacific , in the day of its tyrannous power over all the shippers of California ; later he drafted into the charter of San Francisco new provisions to improve the wages of all city employees ; as its young city and county attorney , he aggressively protected the city against street railway encroachments , successfully enforcing the law against infractions ; as Interstate Commerce Commissioner , he disentangled a network of injustices in the relations between shippers and railroads , exposed rebating and demurrage evils ; formulated new procedures in deflating , reorganizing , and zoning the business of all the express companies in the country ; as Secretary of the Interior , he confirmed to the people a fuller use of Federal Lands , and National Park Reserves , laid the foundation for the development , on public domain , of water powers , and the leasing of Government oil lands , and built the Government railroad in Alaska ; during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inexhaustible enthusiasm for cooperation , with definite plans for swift action , to focus National resources to meet war needs ; and finally , his last carefully elaborated plan  --  killed by a partisan Congress  --  was to place returned soldiers upon the land under conditions of hopeful and decent independence . These were some of the " glories " of activity into which he poured the resources of his energy and imagination . But no catalogue of the work or the salient mental characteristics of Franklin Lane gives a picture of the man , without taking into account his temperament , for that colored every hour of his life , and every act of his career . The things that he knew seized his imagination . Even when a middle-aged man he sang , like a troubadour , of the fertility of the soil ; he was stirred by the virtue and energy of what he saw and touched ; his heart leaped at the thought of the power of water ready to be unlocked for man 's use  --  most happy in that the thing that was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of oil ! " he cries , in the midst of a sober statistical letter , " Why ! that is as unthinkable as to lose faith in your hands . Oil , coal , electricity , what are these but multiplied and more adaptable , super-serviceable hands ? They may temporarily be unemployed , but the world ca n't go round without them . " A man who feels poetry in petroleum suffers from no wistful " desire of the moth for the star . " To his full sense of life the moth and the star are of one essential substance , parts of one glorious conquerable creation  --  and the moth just a fleck of star-dust , with silly wings . In truth , both then and throughout most of the days of his life he was completely oriented in this world , at home here , with his strong feet planted upon reality . He liked so many homely things , that his friendly glance responded to common sunlight without astigmatism . That his sympathies should have outrun his repugnances was of great practical moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both ends , for though he had to lose time by earning his own professional equipment , he lost little energy in friction . He wrote to a political aspirant for high office , in 1921 , " Pick a few enemies and pick them with discretion . Chiefly be FOR things . " To a man who was making a personal attack on an adversary of Lane 's , while in 1914 , as Secretary of the Interior , he was engrossed in establishing his " conservation-by-use " policy , in opposition to the older and narrower policy of conservation by withdrawal , Lane wrote , " I have never seen any good come by blurring an issue by personal conflict or antagonisms . ... I have no time to waste in fighting people ... to fight for a thing the best way is to show its advantages , and the need for it ... and my only solicitude is that the things I care for should not be held back by personal disputes . " ... This lesson he had learned more from his own temperament than from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of efficiency and also in his sense of humor . During this same hot conservation controversy he writes to an old friend , " I have no intention of saying anything in reply to Pinchot . He wrote me thirty pages to prove that I was a liar , and rather than read that again I will admit the fact . " This preoccupation with the main issue , in getting beneficial results was one thing that made him glad to acclaim and use the gifts of other men . Through his sympathies he could follow as well as lead , and he caught enthusiasms as well as kindled them . He believed in enthusiasm for itself , and because he saw in it one of the great potencies of life . In writing of D'Annunzio 's placing Italy beside the Allies , he rejoices in the beautiful spectacle of the spirit of a whole people " blown into flame by a poet-patriot . " But " the ideal , " he urges , " must be translated into the possible . Man can not live by bread alone  --  nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life expressed only one mood , for he paid , as men must , for intense buoyancy of temper by black despairs . " Damn that Irish temperament , anyway ! " he writes . " O God , that I had been made a stolid , phlegmatic , non-nervous , self-satisfied Britisher , instead of a wild cross between a crazy Irishman with dreams , desires , fancies  --  and a dour Scot with his conscience and his logical bitterness against himself  --  and his eternal drive ! " His exaggerations of hope and his moods of broken disappointment , his ever-springing faith in men , and in the possibility of just institutions , were more temperamental than logical . Moods of astonished grief , when men showed greed and instability , gave place to humorous and tolerant analysis of characters and events . Even his loyalty to his friends was subject to the slight magnetic deflections of a man of moods . He was true to them as the needle to the pole ; and with just the same piquing oscillations , before the needle comes to rest at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its capricious rhythms , the subtle movements of human intercourse he trusted himself to express to other men the natural man within his breast , without fear of misconstruction . He contrived to humanize , in parts , even his government reports . They brought him , year by year , touching letters of gratitude from weary political writers . The patient , logical Scot in him that said , " I am going to take this thing up bit by bit without trying to get a whole philosophy into the work , " anchored him to the heaviest tasks as if he were a true-born plodder , while the " wild Irishman " with dreams and desires lighted the way with gleams of Will-o ' - the- Wisp . The quicksilver in the veins of the patient Mercutio of railroad rates and demurrage charges lightened his work for himself and others . Just as in the five years when he served San Francisco , as City and County Attorney , he labored to such effect that not one of his hundreds of legal opinions was reversed by the Supreme Court of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so immersed that , as he says , " I even have to take the blamed stuff to bed with me . " Fourteen and sixteen hours at his official desk were not his longest hours , and sometimes he snatched a dinner of shredded biscuit from beside the day 's accumulations of papers upon his heaped-up desk . He laid upon himself the burden of labor , examining and cross-examining men for hours upon a single point of essential fact  --  quick to detect fraud and intolerant of humbug ,  - -  but infinitely patient with those who were merely dull , evading no drudgery , and , above all , never evading the dear pains of building-up and maintaining friendship .

" Blind Boss Buckley " was the Democratic dictator of San Francisco , and against his regime the initial efforts of the League were directed . It was a giant 's task , an impossible task , for a small group of newspaper writers and college undergraduates .

WIGMORE Oakland , February 27 , 1888 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  I am thinking of getting back in your part of the world myself , and this is what I especially wanted to write you about . I desire to see the world , to rub off some of my provincialisms , to broaden a little before I settle down to a prosaic existence . So , as I say , I want to live in Boston awhile and my only possibility of so doing is to get a position on some Boston paper , something that will afford me a living and allow some little time for social and literary life . However I do n't care much what the billet is . I can bring letters of recommendation from all the good newspaper men in San Francisco , both as to my ability at editorial work ( I have done considerable for the San Francisco NEWS LETTER and EXAMINER ) , and at all kinds of reportorial work . ... I passed the law examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a full-fledged  --  but not a flying , attorney . I have not determined definitely on going into law . ... Politically speaking we Mugwumps out here are happy . ... California has been opposed to Cleveland on every one of his great proposals ( civil service reform , silver question , tariff reform ) , and yet the Republicans must nominate a very strong man to get this State this year . The people admire old Grover 's strength so much , he is a positive man and an honest man , and when the people see these two exceptional virtues mixed happily in a candidate they grow to love and admire him out of the very idealism of their natures . But I must not bother the Boston attorney any longer . Write me all you know of opportunities there and believe me always your friend , FRANK K. LANE @# TO JOHN B. WIGMORE Oakland , May 9 , 1888 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  Of course I would have to stand my chances in getting a position . Newspaper men , perhaps more than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles rule in every good newspaper office to their fullest extent . When I wrote you , I was unsettled as to my plans for the coming year . My brother desired to spend a year or so in Boston and I thought of accompanying him . He has changed his plans and so have I. ... I am regularly on the Chronicle staff , chiefly writing sensational stories . I get a regular salary of twenty-five dollars a week besides some extras , and have as easy and pleasant a billet as there is on the paper , though editorial work would be more to my liking . These arrangements do not interfere , however , with my Boston plan , for sooner or later I shall breathe its intellectual atmosphere , that I may outgrow provincialism and become intellectual by force of habit rather than will . How long it will be before the wish can be gratified I can not tell . Probably next year . You see the law is not altogether after my taste . I feel it a waste of time to spend days quarreling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time as if I must be engaged in some life work which will make more directly for the good of my fellows . I feel the need which the world manifests for broader ideas in economics , politics , the philosophy of life , and all social questions .

I am unsettled , however , as to my permanent work . ... Oakland , September 20 , 1888 ... The copies of the Massachusetts law have been duly received and put to the best of use . On my motion our Young Men 's League appointed a Committee to draft a law for presentation to the Legislature .

Tell me , please , how you select your election officials in your large cities . Our mode of selection is really the weak point with us , for no matter how good a law we might procure , its enforcement would be left to " boss " tools  --  corruptionists of the worst class . ... Oakland , December 2 , 1888 ... Your letter breathes the sentiments of thousands of Republicans who voted against Cleveland . They are now " just a little " sorry that so good a man is beaten .

You surely ought to join us on the tariff fight , but then I wish you the best of fortune whatever your choice . Ferd and several others with myself are now organizing what will some day be a great state , if not a great national institution . We call it the Young Men 's Democratic League Footnote : This plan seems to have been to enlarge the influence of the League mentioned in a former letter.  --  it is to be made up of young men from twenty-one to forty-five ; its scope  --  national politics , election of President and Congressmen , and its immediate purpose to inform the people on the tariff question . When our Constitution is published you shall have one . We expect to organize branches all over the State and in a year or two will be strong in the thousands .

D. " instead of " J , F. "  --  in another instance , his name was printed a little below the title of the office , because of the narrowness of the ticket . If these ballots were counted for him he thinks he would have won . ... Fourteen years later , when the electoral count was made of Franklin K.

The Committee of the Senate decided without any debate on the bill to report adversely to it . I got them to reconsider their vote , and we will have a hearing at any rate before the bill is killed .

There is justification here for a social-economic revolution and it will come , too , if things are not bettered . If you have a stray thought let me know it and soon . Your friend , F. K. L. Lane 's desire for stimulating companionship in New York was quickly gratified . A spontaneous association of friendships , based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind , sprang up among a little group of men of very diverse types . All were strangers in New York with no immediate home ties . " Women played no part in our lives , " one of them recalls . " We came together to discuss plays , poetry , politics , anything and everything  --  the great actors , comic operas , the songs of the streets , science , politics . " John Crawford Burns , Lane , Brydon Lamb , Curt Pfeiffer formed the nucleus of what spread out irregularly into larger groupings . John Crawford Burns , who was slightly older than the rest , a purist , and something of a " dour Scot , " was a man of conservative and cultivated tastes and the dean of the group . He was in a business house that imported linens , and lived in a " glorious room with two outside windows , and ample seating capacity , " so the friends often met there and learned something of Gothic architecture and of the abominations of slang , in spite of themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb , " also of Scotch descent , but born in America , a delightful combination of strength , sweetness and light . The simple grace of his manner , his unhurried speech , his urbanity , captivated us all . We loved him for what he was , and we considered him our arbiter elegantiarum " Of Lane at that period the same friend writes , " I remember a fine , stocky , muscular presence with a striking head . A massive , commanding man , he was , a persuasive and compelling leader . " But none of the men had any sense of anything but complete friendly , boyish equality . " Lane was , " Pfeiffer says , " interested in human beings , not problems , excepting as their solution might be made serviceable to the needs of individuals . He had great tolerance for the most unusual opinions . I do n't think Lane ever had much interest in the dogmas of science , religion , or philosophy ; he lived by the spirit of them , that can not be expressed in formulae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , for colors and sounds , and for moral beauty , and blended with it the statesman 's observant awareness of conditions in the world of affairs . " At the beginning of their friendship , in 1889 , Curt Pfeiffer himself was only nineteen years old , a youth whose family had come from Holland and Germany . He appeared in the boarding-house on 32nd near Broadway , where Burns lived , fresh from three months at the Paris Exposition , a vacation that had followed a course of scientific study at Zurich , Switzerland . The wonders of Paris , a-glitter with the blaze of undreamed-of electrical beauty , and the greater wonder of the scientific discoveries and speculations , of the eighties , as taught at the University of Zurich , gave the young traveler an instant place among the others . Because of his love for exact statement and his scientific approach in discussion , young as he was , he contributed something very real to the group whose chief preoccupation  --  aside from the joy of living-was with art , government , and literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to the discoverer , he brought it in and insisted on their reading parts of it together . Browning , Darwin , the Vedic Hymns , Stevenson , Taine , Buckle , Spencer , Kipling , Sir Henry Maine , on primitive law , and Emerson ! The relation of the men was almost impersonal in the fervor of their explorations into life . Differences of blood and tradition were not only easily bridged but welcomed , because they assured , to the group as a whole , sharper angles of mental refraction  --  breaking the ray of truth they sought into more of its component colors . Pfeiffer recalls that " one Saturday night , under the influence of reading from the Vedic Hymns , and a talk on astronomy , we went up on the roof of our boarding-place , and observed a complete revolution of the starry heavens , from dusk to dawn . We drifted into talk , ... and when we finally descended to our beds on Sunday morning , we found ourselves drenched to the skin from the drizzling dew . We never forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His political interests brought Lane into the Reform Club where Progress and Poverty , Henry George 's new book , was the center for discussion upon the whole problem of the distribution of taxation . Lane and Henry George established a cordial friendship . John Crawford Burns says that in 1889 " Lane 's chief hero was Cleveland , and his oracle Godkin , of the EVENING POST "  --  later , the NATION . " When I knew him in New York he represented a San Francisco newspaper , the CHRONICLE , I think , as correspondent . He was not whole-heartedly in sympathy with his proprietor , nor indeed with the sensational aspect of journalism , and he always scoffed at the idea of newspaper writers constituting a modern priesthood . He laughingly justified his association with the CHRONICLE by saying he gave tone to it . For this and other services , he received , I think , two thousand dollars a year , which even thirty years ago did not admit of luxury and riotous living . " Lane 's whole stay in New York was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that he shared with disinterested minds made of this period the seed-bed for future intellectual growth . In 1891 , in spite of the delights of personal friendships , in New York , Lane grew increasingly dissatisfied with the limitations of newspaper corresponding . He wanted a paper of his own , in which he could express without reserve the ideals of social and political betterment with which his mind was teeming . In this mood , the first acclaim of the rapid growth of the pioneer towns of the far Northwest reached him . He saw in this his opportunity , and acted quickly and decisively . He gathered together his own savings , borrowed from his friend , Sidney Mezes , a few more thousand dollars and went to Tacoma , Washington , to buy the Tacoma Evening News . As soon as the transfer was well made , Lane threw himself enthusiastically into the politics of the new town , already suffering from boss rule . By his editorials he succeeded in stirring up the City Hall , and drove into Alaskan exile the Chief of Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become immensely rich in Alaska while Lane 's paper was running into bankruptcy in Tacoma . But Lane 's misadventure was not wholly due to his civic virtue . He had " bought in " at just the moment when the instruments were tuning up for the prelude to the great panic crash of 1893 . Tacoma , and the whole Northwest , had been mainly developed by casual investments of speculative Eastern capital , and this capital , sensitive to change , was being withdrawn to meet home needs . Investors , to protect real interests , were willing to sacrifice their " little Western flyers , " at almost any discount . As the terminal of the new Northern Pacific Railroad , Tacoma  - -  lying on the bluffs overlooking the great inland sea of Puget Sound , guardianed by the vastness of its mountain  --  was backed by forests whose wealth could scarcely be exaggerated , even by promoter 's advertisements . She was noisily proclaimed to be the " Gateway to the Orient , " but trade was not yet firmly established with the Orient , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the capital to develop it was slowly ebbing Eastward ? No paper without heavy capitalization , could have sustained a policy of political reform , when , in the picturesque vernacular of the time and place , " the bottom had dropped out of the town . " A rival newspaper , the LEDGER , in order to retrench , began a war on the Printers ' Union , to break wages . Lane repudiated the effort made to " rat " his paper and to force the Union out . He sustained his men in their fight to keep the Union rate , and lent them his presses to carry on their propaganda . In after years he said , " As to my labor record , it is a consistent one of thirty years length , ever since I stood by the Union in Tacoma , and went broke . " Again he wrote to an acquaintance , " I often think of the old days in Tacoma . We were a fighting bunch , and I think most of us are fighting for the same things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less graft in affairs , and a chance for a man to rise by ability and not by pull alone . " In April , 1893 , Lane had married Anne Wintermute  --  he needed all he could find of cheer in those depressing days . The whole town was beaten to its knees by loss and fore-closure . Lane was struggling to hold together his paper , and save his friend 's investment and his own little stake . The one bright interlude of that time for him lay in reading , and in his new friendships . He loved to chant aloud to a group of stranded young fellows gathered in his rooms , in his gay trumpeting way , brave passages from the Barrack-Room Ballads , of Kipling , that were lifting the spirits of the English-speaking world with their freshness and daring . Stevenson , too , with his polished optimism delighted Lane . " I can remember , " says one of the group , " just how I heard him read aloud the last words from Stevenson 's essay , Aes Triplex , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were so miserable ! ' " :  --  " All who have meant good work with their whole hearts , have done good work , although they may die before they have the time to sign it . ... Does not life go down with a better grace , foaming in full body over a precipice , than miserably straggling to an end in sandy deltas ? When the Greeks made their fine saying that those whom the Gods love die young , I can not help believing they had this sort of death also in their eye . For surely , at whatever age it overtake the man , this is to die young . Death has not been suffered to take so much as an illusion from his heart . In the hot-fit of life , a-tip-toe on the highest point of being , he passes at a bound on to the other side . The noise of the mallet and chisel is scarcely quenched , the trumpets are hardly done blowing , when , trailing with him clouds of glory , this happy-starred , full-blooded spirit shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good work he had meant with his whole heart , Lane turned from the bankruptcy of his paper , sold at auction , to write to his friend of new adventures . @# To John H.

He also formed a law partnership with his brother , George W. Lane , under the firm name of Lane and Lane . In 1895 a curious case , estimated as involving about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young attorneys . The Star , of San Francisco , described the issue at stake by saying , " One Jose Noe and four alleged grand-children of Jose Noe appear , who pretend that they can show a clear title to an undivided one-half interest in nearly forty-five hundred acres within the city , on which land reside some five thousand or more owners , mostly men of small means . " Upon investigation Lane and his brother became convinced that the suit had been instituted as a blackmailing scheme , in an attempt to force the owners to pay for quit-claim deeds ; they took and energetically fought the case for the defendants , without asking for a retainer . Their clients formed themselves into what they called the San Miguel Defense Association . In a year the title of the householders to their little homes was established beyond peradventure . With the warmth of Latin gratitude this service was remembered . In 1898 when Lane ran for his first political office , as City and County Attorney , the San Miguel Defense Association revived its energies , formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulars about Franklin K. Lane , " who nobly fought for us . ... It is now our turn to stand by him and see that he is elected by a very large majority . " Their proclamation ended with the appeal , " Vote for Franklin K. Lane , the Foe to Blackmailers . " As Lane 's plurality in this first election was eight hundred and thirty-two votes , there is little doubt that his grateful clients played a real part in that success . The Tacoma printers had also sent a testimonial , which was widely distributed in the campaign , as to Lane 's friendship to labor , saying that they , in gratitude , had made him an honorary member of their Typographical Union . The campaign was made on the rights of the plain people , for its chief issue . In the letter that follows , Lane , in 1913 , tells of his formal entry into politics , in 1898. @# To P. T.

I helped to draft the charter , and as it had to be submitted to the people for ratification , I stumped the city for it . Later , when the first election was held under it , my friends on the charter committee insisted that I should accept the Democratic nomination for City Attorney .

I was nominated by the Democratic party by an independent movement and was elected ; later re-elected , and elected for a third term . After an unsuccessful candidacy for the governorship , I was appointed a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission by President Roosevelt . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To John H. Wigmore San Francisco , November 14 , 1898 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  This is a formal note of acknowledgment of the service rendered me in the campaign , which has just closed successfully . There were only three Democrats elected on the general ticket , the Mayor , Assessor , and myself . I ran four thousand five hundred votes ahead of my ticket . It was a splendid tribute to worth ! I never before realized how discriminating the American public is . A man who scoffs at Democratic institutions must be a tyrant at heart , or a defeated candidate . I tell you the people know a good man when they see one . My opponent was the present Attorney General of the State , W. F. Fitzgerald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Republican ticket . He has been steadily in office for thirty years , in Mississippi , Arizona , and California , and this is his first defeat ; and I sincerely regret that I had to take a fall out of such a gentleman . Now , the perplexing problem arises as to how long I shall hold office . The term is for two years . The new charter comes up before the coming Legislature for approval in January , and that instrument provides for another election next fall , to fill all City and County offices . ... I do n't want to stay in politics , two years in the office will be long enough for me . I hope that I shall make a creditable record . I can foresee that strong pressure will be brought to bear upon me to act with the Examiner in making things disagreeable for the corporations , and I will have no easy task in gaining the approval of my own party , and of my conscience and judgment at the same time . Let me thank you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yours sincerely , FRANKLIN K. LANE The City Charter that Lane had helped to draft , with its many new provisions , never before adjudicated , made his first term as City and County Attorney one requiring an especial amount of laborious legal study . To meet the pressing need , Lane organized his corps of assistants to include several men of marked legal ability and the industry that the task demanded , appointing his brother , George W. Lane , as his first assistant . It was partly due to the good team-work of the office that his opinions rendered in four years were as " numerous as those heretofore rendered by the department in about sixteen years , " and that during one of the years of his incumbency " snot a dollar of damages was obtained against the city . " Illustration with caption : FRANKLIN K. LANE AS CITY AND COUNTY ATTORNEY @# To John H. Wigmore San Francisco , September 25 , 1899 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  ... As an evidence of what I am doing I sent you a brief three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just filed on the question of county officers holding over under the Charter , a third on the new primary law which is a grand thing if we can make it stick , and a fourth on the taxation of bonds of quasi-public corporations , and a fifth on the taxation of National Bank stock . I have hardly seen my baby for six weeks ; have been at the office from nine A.M. to eleven P.M. regularly . And now that I am nearly dead a new campaign is on and I must run again . And , of course , I have enemies now which I had n't last year . Thank you once again for so kindly remembering me . Yours sincerely , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# Lane 's first child , a son , was born in the spring of 1898 . He is the " Ned " of the letters  --  Franklin K. Lane , Jr . Lane 's attitude toward children is shown in many of his letters .

Wigmore San Francisco , November 10 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  This is to be a mere bulletin . I am elected once again  --  10,500 majority , the largest received by any candidate . You expected me to run for Mayor I know . Well , it was offered me  --  the nomination , I mean  --  and all my campaign expenses promised . But I could n't accept , having told the Labor Union people that I was a candidate for City Attorney and not for Mayor . This Labor Union Party is a new one , the outgrowth of the recent strike . They have elected their Mayor , a musician named Schmitz , a decent , conservative young man , who will surprise the decent moneyed people and anger the laboring people with his conservatism . Footnote : Lane lived to smile at his too charitable characterization of this San Francisco Mayor . I did n't have one single word of praise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that I was a candidate . It was jolly good therefore to win as I did . And my congratulations to you , my honored friend , Dean Wigmore . Next year I am to publish my Opinions , a copy of which , of course , will go to you , but not by virtue of your office , old man . You are arriving , of course , but there is something better in store . A Federal Judgeship is the thing for you ; and when I get into the Cabinet you shall have it . But do n't wait till then . I 'm gray and bald now and my boy patronizes me . So do n't wait , but get your lines out , and one of these days you 'll make it . Where next I shall land I do n't know , probably in a law office , praying for clients . ... Always yours , F. K. L. Lane 's first majority in 1898 of 832 votes was increased to 10,500 in 1899 , when he was re-elected ; and two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of his opinions , as City Attorney , were collected and bound in a volume , as none of them had been reversed by the Supreme Court of the State . He took much pleasure in a dinner club that he helped to form . The members were University professors , lawyers , newspaper men , and a few business men . " But , " says one of them , " in spirit they were poets , philosophers and prophets . They were aware that their solutions of problems vexing to the brains of other men , would be Utopian , but as they were not willing to be classed with ordinary Utopians they named their club Amaurot , after the capital of Utopia , thus signifying that while they dwelt in Utopia , they were not subject to it but were lords of it  --  the teachers of its wisdom and the makers of its laws . " His home life absorbed much of his leisure . He and his family had moved into a modest house on Gough Street , in San Francisco , with a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills from the upstairs living-room window  --  for no house was a home to Lane that had no view  --  and in the back-yard , among its red geraniums and cosmos bushes , he played Treasure Island and Wild West with his boy . In the summer of 1902 , Lane was nominated as the Democratic and Non-Partisan candidate for Governor of California . At the Democratic Convention at Sacramento , an onlooker described the excitement among the delegates before a selection was made , " Throughout the night until late afternoon of the second day , without any clear solution of the problem , came the roll-call of the counties , then a wild stampede for the young City and County Attorney of San Francisco , who was borne to the platform . ... " It was Franklin K. Lane who stood a goodly and confident figure , waving a palm-leaf fan for quiet . He said :  --  " ' I was in the rear of the hall when Governor Budd made his speech and voiced the call of the party for a winner , and , in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " This note of joyous truculence , with the little out-thrust of the underlip , brought , as so often before and since , laughter and applause . A hot and spirited campaign followed . California is naturally Republican , and Lane had many times challenged and attacked the great powers of the State . He made as his chief issues , Irrigation , Prison Reform , and a fairer share in the world 's goods for all the people . He traveled far and fast , often speaking six times in a day , at different places , and sometimes riding a hundred and fifty miles in twenty-four hours , over the rough roads of remote counties . While campaigning he outlined his notion of public service in this way , " No man should have a political office because he wants a job . A public office is not a job , it is an opportunity to do something for the public . Once in office it remains for him to prove that the opportunity was not wasted . ... " And again he said ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little that I have seen in political life , as this , that while it is a game in which men can be mean , contemptible and dastardly , it is a game also that brings out the finer , better , and nobler qualities . I know why some men are in politics to their own financial loss . Because they find it is a great big man 's game , which calls for men to fight it , and they want to stand beside their fellows and do battle . " In regretting that he could not attend a Democratic meeting , at Richmond , California , he sent this letter ,  - -  @# TO LYMAN NAUGLE MY DEAR MR . NAUGLE ,  --  ... The cause of Democracy is being given more sincere and thoughtful interest this campaign than for many years . One of its cardinal principles is that the individual is more important to the State than mere property , and that the welfare of the majority of our citizens must always be paramount and their rights prevail , no matter what the weight of influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personal worth which make a State great both politically and industrially , and in my estimation they are to be found in largest proportions in the Democratic party . For these reasons I believe there will be a very large change in the vote of this State in our coming election . Reports have reached me from many parts of the State , and I am entirely satisfied that we shall win this fight provided that we do our full share of earnest work , if that be lacking we do n't deserve it . ... Yours for honest victory , FRANKLIN K. LANE At first Hearst 's powerful paper , the San Francisco Examiner , took a negative tone toward Lane 's candidacy but soon became dangerously , if covertly , antagonistic . Of Hearst 's methods of attack Lane wrote , in detail , on July 3 , 1912 , to Governor Woodrow Wilson , then Democratic nominee for the Presidency . After enumerating one specific count after another against the Examiner Lane said :  --  " When a boy putting myself through college I was business manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published extracts from this paper and credited them to me , and on the morning of election day sent a special train throughout the whole of Northern California containing an issue of his paper , appealing to the saloon-keepers and wine-growers for my defeat . " ... No editorial word of his disfavor appeared , but in every news article there was in the headline a cunning turn or twist , calculated to arouse prejudice against me . I notice in this morning 's issue of the American the same policy is being pursued regarding you . " Now the great mistake I made was in not boldly telling the public just what I knew . ... I felt that it was a personal matter with which the public was not concerned , but I know now , as I have gotten older and seen more of politics , that it was a public matter of the first importance , as to which the public should have had knowledge . " Later when he Hearst budded as a candidate for President , in 1904 , he sought an interview with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy that had been pursued . Our interview closed with this dialogue :  --  " ' Mr. Lane , if you ever wish anything that I can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done . ' " " To which I responded , ' Mr. Hearst , if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put that telegram down as a forgery . ' " In a State like California , one of whose chief industries was the growing of wine-grapes , and where the Examiner was the farmer 's paper , at least one phase of the attack upon Lane bore heavy fruit . Upon election day the count between Lane and Dr. George Pardee , the Republican candidate , was found to be close . In the end several thousand votes , unmistakably intended for Lane , were thrown out upon technicalities . Lane was defeated , and Dr. Pardee took office . It was a bitter blow . The night when the final bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son , of four , to him , leaning down he put his arm around the boy very gravely and tenderly , and said , " Ned , it is n't my little son , it is Dr. Pardee 's little boy that is going to have that white pony . " The boy caught the emotion in his father 's voice , and said cheerily , " O , that 's all right , Dad . That 's all right . " Lane found that in spite of the loss of the Governorship his circle of personal contacts had been greatly widened by his campaign . He had come to know , and be known by , the men most prominent in California public affairs and he had made , and confirmed , many friendships with men who had given themselves whole-heartedly to his advancement . Of these friendships he wrote , in 1920 , to his friend Timothy Spellacy , " Eighteen years I have known you and never a word or act have I heard of , or seen , that did not make me feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your acquaintance , friendship , affection . ... When I get mad , as I do sometimes , over something that the Irish do , I always am tempted to a hard generalization that I am compelled to modify because of you and Mike and Dan O'Neill , in San Francisco  --  and a few more of the Great Irish . " Lane 's second child , Nancy , was born January 4 , 1903 . Early in that year Lane was given the complimentary vote of his party in the California Legislature for United States Senator . He was chosen in April to go to Washington to argue the case of the need of the City of San Francisco for a pure water supply from the Hetch-Hetchy Valley , an unused part of the Yosemite Park . A curious opposition to this measure had been worked up in the East by a small group of well-intentioned nature lovers who did not , perhaps , realize that this was one of many thousand valleys in the Sierras , and one not , in any sense , unique in its beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marsh , dreaded even by hunters because of the " bad-going " into a large lake-reservoir to feed the city of San Francisco . This was the first of Lane 's fights to assure to man the use of neglected resources , and at the same time , by great care , to protect natural beauty for his delight . While in Washington on this errand , he met President Roosevelt several times . Their informal talks served to increase Lane 's strong liking for the vigorous man of action , then at the height of his powers . To his friend he writes of all this . @# To John H. Wigmore San Francisco , May 9,1903 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  My trip East was a great success . After leaving you I stayed three or four days in Washington , where I found the Department of the Interior pretty well stacked against me ; I , however , succeeded in having a day fixed upon which an argument would be listened to , and after this victory went to New York , where I met many old friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington I had several days of argument before the Department , saw the President Roosevelt twice and lunched with him , and then went South ; was invited by the Legislature of Texas to speak before them , which I did with much satisfaction , especially as there were but two Republicans in both houses . I stopped with my old friend Mezes , in Austin , who is the dean of the University , ... and easily the most influential man socially , politically , and educationally in the institution . ... I am having an extremely disagreeable time . The Democrats here insist upon my running for Mayor , urging it as a duty which I owe to the party , because they say I am the only man who can be elected ; and as a duty to the city , because they say that the scoundrels who are now in office will continue , and worse ones come in , unless we can elect some clean Democrat . I urge everything against the thing , that comes to my mind , including my poverty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my personal aversion to the office of Mayor , the inability of any one to please the people of San Francisco as Mayor , the conspiracy of the newspapers that exists against a government that is not controlled by them , and the fact that to insist upon my taking this office would be an act of political murder on the part of my friends . ... Yours as always , FRANKLIN K. LANE Heavy and continued pressure , through the spring and summer , was brought , by his party , to bear upon Lane to accept the nomination for Mayor of San Francisco . His letters show his reluctance and distress . The appeal was made personal , with reminders of sacrifices made for him . He at last agreed to run . His judgment of the situation was fully confirmed in the final event . His defeat was unequivocal . San Francisco had no idea of accepting a Democratic mayor with a leaning toward reform . Lane analysed the political situation in this letter :  - -  @# To John H. Wigmore San Francisco , January 26 , 1904 MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mayor will be , it is of course impossible to say . Its immediate effect has been to throw me into the active practice of law , and thus far I have not starved . It will , of course , not lead to my retirement from politics , but it will postpone no doubt , the realization of some ambitions . I think I wrote you just what my state of mind was previous to the nomination . I did not wish to make the fight , did everything that was in my power to avoid the nomination , and even went so far as to hold up the convention in a formal letter which I addressed to it , telling them that I did not wish to be Mayor of San Francisco and begging them to get some one else . The fight was along class lines entirely ; the employers on one side and the wage earners on the other . The Republican nominee represented the employers , the Union Labor nominee , the wage earners . I stood for good government , and in the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid old fight in which every interest that was vicious , violent , or corrupt was solidly against me . And while I did not win the election , I lost nothing in prestige by the defeat , save among politicians who are always looking for availability . It was not , in the nature of things , up to me to run for Mayor , but my people all believed that I was assured of election and felt that I was the only man who could possibly be elected . I acted out of a sense of loyalty to my party and a desire to do something to rid the city of its present cursed administration . However , it may in the end be a very fortunate thing , for I know no career more worthless than that of a perpetual office-seeker . I received a letter from a friend in New York yesterday telling me that Senator Hill Footnote : In campaigning New York for Cleveland , Lane had met David B. Hill. had told him that the New York delegation would cast its vote for me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded me as the most available man to nominate ; but , of course , I sent back word that that was not to be considered . I should judge from the EXAMINER here , that Hearst was making a very strong fight for a delegation from Illinois . His boom seems to me to be increasing . That it is possible for such a man to receive the nomination , is too humiliating to be thought of . ... Very sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE The day after his defeat Lane had written to thank a generous friend :  - -  @# TO WILLIAM R. WHEELER San Francisco , Wednesday November , 1908 MY DEAR WILL ,  --  I ca n't go to the country without saying to you once more that your self-sacrifice and manliness throughout this campaign have endeared you to me to a degree that words can not convey . I had hoped the last day or two that I would be able to make your critics ashamed to look you in the face , and that they would in time come pleading to you for recognition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a man 's part , and set a standard in friendship and loyalty which my boy shall be taught to strive for . I earnestly hope that your business relations will not be disturbed by this trouble into which I got you . Had I been out of it Crocker could n't have won . My vote would largely have gone for Schmitz . Give my love to Mrs. Wheeler and believe me , always your friend , FRANKLIN K. LANE Wheeler , himself a Republican , belonged , at the time , to a firm of irreconcilable Republicans , who had expressed sharp disapproval of his activity in Lane 's behalf . Out of office and back to the practise of the law , Lane soon built his private practise on a firmer basis than before . His close identification with the Democratic Party was not impaired , but the frequent demands for attendance at public conventions and meetings he could not leave his practise to accept . In declining one of these invitations he replied :  - -  @# TO ORVA G. WILLIAMS IROQUOIS CLUB , CHICAGO , ILLINOIS San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that we of the West look to you who are closer to the center of things for leadership . ... This means only that we must be true to the principles that make us Democrats . ... The law must not be severe or lenient with any man simply because he is rich nor because he is poor . It must not become the tool of class antagonism for either the persecution of the well-to-do or for the repression of the masses of the people . ... We must resist the base opportunism which would abandon our strong position of devotion to these fundamental principles of good government for the sake of gaining temporary strength from some passing passion of the hour . To identify our party with an idea which springs from class distrust or class hatred is to gain temporary stimulation at the expense of permanent weakness . If we are to heed the voice which bids us cease to be Democrats in order that we may win , we shall find that we have lost not only the victory of being true , but also the victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case we are true . ... Our creed is simple and clear , but it can not be recited by those who would make our organization an annex to the Republican party by catering to that conservatism which seeks only to bring greater benefit to the already wealthy , nor by those who would make it an annex to the Socialist party by joining in every attack , no matter how unjust , upon the wealthy . Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To the Iroquois Club of Los Angeles on the same day he wrote ,  --  " It becomes us to consider well the meaning of the signs of the times . Miracles may not be worked with these waves of prosperity . It is in no man 's power to say ' Peace , be still ' and quiet the troubled sea of panic . But we may make sure that men of steady nerve , of clear head and highest purpose are at the helm . I expect to see the time when the Democratic party will , by fixed adherence to a well-defined course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our people , not for a single election but for a long series of elections , and if we begin now with this end in view we certainly will be prepared for whatever may happen  --  victory or defeat ; and in both alike we will be proud of our party and give a guarantee for the future . " While campaigning California for Governor , in 1902 , Isadore B. Dockweiler ran on Lane 's ticket , for the office of Lieutenant Governor , and Dockweiler still looked to him for counsel . @# TO ISADORE B. DOCKWEILER San Francisco , April 16 , 1904 MY DEAR DOCKWEILER ,  --  You ask in your favor of the 14th whether California will send a delegation to St. Louis pledged to Mr. Hearst and if this program has been agreed upon , as is the report in Los Angeles . I can not tell what the Democrats of California will do , but I know what they should do . A delegation should go from this state that is free , unowned , unpledged , made up of men whose prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not need to bind with pledges . To pledge the delegation is to make the delegates mere pawns , puppets , counters , coins to trade with ,  --  so much political wampum . The object in holding a national convention is not to please the vanity nor gratify the ambition of any individual , but to select a national standard bearer who will proudly lead the party in the campaign and be a credit to the party and an honor to the nation , if elected . Surely the Democracy of California can select candidates who can be depended upon to be guided by these considerations . To tie the delegates hand and foot , toss them into a bag , and sling them over the shoulder of one man to barter as he may please , is not consistent with my notion of the dignity of their position , nor does it appeal to me as the most certain manner of making them effective in enlarging and emphasizing the power of the state . ... As to your suggestion of a program to deliver this state to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a party to it , never have been , and never will be . ... The Democrats of California ... will do much for the sake of harmony so long as party welfare and public good are not sacrificed ; but they must be permitted to make their own program irrespective of the personal alliances , affiliations , or ambitions of politicians . Personally , I am not in active political life . My views upon party questions I do not attempt to impose upon my party , yet I know of no reason why I should hesitate to give them expression . I can not but believe that if many a man were more indifferent to his future , he would be more certain to have a future . There is one reason which to my mind should forbid my active direction of any organized movement against Mr. Hearst , namely the attitude of his paper during my recent campaign for the governorship . I do not wish it to be said or thought that I am seeking to use our party for purposes of personal retaliation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign I am persuaded it does not affect my judgment that it is the part of wisdom to send an unpledged delegation to the national convention . The Democrats of California should determine with calmness and without passion what course will be most likely to prove a matter of pride to themselves , their state , and the nation , and in that sober judgment act fearlessly . Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# The Pacific Coast , in 1904 , still suffered from transportation problems of great complexity . The railroads , whose terminals were here , were few and extraordinarily powerful and had , heretofore , controlled rail traffic , to a large extent , in their own interest . They wanted no regulation or interference from the Interstate Commerce Commission and no Pacific Coast representative on that Commission . The fruit , wheat , and lumber producers of the Western Coast , on the other hand , felt the need of a strong representative to protect their interests against the railroads , and to stabilize freight rates . Lane 's record for independence of sinister control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shippers for this position . Benjamin Ide Wheeler , President of the University of California , was a friend of Lane 's and also a friend of President Roosevelt 's . While in the East , in the spring of 1904 , Wheeler had a talk with Roosevelt , about Lane 's qualifications for the Interstate Commerce appointment . He told Roosevelt why the producers in California needed a man that they could trust to be fair to their interests on the Commission . Roosevelt heartily concurred , and promised to name Lane for the next vacancy . When the vacancy occurred , however , just after an overwhelming Republican victory , Roosevelt impulsively gave the appointment to an old friend  --  Senator Cockrill of Missouri , a Democrat . Wheeler at once telegraphed the President reminding him of the oversight , and to this Roosevelt telegraphed this reply :  --  " Am exceedingly sorry , had totally forgotten my promise about Lane and have nothing to say excepting that I had totally forgotten it when Senator Cockrill was offered the position . I can only say now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great talents and experience when the chance occurs . Of course when I made the promise about Lane the idea of getting Cockrill for the position could not be in any one 's head . This does not excuse me for breaking the promise , which I should never have done , and of course , if I had remembered it I should not have offered the position to Cockrill . I am very sorry . But as fortunately I have another term , I shall make ample amends to Lane later . " In September , 1905 , while matters were in this position , Lane went to Mexico , as legal adviser for a western rubber company . In October , Roosevelt announced his intention to place Lane on the Interstate Commerce Commission , to fill the annual vacancy that occurred in December . The announcement caused much newspaper comment , especially in the more partisan Republican press , as the coming vacancy would leave two Republicans and two Democrats on the Commission . When Lane reached the United States he wrote :  - -  @# TO EDWARD B. WHITNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have just returned from a two months ' trip through Mexico , from the Rio Grande to Guatemala , and from the Gulf to the Pacific , and know nothing whatever concerning the Interstate Commerce Commissionership , save what I have seen in the papers since my return . ... I have not put myself in the position of soliciting , either directly or indirectly , this appointment ; I have never even stimulated to a slight degree the activity ... of my friends on my behalf . There is some misgiving in my own mind as to whether acceptance of the position would be of benefit to me either politically , or otherwise . I have no doubt the nomination for Governor can be mine next year without effort , and what the outcome of an election would be in 1906 , even in a Republican State , is not now to be prophesied , in view of the somersaults in Ohio and Pennsylvania of a week ago . Of course , ... it is a great opportunity to prove or disprove the capacity of this government to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does look to me as if the problem of our generation is to be the discovery of some effective method by which the artificial persons whom we have created by law can be taught that they are not the creators , the owners , and the rightful managers of the government . The real greatness of the President 's policy , to my notion , is that he has determined to prove to the railroads that they have not the whole works , and the policy that they have followed is as short-sighted as it can be . It will lead , if pursued as it has been begun , to the wildest kind of a craze for government ownership of everything . Just as you people in New York City were forced , by the delinquency and corruption of the gas combine , to undertake the organization of a municipal ownership movement , so it may be that the same qualities in the railroads will create precisely the same spirit throughout the country . I appreciate thoroughly your position in New York . ... Hearst knows public sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a danger in the United States , I am afraid , for many years to come . He has great capacity for disorganization of any movement that is not his own , and an equal capacity for organization of any movement that is his personal property . He feels with the people , but he has no conscience . ... He is willing to do whatever for the minute the people may want done and give them what they cry for , unrestrained by sense of justice , or of ultimate effect . He is the great American Pander . Reverting again to the Interstate Commerce Commissionership , I think the railroads here are determined that no Pacific Coast man shall be appointed . That has been the policy of the Southern Pacific since the creation of the Commission . ... One of the amusing reports that has come to me is that the railroad feels friendly toward me . I think probably the extent of their friendliness is in acknowledging that I am not a blackmailer . They know that I would not hold them up , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . In the various campaigns that I have made , it has never been suggested that the railroads had any more influence with me than they ought to have , or that anybody else had , and in my fight for the Governorship they did not contribute so much as a single postcard , nor did an individual railroad man contribute a dollar to the campaign fund . I say this because I heard yesterday that word had gone to the President that I was something of a railroad man , which is about the most amusing thing that I have heard for sometime . The charge never was made in any of my five campaigns , and certainly is made only for foreign consumption , end not for home consumption . Do not in any way put yourself out regarding this matter . I am satisfied that the President will do just what he wants to do and just what he thinks right , without much respect to what anybody says to him , and I do n't want to bring pressure to bear upon him ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have friends who think well of me . I am very appreciative of your offer and efforts , and hope that , whether I am given this position or not , I shall before very long have the opportunity of seeing you in New York . Very sincerely , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO HON. THEODORE ROOSEVELT THE WHITE HOUSE San Francisco , December 9 , 1905 MY DEAR MR . PRESIDENT ,  --  I have not written you before because of my expectation that I would see you soon , but as there now seems some doubt as to immediate confirmation I will not longer delay expressing the deep gratification which the nomination gave me . You gave the one answer I could have wished to the whispered charge that I was bound by obligation of some sort to the railroads  --  a charge never made in any form here , not even in the hottest of my five campaigns . My honor stood pledged to you  --  by the very fact of my willingness to accept the post  --  that I was free , independent , self-owned , capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my confirmation , it has been suggested that it was the customary and expected thing for me to go to Washington and help in the fight . This I feel I should not do and have so written to Senator Perkins and others . I do not wish to appear indifferent in the slightest degree to the honor you have done me , or to the office itself , but I feel that you will appreciate without my setting them forth on paper the many reasons which hold me here . This is no time for an Interstate Commerce Commissioner to be on his knees before a United States Senator or to be thought to be in that position . Very respectfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Benjamin Ide Wheeler President , University of California San Francisco , December 15 , 1905 MY DEAR MR . WHEELER ,  --  I enclose copy of a letter sent this morning to Mr. Smythe of San Diego , who is temporarily with Senator Newlands in Washington . I wanted to tell you last night that I had written to the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and telling him that I did not think it was the right thing for me to go to Washington under present circumstances . He may have a different notion in this respect , and of course I should be guided by his judgment ... I have no doubt that many of the Senators would be quite willing to let the President have the law if they could have the Commission ... Personally I should be most pleased to meet these critical gentlemen of the Senate and give them a very full account of my eventful career . But the fact that I am a Democrat could not be disproved by my presence in Washington , and I am not likely to apologize for what one of my kindly Republican critics calls " this error of his boyhood . " I am concerned in this matter because I do not wish to cause the President any embarrassment . He is fighting for far larger things than this appointment represents . He knows his own game , and I am quite willing to stand on a side line and see him play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center if I am needed . I must apologize for troubling you with this matter , but I do not wish you to regard me as indifferent or unappreciative . And if you think that I am too far up in the clouds I want you frankly to tell me so . Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To William E. Smythe San Francisco , December 15,1905 MY DEAR MR . SMYTHE ,  --  I have been out of town for a few days , else I would have acknowledged your kind letter of congratulation sooner . I sent a note the other day to our friend Senator Newlands in recognition of the effort he has been making to secure action upon my appointment , and I certainly regard myself as very fortunate in having one who knows me upon that Committee . Footnote : The Interstate Commerce Committee . According to the press despatches here I am regarded as something of a monster by the more conservative Senators , a sort of cross between Dennis Kearney and Eugene Debs with a little of Herr Most thrown in ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having it thought that I in any way compromised myself to obtain the Senate 's favorable action . I know that you are not alone in this view as to the wisdom of my going on , for I have received other messages to the same effect . But , as you know , the President made this appointment upon grounds quite superior to those of political expediency and upon recommendations not at all political in their nature ... Very truly yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To John H. Wigmore San Francisco , December 21 , 1905 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  Your letter bore good fruit ... As for confirmation it is not as likely as I could wish . However , I am enjoying the situation hugely , and if the fight is kept up I may enlarge into a national issue . The Press of California ( notice the respectful capital ) is practically a unit for me ... My information is that the President will stand pat . But the fight with the Senate is growing so large that no one can tell what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meet the Senators , but I have refused . ... Am I not right ? Remember me very kindly to your wife , and to you both a Merry Christmas . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Benjamin Ide Wheeler President , University of California San Francisco , December 22 , 1905 MY DEAR MR . WHEELER ,  --  It was mighty good of you to bring me that message of good cheer last night . I have not told you , and can not now tell you the very great pleasure and gratification you have given me by the many evidences of your personal friendship . To me it is better to have that kind of friendship than any office . I have just received a letter from the President Roosevelt that is so fine I want you to know of it at once  --  but the original I keep for home use . Here it is :  --  " ... I thank you for your frank and manly letter . It is just the kind of a letter I should have expected from you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall make and am making as stiff a fight as I know how for you . I think I shall carry you through ; but of course nothing of this kind is ever certain . ... " Please remember me most kindly to Mrs. Wheeler and believe me always , faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# The California earthquake , of April 18 , 1906 , occurred at about five o'clock in the morning . Lane was living in North Berkeley , across the bay from San Francisco . His house built of light wood and shingles , rocked , and his chimneys flung down bricks , in the successive shocks , but with no serious damage . Meanwhile San Francisco sprang into flames from hundreds of broken gas mains . Lane reached the city early in the morning , and was at once put , by the Mayor , upon the Committee of Fifty to look to the safety of the City . Will Irwin wrote this picturesque story of the episode after having heard his friend describe this adventure :  --  " Lane has said since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his was a city life after all . He had never tested himself against primitive physical force , tried himself out in an emergency , and he had always longed for such a test before he died . When the test came it was a supreme one : the San Francisco disaster . ... " On the last day but one of this visitation the fire , smoldering slowly in the redwood houses , had taken virtually all the district east of Van Ness Avenue , a broad street which bisects the residence quarter . ... By this time the authorities had given up dynamiting . Chief Sullivan , the one man among them who understood the use of explosives in fire fighting , was dead . The work had been done by soldiers from the Presidio , who blew up buildings too close to the flames and so only scattered them . Lane stood on the slope of Russian Hill , watching the fire approach Van Ness Avenue , when a contractor named Anderson came along . ' That fire always catches at the eaves , not the foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here if some one would dynamite all the block beyond Van Ness Avenue . It could never jump across a strip so broad . ' ' But they 've forbidden any more dynamiting , ' said Anderson . ' Never mind ; I 'd take the chance myself if we could get any explosive , ' replied Lane . ' Well , there 's a launch full of dynamite from Contra Costa County lying right now at Meigs 's Wharf , ' said Anderson . Just then Mr. and Mrs. Tom Magee arrived , driving an automobile on the wheel rims . Lane despatched them to Meigs 's Wharf for the dynamite . He and Anderson found an electric battery , and cut some dangling wires from a telephone pole . By this time the Magees were back , the machine loaded with dynamite ; Mrs. Magee carrying a box of detonators on her lap . Lane , Anderson , and a corps of volunteers laid the battery and strung the wires . ' How do you want this house to fall ? ' asked Anderson , who understands explosives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' And I 've never forgotten the picture which followed , ' Lane has told me since . ' Anderson disappeared inside , came out , and said : " All ready . " I joined the two ends of wire which I held in my hands . The house rose twenty feet in the air  --  intact , mind you ! It looked like a scene in a fairy book . At that point I rolled over on my back , and when I got up the house was nothing but dust and splinters . ' " They went down the line , blowing up houses , schools , churches . Then came bad news . To the south sparks were catching on the eaves of the houses . Down there was a little water in cisterns . Volunteers under Lane 's direction made the householders stretch wet blankets over the roofs and eaves . Then again bad news from the north . There the fire had really crossed the avenue . It threatened the Western Addition , the best residence district . The cause seemed lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few houses were afire , and the slow-burning redwood was smoldering but feebly . ' Just a little water would stop this ! ' he thought . The whole water system of San Francisco was gone , or supposedly so , through the breaking of the mains . ' But I had a hunch , just a hunch , ' said Lane , ' that there was water somewhere in the pipes . ' He had learned that a fire company which had given up the fight was asleep on a haystack somewhere in the Western Addition . He went out and found them . They had been working for thirty-six hours ; they lay like dead men . Lane kicked the soles of the nearest fireman . He returned only a grunt . The next fireman , however , woke up ; Lane managed to get him enthusiastic . He found a wrench , and together he and Lane went from hydrant to hydrant , turning on the cocks . The first five or six gave only a faint spurt and ceased to flow . Then , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they turned a cock no more promising than the others , and out spurted a full head of water . No one knows to this day where that water came from , but it was there ! They shut off the stream . ' It will take three engines to pump it to that blaze , ' said the fireman . He , Lane , and Anderson scattered in opposite directions looking for engines . When twenty minutes later , Lane returned with an engine and company two others had already arrived . But they had not yet coupled the hose up . The companies were quarreling as to which , under the rules of the department , should have the position of honor close to the hydrant ! Lane settled that question of etiquette with speed and force . They got a stream on the incipient fire , and the water held out . The other side of Van Ness Avenue gradually burned out and settled down into red coals . The Western Addition was saved , and the San Francisco disaster was over . " A few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for the rebuilding of San Francisco . When he found that Congress would not act in this matter , he , with Senator Newlands , of Nevada , and some others , went to the President and the Secretary of the Treasury to see if Federal help could be secured for the ruined city . @# To William R. Wheeler New York , June 23 , 1906 MY DEAR WILL ,  --  I have just returned from Washington , where I hope we have accomplished some good for San Francisco , although it was mighty hard to move anyone except the President and the Secretary of the Treasury . But I did not intend to write of anything but your personal affairs . Yesterday , on the train , I discovered that you had met with another fire . This is rubbing it in , hitting a man when he is down . The Gods do n't fight fair . The decent rules of the Marquis of Queensberry seem to have no recognition on Olympus , or wherever the Gods live . I can quite appreciate the strain you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you are with dispirited old men and indifferent young ones , I hope this last blow will have some benefit which I can not now perceive , else it must come like almost a knock-out to the concern . Brave , strong , bully old boy , no one knows better than I do what a fight you have been making these last few years and how many unkindnesses fortune has done you . There is not much use either in preaching to one 's self or to another , the advantages of adversity . I do n't believe that men are made by fighting relentless Fate , the stuff they have is sometimes proved by struggle ,  --  that is the best that can be said for such philosophy . More power to you my dear fellow ! I took occasion to give M ... a warm dose of Bill Wheeler . He is an old sour-ball who thinks he is alive but evidently has been in the cemetery a long time . He talked all right about you , but all wrong about San Francisco ... Give my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet any calamity , and remember me most warmly to the Boy . Sincerely and affectionately yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# The Hepburn Bill provided for seven men on the Interstate Commerce Commission , instead of five . Roosevelt intimated that he would appoint two Republicans . All opposition to Lane was then withdrawn . @# To John H. Wigmore New York , June 27 , 1906 MY DEAR WIGMORE ,  --  Thanks , and again thanks , for your letter to Senator Cullom and yours to me . It looks now as if with a seven man Commission the objection to my Democracy would cease . Senator Cullom 's letter is very reassuring , and I wish that I had met him when in Washington . ... Before another week this business of mine will have come to a head , and I hope soon after to start West , via Chicago . If the report to-day is true that Harlan of Chicago is to go on the Commission , you will have two friends on the body .

Wheeler Washington , July 2 , 1906 MY DEAR BILL ,  --  I have waited until this minute to write you , that I might send you the first greeting from the new office . I have just been sworn in and signed the oath , and to you I turn first to express gratitude , appreciation , and affection . My hope is to leave here tomorrow and go to Chicago at once on your affair , and then West . Remember me most affectionately to your wife , and believe me always most faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# At the same time an affectionate letter of appreciation went to Benjamin Ide Wheeler . @# @# IV RAILROAD AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman Inquiry  --  Railroad Regulation  --  Letters to Roosevelt @# During the late summer of 1906 , Lane was in Washington or traveling through the South and West to attend the hearings of the Interstate Commerce Commission . The Hepburn Act of 1906 , among other extensions of power to the Commission , brought the express companies of the United States under its jurisdiction , and the Commission began the close investigation into the rates , rules , and practises , that finally resulted in a complete reorganization and zoning of the companies . The new powers given the Commission , by this Act , inspired fresh hope of righting old abuses , associated with railroad finance , over-capitalization and stock-jobbing . The Commission set itself to finding a way out of the ancient quarrel between shippers and railroads in the matters of rebating and demurrage charges . In the latter part of the year , President Roosevelt called an important meeting at the White House , for the purpose of deciding whether an inquiry should not be made into the merging of the Western railroads , then under the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State ; William H. Taft , Secretary of War ; Charles Bonaparte , Attorney General , were present ; Chairman Martin A. Knapp and Franklin K. Lane of the Interstate Commerce Commission , and the special Counsel for the Commission  --  Frank B. Kellogg . The matter of the proposed inquiry was discussed , each man being asked , in turn , to express his opinion . Root and Knapp were not in favor of beginning an investigation of the railroad merger , Bonaparte , Kellogg , and Lane favored an immediate inquiry . Lane declared that , in a few weeks , when the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission was published , it would be impossible to avoid making the inquiry . At this point , President Roosevelt turned to William H. Taft , who as yet had expressed no opinion , saying , " Will , what do you think of this ? " Mr. Taft said quietly , " It 's right , is n't it ? Well , damn it , do it then . " And the plans for the famous Harriman Inquiry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public utilities , were then taken under consideration . During the inquiry , when E. H. Harriman was on the stand for hours , the Commissioners trying to extract , by round-about questioning , the admission from him that he would like to extend his control over the railroads of the country , Lane , who had been silent for some time , suddenly turned and asked Harriman the direct question . What would he do with all the roads in the country , if he had the power ? With equal candor and simplicity , Harriman replied that he would consolidate them under his own management . This answer rang through the country . @# TO EDWARD F. ADAMS Washington , February 16 , 1907 MY DEAR ADAMS ,  --  ... I think the standpoint taken by our railroad friends in 1882 is that which possesses their souls to-day . I am conscious each time I ask a question that there is deep resentment in the heart of the railroad official at being compelled to answer , but that he is compelled to , he recognizes . The operating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time these days with the law departments . They can not understand why the law department advises them to give the information we demand , and I have heard of some most lively conferences in which the counsel of the companies were blackguarded heartily for being cowards , in not fighting the Commission . You certainly took advanced ground in 1882 , ...  --  there can be no such thing as a business secret in a quasi-public corporation . ... Very truly yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER PRESIDENT , UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA Washington , March 31,1907 MY DEAR MR . WHEELER ,  --  ... I have taken the liberty of giving Mr. Aladyin , leader of the Group of Toil in the Russian Duma , a note of introduction . He 's an immensely interesting young man , a fine speaker and comes from plain , peasant stock . He will talk to your boys if you ask him . During these days of panic in Wall Street the President Roosevelt has called me in often and shown in many ways that he in no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in studying him in time of stress . He is one of the most resolute of men and at the same time entirely and altogether reasonable . No man I know is more willing to take suggestion . No one leads him , not even Root , but no one need fear to give suggestion . He lives up to his legend , so far as I can discover , and that 's a big order . The railroad men who are wise will rush to the support of the policies he will urge before the next Congress , or they will have national ownership to face as an immediate issue , or a character of regulation that they will regard as intolerable . You will be here again soon and I hope that you will come directly to our house and give us the pleasure of a genuine visit . ... Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO ELIHU ROOT Washington , February 14 , 1908 My DEAR MR . SECRETARY ,  --  I have lately been engaged in writing an opinion upon the jurisdiction of the Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has occurred to me that an extensive American merchant marine might be developed by some legislation which would permit American ships to enjoy preferential through routes in conjunction with our railroad systems . The present Interstate Commerce Law , as I interpret it , gives to the Commission jurisdiction over carriers to the seaboard . It is the assumption of the law that rates will be made to and from the American ports and that at such ports all ships may equally compete for foreign cargo . Might it not be possible to extend the jurisdiction of the Commission over all American vessels engaged in foreign trade , and with such ships alone  --  they alone being fully amenable to our law  --  permit the railroad which carries to the port to make through joint rates to the foreign point of destination ? There is so vast a volume of this through traffic that the preference which could thus be given to the American ship would act as a most substantial subsidy . There may be objections to this suggestion arising either out of national or international policy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , however , as possibly containing the germ of what Mr. Webster would have termed a " respectable idea . " Faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO E. B. BEARD Washington , December 19 , 1908 MY DEAR MR . BEARD ,  --  I have not seen the article in the CALL , to which you refer , but have heard of it from a couple of Californians , much to my distress . Of course I appreciate that at a time of strain such as that which you shippers and business men of California are now undergoing , it is to be expected that the most conservative language will not be used . ... The trouble is with the law . ... It is only upon complaint that an order can be made reducing a rate , and I understand that such complaints are at present being drafted in San Francisco and will in time come before us but such matters can not be brought to issue in a week nor heard in a day , and when I tell you that we have on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appreciate how great the volume of our work is , and that you are not alone in your feeling of indignation or of distress . If you will examine the docket of the Commission , you will find that the cases of the Pacific Coast have been taken care of more promptly within the last two years than the cases in any other part of the United States . I have seen to this myself , because of the long neglect of that part of the country . ... I want to speak one direct personal word to you . You are now protesting against increased rates . I have outlined to you the only remedy a change in the law that I see available against the continuance of just such a policy on the part of the railroads , and I think it might be well for you to see that the Senators and Representatives from California support this legislation . It is not calculated in any way to do injustice or injury to the railroads . ... This is a plan which I have proposed myself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce has endorsed it . The whole Pacific Coast should follow suit enthusiastically . Please remember that I am not the Commissioner from California ; that I am a Commissioner for the United States ; and that it is not my business to fight the railroads , but to hear impartially what both sides may have to say and be as entirely fair with the railroads as with the shippers . I am flattered to know that the railroad men of the United States do not regard me as a deadhead on this Commission . My aggressiveness on behalf of the shipping public has brought upon my head much criticism , and it would be the greatest satisfaction for those who have been prosecuted for rebating or discovered in illegal practises to feel that they were able in any degree to raise in the minds of the shippers any question of my loyalty to duty . I expect to be in California during January , for a few days , and hope that I may see you at that time . Very sincerely yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 13 , 1909 MY DEAR GEORGE ,  --  ... I suppose you have n't seen my interview on the Japanese question . I gave it at the request of the President Roosevelt , because he said that the Republican Senators and Congressmen would not stand by him if it was going to be a partisan question in California politics . So I said that I would give the value of my name and influence to the support of his policy , so that Flint , Kahn , ET AL. , could quote me as against any attack by the Democrats . The President has done great work for the Coast . Congress never would have done anything at this time , and by the time it is willing to do something the problem will practically be solved . I am expecting to be roasted somewhat , in California , but I felt that it was only right to stand by the man who was really making our fight without any real backing from the East , and without many friends on the Pacific  --  so far as the " pollies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that they will all be on good terms with Taft , but unless I 'm mistaken in the man they will be greatly fooled . ... Have you noticed that nice point of constitutional law , dug up by a newspaper reporter , which renders Knox ineligible as Secretary of State ? He voted for an increase in the salary of the Secretary of State three years ago . They will try to avoid the effect of the constitutional inhibition by repealing the act increasing the salary . Technically this wo n't do Knox any good , altho ' it will probably be upheld by the Courts , if the matter is ever taken into the Courts . Roosevelt is very nervous these days but as he said to me the other day , " They know that I am President right up to March fourth . " I took Ned and Nancy to see him and he treated them most beautifully . Gave Ned a pair of boar tusks from the Philippines and told him a story about the boar ripping up a man 's leg just before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal card . F. K. L.

" On through the night as the willows go weeping The daffodils sigh , As the wind sweeps by Right through the sky . " TO CHARLES K. MCCLATCHY SACRAMENTO BEE Washington , March 20 , 1909 My Dear McClatchy ,  --  I am just in receipt of your letter of March 15th , with reference to my running for Governor next year . There is nothing in this rumor whatever . I have been approached by a good many people on this matter , and perhaps I have not said as definitely as I should that I had no expectation of re-entering California politics . When I was last in California some of my friends pointed out to me the great opening there would be for me if I would become a Republican and lead the Lincoln-Roosevelt people . There does not seem to be any line of demarcation between a Democrat and a Republican these days , so that such a change would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal belief is that the organization in California on the Republican side could be rather easily beaten , and we could do with California what La Follette did with Wisconsin . But I am trying not to think of politics , and I told those people who came to me that I thought my line of work for the next few years was fixed . ... No one yet knows from Mr. Taft 's line of policy what kind of a President he will make . Everybody is giving him the benefit of the doubt . The thing , I find , that hangs over all Presidents and other public men here to terrify them is the fear of bad times . The greatness of Roosevelt lay , in a sense , in his recklessness . These people undoubtedly have the power to bring on panics whenever they want to and to depress business , and they will exercise that power as against any administration that does not play their game , and the " money power , " as we used to call it , allows the President and Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move but if it goes outside that field and follows policies or demands measures which interfere with the game as played by the high financiers , they do not hesitate to use their " big stick , " which is the threat of business depression . ... There are a lot of things to be done in our State yet before we both pass out . ... As always , very truly yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO LAWRENCE F. ABBOTT OUTLOOK Washington , September 22 , 1909 MY DEAR ABBOTT ,  --  ... President Taft 's suggestion of a Commerce Court is a very sensible one . We suggested the institution of such a Court some years ago , so that the question of nullifying our order will be brought up before men who have special experience . ... The trouble with the Courts is that they know nothing about the question . Fundamentally it is not ... law but economics that we deal with . The fixing of a rate is a matter of politics . That is the reason why I have always held that the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should have a Court that will pass really upon the one question of confiscation  --  the constitutionality of the rates fixed  --  and leave experienced men to deal with the economic questions . ... I have long wanted to see you and have a talk about our work . At times it is rather disheartening . The problem is vast , and we pass few milestones . The one great accomplishment of the Commission , I think , in the last three years , has been the enforcement of the law as against rebating . We have a small force now that is used in this connection under my personal direction , and I think the greatest contribution that we have made , perhaps , to the railroads has been during the time of panic when they were kept from cutting rates directly or indirectly and throwing each other into the hands of receivers . The great volume of our complaints comes from the territory west of the Mississippi River and practically all of the larger cities in the inter-mountain country have complaints pending before us attacking the reasonableness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give consideration to these that the Commission , as a body , goes West the first of the month . ... I have just returned from a trip to Europe , and I find that what I said two or three years ago about the United States being the most Conservative of the civilized countries is absolutely true . By the way , at the Sorbonne at Paris they are exhibiting the chair in which President Roosevelt will sit when he comes to deliver his address and I am thinking that he will have quite as hearty a reception in Paris as in any of our cities . Very truly yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO JOHN H. WIGMORE Washington , December 3 , 1909 MY DEAR DOCTOR ,  --  ... I think there is but little doubt that De Vries will receive the appointment , though of course everything here is in absolute chaos . ... The best symptom in my own case is that I have been called in twice to consult over proposed amendments to the law , and the President 's Taft 's reference thereto in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth something  --  more than I do myself , in fact  --  for down in my heart , though I do not let anybody see it , I am really a modest creature . Since my return from the West we have had one merry round of sickness in the house ... but all are on their feet once more and as gay as they can be with a more or less grumpy head of the household in the neighborhood , ( assuming for the nonce that I am the head of the household ) . The President is going to appoint Lurton . Footnote : To the Supreme Bench . He should have said so when he made up his mind to do it , which was immediately after Peckham 's death . He would have saved himself an immense amount of trouble . Lurton seems to have been very hostile to the Interstate Commerce Commission , and is too old , but otherwise I hear nothing said against him . I really would like to see Bowers put on the bench very much . He has made a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very strong man , and in sympathy with Federal control that 's real . By the way , I had a talk the other day with Attorney General Wickersham regarding the treatment of criminals , and I believe you can secure through him the initiation of an enlightened policy in this matter . He told me that he was going to make some recommendations in his report , and perhaps the President may deal with the matter slightly in his message . Wickersham is a thoroughly modern proposition , and as he has charge of all the penitentiaries , and his recommendations , with relation to parole and such things , absolutely go with the President , I believe you could do more good in an hour 's talk with him than you could effect in a year otherwise . If you could run down , during the holiday vacation , I would bring you two together for a talk on this matter , and you , also , might take up the very live question with the President of cutting off red-tape in the courts .

I have spent a rather pleasant day reading , and looking at this great desert of New Mexico and Arizona . No one on board that I know or care to know , but the big sky and my books keep me busy . Do you remember that picture in the Corcoran Gallery with a wee line of land at the bottom and a great high reach of blue sky above , covering nine-tenths of the canvas ? I have thought of it often to-day  --  " the high , irrepressible sky .

But such an anchor to windward , for two most hand-to-mouth spendthrifts ! ... @# TO THEODORE ROOSEVELT Washington , April 29 , 1910 MY DEAR MR . ROOSEVELT ,  --  Mr. Kellogg tells me that he expects to see you in Europe , and I avail myself of his offer to carry a word of welcome to you , inasmuch as I must leave for Europe the day after your arrival in New York , the President having appointed me as a delegate to the International Railway Congress at Berne . The country is awaiting you anxiously  --  not out of mere curiosity to know what your attitude will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The public opinion which you developed in favor of the " square deal " is stronger to-day than when you left , and your personal following is larger to-day than it ever has been . There is no feeling ( or if there is any it is negligible ) that the President Taft has been consciously disloyal to the policies which you inaugurated or to his public promises . He is patriotic , conscientious , and lovable . This was your own view as expressed to me , and this view has been confirmed by my personal experience with him . It is also , I believe , the judgment of the country at large . But the people do not feel that they control the government or that their interests will be safeguarded by a relationship that is purely diplomatic between the White House and Congress . In short we have a new consciousness of Democracy , largely resulting from your administration , and it is such that the character of government which satisfied the people of twenty years ago is found lacking to-day . Practically all the criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling of the people that their opinions and desires are not sufficiently consulted , and they are suspicious of everything and everybody that is not open and frank with them . Outside of a few of the larger states the entire country is insurgent , and insurgency means revolt against taking orders . The prospect is that the next House will be Democratic , but the Democrats apparently lack a realization of the many new problems upon which the country is divided . Their success would not indicate the acceptance of any positive program of legislation ; it would be a vote of lack of confidence in the Republican party because it has allowed apparent party interest to rise superior to public good . The prospect is that every measure which Congress will pass at this session will be wise and in line with your policies , but the people do not feel that THEY are passing the bills . I have presumed to say this much , thinking that perhaps you would regard my opinion as entirely unbiased , and in the hope that I might throw some light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dealt with . Whether you choose to re-enter political life or not , men of all parties desire your leadership and will accept your advice as they will that of none other . Pardon me for this typewriting , but I thought that you might prefer a letter in this form which you could read to one in my own hand which you could not read . Believe me , as always , faithfully yours . FRANKLIN K. LANE From Berlin , Lane received from Theodore Roosevelt , dated May 13 , 1910 , these lines ,  --  " ... I think your letter most interesting . As far as I can judge you have about sized up the situation right . With hearty good wishes , faithfully yours , THEODORE ROOSEVELT @# TO JOHN H. WIGMORE Washington , March 2 , 1911 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  No other letter that I have received has done me as much good or given me as much pleasure , or has been as much of a stimulus , as has yours . The fact that you took the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendship that is beyond all price , and of which I feel most unworthy . I have had the figures checked over , resulting in some slight changes , and will send you a revised copy as soon as it is printed . The newspaper criticisms are generally very friendly , although the FINANCIAL CHRONICLE , the WALL STREET JOURNAL , and other railway organs are extremely bitter . The Western papers do not seem to have been very much elated over the decision . It has appeared to me from the beginning as if they had been " fixed " in advance and that their reports were always biased for the railroads , but the country at large will realize , I think , before long , that the decisions are sound , sensible , and in the public interest . Some of the least narrow of the railroad men also take this view . The best editorial I have seen is in the New York EVENING POST . Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE P. S. I got this note from Roosevelt this morning , headed THE OUTLOOK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , and I shall read the REPORT with genuine interest . More power to your elbow ! Faithfully yours . " " This report was known , " Commissioner Harlan explains , " as the Western Advance Rate Case . It was one of the first of the great cases covering many commodities and applying over largely extended territories . In his opinion denying the rate advances proposed by the carriers , Commissioner Lane discussed the Commission 's new powers of suspending the operation of increased rates pending investigation and the burden of proof in such cases . He marshalled a vast array of facts and figures and announced conclusions that were accepted as convincing by the public at large . He then pointed out that the laws enforced by the Commission sought dominion over private capital for no other purpose than to secure the public against injustice and thereby make capital itself more secure . " @# TO WILLIAM R. WHEELER TRAFFIC BUREAU , MERCHANTS ' EXCHANGE SAN FRANCISCO , CALIFORNIA Washington , June 27 , 1911 DEAR SIR ,  --  Adverting to yours of June 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing can be added to my previous letter unless it is the expression of my personal opinion that a rate should not be made for the carriage of 20,000 pound shipments by express . We are receiving daily similar complaints to yours , respecting the nonadjustment of express rates , and if you will call at this office we shall be pleased to reveal the reason for our failure , hitherto , to grant the relief desired . It is extremely warm in Washington at the present time , but if anything could add to the disagreeableness of life in the city it is the unreasoning insistence on the part of the traffic bureaus of the country that express rates shall be fixed overnight . I desire to say that I have given some year or two of more or less profane contemplation to this question , and have now engaged a large corps of men , under the direction of Mr. Frank Lyon as attorney for the Commission , to seek a way out of the inextricable maze of express company figures . Whether we will be able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts short the cord , is a question to which no certain answer can be given . Would you kindly advise the importunate members of a most worthy institution , that express rates to San Francisco possess me as an obsessment . My prayer is at night interfered with by consideration of the question  --  " What should the 100 pound rate be by Wells Fargo &; Co. from New York to San Francisco ? " And at night often I am aroused from sleep , feeling confident in my dreams that the mystic figure of " a just and reasonable rate , " under Section One , on 100-pound shipments to San Francisco , had been determined , and awaken with a joyous cry upon my lips , to discover that life has been made still more unhappy by the torture of the subconscious mind during sleep . No doubt your shippers are being treated unfairly , both by the express companies and by the Interstate Commerce Commission . This is a cruel world . Congress itself adds to the torture , by almost daily referring to us some bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar service , and while the thermometer stands at 117 degrees in the shade we are requested to advise as to whether express companies should not be abolished . It has only been by the exercise of a rare and unusual degree of self-control on my part , and by long periods of prayer , that I have refrained from advising Congress that I thought express companies should be abolished and designating the place to which they should be relegated . As perhaps you may have heard , I shall visit the Pacific Coast in person during the next few weeks , and there I trust I may have the pleasure of meeting you and your noble Governing Committees , to whom I shall explain in person and in detail the difficulties attaching to the solution of this problem . ... Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO LAWRENCE F. ABBOTT OUTLOOK Washington , December 4 , 1911 MY DEAR ABBOTT ,  --  ... We are making history fast these days , and at the bottom of it all lies the idea , in the minds of the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the Government . For the centuries and centuries that have passed , government has been something imposed from above , to which the subject or citizen must submit . For the first century of our national life this idea has held good . Now , however , the people have grown in imagination , so that they appreciate the fact that the government is very little more than a cooperative institution in which there is nothing inherently sacred , excepting in so far as it is a crystallization of general sentiment and is a good working arrangement . And the feeling with relation to big business , when we get down to the bottom of it , is that if men have made these tremendous fortunes out of privileges granted by the whole people , we can correct this by a change in our laws . They do not object to men making any amount of money so long as the individual makes it , but if the Government makes it for him , that is another matter . I have been meeting ... with some of the committees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusts , and I expect something by no means radical as a starter . You ask as to leadership in both Houses . There is not much in the Lower House that can be relied upon to do constructive work , so far as I can discover . Our Democratic leaders all wear hobble skirts . But in the Senate there is some very good stuff . I expect to be in New York in January , and then I hope to see you . Very truly yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE When he was running for Governor in 1902 , Lane made prison reform one of the foremost issues of his campaign . Several years later when a movement was started petitioning the Governor to parole Abraham Ruef , who had served a part of his term in the penitentiary for bribery in San Francisco , Lane signed the petition . This brought a letter of remonstrance from his friend Charles McClatchy , editor and owner of the Sacramento Bee , who felt that such a movement was ill-timed and not in the interest of the public good . @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1911 MY DEAR CHARLES ,  --  I have your letter regarding the paroling of Abraham Ruef , and , far from taking offense at what you say , I know that it expresses the opinion of probably the great body of our people , but I have long thought that we dealt with criminals in a manner which tended to keep them as criminals and altogether opposed to the interests of society . I am not sentimental on this proposition , but I think I am sensible . We are dealing with men convicted of crime more harshly and more unreasonably than we deal with dogs . Our fundamental mistake is that we utterly ignore the fact that there is such a thing as psychology . We are treating prisoners with the methods of five hundred years ago , before anything was known about the nature of the human mind . ... There are , of course , certain kinds of men who should for society 's sake be kept in prison as long as they live , just as there are kinds of insane people that should be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you will get the thought into your mind that our present penal system is Silurian and unscientific  --  the same to-day as it was 10,000 years ago  --  you will see my stand-point . Our penitentiaries develop criminals , they make criminals out of men who are not criminals to begin with  --  boys , for instance . They debase and degrade men . The state by its system of punishment reaches into the heart of a man and plucks out his very soul . I am speaking of men who are when they enter responsive to good impulses . ... I thoroughly appreciate the spirit in which you have written me , and I hope that you will get my point of view . I have known Abe Ruef for over twenty-five years . He was a perfectly straight young man and anxious to help in San Francisco . I do not know the influences that turned him into the direction that he took , but I am absolutely certain that that man has suffered mental tortures greater than any that he would have ever suffered if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear brave , but he is in fact , I will warrant you , a heart-broken man , because he has failed of realizing his own decent ideals . ... He never was my friend , politically , socially , or otherwise , but my judgment is that society will be better off if he is allowed the limited freedom that a parole gives and given an opportunity to live up to his own ideal of Abe Ruef . Regards to Val , your wife , and family . As always , faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO CHARLES K. MCCLATCHY SACRAMENTO BEE Washington , January , 1912 MY DEAR CHARLES ,  --  I have your note regarding Ruef . ... It seems to me you have made one good point against me , and only one ,  --  that there are poor men in jail who ought to be paroled at the end of a year . Very well , why not parole them ? If they are men who have been reached by public opinion and are subject to it , I see no reason why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with by itself and to each case should be given the same kind of treatment that I give to Ruef . You will be advocating this thing yourself one of these days , calling it Christian and civilized and denouncing those who do not agree with you as being barbarians . It may be that Ruef fooled me when he was just out of college , but I was a member of the Municipal Reform League which John H. Wigmore , now Dean of the Northwestern University Law School , Ruef and myself started . It did not last very long , but I think that Ruef was as zealous as any of us for good government . With many wishes for the New Year , believe me always , my dear Charles , yours faithfully , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS LONDON , ENGLAND December 13 , 1911 MY DEAR BURNS ,  --  I have felt grievously hurt , at hearing from Pfeiffer several times , that you had written him , and nary a word to me . The idea that I should write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but write me , never entered my head . I want you to understand distinctly the position which you now occupy in the minds of your friends . You are a gentleman of leisure , traveling in Europe with an invalid wife , necessarily bored , and anxious to meet with anything that will give you an interesting life . Under the circumstances , you may relieve your mind at any time , of any intellectual bile , by correspondence . ... If you wish something serious to do , I will formally direct you to make a report upon Railway Rates and Railway Service in Europe . This will give you some diversion in between your attacks of religion and architecture . Pfeiffer , I presume , has returned from the Far West , but so far I have not heard from him . The last letter I got was from the Yosemite . He seems to have been enchanted with that country . He says there is nothing in Europe to compare with it . It is splendid to see a fellow of his age , and with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me that he is more appreciative and buoyant than he was twenty years ago , and he is really very sane . His sympathies , unlike yours , are with the present and not with the dead past . You will be interested in knowing that Mr. T. Roosevelt is likely to be the next Republican nominee for President . Within the last six weeks it has become quite manifest that Taft can not be elected . ... And so you see , the whirligig of time has made another turn . Big Business in New York is looking to Roosevelt as a statesman who is practical . The West regards him as the champion of the plain people . He is keeping silent , but no doubt like the negro lady he is quite willing to be " fo'ced . " On the Democratic side all of the forces have united to destroy Wilson , who is the strongest man in the West . The bosses are all against him . They recently produced an application which he had made for a pension , under the Carnegie Endowment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle , unnoticed for a year or so after its rejection , but owing to campaign emergencies was produced , at this happy moment , to show that Wilson wanted a pension . As a Philadelphia poet whom you never heard of says :  --  " Ah , what a weary travel is our act , Here , there , and back again , to win some prize , Those who are wise their voyage do contract To the safe space between each others ' eyes . " This line is in keeping with my reputation as an early Victorian . ... Do write me some good long letters . You have a better literary style than any man who ever wrote a letter to me , and I love you for the prejudices that are yours . Give my love to your wife . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANES @# TO THEODORE ROOSEVELT Washington , December 10 , 1911 MY DEAR COLONEL ,  --  I have been thinking over what I said yesterday , and I am going to presume upon my friendship and , I may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though the call comes from a united party and under circumstances the most flattering , do not accept it unless you are convinced of two things : ( 1 ) that you are needed from a national standpoint and not merely from a party standpoint ; ( 2 ) that you are certain of election . Sacrifice for one 's country is splendid , but sacrifice for one 's party is foolish . You must feel assured before acceding to the call , which I believe will certainly come , that it is more than party-wide , and that it is sufficiently strong to overcome the trend toward Democratic success . If I were asked I would say that I think both of these conditions are present  --  that the desire to have you again is much broader than any party , and so large that it would insure your victory ;  --  but no man is as wise a judge of these things as the man himself whose fortunes are at stake . Thanking you again for the pleasure of a luncheon , believe me , as always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter marked PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL replied :  --  ... " That is a really kind and friendly letter from you , and I appreciate it . Now I agree absolutely with you that I have no business under any circumstances to accept any such call , even in the greatly improbable event of its coming , unless I am convinced that the need is National , a need of the people and not merely a need of the Party . But as for considering my own chances in any such event , my dear fellow , I simply would not know how to go about it . I am always credited with far more political sagacity than I really possess . I act purely on public grounds and then this proves often to be good policy too . I assure you with all possible sincerity that I have not thought and am not thinking of the nomination , and that under no circumstances would I in the remotest degree plan to bring about my nomination . I do not want to be President again , I am not a candidate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do not for one moment believe that any such condition of affairs will arise that would make it necessary to consider me accepting the nomination . But as for the effect upon my own personal fortunes , I would not know how to consider it , because I would not have the vaguest idea what the effect would be , except that according to my own view it could not but be bad and unpleasant for me personally . From the personal standpoint I should view the nomination to the Presidency as a real and serious misfortune . Nothing would persuade me to take it , unless it appeared that the people really wished me to do a given job , which I could not honorably shirk. ... " @# TO SAMUEL G. BLYTHE Washington , January 6 , 1912 MY DEAR SAM ,  --  ... I , too , have been reading William James .

If I had not been unlucky enough to be born in Canada I could be nominated for President this year . Things are in a devil of a condition . We could have elected Wilson , hands down , if it had not been for Hearst 's malevolent influence . He is at the bottom of all this deviltry . His aim is to kill Wilson off and nominate Clark , and Clark is in the lead now , I think . God knows whether he can beat Taft or not . It looks to me as if Taft will be nominated . I have a feeling somehow that the Roosevelt boom wo n't materialize . My love to the Missis and to Mr. House . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO JOHN H.

I get to my office about nine , and without going out of my room ( for I take my lunch at my desk ) , stay until six , and work at home every night until half past eleven , and then take a volume of essays or poems to bed with me for half or three-quarters of an hour , and so to sleep .

It looks as if Clark might be the nominee on the Democratic side . Taft is gaining in strength , and somehow I can not feel that Roosevelt will ever be in it , although you know how I like him . The situation seems a bit artificial . Give my love to Mrs. John . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO GEORGE W. LANE Washington , February 23 , 1912 MY DEAR GEORGE ,  --  ... Yesterday I delivered an address before the University of Virginia on A Western View of Tradition  --  which when it is printed I will send out to you  --  and in the afternoon was taken up to Jefferson 's home , Monticello . It is on a mountain , the top of which he scraped off . It overlooks the whole surrounding country , most of which at that time he owned . He planned the whole house himself , even to the remotest details , the cornices and the carvings on the mantels , the kind of lumber of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timbers used , the carving of the capitals on the columns , the folding ladder that was used to wind up the clock over the doorway , the registers on the porch that recorded the direction in which the wind was coming , as moved by the weather-vane on the roof , the little elevator beside the fireplace ... and a thousand other details . ... I would like nothing better if I had any kind of skill in using my hands than to take a year off and build a house . It is a real religion to create something , and you do not need a great deal of money to make a very beautiful little place . You must have one large room , and the house must be on some elevation , and you must get water , water , and water . ... It is water that makes land valuable in California or anywhere else . Affectionately yours , F. K. L. @# TO CARL SNYDER Washington , March 6 , 1912 MY DEAR CARL ,  --  I have this minute for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1912 , and therefore for the first time my eyes lighted upon your most delicious roast of the Commerce Court . ... I do not know what the outcome of this movement will be . The only settled policy of government is inertia . The House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations , I believe , proposes to abolish the appropriation for the Court , which looks like a cowardly way to get at the thing , but perhaps it is most effective . However , I really doubt if they will have the nerve to do this . It is a mighty critical year , I think , in our history . It looks to me as if the reactionaries were going to get possession of both parties , and that a third party will be needed and nobody will have the nerve to start it . Roosevelt has got everything west of the Mississippi excepting Utah and Wyoming , in my judgment . That he will be able to get the nomination I am not so sure ; but he does not care a tinker 's damn whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it because the people wo n't give anything to a man that he does not want . ... Well , we are living in mighty interesting times anyway . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE On February 22 , 1912 , Lane delivered the annual address at the University of Virginia . He spoke on American Tradition , saying that as Americans are physically , industrially , and socially the " heirs of all the ages " our supreme tradition is a " hatred of injustice . " That one of the great experiments that a Democracy should make is to find a more equitable distribution of wealth " without destroying individual initiative or blasting individual capacity and imagination . " This address brought a letter from Oliver Wendell Holmes , Justice of the Supreme Court . @# TO FRANKLIN K. LANE March 17 , 1912 MY DEAR SIR ,  --  Let me thank you at once for your Virginia address , which I have just received and just read  --  read with the greatest pleasure . I admire its eloquence , its imagination , its style . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gain heart from its tone of hope . I am old  --  by the calendar at least  --  and at times am more melancholy , so that it does me good to hear the note of courage . One implication may carry conclusions to which I think I ought to note my disagreement ,  --  the reference to unequal distribution . I think the prevailing fallacy is to confound ownership with consumption of products . Ownership is a gate , not a stopping place . You tell me little when you tell me that Rockefeller or the United States is the owner . What I want to know is who consumes the annual product , and for many years I have been saying and believing that to think straight one should look at the stream of annual products and ask what change one would make in that under any REGIME . The luxuries of the few are a drop in the bucket  --  the crowd now has all there is . The difference between private and public ownership , it seems to me , is mainly in the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to direct labor into the most productive channels , and the greater poignancy of the illusion of self-seeking under which the private owner works . The real problem , under socialism as well as under individualism , is to ascertain , under the external economic and inevitable conditions , the equilibrium of social desires . The real struggle is between the different groups of producers of the several objects of social desire . The bogey capital is simply the force of all the other groups against the one that is selling its product , trying to get that product for the least it can . Capital is society purchasing and consuming  - -  Labor is society producing . The laborers unfortunately are often encouraged to think capital something up in the sky which they are waiting for a Franklin to bring down into their jars . I think that is a humbug and lament that I so rarely hear what seem to me the commonplaces that I have uttered , expressed . Your fine address has set me on my hobby and you have fallen a victim to the charm of your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. S. Of course I am speaking only of economics not of political or sentimental considerations  --  both very real , but as to which all that one can say is , if you are sure that you want to go to the show and have money enough to buy a ticket , go ahead , but do n't delude yourself with the notion that you are doing an economic act . I make the only return I can in the form of the single speech I have made for the last nine years . @# TO OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT Washington , March 20 , 1912 MY DEAR MR . JUSTICE ,  --  I sincerely thank you for the warmth and generosity of your comment on my Virginia speech . Your economic philosophy is fundamentally , I think , the same as mine  --  that the wealth produced is a social product . And men may honestly differ as to how best that stream of foods and other satisfactions may be increased in volume , or more widely distributed . May I carry your figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England has the superior right , but in an arid country the common law rule is abandoned because under new conditions it does not make for the greatest public good ? The land adjoining feels the need of the water , and society takes from one to give to the other . The last century was devoted to steaming up in production . This century , it appears to me , will devote itself more definitely to distribution . It is nonsense , of course , to say that because the rich grow richer the poor grow poorer ; but the poor are not the same poor , they , too , have found new desires . Civilization has given them new wants . Those desires will not be satisfied with largesse , and with the machinery of government in their hands the people are bound to experiment along economic lines . They will certainly find that they get most when they preserve the captain of industry , but may it not be that his imagination and forethought may be commanded by society at a lower share of the gross than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different , perhaps of a sentimental nature ? ...

WILLARD ,  --  That was a warm cordial note that you sent me regarding my University of Virginia address , and what you say of my sentiments confirms my own view that property must look to men like yourself for protection in the future  --  men who are not blind to public sentiment and whose methods are frank . The worst enemy that capital has in the country is the man who thinks that he can " put one over " on the people .

You certainly are very much in the right . Everything begins to look as if the Republican party would prove itself the Democratic party after all . Our Southern friends are so obstinate and so traditional , and so insensible to the problems of the day , that while they are honest they are too often found in alliance with the Hearsts and Calhouns . The Republican party , on the other hand , seems to have courage enough to take a purgative every now and then . We must find ways of satisfying the plain man 's notion of what the fair thing is , or else worse things than the recall of judges will come to pass . Every lawyer knows that the law has been turned into a game of bridge whist .

As always , yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE TO GEORGE W. LANE Washington , July 2 , 1912 MY DEAR GEORGE ,  --  I am off tomorrow for Baddeck , Cape Breton , where I shall probably be until the 1st of September or thereabouts  --  if I can endure that long period of country life and absence from the political excitement of the United States . It looks , as I am writing , as if Wilson were to be nominated at Baltimore . If he is he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Footnote : Taft carried Vermont and Utah . Wilson is clean , strong , high-minded and cold-blooded . To nominate him would be a tremendous triumph for the anti-Hearst people . I have been over at the convention several times . Hearst defeated Bryan for temporary chairman by making a compact with Murphy , Sullivan and Taggart . ... Bryan has fought a most splendid fight . I had a talk with him . He was in splendid spirits and most cordial . The California delegation headed by Theodore Bell has been made to look like a lot of wooden Indians . Bell himself was shouted down with the cry of " Hearst ! Hearst ! " , the last time he rose to speak . The delegation is probably the most discredited one in the entire convention . ... My summer , I presume , will be put in chiefly in sailing a small yawl with Gilbert Grosvenor , rowing a boat , fishing a little , and walking some . My diet for the next two months will consist exclusively of salmon and potatoes , cod-fish and potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my report in the Express Case , a copy of which will be sent you . It has been a most tremendous task , and the work has not yet been completed for we have to pass upon the rates in October ; but I am in surprisingly good condition  - -  largely , perhaps , because the weather has been so cool for the last month ... All happiness , old man ! Affectionately yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE " Lane had a long look ahead , " says James S. Harlan , " that often reminded one of the extraordinary prevision of Colonel Roosevelt . One striking instance of this was in connection with this Express Case . " Early in the progress of the investigation of express companies undertaken by him in 1911 , at the request of the Interstate Commerce Commission , Lane warned a group of high express officials gathered around him that unless they promptly coordinated their service more closely to the public requirements , revised their archaic practices , readjusted and simplified their rate systems so as to eliminate discriminations , the frequent collection of double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper and a better service , the public would soon be demanding a parcel post . " The suggestion was received with incredulous smiles , one of the express officials saying , apparently with the full approval of them all , that a parcel post had been talked of in this country for forty years and had never got beyond the talking point , and never would . As a matter of fact , there was little , if any , movement at that time in the public press or elsewhere for such a service by the government . But Lane 's alert mind had sensed in the current of public thought a feeling that there was need of a quicker , simpler , and cheaper way of handling the country 's small packages , and he saw no way out , other than a parcel post , if the express companies stood still and made no effort to meet this public need . " Within scarcely more than a year Congress , by the Act of August 24 , 1912 , had authorized a parcel post and such a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not until December of the latter year that the express companies were ready to file with the Commission the ingenious and entirely original system Lane had devised for stating express rates . The form was so simple that even the casual shipper in a few minutes ' study could qualify himself for ascertaining the rates , not only to and from his own home express station but between any other points in the country . But by that time the carriage of the country 's small parcels had permanently passed out of the hands of the express companies into the hands of the postal service , by which Lane 's unique form for stating the express rates was adopted as the general form of showing its parcel post charges . " @# TO Oscar S. Straus Washington , July 8 , 1912 MY DEAR MR . STRAUS ,  --  I thank you heartily for your appreciative note regarding my University of Virginia talk . I wanted to say something to those people , especially to the younger men , that would make them doubt the wisdom of staying forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I write , word comes that Woodrow Wilson has been nominated . I do not know him , but from what I hear he promises if elected to be a real leader in the war against injustice . The world wants earnest men right now  --  not cynics , but men who BELIEVE , whether rightly or wrongly ; and the reason that the East is so much less progressive as we say , than the West , is because the East is made up so largely of cynics . Thanking you once more for your appreciative words , believe me , sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE TO BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER PRESIDENT , UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA Baddeck , Nova Scotia , July 81 , 1912 MY DEAR MR . WHEELER ,  --  Your letter followed me here , where at least one can breathe . This really is a most beautiful country filled with self-respecting Gaelic-speaking Scotch from the islands of the north  --  crofters driven here to make place for sheep and fine estates on their ancestral homes in the Highlands . I am proud of your words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . I believe we 've done a real service both to the country and to the express companies . The latter will probably live if their service and their rates improve . Otherwise the Government will put them out of business , requiring the railroads to give fast service for any forwarder , as in Germany . Politically , things look Wilson to me . Taft wo n't be in sight at the finish . It will be a run between Wilson and T. R. I ca n't name five states that Taft is really likely to carry . My friends in Massachusetts say Wilson will win there , and so in Maine . Well , I suppose you and I are in the same sad situation  --  eager to break into the fight but bound not to do it . Do you know I believe that T. R. has discovered , and just discovered , that it is our destiny to be a Democracy . Hence the enthusiasm which Wall Street calls whiskey . ... Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K , LANE @# TO GEORGE W. LANE Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am mighty glad to get your Labor Day letter , but sorry that its note is not more cheerful and gay . I can quite understand your position though . We are all obsessed with the desire to be of some use and unwilling to take things as they are . I do not know a pair of more rankly absurd idealists than you and myself , and along with idealism goes discontent . We do not see the thing that satisfies us , and we can not abide resting with the thing that does not satisfy us . We are of the prods in the world , the bit of acid that is thrown upon it to test it , the spur which makes the lazy thing move on . This summer I saw a great deal of a man ... who was perfectly complacent . ... And I noticed that he took no acids of any kind  - -  never a pickle , nor vinegar , nor salad  --  but would heap half a roll of butter on a single sheet of bread and eat sardines whole . And I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow 's stomach that accounted for his temperament . If I ever get the time I am going to try and work out the theory . The contented people are those who generate their own acid and have an appetite for fats , while the discontented people are those whose craving is for acids . A lack of a sense of humor and a love for concrete facts , as opposed to dreams , goes along with the first temperament . You just turn this thing over and see if there is not something in it . I am long past the stage of trying to correct myself ; I am just trying to understand a lot of things  --  why they are . ... F. K L. @# TO JOHN H. WIGMORE Washington , July 3 , 1912 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  Of course you may keep the Napoleon book . It is intended for you . Your criticism of T. R.

What a splendid jump in three years that man has made ! They tell me he is very cold-blooded . We need a cold-blooded fellow these days ... September 21 , 1912 ... You will by this time have picked up all the politics of the time . Wilson is strong , but not stronger than he was when nominated . T. R. is gaining strength daily , that is my best guess . He has the laboring man with him most enthusiastically but not unanimously , of course . The far West  --  Pacific Coast  --  is his . All the railroad men and the miners ... I am not sure of Wilson . He is not " wise " to modern conditions , I fear . Tearing up the tariff wo n't change many prices . Does n't he seem to talk too much like a professor and too little like a statesman ? Hearst is knifing him for all he is worth . He has fixed in the workingmen 's minds that Wilson favors Chinese immigration . Well , when am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John ? How I do wish you were here ! As always , F. K. L. @# To Timothy Spellacy Washington , September 30 , 1912 MY DEAR TIM ,  --  I have your fine , long letter of September 23 , and this is no more than just an acknowledgment . I am glad to know that you are taking so hearty an interest in the campaign . It is really too bad that you did not stay longer in Baltimore and see Bryan win out all along the line . I do n't want a position in the Cabinet . I am not looking for any further honors , but I want to help Wilson make a success of his administration , for I think he will be elected . I am afraid that he will become surrounded by Southern reactionaries  --  men of his own blood and feeling , who are not of the Northern and more progressive type . We have got to cut some sharp corners in doing the things that are right . By this I do n't mean that we will do anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat it is illegal to have a strong central government  --  one that is effective  --  and we have got to have such a government if we are going to hold possession of the Nation . The people want things done . Wilson is a bit too conservative for me , but maybe when he realizes the necessity for strength he will be for it . I am sorry for B  --  . Poor chap ! His alliance with Hearst undid years of good work ... As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Adolph C. Miller Washington , October 18 , 1912 MY DEAR ADOLPH ,  --  I have postponed until the last minute writing you regarding my proposed visit in California . I see now clearly that it is impossible for me to get out there this fall . The Express Case ... is still on my hands , and with all of my energy I shall not be able to get rid of it until the first of the year at least ... Moreover ( and this is a personal matter that I wish you would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great deal of pain , and have been for the last three or four weeks ... I can not work as hard as I did some time ago ... I rebel at sickness as much as I do at death . The scheme of existence does not appeal to me , at the moment , as the most perfect which a highly imaginative Creator could have invented . My transcendental philosophy seems a pretty good working article when things are going smoothly , but it is not quite equal to hard practical strain , I fear . Politically things look like Wilson , though I suppose T. R. will get California and a lot of other states . I think he will beat Taft badly . The new party has come to stay , and it will be a tremendous influence for good . I do n't take any stock in the talk about T. R 's personal ambition being his controlling motive . I think that he has found a religious purpose in life to which he can devote himself the rest of his days , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right lines . Remember me most kindly to your wife and President Wheeler . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To William F. McCombs Chairman , Democratic National Committee Washington , October 19,1912 Dear Mr. McCombs ,  --  I can not go to California and make speeches for Governor Wilson without resigning from the Commission . Four years ago two Republican members of the Commission were strongly urged at a critical time in the campaign to get into Mr. Taft 's fight so as to help with the labor vote . I insisted that they should not do it , and the matter was brought before the Commission , and we then decided that no member of the Commission should take part in politics . So you see when the telegrams began to come in this year , urging that I go out to California and the other Pacific Coast states , I was compelled to say that I was stopped by my position of four years ago . I have never wanted to get into a campaign as much as I have this one . Governor Wilson represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty years in my State ; but I think that it would be almost fatal to the independence and high repute of this Commission for its members to take part in a national campaign . We have so much power that we can exercise upon the railroads and upon railroad men that any announcement made by a member of this Commission could properly be construed as a threat or a suggestion that should be heeded by the wise . I know that this view of the matter will appeal to you as entirely sensible when you reflect upon it , and to my impatient friends in California , to whom it has been very hard to say no . I am glad to see that you are holding the fight up so hard at the tail end of the campaign . That is when Democratic campaigns have so often been lost . Governor Wilson is maintaining himself splendidly , and our one danger has been over-confidence . Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# About the political situation he wrote to one of his former Assistants in the City and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asher Washington , October 22,1912 MY DEAR HUGO ,  --  I have your long letter which you promised in your telegram . Now , old man , I want to have a perfectly open talk with you . I understand your attitude of affectionate ambition for me , and I am mighty proud of it , that after the years we were associated together , the ups and downs we had , you feel the way you do . Wilson is going to be elected unless some miracle happens , and I would tremendously like to get out to California and speak to the people once more . You do not know just how the old lust for battle has come over me . Following your telegram came a letter from McCombs , the Chairman of the National Committee , saying that he had received a lot of telegrams urging him to have me go and that Governor Wilson would like me to . But I wrote him precisely as I have you . If the members of this Commission once get into politics , the institution is gone to hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish . This is the most powerful body in the United States , and we must act with a full sense of the responsibility that is on us ... As for being a member of Wilson 's Cabinet , I do n't want to be . In the first place I ca n't afford it . There is no Cabinet man here who lives on his salary , and as you know , I have got nothing else . I save nothing now out of the salary that I get , and if the social obligations of a Cabinet position were placed upon me I would have to run in debt ... Furthermore , I am doing just as big work and as satisfactory work as any member of the Cabinet . The work that a Cabinet officer chiefly does is to sign his name to letters or papers that other people write . There is very little constructive work done in any Cabinet office . While the glamour of intimate association with the President  --  the honor that comes from such a position  --  appeals to me , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appreciation ; yet the position that I occupy is one of so much power , and I am conscious so thoroughly of its usefulness , that I do not want to change it . I should be more or less close to the President anyway , I presume . His friends are my friends , and I shall have an opportunity to help make his administration a success by advising with him , if he desires my advice . Now , old man , I have talked to you very frankly , and I know that you will understand just what I mean . If I were out of office I would have been in Wilson 's campaign a year ago . If I wanted a Cabinet position now I would resign from the Commission and go out to help him . I think probably if I felt that California 's vote was necessary to Wilson 's success and that I could help to get it , I would take the latter course , although it is not clear that that would be my duty , in view of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as always , faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Francis G. Newlands Reno , Nevada Washington , October 28 , 1912 MY DEAR SENATOR ,  --  I am delighted at the receipt of your long letter , for I have been very anxious to know how you felt about your own State . Of course it has been a foregone conclusion for some time that Wilson would carry the United States , but I was desirous that you should carry Nevada for your own sake ... In my judgment the Interstate Trades Commission needs all of your concentrated energy for the next year . The bill should be your bill , and you should be the leading authority upon the matter . Wilson should look to you for advice along this line of dealing with the trust problem . He will , if you have the greater body of information upon the subject . Of course Roosevelt did not know where he was going as to his Trades Commission , and he would not have had any opportunity were he elected to go any farther , ... because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , you can see from his speeches , has swallowed Brandeis ' theory without knowing much about the problem , but he certainly has handled himself well during the campaign ... What he does will very largely depend , I think , upon those who surround him . He must have access to sources of information outside of the formal administrative officers who make up his Cabinet . This is a very delicate way of saying that he must have a sort of " kitchen cabinet " made up of men like you and myself who will be willing to talk frankly to him , and whom he will listen to with confidence and respect . If he can get the Southerners into line with the Northern Democrats he can make over the Democratic Party and give it a long lease of life . If he can not do this , and his party splits , Roosevelt 's party will come into possession of the country in four years , and hold it for a long time ...

Washington , November 6 , 1912 MY DEAR GOVERNOR ,  --  The door of opportunity has opened to the Progressive Democracy . I know that you will enter courageously . The struggle of the next four years will be to persuade our timid brethren to follow your leadership , " gentlemen unafraid . " I am persuaded from my experience here that no President can be a success unless he takes the position of a real party leader  --  the premier in Parliament as well as a chief executive . The theoretical idea of the President 's aloofness from Congress  --  of a President dealing with the National Legislature as if he were an independent government dealing with another  --  is wrong , because it has been demonstrated to be ineffective and ruinous . We need definiteness of program and cooperation between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue . There is generally one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes it is one , and sometimes the other .

There are many hopeful signs , as you say , not the least of which is that the Supreme Court has at last been moved to amend its equity rules . The whole agitation for judicial recall will do good because it will not lead to judicial recall but to the securing of a superior order of men on the bench and to simplified procedure . I find that it is better to decide matters promptly and sometimes wrongly than to have long delays . The people have very little confidence in our courts , and this is because of one reason : Our judges are not self-owned ; either they are dominated by a political machine or by associations of an even worse character . Few men on the bench are corrupt ; many of them are lazy , and others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am heartily in sympathy with a movement such as that you are promoting . It is in my opinion a very practical way  --  perhaps the only practical way  --  of heading off universal judicial recall .

They are not going to be unfair unless driven to be radical by intolerable conditions . ... Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# Immediately after Woodrow Wilson 's election in November , telegrams and letters from different parts of the country , and especially from his many friends in California , began to reach Lane asking that he should consider himself available for a Cabinet position , offering support and requesting his permission for them to make a strong effort in his behalf . This he emphatically refused , saying that he was not a candidate , but in spite of his refusals , editorials began to appear in many Western papers . @# To Charles K.

I know absolutely nothing about the suggestion made by the Call as to my being appointed to the Cabinet . I rather think that it was Ernest Simpson 's friendly act , though I have not heard from him at all . Three men have been to me from the Coast who wanted to be in the Cabinet , and I have told each one the same thing :  --  That I was not a candidate ; that no one would speak to the President for me with my consent ; but that I would not say that I would not accept an appointment , because I would do almost anything to make Wilson 's administration a success , for I believe that he has faced the right way and the only difficulty that he will have will be in securing strong enough support to carry out his own policies . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much less radical than he would voluntarily have made it . I do not know him and shall not go near him unless he sends for me . If he does send for me I shall tell him the truth regarding anybody of whom he speaks to me . I shall advocate nobody . I am not going to be a job peddler or solicitor . My present position makes all the demand upon my imagination , initiative , and capacity that my abilities justify . I could not work any harder or do any better work for the people in any position that the Government has to give . I am not at all enamored of the honor of a Cabinet place . Now , I am talking to you in the utmost frankness as if you were sitting just across the table from me . Of course what I am saying to you is absolutely private and personal . ...

Washington , November 26 , 1912 MY DEAR SIMPSON ,  --  How it ever entered into your head to give me so splendid a boom for a position in Wilson 's Cabinet I do not know . Someone suggested that the tip came from Ira Bennett at this end , and I see that the Sacramento Bee suggests that the railroads wish to remove me from my present sphere of troublesomeness ; but my own guess is that your own good heart and our long-time friendship was the sole cause of this most kindly act . Some of the California papers , I notice , have had editorials saying I should stay where I am ( which is not a disagreeable fate to be condemned to , barring a slight surplus of work ) , but of course Wilson is not going to appoint anyone to his Cabinet because of pull . He has a more difficult job than any President has ever had since Lincoln , because he has to reconcile a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy one with policies and another with offices . My guess is that he will have to turn over the whole question of patronage practically to his Cabinet and that he will become the actual leader of his party and attempt to formulate the legislative policies of the party . He has a distinct ideal of what the Presidency may be made . Whether he can make good under conditions so apparently irreconcilable is a question that time only can answer . His political family he will choose for himself . They ought to be the very largest men that our country can produce , and I am not fool enough to think that I am entitled to be in such a group . With the warmest thanks , my dear Simpson , for your kindness , believe me , as always , cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Fairfax Harrison Washington , November 26 , 191L MY DEAR MR . HARRISON ,  --  That is an exceedingly interesting and philosophical presentation of your reason for adherence to the Progressive Party . I understand your point of view and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Colonel Roosevelt would carry several of the Southern states . The Democratic party of the North is distinct from the Democratic party of the South , at least I fear that it is . The next four years will demonstrate the possibility of these two elements living together in effective cooperation . If Governor Wilson is a mere doctrinaire the present victory will be of no value to the Democratic party , but may be of great value to the country , for the horizontal cleavage in the two parties will become manifest , unmistakable , and open , and out of the breaking up will come a re-alignment upon real lines of tendency . If President Wilson attempts to do anything which satisfies the reasonable demand of the progressive North he will run counter to the traditional policy of the South ; that is to say , effective regulation of child labor , of interstate corporations  --  railroad and industrial  --  flood waters , irrigation projects . These , and a multitude of other matters make necessary the wiping out of state lines to the extent that a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our good Spanish friend said some centuries ago , " Where two men ride of a horse one must needs ride behind . " This fact is stronger than any written word , and facts are the things which statesmen deal with . If the South is large enough to see this  --  if it has grown to have national vision  --  the hope of the Northern Democrat can be realized . Otherwise the traditionalists of both North and South will make a party by themselves , and the rest of the country will follow in your lead into THE new party or A new party . With warm regards , believe me , cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To James P. Brown Washington , November 27 , 1912 MY DEAR JIM ,  --  I see your point of view and am glad you have taken the position that you have , because you can demonstrate whether there is anything excepting a sawed-off shot-gun that will compel some editors to tell the truth . ... I shall not read your pamphlet because I have too much other reading that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being totally ignorant on the subject , is that you have violated the Sherman Law , but everybody knows that the Sherman Law should be amended and the conditions stated upon which there may be combination . Do get out of your head , however , the idea that a railroad corporation and an industrial corporation are subject to the same philosophy , as to competition . One is necessarily a monopoly and therefore must be regulated ; the other is not necessarily a monopoly , and the least regulation that it can be subjected to the better . We have let things go free for so long that we have created a big problem that sane men must deal with sensibly ; not admitting all there is to be right , but recognizing every natural and legitimate economic tendency .

It is very good to know that you and President Wheeler have a sort of mutual agreement on me for a Cabinet position , but I do n't think of it for myself . ... I find that I do not have the ambition that I once had , excepting to do the work in hand just as well as possible , and I am altogether impatient with the way I do it . I should like to see you Secretary of the Treasury . There is to be some change made in our currency laws during the next four years , and a man of perfectly sane , level mind is tremendously needed to guide Wilson in this matter , for I guess he is very ignorant upon the subject . Especially is this true if Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Sid Mezes ' brother-in-law , is as close to Wilson as any other man , and I will drop him a note , telling him something about you , for I know that he is interested in selecting Cabinet officers as he has been talking to me about possible Attorney Generals . I have told him that I wanted nothing . ... Mezes is the same adroit diplomat that he has always been , since receiving the Presidency at Texas . He is doing big things for his University and says that in two or three years he will be in a position to retire , and will retire and spend the most of his time in Europe ; but unless my guess is wrong , his ambition has at last been fired and he will look for other worlds to conquer if he achieves what he is after in Texas .

Wigmore is a Progressive democrat with a capital P. and a small d ; can give reason for his faith based on his philosophy of government . He has national vision and has rare good common sense . The man who can write a good law book is rarely one who would make a good lobbyist , although Judah P. Benjamin was this sort of genius . So with Wigmore .

That he is headstrong , arbitrary , and positive , his friends admit . These are real virtues in this day of slackness and sloppiness . I have just returned from New York where I have talked with McAdoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advising him regarding his Cabinet , and they tell me he is a most satisfactory man to deal with . He listens quite patiently and makes up his mind , and then " stays put . " His Cabinet will be his advisers but no one will control him . I heard him make that speech at the Southern Society dinner , which was really much larger than the audience could understand . It was a presentation of the theory that the thought of the nation determined its destiny and that we could only have prosperity if our ideal was one of honor . His warning to Wall Street , that an artificial panic should not be created , was done in a most impressive way . ... I was asked to give the names of men from California who would make good Cabinet material , and I named Phelan and Adolph Miller . The currency question will be the big problem in the next two or three years , and I should like Wilson to have the benefit of as sane a mind as Miller 's ; but I fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some difficulty in getting a college professor to appoint another college professor . I hope we shall see you here soon . With holiday greetings to Mrs. Wheeler and the Boy , believe me , as always , faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO SIDNEY E. MEZES PRESIDENT , UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS Washington , December 23 , 1912 MY DEAR SID ,  --  I have your letter enclosing a telegram from Miller . I received a note from him acknowledging the telegram . He was evidently extremely delighted at being remembered . The sturdy , strong old Dutchman has a whole lot of sentiment in him ; and he makes few friends , has drawn pretty much to himself , I think , and falls back upon those whom he has known in earlier days . I sent a note to Mr. House regarding him . He would be a splendid man to have here in some capacity connected with the Government , now that we are to deal with currency matters . I told Mr. House that he could find out all about Miller from you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He certainly is an adroit and masterful diplomat . The fact is I do not know that I have seen a man who is altogether so capable of handling a delicate situation . By some look of the eye or appreciative smile at the right moment he gives you to understand his sympathy with and full comprehension of what you are saying to him . They tell me in New York that he is really the man closest to Wilson , and he tells me that Wilson is a delightful man to deal with because he has got a mind that is firm as a rock . ... I send my Christmas greetings to you both . We have a sick little girl on our hands , but she is coming along all right now . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To John H. Wigmore Washington , January 8,1913 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  ... You may not know it , but I suggested your name to Mr. House , an intimate of President-elect Wilson , for Attorney General . ... He told me that he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Southerners , I fear that Wilson 's idea is that he can declare a general policy and be indifferent as to the men who carry it out . There is a certain lack of effectiveness running through the South which makes for sloppiness and a lack of precision . I have found that generalizations do not get anywhere . The strength of any proposition lies in its application . The railroads and the trusts and the packers , and all the others who are violating the statutes , are indifferent as to how big the law is and upon what sound principles it is based , provided they have a lot of speechmakers to enforce the law . They do n't care what the law is ; their only concern is as to its enforcement . I am going to give the Democratic Party four years of honest trial , and then if it has not more precision , definiteness , and clearness of aim , am going to call myself a Progressive , or a Republican , or something else . Wilson is strong , capable of keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind . In these three respects he differs materially from our present President whose last flop on the arbitration of the Panama Canal proposition is characteristic . ... Now , old man , let me say to you that you must take the very best of care of yourself , for we need you more than anybody else in this country , right at this time . As always yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To John H. Wigmore Washington , January 20 , 1913 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  I have received both of your letters , and I am very glad that you made that mistake regarding my address for it brought me two letters instead of one . I received your Continental Legal History months ago and thought that I had acknowledged it with all kinds of appreciation , but perhaps I only thought the things . ... I turned the book over to Minister Loudon of the Netherlands who knew the Dutch professor who had written one of the articles , and the rascal has not returned the book , but I shall get it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly stirred because Wilson has frowned upon the Inaugural Ball  --  a very proper frown , to my way of thinking  --  but inasmuch as all of the merchants who advance money for the inaugural ceremonies recoup themselves from the receipts from the Inaugural Ball , there is much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth , and Wilson will enter Washington , in my judgment , a very unpopular president , locally . The fact is , I think , he is apt to prove one of the most tremendously disliked men in Washington that ever has been here . He has a great disrespect for individuals , and so far as I can discover a very large respect for the mass . His code is a little new to us ; and I feel justified in proceeding upon the theory that every man should help him , and that it is within his ( Wilson 's ) proper function to throw Mr. Everyman down whenever public good requires it , and that his silence never estops him from interfering at any time . Perhaps you can not make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my room at home with a very bad cold , and perhaps I do not know precisely what I mean myself ; but I am trying to say that under all circumstances Wilson regards himself as a free man , and that he is bound by no ties whatever to do anything or to follow any course ; that he recognizes no such thing as consistency , or logic , or gratitude , as in the slightest embarrassing him . ... I do hope that the President will get some capable effective administration officers who will take the burden of patronage off his shoulders and give him a chance to think on the money question , which is his big problem . I like his Chicago speech , I like his New York speech , but I do not find many people who understand him , because he is really a sort of philosopher . He teaches the psychology of new thought , the influence and effect of thought upon government . I have written an article for the World 's Work which is to appear in March , entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really sort of an answer to one or two articles that they have had upon the railroad side of the question of regulation  --  a demonstration of the chaotic condition of things that existed prior to the establishment of the Commission ; and that the effect of regulation has been to increase railroad earnings and put things upon a stable and more satisfactory basis . ... I find that I have a copy of the proofs in the office and I am going to send it to you and ask you to criticise it . ... With my love to your good wife , believe me , as always , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Joseph N. Teal Washington , January 20 , 1913 MY DEAR JOE ,  --  ... You know we practically have the power now to make a physical appraisement . ... We should not ourselves attempt to arrive at cost . That is a very hard thing for the railroads to furnish . They have taken good care to destroy most of the books and papers that would show cost . Politically , I hear of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more perfectly than anybody I have ever known , and nobody comes back from Trenton knowing anything more than when he went . ... The money question is going to be the big one , and it looks to me as though certain gentlemen were preparing to intimidate him with a panic , which they wo n't do because he will appeal to the country . He has got splendid nerve , and while Washington wo n't like him a little , little bit , the country , I think , will put him down as a very great President . As always , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Edward M. House Washington , January 22 , 1913 DEAR MR . HOUSE ,  --  You ask me what is the precise political situation on the Pacific Coast as to various candidates for the Cabinet . As I have told you , I am to be eliminated from consideration . California has but one candidate , one who was in Governor Wilson 's primary campaign and who made the fight for him in that state , in the person of James D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phelan will be given to the foremost man in the progressive fight in California . ... He is a brilliant speaker and a man of excellent business judgment . ... He has fine social quality and sufficient money to maintain such a position in proper dignity . Not to recognize him in some first-class manner would be a triumph for his enemies  --  and his enemies are the crooks of the state . Joseph N. Teal who is spoken of from Oregon as a possible Secretary of the Interior , is a good lawyer and a most public-spirited man who has been identified with every sane movement for progress in that state . He is a man of means and is deeply interested in questions of conservation and the improvement of our waterways . ... ... As a matter of party politics I do not think that any Pacific Coast state can be made Democratic by the appointment of a member of the Cabinet from it ; as a matter of national politics , it seems to be necessary that that part of the country should have a voice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a word or two on a more important matter . You realize , I presume ( and Governor Wilson evidently does ) that there is talk of a probable panic in the air . He dealt with this matter masterfully in his New York speech . Worse things than panic can befall a nation . We must preserve our self-respect as a self-governing people . But what is the cause of this loose talk ? Apprehension . The business interests of the country do not know what they are to expect . As a party we are too much given to generalization ; we have too little precision of thought . You will notice how the New York papers of yesterday speak of Governor Wilson 's bill regarding the regulation of trusts . This is something definite , and does not frighten because it is known . The problems we have to deal with  --  the tariff , currency , and trusts  - -  should all be dealt with in this same manner . The Administration should have a definite program on each one of these questions ; and I mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be presented as party measures at the very first possible moment . I have information that the banks are already saying that they will stop loans until these questions are dealt with . This is the way by which panic can be produced . The country is too prosperous to allow a widespread industrial panic if the measures favored by the Government commend themselves to the people as sane and necessary . Why ca n't we , as the boys on the street say , " beat them to it " ? If Congress is called by the middle of March , and the tariff is quickly put out of the way , and a currency bill promptly follows , we can restore the mind of the country to its normal state by midsummer . You know that this problem of government is largely one of psychology . The doctor must speak with definiteness and certainty to quiet the patient 's nerves , and the doctor is the party as represented in the President and Congress . With warm regards to Mrs. House , believe me , as always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , February 26 , 1913 MY DEAR MR . INNES ,  --  I received your pamphlet and have read it through with the deepest interest . These young men Footnote : A group of young men organized for social and political betterment , who sought advice. are deserving of the strongest encouragement . I have no criticism whatever to make of their prospectus  --  for that word , I presume , without slight , can be properly used . My conviction is that we can find no solution for the problems of social , political , economic , or spiritual unrest . " The man 's the man " philosophy has taken hold of the world . We have lost all traditional moorings . We have no religion . We have no philosophy . Our age is greater than any other that the world has seen . We have been lifted clear off our feet and taken up into a high place where we have been shown the universe . The result has been a tremendous and exaggerated growth of the ego , and we have regarded ourselves as masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sensualism , and sensualism had its foundation in hopelessness . We are materialists because we have no faith . This thing , however , is being changed . We are coming to recognize spiritual forces , and I put my hope for the future , not in a reduction in the high cost of living , nor in any scheme of government , but in a recognition by the people that after all there is a God in the world . Mind you , I have no religion , I attend no church , and I deal all day long with hard questions of economics , so that I am nothing of a preacher ; but I know that there never will come anything like peace or serenity by a mere redistribution of wealth , although that redistribution is necessary and must come . If I were these young men and wished to concentrate upon some economic question , I should put my time in on the cost of distribution . ... That is the economic problem of the next century  --  how to get the goods from the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; how to get the manufactured product from the factory to the house with the least possible expense . I have an idea that we have too many stores , too many middlemen , too much waste motion . So that I have only two thoughts to suggest : The first is that the ultimate problem is to substitute some adequate philosophy or religion for that which we have lost ; and the second is to concentrate on the simple economic problem . Have we the cheapest system of distribution possible ? ... Sincerely yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# @# VI SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR 1913-1915 Appointment as Secretary of the Interior  --  Reorganization of the Department  --  Home Club  --  Bills on Public Lands @# His appointment , as Secretary of the Interior , came to Lane in a letter from President-elect Wilson , stating that he was being " drafted " by the President for public service in his Cabinet . The letter was written about the middle of February , 1913 . The urgent manner of the appointment was caused by Lane 's frankly-expressed reluctance to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yet fuller accomplishment had been assured by his recent appointment as Chairman of the Commission . Seven years of application to the intricate problems of adjustment between the conflicting claims of the public , the shippers , and the railroads , did not solve all the issues involved in new and profoundly interesting cases coming up for adjudication . In addition to this natural desire to expand and perfect the technique of administration of his Commission , Lane dreaded the great increase in social and financial demands involved in a Cabinet position . In addition to these reasons , the change in service would mean work with men that he knew only slightly , if at all , and under a President whom he had never met . Perhaps the consideration that weighed more heavily than any of these , in his feeling of reluctance , was that the portfolio of the Department of the Interior , with its congeries of ill-assorted bureaus was in itself unattractive to a man with Lane 's love of logical order . His liking for strong team-work and for the building of morale among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible promise of gratification among bureau chiefs as unrelated as those of the General Land Office , the Indian Office , the Bureau of Pensions , Patent Office , Bureau of Education , Geological Survey , Reclamation Service , and Bureau of Mines . It was , therefore , with something of the spirit of a drafted man that Lane set his face toward his new work . Members of his immediate family recall days of depression after the appointment first came , but the cordial response of the press of the country to his appointment , the flooding in of many hundreds of letters and telegrams of congratulation , and President Wilson 's own cordiality  --  lifted Lane 's mood to its normal hopefulness . In relating the history of the appointment itself , Arthur W. Page , of the World 's Work , writes , after talking with E. M. House of the matter , " House recommended Lane , as perhaps the one man available , adapted to any Cabinet position from Secretary of State down . At one time Lane was slated for the War Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Interior because being a good conservationist , as a Western man he could promote conservation with more tact and less criticism than an Eastern man . " Confronted by a complex and definite task , Lane 's mind quickened to the attack . The situation of the Indian seized his sympathy . In his first official report he wrote , " That the Indian is confused in mind as to his status and very much at sea as to our ultimate purpose toward him is not surprising . For a hundred years he has been spun round like a blindfolded child in a game of blindman 's buff . Treated as an enemy at first , overcome , driven from his lands , negotiated with most formally as an independent nation , given by treaty a distinct boundary which was never to be changed while water runs and grass grows , ' he later found himself pushed beyond that boundary line , negotiated with again , and then set down upon a reservation , half captive , half protege . " With this at heart Lane wrote a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Assistant . @# To John H. Wigmore Washington , March 9,1913 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  I want you as my First Assistant . It is absolutely essential that I should have you ! ! I am aiming to gather around me the largest men whom I can secure and to form a cabinet of equals . Four years of this life here would bring a great deal of satisfaction to you . You would meet the distinguished men of the world . It is the center of all the great law movements of the world ,  --  for peace , international arbitration , reform in procedure , and such matters . Beside that , we have two or three of the greatest problems to meet and solve that have ever been presented to the American people . First in the public mind is the land problem . How can we develop our lands and yet save the interest of the Nation in them ? Second , and I think perhaps this should be first , is the Indian problem . Here we have thousands of Indians , as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property which is rapidly rising in value . I am their guardian . I must see that they are protected . They have schools over which we have absolute control  - -  the question of teachers that they are to have , the question of the kind of education that they are to be given , the question of industry that they are to pursue . Their morals , I understand , are in a frightful state , largely owing to our negligence and the lack of enforcement of our laws . We can save a great people ; and the First Assistant has this matter as his special care . I do not know of any place in the United States which calls for as much wisdom and for as great a soul as this particular job . I will give you men under you over whom you will have entire control and who will be to your liking . I will give you men to sit beside you at the table who will be of your own class . You can do more good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in forty where you are now . There are a lot of men who can teach law , and lots of men who can write the philosophy of the law , but there are few men who can put the spirit of righteousness into the business , social , and educational affairs of an entire race . Think of that work ! Beside that you have the constructive work in framing and helping to frame a line of policy as to the disposition of our national lands  --  the opening of Alaska . Now , John , I have looked over the entire United States and you are the only man that I want . The salary is five thousand a year . You can live on that here without embarrassment . The President will be delighted to have you , and you will find him treating you with the same consideration and giving you the same dignity that he does all the members of his Cabinet ; all the Supreme Court . I have never seen a man more considerate , more reasonable . Dr. Houston , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis , under an arrangement by which he can return at the end of his term . You , doubtless , could make a similar arrangement , and if you wish to , you will have plenty of opportunity to give one or two courses of lectures in the University during the year , I have thought seriously of going out to see you , but with Cabinet conditions as they are it is impossible , for we are passing upon important questions now that prevent that . I am very selfish in urging you to this , but I am also giving you an opportunity to do work that will be more congenial than any you have ever done , and to be with a more congenial lot of people . If there is any doubt in your mind let me know , but do n't say " No " to me . The country needs you . You have done a great work . There is nothing higher to be done in your line . Now come here and help in a great constructive policy . Sincerely and affectionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work Washington , March 12 , 1918 MY DEAR PAGE ,  --  I have just now seen your letter of March 2nd , else it would have had earlier recognition . The President is the most charming man imaginable to work with . Most of us in politics have been used to being lied about , but there has been a particularly active set of liars engaged in giving the country the impression that W. W. was what we call out West a " cold nose . " He is the most sympathetic , cordial and considerate presiding officer that can be imagined . And he sees so clearly . He has no fog in his brain . As you perhaps know , I did n't want to go into the Cabinet , but I am delighted that I was given the opportunity and accepted it , because of the personal relationship ; and I think all the Cabinet feel the way that I do . If we ca n't make this thing a success , the Democratic Party is absolutely gone , and entirely useless .

It was a surprise to me . It came at the last minute . I had to introduce myself to the President-elect the day before the inauguration . I find him consideration itself in Cabinet meetings and he never seems to be groping . In my mental processes I find myself constantly like a man climbing a mountain , pushing through belts of fog , but his way seems clear and definite .

I am struggling hard to get the reins of this six-horse team in my hands and every day I feel more acutely the weight of the responsibility that I bear . The last few weeks have been put in being interviewed by Senators and Congressmen , who wish to name men for the few positions in the office . It has been rather enjoyable , and they have been fair and by no means peremptory . The hardest place I have to fill is that of Commissioner of Indian Affairs . How absurd to try to get a man to handle the interests of an entire race , owning a thousand million dollars ' worth of property , and have to offer a salary of $5,000 a year ! I hope that you will feel free to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my department that may happen to come to you out of your great experience . As always , faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO LAWRENCE F. ABBOTT OUTLOOK Washington , April 9 , 1913 MY DEAR LAWRENCE ,  --  The Japanese are reducing the value of California lands by buying a piece in a picked valley , paying any price that is demanded . They swarm then over this particular piece of property until they reduce the value of all the adjacent land . No one wishes to be near them ; with the result that they buy or lease the adjoining land , and so they radiate from this center until now they have possession of some of the best valleys . Really the influx of the Japanese is quite as dangerous as that of the Chinese . The proposed legislation in California is not to exclude Japanese alone , but to make it impossible for any alien to own land , at least until he declares his intention to become a citizen . Inasmuch , of course , as Orientals can not become citizens , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , as in all things Californian , a good deal of hysteria over this matter , and I think your Progressive friends are trying to put the Democrats in a bit of a hole by making it appear that the Democrats are being influenced by the Federal Government to take a more conservative course than the Progressives desire . My information is that some restrictive legislation will be passed by the legislature , no matter what Japan 's attitude may be , but Japan 's face will be saved and every need met if the legislation is general in terms . ... @# April 20 , 1913 ... I do not like the sudden turn that Johnson seems to have taken in the last day or two but I still have faith that those people out there will do the sensible thing and allow us to save Japan 's face while very properly excluding the Japanese from owning land in California ; and I have no objection whatever to excluding all the Englishmen and Scotchmen who flock in there without any intention of becoming citizens . As always , yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FALLS TRIBUNE Washington , May 26 , 1913 MY DEAR MR . BOLE ,  --  That is just the kind of a letter that I want and that is helpful to me . As to the settler , I have one policy  - -  to make it as easy as possible under the law for the bonafide settler to get a home , and to make it just as difficult as possible for the dummy entryman to get land , which he will sell out to monopolies . These Western lands are needed for homes for the people , not as a basis of speculation . As to the Reclamation Service ... There really was a very bad showing made by the Montana projects . It was disheartening to feel that we had spent so many million dollars and that the Government was looked upon as a bunko sharp who had brought people into Montana where they were slowly starving to death . The Government has returned to Montana almost as much as her public lands have yielded , whereas in other states , like Oregon and California , less than a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Ever since I came here Senators and Congressmen have been overwhelming me with curses upon the Reclamation Service , and I thought I ought to find out for myself just what the facts were . I gave every one a chance to tell his story . Now I am being overwhelmed with protests against the discontinuance of this work . Every state is insisting that I shall now start up some new enterprises or continue some old ones , and I do not know where the money is going to come from . We are bound to be short of funds even to continue existing work , if we can get no money out of projects that are really under way , and there seems to be a unanimity of opinion among Western Senators and Congressmen that payment by the settlers must be postponed , because they are having a hard enough time as it now is .

Does he say anything as to how to make a reclamation project pay , or as to what is the best method of teaching Indians , or how much work a homesteader should do on his land before being entitled to patent ? These are the great and momentous questions that fill my mind . I had thought perhaps that as a member of the Cabinet I would have an opportunity , say once a month or so , to think upon questions of statecraft and policy , but I find myself locked in a cocoon  --  no wings and no chance for wings to grow .

My work here is just as interesting as any work that a Senator has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is any chance for a man who has not got a great deal of money .

There was also some talk of Patton getting into the race , and he is a good man . Thankfully and cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# Early in July , 1913 , Lane started on a tour of investigation of National Reclamation projects , Indian reservations and National Parks . With him went Adolph C. Miller , who had become the Director of the Bureau of National Parks in May . They turned to the Northwest , beginning in Minnesota and then proceeding to Montana , Wyoming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions in each place , Lane sent ahead of him an old friend and trusted employee , William A. Ryan , whose part it was to go over each project or reservation and find what the causes for complaint were , where poor work had been done , what groups and individuals were dissatisfied , and why . In no way was William Ryan to let it be suspected that he was in any way identified with the Department of the Interior . Traveling in this way , two weeks ahead of the Secretary , Ryan was able to put a complete report of each project in Lane 's hands some time before he arrived , so that the Secretary was thoroughly familiar with all complaints and conditions before he was met on the train by the representatives of the Department , who naturally wished to show him only the best work . In addition to this , Lane everywhere held public meetings , inviting all settlers to meet him and make their complaints . This plan enabled him to cover the ground touched by his Department in a comparatively short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interviewed all those who wished to see him upon business from seven in the morning until twelve or one at night . Sometimes , in a day , he went a hundred and fifty miles in an automobile , spoke to many groups of farmers in different places , heard their complaints against the Department , and told them what the Government was trying to do for them . During this first tour of inspection Lane reached Portland , Oregon , the latter part of August , and received a telegram from the President asking him to go directly to Denver , there to represent the President and address the Conference of Governors , on August 26th . Lane left the completion of the proposed itinerary of investigation , in Oregon , to Miller and turned back to Colorado . He made the opening address at the Governors ' Conference and then rejoined his party in San Francisco , the first of September . Here , after several days of conferences and speeches , while standing in the sun reviewing the Admission Day parade of the Native Sons , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angina pectoris which , several years later , returned with violence .

Illustration with caption : FRANKLIN K. LANE , MRS . LANE , MRS . MILLER , AND ADOLPH C. MILLER At the end of your little comment you spoke of conditions in the lower grades of the Department as being almost as bad as if they were corrupt . I have not your article before me , but I think this is the meat of it . I wish you would tell me just what you mean by this . I know that lots of things come to men like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained pretty well my old newspaper faculty of smoking things out . If we have anything here that is almost rotten , I want to know it before it gets thoroughly rotten . I have found a lot of things that were wrong , and have set most of them right . There has already been a great improvement ; for instance , in Indian affairs . Under the last Administration , for example , the highest bid on 200,000 acres of Indian oil lands was one-eighth royalty and a bonus of one dollar an acre . We recently leased 10,000 of these same acres at one-sixth royalty and a bonus of $500,000 . I have had an examination made into probate matters , in Oklahoma , and found an appalling condition of things . In one county where there are six thousand probate cases pending , all involving the interests of Indian minors , the guardians in three thousand cases were delinquent in filing reports , and otherwise in complying with the law . This week I have arranged with the Five Civilized Tribes to institute a cooperative method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration ; especially appointing an attorney to look after the interests of these minors in each of the counties in eastern Oklahoma . We are to aid the Oklahoma courts in cleaning up the State . Let me have any facts that will be of help . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE To Edward M. House Washington , November 19 , 1913 MY DEAR COLONEL ,  --  I had a call last Sunday morning from Mr. Blank of New York , who came to feel me out on the reorganization of the Democratic party in New York City , with particular reference to the question of how to treat one William R. Hearst ... ... He has been working for some years , evidently in more or less close but indirect alliance with Hearst , through Clarence Shearn and a man named O'Reilly , who is Hearst 's political secretary .

He would stand in with anybody and be as gentle as a queen dove for the purpose of destroying the existing organization , but that he was a very overbearing and arbitrary man , with whom no one could work in creating a new organization , unless he regarded himself as an employee of Hearst . Moreover , I did not see how it was possible to take Hearst and his crowd , even on a minority basis , so long as they were fighting the Administration , and that I understood Hearst had recently more emphatically than ever read himself out of the Democratic Party . I told Blank that ... I should not expect any cooperation between the Federal Government and an organization in which Hearst was a factor .

It has tended greatly to support me against the depth of sorrow which I felt at the beginning . There is no evidence of hysteria on her part , whatever . She dictated to Mrs. Lane , who was sitting beside her , some of the things that John said to her .

Adams Washington , January 10 , 1914 MY DEAR MR . ADAMS ,  --  ... Our most difficult problem is that of water . Colorado , for instance , claims that all of the water that falls within her borders can be used and should be used exclusively for the development of Colorado lands . Southern California has made a protest against my giving rights of way in the upper reaches of the Colorado for the diversion of water on to Colorado lands saying that Imperial Valley is entitled to the full normal flow of the Colorado . The group of men who hold land in Mexico south of the Imperial Valley make the same claim . Arizona wishes to have a large part of this water used on her soil , and the people of Colorado are divided as to whether the water should be carried over on to the eastern side of the Rockies or allowed to flow down in its natural channel on the western side . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rises in Colorado , where the Coloradans claim all the water can be used and can be put to the highest beneficial use .

If we recognize Colorado 's full claim there is probably enough water in Colorado to irrigate all of her soil , but portions of Wyoming , Nebraska , Arkansas , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , and Utah would remain desert . If you can tell me how to solve this problem so as to recognize the right that you claim Colorado has , and to maintain the rights that the Federal Government and the adjoining States have , I shall certainly be deeply grateful .

PRESIDENT ,  --  I have your note of yesterday referring to me the correspondence between yourself and the Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service employees in woman suffrage organizations . I think perhaps I am a prejudiced partisan in this matter for I believe that the women should have the right to agitate for the suffrage . Furthermore , I think they are going to get the suffrage , and that it would be politically unwise for the administration to create the impression that it was attempting to block the movement . I should think it the part of wisdom for you personally to make the announcement that women Civil Service employees will be protected in the right to join woman suffrage organizations and to participate in woman suffrage parades or meetings . This is practically what the Civil Service Commission says , but in a more careful , lawyer-like manner , whereas whatever is said should be said in a rather robust , forthright style . The real thing that we are after in making regulations as to political activity is to keep those who are in the employ of the Government from using their positions to further their personal ends or to serve some political party . What they may do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , so long as they do nothing toward breaking it down as a merit service , do not discredit the service , or render themselves unfit for it ... The spoils system is a combination of gratitude and blackmail . The merit system is an attempt to secure efficiency without recognizing friendship or fear . We can safely allow the participation of merit system employees in an agitation so long as they do not go to the point where official advantage may be had through the agitation by securing a reward through party success ... I believe you might well make a statement of two or three hundred words in which you could state your decision with the philosophy that underlies it , in such a manner as to make the women understand that you are taking a liberal attitude and yet protecting the full spirit of the Civil Service idea .

On Thursday , the War Department refused the use of an engineer for the Alaskan railroad . In one day I drafted and secured the passage of a joint resolution giving me the man I wanted .

The reply was that the matter must be held over till the next meeting , and meanwhile we were asked to suggest a program . Then I sent my message to you . I have told this to no one but Anne . You deserve no less than the fullest statement from me . Please treat it as the most sacred of secrets . Always gratefully yours , FRANKLIN K.

SHAW ,  --  Of course I saw the Review for April before your copies arrived , for somebody was good enough to tell me that there was a good word in it for me , and no matter how busy I am I always manage to read a boost ... You ask what I am doing to bring about team-work in the Department . Many things . As you probably do n't know , this has been a rather disjointed Department . It was intended originally that it should be called the Home Department , and its Secretary the Secretary for Home Affairs . How we come to have some of the bureaus I do n't know . Patents and Pensions , for instance , would not seem to have a very intimate connection with Indians and Irrigation . Education and Public Lands , the hot springs of Arkansas , and the asylum for the insane for the District of Columbia do not appear to have any natural affiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as independent entities , and I have sought to bring them together , centering in this office . One of the first things I did was to form what is called a Land Cabinet , made up of the Assistant Secretaries , the Commissioner of the Land Office , and the Director of the Geological Survey . We meet every Monday afternoon and go over our problems together . The Reclamation Commission is another organization of a similar sort , and we have constant conferences between the heads of bureaus which have to do with different branches of Indian work , lands , irrigation , and pensions . Some time ago in order to develop greater good feeling between the heads of the bureaus we organized a noonday mess , at which all the chiefs of bureaus and most of their assistants take their luncheon ... But the largest work , I think , in the way of promoting the right kind of spirit within the Department was the organization of the Home Club . This is a purely social institution , which the members themselves maintain . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiation fee and the same dues , and all meet upon a common ground in the club . Our club house is one of the finest old mansions in this city , formerly the residence of Schuyler Colfax ... It is a four-story building in LaFayette Square , within a half a block of the White House . This house we have furnished ourselves in very comfortable shape without the help of a dollar from the outside , and we maintain it upon dues of fifty cents a month . Each night during the week we have some form of entertainment in the club  --  moving pictures , or a lecture , or a dance , or a musicale . I organized this club for the purpose of showing to these people of moderate salaries what could be done by cooperation . It is managed entirely by the members of the Department . There is no caste line or snobbery in the institution , and for the first time the people in the different bureaus are becoming acquainted with each other , and enjoy the opportunities of club life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Washington a great service club , covering a block of land , containing fifteen or twenty thousand members , in which for a trifle per month we could get all of the advantages of the finest social and athletic club that New York contains . In the Home Club we have a billiard room , card rooms , a library , and a suite of rooms especially set aside for the ladies . We are fitting up one of the larger rooms as a gymnasium for the young men and boys , and expect to have bowling alleys , and possible tennis courts on a near-by lot . In this way I meet many of those who work with me , whom I never would see otherwise , and from the amount of work that the Department is doing , which is increasing , I am quite satisfied that it has helped to make the Department more efficient . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Charles K. Field Sunset Magazine Washington , April 18 , 1914 MY BEAR CHARLES ,  --  ... My picture on the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had taken for some time , and the Democratic donkey is encouragingly fat . I wish in some way it were possible to impress upon our Western Senators and Congressmen the advisability of putting through the bills that I have before Congress in line with my report  --  a general leasing bill , under which coal , oil , and phosphate lands could be developed by lease , and a water power bill . As it is now , a man runs the risk of going to jail to get a piece of coal land that is big enough to work ; and the very bad situation in the oil field in California is entirely due to the inapplicability of our oil land laws . We have a couple of million acres of good phosphate lands withdrawn , totally undeveloped because no one can get hold of them , and no capital will go into our Western power sites because we can give at present only a revocable permit , whereas capital wants the certainty of a fixed term . I have tried to draft laws , copies of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . I mean by that , that they are reasonable and will be passed by Congress if the West can only show a little interest in them , but so far the men who have been fighting them are Westerners . Why ? For no better reason than that these gentlemen are in favor of having all of the public lands turned over to the states . It is useless to argue this question as to whether it is right or wrong , because Congress would never do it , so that opposition to these bills is simply opposition to further development of the West . Now if you can punch these people up a bit in some way and make them understand that the West should want to go ahead , rather than block development for all time , ... you will be rendering a public service . With these few remarks I submit the matter to your prayerful consideration . As always , cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Frederic J.

The power trust is fighting the power bill , although as amended by the Senate Committee it is especially liberal and fair and will bring millions of dollars into the West for development of water power . There seems to be no real opposition to the western development bill , generally called the leasing bill , excepting from those who believe that all of our public lands should be turned over to the States . These are non-partisan measures . They have been drafted in Consultation with Republicans and Progressives , as well as Democrats , and I regard them as the ultimate word of generosity on the part of the Federal Government , because all of the money produced is to go into western development .

Do n't mind the slaps and raps that you get , regarding the high duty you perform . The people respect you as an entirely honest and efficient public servant . It did my heart good to hear the men I talked with speak so appreciatively of you . I enjoyed my two days with you as I have not enjoyed any two days for many years . The best thing in all this blooming world is the friendship that one fellow has for another .

You make some profound suggestions which would never in the world have occurred to me . The American believes that the doctrine of equality necessarily implies unlimited appeal . This is my psychological explanation for the unwillingness to give our judges more power . Another explanation is that the American people are governed by sets of words , one formula being that this is a government by law , hence the judge must have no discretion and rules must be arbitrary and fixed . I had a roaring good time in San Francisco . Spoke to fifty thousand people , and more , who could not hear me . Made a rotten speech and met those I loved best , so I am not altogether displeased with having taken the trip after all . Hope your arm is doing finely . Give my love to your dear wife .

I suppose if you were a few years younger you would be over in the trenches , or up in England getting ready . From all we hear , the Scotchmen are the only fellows that the Germans really are afraid of or entirely respect . The position of a neutral is a hard one . We are being generously damned by the Germans and the aggressive Irish for being pro-British , and the English press people and sympathizers in this country are generously damning us as the grossest of commercialists who are willing to sell them into the eternal slavery of Germany for the sake of selling a few bushels of wheat .

WHEELER ,  --  I am extremely obliged to you for your appreciative letter regarding my speech , Footnote : On the American Pioneer. but do n't publish it in the Poetry Department or you will absolutely ruin my reputation as a hard working official . No man in American politics can survive the reputation of being a poet . It is as bad as having a fine tenor voice , or knowing the difference between a Murillo and a Turner . The only reason I am forgiven for being occasionally flowery of speech is that I have been put down as having been one of those literary fellows in the past . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS ROME , ITALY Washington , March 13 , 1915 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  I have received three letters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . Your first and longest letter , but not a word too long , I thought so very good that I had it duplicated on the typewriter and sent a copy to each member of the Cabinet , excepting Bryan , whom you refer to in not too complimentary a manner . On the same day that I received this letter I received one from Pfeiffer , presenting the American merchants ' point of view , who desire to get goods from Germany , a copy of which I inclose . So I put your letter and his together , and told them all who you both are . Thus , old man , you have become a factor in the determination of international policy . Several members of the Cabinet have spoken with the warmest admiration of your letter , one scurrilous individual remarking that he was astonished to learn that I had such a learned literary gent as an intimate friend . We are just at present amused over the coming into port of the German converted cruiser Eitel , with the captain and the crew of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The calm gall of the thing really appeals to the American sense of humor . Here is a German captain , who captured a becalmed sailing ship , loaded with wheat , and blows her up ; sails through fifteen thousand miles of sea , in danger every day of being sunk by an English cruiser , and then calmly comes in to an American port for coal and repairs . The cheek of the thing is so monumental as to fairly captivate the American mind . What we shall do with him , of course , is a very considerable question . He can not be treated as a pirate , I suppose , because there can not be such a thing as a pirate ship commanded by an officer of a foreign navy and flying a foreign flag . But he plainly pursued the policy of a pirate , and I am expecting any day to find Germany apologizing and offering amends . But there may be some audacious logic by which Germany can justify such conduct . Talking of Belgium , I was referred the other day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the 10th volume of Cobbett 's Parliamentary Reports , touching the attack on Copenhagen by England in 1808 , in which the Ministry justified its ruthless attack upon a neutral power in almost precisely the same language that Von Bethmann Hollweg used in justifying the attack on Belgium , and Lord Ponsonby used the sort of reasoning then , in answer to the Government , that England is now using in answer to Germany . I was distrustful of the quotations that were given to me and looked the volume up , and found that England was governed by much the same idea that Germany was  --  just sheer necessity . Of course , your answer is that we have traveled a long way since 1808 . Does n't it look to you an impossible task for England and France to get beyond the Rhine , or even get there ? England , of course , has hardly tried her hand in the game yet and if the Turk is cleaned up she will have a lot of Australians and others to help out in Belgium .

Miller , now of the Federal Reserve Board , and Franklin D. Roosevelt , assistant Secretary of the Navy , who were going out to visit officially the Exposition , were the principal members of the party . In Berkeley , on March twenty-third , 1915 , Lane received his degree from the University of California . In conferring this degree President Wheeler said :  --  " Franklin K.

" By direction of the Regents of the University of California I confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Laws :  --  " Creative statesman in a democracy ; big-hearted American . " On December 7 , 1915 , upon receiving a copy of the diploma Lane wrote in acknowledgement to Dr. Wheeler ,  --  " I have the diploma which it has taken all the talent of the office to translate .

So I pass him along to you . Please see that he has the front bench and is called upon to open the congress with prayer , which , being a Yankee and a pirate , he undoubtedly can do in fine fashion .

Mezes lives among Hebrews , Lamb is broken-hearted that he can not get into the war , and Pfeiffer is trying to get England to let his German goods through Holland .

Von Hindenburg will come down upon Italy , when he has lured the Italians up into some pass and given them a sample of what the Russians got in East Prussia . You see I am in quite a prophetic mood this afternoon . Tell me if you understand Italy 's position  --  just how she justifies herself in entering the war ? I have seen no authoritative justification that I thought would hold water . The Coalition ministry in England is weaker than the Liberal ministry . Lord Northcliffe , who is the Hearst of England , has become its boss .

Neither has England answered our protest , sent some three months ago , against the invasion of our rights upon the seas .

The poor man has been so worried by the great responsibilities put upon him that he has not had time to think or deal with matters of internal concern . ... He is extremely appreciative of the spirit you have shown . I have a large number of matters in my own Department  - -  Alaskan railroad affairs and proposed legislation  --  that I ought to take up with him ; but I can not worry him with them while international concerns are so pressing . I feel that at last the country has come to a consciousness of the President 's magnitude . They see him as we do who are in close touch with him . ... My own ability to help him is very limited , for he is one of those men made by nature to tread the wine-press alone . The opportunity comes now and then to give a suggestion or to utter a word of warning , but on the whole I feel that he probably is less dependent upon others than any President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly so  --  for a man who sees comparatively few people , and yet he never takes public sentiment as offering a solution for a difficulty ; if he can think the thing through and arrive at the point where public sentiment supports him , so much the better .

In the fall I am going to ask you to lend a hand in support of my conservation bills , which look like piffling affairs now in contrast with the big events of the day . Once more I thank you heartily for your letter . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO GEORGE W. WICKERSHAM Washington , July 18 , 1915 MY DEAR AND DISTINGUISHED SIR ,  --  I once knew a vainglorious chap who wrote a poem on the Crucifixion of Christ .

" All of us feel " that-a-way " once in a while when we think of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words to say upon the German note next Tuesday . Footnote : Day of Cabinet meeting . They will be short and somewhat ugly Anglo-Saxon words , utterly undiplomatic , and I hope that some of them will be used . There is no man who has a greater capacity for indignation than the gentleman who has to write that note , and no man who has a sincerer feeling of dignity , and no man who dislikes more to have a damned army officer , filled with struttitudinousness , spit upon the American Flag  --  a damned goose-stepping army officer ! This morning comes word that they tried to torpedo the Orduna , but failed by a hair . This does not look like a reversal of policy . Of course those chaps think we are bluffing because we have been too polite . We have talked Princetonian English to a water-front bully . I did not believe for one moment that our friends , the Germans , were so unable to see any other standpoint than their own . I saw ex-secretary Nagel here the other day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmos Club . One of the men at the table said , " I think Lane ought to have been appointed Secretary of State .

" So you see I am cut out from all these great honors . Is this visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children ? I wish you joy in your work and I wish I could lay some of my troubles on your shoulders . Mrs. Lane and I are going up to see you just as soon as we get the chance . I had to decline to address the American Bar Association because I did not want to be away from here for a week .

I send you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been gotten up to suit the artistic taste of my private secretary . As always , FRANKLIN K. LANE TO FREDERIC J. LANE Washington , July 21 , 1915 MY DEAR FRITZ ,  --  I wish I could think of something I could do for you dear people back there . I have n't heard from George for a long while , but I hope he is getting something in mind that makes him think life worth living . It is strange that every lawyer I know would like to be situated just as George is , with a little farm in a quiet dell . Last night I talked with Senator Sutherland . It is his hope sometime to reach this ideal . And the other night I talked with Justice Lamar , and told him of George 's life , and he said that he had dreamt of such an existence for fifty years but has never been able to see his way to its realization . There is no chance of our getting out to the Coast this year . The President expects us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Mexican question , as to which I have presented a program to him which so far he has accepted . These are times of terrible strain upon him . I saw him last night for a couple of hours , and the responsibility of the situation weighs terribly upon him . How to keep us out of war and at the same time maintain our dignity  --  this is a task certainly large enough for the largest of men . Conditions politically are very unsettled , and much will turn I suppose on what Congress does . More and more I am getting to believe that it would be a good thing to have universal military service . To have a boy of eighteen given a couple of months for two or three years in the open would be a good thing for him and would develop a very strong national sense , which we much lack . The country believes that a man must be paid for doing anything for his country . We even propose to pay men for the time they put in drilling , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absurd ! We must all learn that sacrifices are necessary if we are to have a country . The theory of the American people , apparently , is that the country is to give , give , give , and buy everything that it gets . Hope things are going well with you . Drop me a line when you can . Affectionately , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS ROME , ITALY Washington , July 30 , 1915 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  Things have come to such a tension here that I doubt the wisdom of my discussing international politics with you ; nevertheless , I want you not to be weary in well-doing , but continue to give me the views of the Tory Squire . I hope that your admiration for Balfour will prove justified . Of course , our press , which can not be said to sympathize strongly with the conservative side , makes it appear that Lloyd George is now bearing a great part in the work of securing ammunition . This is the inevitable result of allowing the people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves to be the most useful in a time of emergency . However , it may be that Balfour is himself directing all that Lloyd George does . This morning 's papers contain an official statement from Petrograd suggesting that the English get to work upon the west line . This seems to me extremely unkind , inasmuch as the English have already lost over 300,000 and have furnished a large amount of money to Russia , I understand . Pfeiffer sent me an article the other day from a German professor , in which he said that the three million men that Kitchener talked about was all a bluff . Pfeiffer keeps sending me long protests against England 's attitude regarding our trade , which seem to me to be fair statements of international law . The word that I get rather leads me to believe that the war will last for at least another year and a half , which is quite in line with Kitchener 's prophecy , but where will all these countries be from a financial standpoint at the end of that time ? I fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually repudiate their debt , and what will become by that time of the high-spirited French , who are holding three hundred and fifty miles of line against eleven held by the British and thirty by the Belgians ? Yesterday I received a request from a German Independence League for my resignation , as I was born under the British flag and was supposed to be influential with the President , who has recently sent a very direct and business-like letter to Germany . My answer was that they had mistaken my nationality . My real name was Lange and my father had stricken out the G. ! Affectionately yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO EUGENE A. AVERY Washington , August 2 , 1915 MY DEAR AVERY ,  --  I am very glad to hear from you and to get your verse . I had a glorious time at Berkeley .

But after all is said and done , I guess I like him about as much , as I did in the enthusiastic days when we used to quiz old Moses . The streak of ideality that I had then I still retain . The reason that I have remained a Democrat is because I felt that we gave prime concern to the interests of men , as such , and had more faith that we could help on a revolution .

DAVIS Washington , August 2 , 1915 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  I am very glad to get your letter of July 28 , telling me your views regarding the last note . I believe the paragraph to which you refer was absolutely essential to make Germany understand that we meant business ; that she could not have taken our opposition seriously is evidenced by her previous note , and which , I think , was as insulting as any note ever addressed by one power to another . Think of the absurd proposition , that we should be allowed a certain number of ships to be prescribed by Germany upon which our people could sail ! Of course , if we accepted her conditions , we would have to accept the conditions that any other belligerent , or neutral , for that matter , might impose . What becomes of a neutral 's rights under these conditions ? The Leenalaw case shows that Germany can do exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give people a chance to get off the ship before they blow her up . This is good sense and good morals ; and the whole neutral world is behind us . If , in response to our note , Germany had said , " We regret the destruction of American lives , and are willing to make reparation , and have directed our submarines that they shall not torpedo any ships until the ship has been given an opportunity to halt , " there would have been no trouble ; but Germany evidently did not take us seriously . Our English was a bit too diplomatic . I am writing you thus frankly , and in confidence , of course , because I respect your opinion greatly . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE In the middle of August , Lane joined his family at Essex-on-Champlain , New York , for a few days . While there he went with Mr. and Mrs. James S. Harlan to Westport , some miles further south on the lake , to see the summer boat races and water sports . Mr. Harlan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his dock by Dick Mead , won the race , and that evening on their return Lane gave the following letter to the successful builder :  --  August 21 , 1915 To " Dick " Mead on winning the race at Westport in the Gladwater . We wonder sometimes why man was made , so full is life of things that terrorize , that sadden and embitter . This life is a sea ; tranquil sometimes but so often fierce and cruel . And you and I are conscript sailors . Whether we will or no we must sail the sea of life , and in a ship that each must build for himself . To each is given iron and unhewn timber , to some more and to some less , with which to fashion his craft . Then the race really starts . Some of us build ships that are no more than rafts , formless , lazy things that float . Fair weather things for moonlight nights . But others , high-hearted men of vision , will not be satisfied to drift with the current or accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than drift , and they must ! The timber and the iron become plastic under their touch . The dreams of the long night they test in the too-short day . They make and they unmake ; they drop their tools perhaps for a time and drift ; they despair and curse their impatient and unsatisfied souls . But rising , they set to work again , and one day comes the reward , the planks fit together , and feeling the purpose of the builder , clasp each other in firm and beautiful lines ; the unwilling metal at last melts into form and place and becomes the harmonious heart of the whole  --  and so a ship is born that masters the cruel sea , that cuts the fierce waves with a knife of courage . To dream and model , to join and file , to melt and carve , to balance and adjust , to test and to toil  --  these are the making of the ship .

Now that you have secured Italy to intervene , what is the necessity ? What have you to offer by way of a bribe ? I see that you are distributing territory generously . Or do you think that we should go in because we were threatened as England was  --  although she says it was Belgium that brought her in ?

If she says anything about a desire to get back to school , you can put it down as a bluff , and I trust that you will not swamp her with attentions and with company lest it should turn her head .

I judge from this that he is expecting a letter from her  --  or someone else . You are very good to be giving my little one such a fine time . My love to Maidie . Cordially yours , F. K. L. TO FREDERICK DIXON CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR Washington , October 7 , 1915 DEAR MR . DIXON ,  --  I have your letter of October 1st . You have asked me a very difficult question , which is really this :  --  How to get into a man 's nature an appreciation of our form of government and its benefits ? I can not answer this question . There are certain natures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of common authority , which is the essence of Democracy . They are instinctively monarchists . They love order more than liberty . They do not see how a balance can be struck between the two . By force of environment and education their sons may see otherwise . I know of no other way of making Americans , than by getting into them by environment and education a love for liberty and a recognition of its advantages . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE TO ROBERT H. PATCHIN Washington , November 27 , 1915 MY DEAR PATCHIN ,  --  Mrs. Lane and I would be delighted to join in your fiesta to Mrs. Eleanor Egan , but we just ca n't . Why ? Because we have a dinner on December 2nd , also because we are neutral . ... We can not countenance any one who has been in jail . To have been in jail proves poverty . Nor do we regard it as fitting that a young woman should have been torpedoed and spent forty-five minutes in the water splashing around like Mrs. Lecks or Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down or up like a heroine ? Then she would have had an atrocious iron statue erected in her honor among the other horrors in Central Park . After her experience she will doubtless be more sympathetic toward those of us who are torpedoed daily and weekly and monthly and have to splash around for the amusement of a curious public . I hope your dinner of welcome and rejoicing will be as gay as the cherubic smile of the Right Honorable Egan . Cordially , FRANKLIN K. LANE TO FRANCIS R. WALL Washington , November 27 , 1915 MY DEAR WALL ,  --  I wish that I had time for a long letter to you , such as yours to me . But I am only to-day able to get at my personal correspondence which has accumulated in the last six weeks . These have been times of annual reports and estimates , and we have a large number of internal troubles which need constant attention . I am afraid that we are going to have a great deal of trouble in getting our preparedness program through , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so anxious to take advantage of this emergency to raise the tariff duties and to gain credit for whatever is done in the way of preparation . We are too much dominated by partisanship to be really patriotic . This is a very broad indictment , but it seems to be justified . Of course , the people like Bryan and Ford , and the women generally , are moved by a philosophy that is too idealistic , and some of them are only moved , I fear , by an intense exaggerated ego . If I would have to name the one curse of the present day , I would say it is the love of notoriety and the assumption by almost everyone that his judgment is as good as that of the ablest . Of course , the trouble with the ablest people is that they are so largely moved by forces that do not appear on the surface , that one does not know that the views they express are really their own judgment . Democracy seems to be government by suspicion , in large part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . A man to be a good partisan seems called upon to believe that every man of different view is a crook or a weakling . This is the Roosevelt idea . And half of it is the Bryan idea . I wish that I could see you , old man , and have one of our old time talks . ... I shall bear in mind what you say as to the availability of your service , but I hope it may not be necessary to take you from that land of sunshine and dreams that seems so remote from this center of intrigue and trouble . Affectionately yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO JOHN H. WIGMORE Washington , December 8 , 1915 MY DEAR JOHN ,  --  ... Things are not looking at all nice as to Germany and Austria . I know that the country is not satisfied , at least part of it , with our patience , but I do n't see just what else we can do but be patient . Our ships are not needed anywhere , and our soldiers do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American ship . Of course , we do not know the details but the thing looks ugly . Was n't the President 's message on the hyphenated gentlemen bully ? You could not have beaten that yourself . And your dear friend T. Roosevelt , did certainly write himself down as one large and glorious ass in his criticism of the message . He hates Wilson so , that he has just lost his mind . I wish I did n't have to say this about Roosevelt , because I am extremely fond of him ( which you are not ) , but a poorer interview on the message could not have been written . ... As always yours , F. K. L. @# The following letter was written to Mrs. Adolph Miller when she was in a hospital in New York . @# TO MRS . ADOLPH C. MILLER Washington , December 12 , 1915 MY DEAR MARY ,  --  We have just returned from Church and all morning I have been thinking of you and Adolph  --  praying for you I suppose in my Pagan way . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just like to hold your hand or look steadily into your eyes , to tell you that you have the best thing that this world gives  --  friends who are one with you . I can see old Adolph with his grimness and his great love , which makes him more grim and far more mandatory , what a sturdy old Dutch Calvinist he is ! He really is more Dutch than German  --  Dutch modified by the California sun  --  and Calvinist sweetened by you and Boulder Creek , and Berkeley and William James and B. I. Wheeler and his Saint of a Mother . Well , let him pass , why should I talk of him when you really want me to talk of myself ! Last night we had the GRIDIRON dinner , and the President made an exalted speech . He is spiritually great , Mary , and do n't you dare smile and think of the widow ! We are all dual , old Emerson said it in his ESSAY ON FREE WILL , and Adolph can tell you what old Greek said it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two people walk side by side , to-day is Jekyll 's day , and tomorrow is Hyde 's , and so they alternate . Well , the GRIDIRON was a grind on Bryan and Villard and Ford , and a boost for preparedness and Garrison and the Army and Navy . Tell Adolph they had a Democratic mule , two men walking together under a cover , the head end reasonable , the hind end kicking  --  the front end of course represented the Wilson crowd and the hind end the Bryan-Kitchin ,  --  and the two would n't work together . The whole thing was splendidly done and was a lesson to the few Democrats who were there  --  which they wo n't learn . Nancy went to her second party last night  --  a joyous thing in a new evening cloak of old rose , which made her feel that Cleopatra and the Queen of Sheba and Mrs. Galt and all other exalted ladies had nothing on her . What a glorious thing life would be if we could remain children , with all the simple joys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is certainly a good fifty per cent chance that this fine spirit will marry some damn brute who will worry and harass the soul out of her . For so the world goes . I hope she 'll be as fortunate as you have been . To-night we go to the Polks to see Mrs. Martin Egan who was on a torpedoed ship in the Mediterranean , and although she could n't swim floated forty-five minutes till rescued . You must know the Polks well . She has very real charm and your old Mormon of a husband will desert his other fairies for her . Now I have gossiped and preached and prophesied and mourned and otherwise revealed what passes through a wandering mind in half an hour , so I send you , at the close of this screed , my blessing , which is a poor gift , and I would send you the parcel post limit of my love if it were n't for Anne and Adolph , who are narrow-minded Dutch Calvinists . May good fortune betide you and bring you back very soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . MAGNUS ANDERSEN Washington , D.C. , December 24 , 1915 MY DEAR MAUDIE ,  --  It is Christmas eve , and while Nancy and Anne are filling the mysterious stockings , I am writing these letters to the best of brothers and sister . It has been a long , a disgracefully long time since I wrote you , but I have kept in touch pretty well through George and Anne . ... So you have now a philosophy  --  something to hang to ! I am glad of it . The standpoint is the valuable thing . There are profound depths in the idea that lies under Christian Science , but like all other new things it goes to unreasonable lengths . " Be Moderate , " were the words written over the Temple on the Acropolis , and this applies to all things . This world is curiously complex , and no one knows how to answer all our puzzles . Sometimes I think that God himself does not . There is a fine poem by Emerson called , THE SPHINX , which is the most hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual world in which we live , for everything goes not singly but in pairs  --  good and evil , matter and mind . Then , too , you may be interested in his essay on FATE . Dear Fritz  --  dear , dear boy , how I wish I could be there with him , though I could do no good . ... Each night I pray for him , and I am so much of a Catholic that I pray to the only Saint I know or ever knew and ask her to help . If she lives her mind can reach the minds of the doctors just as surely as there is such a thing as transmission of thought between us , or hypnotism . I do n't need her to intercede with God , but I would like her to intercede with man . Why , oh why , do we not know whether she is or not ! Then all the universe would be explained to me . The only miracle that I care about is the resurrection . If we live again we certainly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation hope of religion . Anne has it with a certainty that is to me nothing less than amazing . And people of noble minds , of exalted spirits , not necessarily of greatest intellects have it . George has it in his own way , and he is certainly one of the real men of the earth . The President has it strongly . He is , in fact , deeply , truly religious . The slanders on him are infamous . ... We are to have the quietest possible Christmas . No one but ourselves at dinner  --  I give no presents at all  --  for financially we are up to our eyebrows . I probably will work all day except for an hour or two which I shall use in playing with Nancy , for her gay spirit will not allow anything but the Christmas spirit to prevail . She is so like our Dear One , so determined , cheerful , hopeful , courageous , yet very shy . Ned will be out all night at dances and tomorrow too , for he is a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent and he has plenty of dash . He is learning these things now which I learned only after many years , the little things which make the conventional man of the world . I hope that you will find the New Year one of great peace of mind and real serenity of soul . May you commune with the Spirit of the Infinite and find yourself growing more and more in the spiritual image of the Dear One . My tenderest love to you and to your good high-hearted man , and to the Boy . FRANK @# TO MRS . ADOLPH C. MILLER Washington 1915 This is a Christmas letter and is addressed :  --  " To a Brave Young Woman . " I am afraid it is not just as cheery and merry as it should be because , you see , it 's like this , I am poor  --  very , very poor , and I have very good taste  --  very , very good taste . Now those two things ca n't get on together at Christmas . Then , too , I am busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to shop . Now if you were very , very poor and had very , very good taste and were very , very busy and could n't shop  --  how in heaven could you buy anything for anyone ? I did take half an hour or so to look at things , and things were so ugly that were cheap that of course I could n't buy them without confessing poor taste , or they were so very expensive that I could n't buy them without confessing bankruptcy . Now there you are ! So what could a poor boy do but come home empty-handed , nothing for Anne or Nancy or Ned or you  --  not even something for myself ! And I need things , socks and pipe , and better writing paper than this , and music and toothpaste and some new clothes , and a house near your palace , and a more contented spirit and another job and Ahellofalotof things . Do n't get nervous about me , because I 'm not going to kill myself for lack of all these things , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it is dishonor not to be rich at Christmas time ; not to feel rich , anyway . But then let me see what I 've got ! There 's Anne ! I expect if sold on the block , at public auction , say in Alaska , where women are scarce , she would bring some price ; but her digestion is n't very good and her heart is quite weak and her hair is falling out . But these things , of course , the auctioneer would n't reveal . She would make a fine Duchess , but the market just now is overstocked with Duchesses . And she is a good provider when furnished with the provisions . Now there is Ned  --  he could hire out as a male assistant to a female dancer and get fifty a week , perhaps . Nancy could n't even do that . They are both liabilities . So there you are , with Duchesses on the contraband list , and Nancy not old enough to marry a decayed old Pittsburg millionaire , I will be compelled to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble husband would call quick , though they are live . I really do n't know what to do . I shall wait till Anne comes home and then , as usual , do what she says . I really did look for something for you . But the only thing I saw that I thought you would care for was a brooch , opal and diamonds for seven hundred and seventy-five dollars , so I said you would n't care for it . But I bought it for you A LA Christian Science . You have it , see ? I think you have it , that I gave it to you . And that Adolph does n't know it , see ? Well you have the opal and I am happy because you are enjoying it . Such fire ! What a superb setting ! And such refined taste , platinum , do you notice ! oh , so modest ! No one else has any such jewel . How Henry will admire it  --  and how mystified Adolph is ! Tell him you bought it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy seeing you wear it , and knowing that it bears in its fiery heart all the ardent poetry that I would fain pour out , but am deterred by my shyness . But you will understand ! Each night you must take it out just for a glimpse before saying your prayers . The opal is from Australia , the platinum from Siberia , the diamonds from Africa , the setting was designed in Paris . And here it is , the circle of the world has been made to secure this little thing of beauty for you . What symbolism ! I hope it will make you happy , and cause you to forget all your pain and weakness . It has given me great happiness to give you this little gift . And so we will both have a merry Christmas . FRANK @# @# VIII AMERICAN AND MEXICAN AFFAIRS 1916 On Writing English  --  Visit to Monticello  --  Citizenship for Indians  --  On Religion  --  American-Mexican Joint Commission @# TO WILLIAM M. BOLE GREAT FALLS TRIBUNE Washington , December 29 , 1915 DEAR BOLE ,  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated my annual report . Certainly my old newspaper training has stood me in good stead in writing my reports . In fact it always has , for while I was Corporation Counsel in San Francisco , and a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission , I wrote legal opinions that were intelligible to the layman , and I tried to present my facts in such manner as to make their presentation interesting . The result was that the courts read my opinions and sustained them , but whether they were equally impressive upon the strictly legal mind , I have my doubts , because you know inside the " union " there is a strong feeling that the argot of the bar must be spoken and the simplest legal questions dealt with in profound , philosophic , latinized vocabulary . I remember that after I was elected Corporation Counsel , when I was almost unknown to the bar of San Francisco , I began to hear criticism from my legal friends that my opinions were written in English that was too simple , so I indulged myself by writing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put on , writing in as many Latin phrases and as much old Norman French as was possible . This was by way of showing the crowd that I was still a member of the union . I find that all our scientific bureaus suffer from the same malady . These scientists write for each other , as the women say they dress for each other . One of the first orders that I issued was that our letters should be written in simple English , in words of one syllable if possible , and on one page if possible . Soon after I came here I found a letter from one of our lawyers to an Indian , explaining the conditions of his title , that was so involved and elaborately braided and beaded and fringed that I could not understand it myself . I outraged the sensibilities of every lawyer in the Department , and we have five hundred or more of them , by sending this letter back and asking that it be put in straightaway English . ... Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 Having just sent a wire to you I shall now indulge myself in a few minutes talk with that many-sided , multiple-natured , quite **33;186;TOOLONG person who is known to me as Mary Miller . The flash of brilliant crimson on the eastern side of the opal , do you catch it ? Now that is the flash of courage , the brilliant flame that will lead you to hold your head high . ... I like very much what you say as to wearing our jewel " discreetly but constantly . " No combination of words could more perfectly express the relationship which this bit of sunrise has established between us  --  devotion , loyalty , telepathic communication without publicity . I am sure you are belittling yourself . ... you are a game bird ,  - -  good , you understand , but with a tang , a something wild in flavor , a touch of the woods and mountain flowers and hidden dells in bosky places , and wanderings and sweet revolt against captivity . ... This is my first line of the New Year . Anne is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled with many things , getting ready for the raid of the Huns this afternoon . She says she will write when she repossesses herself of her right arm . Good health ! Some days later ... I have been receiving your wireless messages all week , my dear Mary , and not one was an S. O. S. Good ! The fair ship MARY MILLER is safe . Hurrah ! She never has been staunch , but she was the gayest thing on the sea , and when her sails were all set from jib to spanker she made a gladsome sight , and some speed . Of course , being so gay she was venturesome . That 's where the Devil comes in . He is always looking about for the gay things . He hates anything that does n't make medicine for him . If you are gay you are likely to be venturesome , and if venturesome , you can be led astray . So the good ship MARY MILLER instead of hugging the shore took a try at the vasty deep and got all blown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wireless worked and now with a little puttering along in the sunshine and a lazy sea , she will be her gay self once more , and like Kipling 's Three Decker will " carry tired people to the Islands of the Blest . " That was a most charming letter you sent me , a real bit of intimate talk . Anne read it first . She is very careful as to my reading . And I was glad to know that she could discover nothing in it which might injuriously affect my trustful young mind . Anne is really a good woman . I do n't believe in husband 's abusing their wives , publicly . Good manners are essential to happiness in married life . We are short on manners in this country , and that explains the prevalence of divorce . How much better , as our friend L. Sterne once said , " These things are ordered in France . " F.

As I am dictating this letter I look up at the wall and discover there the head of a bull moose , and that bull moose makes me think of all the things you said four years ago about Roosevelt . And now he is to be again the master of your party  --  perhaps not a candidate , because he may be guilty of an act of self-abnegation and put away the crown , or take it in his own hands and place it upon some one else 's brow . I remember the manner  --  the scornful , satirical , sometimes pitiful and sometimes abusive manner  --  in which you treated the Bull Moose ; and so we are going to have a great spectacle , the Bull Moose and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elephant 's shoulders will be the crowned mahout with the big barbed stick in his hand , telling you which way to turn and when to kneel ! Of course , you will abuse us all for our land policies , but overlook the fact that the brutalities of these policies were committed in other days  --  those good , old Republican days . It really is a wonder that you are not cynical and that you still have enthusiasm . I should not be surprised if you said your prayers and had belief in another world , where all the bad Democrats would sizzle to the eternal joy of the good Republicans . In those days I shall look up to you and I know that you will not deny me the drop of cold water .

In 1912 , 1914 , and 1916 the newspapers in different parts of the country mentioned him as a probable appointee . While , as a young lawyer , this office had seemed to him to be one greatly to be desired , after he came to Washington and knew more of the nature of the cases that necessarily formed the greater part of the work passed upon by the Supreme Court , his interest waned .

I regret greatly that you are not the President of the United States , but he seems to have a notion that it would be a shame to spoil an excellent Secretary of the Interior . Talking of robes , there is an idea in Chesterton that is not bad , that all those who exercise power in the world wear skirts  --  the judge , who can officially kill a man ; the woman , who can unofficially do the same thing ; and the King , who is the State ; likewise the Pope , who can save the souls of all .

I am visualizing you as by my side and addressing you in person . First , no doubt , you will care to hear of the reception given at the White House last evening . According to your directions , I first dined with the Secretary of Agriculture , his wife , and a lady from Providence . ... Going then to the White House we socialized for a few minutes before proceeding down stairs . The President expressed himself as regretting your absence , and the President 's lady , having heard from you , expressed solicitude as to your health . I loitered for a few minutes behind the line and then betook me to the President 's library , where I spent most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden that it was to have a Congress on his hands . Bernard Shaw writes of the Superman , and so does , I believe , the crazy philosopher of Germany . I was convinced last night that I had met one in the flesh . ... The President is cheerful , regarding his Western tour as one of triumph . His lady still wears the smile which has given her such pre-eminence . Mrs. Marshall was in line , looking like a girl of twenty . Those absent were the Wife of the Secretary of War , the wife of the Secretary of the Interior , and the wife of the Secretary of Labor . ... You have two most excellent children , dear madam  --  a youth of some eighteen years who has a frisky wit and a more frisky pair of feet . Your daughter is a most charming witch . I mean by this not to refer to her age ... but to that combination of poise , directness , tenderness , fire , hypocrisy , and other feminine virtues which go to make up the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am inclined to believe that Mr. Ruggles , of Red Gap , would not regard either your son or your daughter as fitted for those high social circles in which they move by reason of the precision of their vocabulary or their extreme reserve in manner , both being of very distinct personality . One is flint and the other steel , I find , so that fire is struck when they come together . While engaged , however , in the game of draw poker , these antipathetic qualities do not reveal themselves in such a manner as to seriously affect domestic peace . I have spent two entire evenings with your children , much to my entertainment . That I will not be able to enjoy this evening with them is a matter of regret , but I am committed to a dinner with the Honorable Kirke Porter , and tomorrow evening I believe that I am to dine with the lady on R.

No one , in fact , throughout the evening alluded to this miscarriage of wisdom . ... ... Much solicitude was expressed by many of those present regarding your health . I told them in my off-hand manner that I was enjoying your absence greatly . ... Having now had this most enjoyable talk with you , I shall delight myself with an hour 's discussion of oil leases upon the Osage Reservation with one Cato Sells .

I certainly will not despair of your being cured until every possible resource has been exhausted . The odds , it seems to me , are in your favor . Whenever Abrams and Vecchi say that they have done all that they can , if you are still in condition to travel , I want you to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet you . ... I wrote you from the train the other day on my way to Harpers Ferry , where I took an auto and went down through the Shenandoah Valley and across the mountains to Charlottesville , where the University of Virginia is . I went with the Harlans . Anne joined us at Charlottesville . ... We visited Monticello , where Jefferson lived , and saw a country quite as beautiful as any valley I know of in California , not even excepting the Santa Clara Valley , in prune blossom time . Those old fellows who built their houses a hundred years ago knew how to build and build beautifully . We have no such places in California as some that were built a hundred and fifty years ago in Virginia , and they did not care how far they got away from town , in those days . Jefferson 's house is up on the top of a hill , as are most of the others ,  --  there are very few on the roads . Most of them are from a mile to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber they built of brick , and imported Italian laborers to do the wood-carving . When I think of how much less in money and in trouble make a place far more magnificent in California , I wonder our people have not lovelier places . Of course , the difference is that in Virginia there were just three classes of people  --  the aristocrat , the middle class , and the negroes . The aristocracy had the land , the middle class were the artisans , and the negroes the slaves . The only ones who had fine houses were the aristocracy , whereas with us the great mass of our people are business and professional men of comparatively small means and we have few men who build palaces . Things have blown up in Ireland , I see , and the Irish are going to suffer for this foolish venture . This man Casement who is posing as the George Washington of the Irish revolution , has held office all his life under the English Government and now draws a pension . His last position was that of Consul General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a year or so ago , in which he proposed an alliance between Germany , the Republic of Ireland , and the Republic of the United States , which should control the politics of the world . ...

This bill , as you know , covers oil , phosphate , and potash lands . ... There are three million acres of phosphate lands , two and a half million acres of oil lands , and a small acreage of potash lands , under withdrawal now , that can not be developed because of lack of legislation . ... The situation here is tense . Of course , nobody knows what will be done . I favor telling Germany that we will make no trade with her , and if she fails to make good her word we will stop talking to her altogether . I am getting tired of having the Kaiser and Carranza vent their impudence at our expense , because they know we do not want to go to war and because they want to keep their own people in line . ... Cordially yours , LANE @# TO GEORGE W.

And just because we love you , and love ourselves even better , we will break all rules , precedents , promises , appointments , agreements , and covenants of all kinds whatsoever , and steal over to see you a week from Saturday . Just what hour I will wire you , and what time we can stay depends upon things various and sundry . But you may depend upon it that it will be as long a time as a very flexible conscience will permit . Remember me , in terms of endearment , to that noble lady who desolated Washington by her departure . As always , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO H. B. BROUGHAM Washington , May 20 , 1916 DEAR MR . BROUGHAM ,  --  ... I recently returned from the Yankton Sioux Reservation in South Dakota where I admitted some one hundred and fifty competent Indians to full American citizenship in accordance with a ritual . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians . Why should not some such ceremony as this be used when we give citizenship to foreigners who come to this country ? Surely it tends to instil patriotism and presents the duties of citizenship in a manner that leaves a lasting impression . Here is a story that should be interesting to all , if properly presented . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE INDIAN RITUAL ADMISSION TO CITIZENSHIP The Secretary stands before one of the candidates and says :  --  " Joseph T. Cook , what was your Indian name ? " " Tunkansapa , " answers the Indian . " Tunkansapa , I hand you a bow and arrow . Take this bow and shoot the arrow . " The Indian does so . " Tunkansapa , you have shot your last arrow . That means you are no longer to live the life of an Indian . You are from this day forward to live the life of the white man . But you may keep that arrow . It will be to you a symbol of your noble race and of the pride you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . " Addressing Tunkansapa by his white name . " Joseph T. Cook , take in your hands this plough . " Cook does so . " This act means that you have chosen to live the life of the white man . The white man lives by work . From the earth we must all get our living , and the earth will not yield unless man pours upon it the sweat of his brow . " Joseph T. Cook , I give you a purse . It will always say to you that the money you gain must be wisely kept . The wise man saves his money , so that when the sun does not smile and the grass does not grow he will not starve . " The Secretary now takes up the American flag . He and the Indian hold it together . " I give into your hands the flag of your country . This is the only flag you ever will have . It is the flag of free men , the flag of a hundred million free men and women , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request to make of you , Joseph T. Cook , that you repeat these words . " Cook then repeats the following after the Secretary . " Forasmuch as the President has said that I am worthy to be a citizen of the United States , I now promise this flag that I will give my hands , my head , and my heart to the doing of all that will make me a true American citizen . " The Secretary then takes a badge upon which is the American eagle , with the national colors , and , pinning it upon the Indian 's breast , speaks as follows :  --  " And now , beneath this flag , I place upon your breast the emblem of citizenship . Wear this badge always , and may the eagle that is on it never see you do aught of which the flag will not be proud . " @# TO FREDERIC J. LANE Washington , June 6 , 1916 MY DEAR FRITZ ,  --  We have a letter from Mary this morning saying you are holding your own pretty well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still convinced that he is right , which is also good news . By the same mail I learn that Hugo Asher was hit by a train and nearly killed . Whether he will recover or not is a question . Asher is a most lovable fellow and loyal to the core . It would break my heart to have him go . I got into my fight with Hearst over Asher . His people demanded that I should fire Asher , and I refused to do it . I guess you are beaten on Roosevelt , old man . The word that we get here is that he is done for at Chicago . Of course before this gets to you the nomination will be made . My own thought has been that he laid too much stress on the support of big business . To have Gary , and Armour , and Perkins as your chief boomers does n't make you very popular in Kansas and Iowa . Hughes may be the easiest man to beat , after all , because he vetoed the Income tax amendment in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are pretty popular . He is a good man , honest and fine , but not a liberal . The whole Congressional push has been for Hughes for months , but I have n't believed that he would accept the nomination . I made the prophesy to some newspaper men the other day that Roosevelt would get in and endorse Hughes with both fists . They were inclined to doubt this , but I still believe that I am right . ... To-day , comes word that Kitchener has been drowned and Yuan Shi Kai poisoned . Heaven knows whose turn comes next . Just think of three such events within a week as that sea battle off Denmark , the greatest naval battle of the world ; the torpedoing of the Secretary of War and all of his staff ; and the poisoning of the Emperor of China . I doubt if there ever was a period in the whole history of the world when things moved as fast and there was as much that was exciting . Of course now we have it all thrown onto a screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago we would have had to wait for perhaps a year before knowing that the Emperor of China had been killed . Nevertheless I think there is more passion and violence on exhibition to-day than at any time in a great many years . I had a talk with the President the other day which was very touching . He made reference to the infamous stories that are being circulated regarding him with such indignation and pathos that I felt really very sorry for him . I suppose that these stories will be believed by some and made the basis of a very nasty kind of campaign . But there is no truth in them and yet a man ca n't deny them . It is a strange thing that when a man is not liable to any other charge they trump up some story about a woman . ... Now my dear boy , may you have a continuance of courage , for there is no telling what day the tide may turn and things swing your way . We know so damned little about nature yet . Affectionately yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHITE HOUSE Washington , June 8 , 1916 MY DEAR MR . PRESIDENT ,  --  I see by the papers that it is repeatedly announced that you are writing the platform . Now I want to take the liberty of saying that this is not altogether good news to me . Our platform should contain such an appreciation of you and your administration , that you could not write it , much less have it known that you have written it . It should be one long joyful shout of exultation over the achievements of the Administration , and I ca n't quite see you leading the shout . The Republican party was for half a century a constructive party , and the Democratic party was the party of negation and complaint . We have taken the play from them . The Democratic party has become the party of construction . You have outlined new policies and put them into effect through every department , from State to Labor . Therefore , our platform should be generously filled with words of boasting that will hearten and make proud the Democrats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . If there is any truth at all in the newspaper statement and any purpose in making it , perhaps the end that is desired might be reached by a statement that you are not undertaking to write the platform , but that at the request of some of the leaders you are giving them a concrete statement of your foreign policy . Faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO MRS . FRANKLIN K. LANE ESSEX ON CHAMPLAIN , N. Y. Washington , June 22 , 1918 MY DEAR ANNE ,  --  I am just back this minute from Brown University where I had a right good time . I arrived in the morning early and kept the Dean waiting for me for a half an hour . ... After breakfast I went over to the University grounds , which are very quaint , on the crest of a hill with fine old buildings , and there found that Hughes was the hero of the day , of course ; every step he took he was cheered . He was very genial about it . We marched in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England town to a meeting house one hundred and seventy-five years old , and there we sat in pews , while the President of Brown , Mr. Faunce , gave the degrees in Latin . I have not heard so much Latin since I left school . There were a pretty good looking lot of boys , about half of them New Englanders and about half of them Westerners . We heard some orations by the students and then marched up the hill again where we had lunch , and then went over to a great tent on the campus where William Roscoe Thayer  --  who wrote the life of Hay  --  President Faunce , Judge Brown , Mr. Hughes , and I spoke . I spoke for about half an hour . My speech fitted in very well , because Thayer preceded me , and he spoke of the lack of an American spirit ; I had already prepared a speech upon the abundance of American spirit , Footnote : Speech published in book entitled , The American Spirit. so that I answered Thayer , and answered him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing weak in her American pride or her vigor that we would take these boys and carry them out West where there was not any lack of virility or hardiness or red blood , and that if they wanted to know whether the American was willing to fight or not , to go to any recruiting office of the United States to-day and see how crowded it was . I told them about our pioneers , who were taking up ten or twelve million acres of land , the men who had gone to Alaska , and then turned upon the real proposition which was that there was a difference between national spirit and martial spirit . War used to be the only opportunity for glory or romance or achievement , while there are a million other opportunities now open , because man 's imagination has grown . In the morning the College had given honorary degrees of LL.D . to Brand Whitlock and Herbert Hoover . So when I came to the close of my talk I told them about Hoover 's Belgian work , and that Brand Whitlock had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English and no French and no Italian and no Spanish and no other flag in Brussels , the Stars and Stripes in front of the American Legation had never come down , and the Belgian peasant when he went to his work in the morning took his hat off in honor of our flag , and I asked those people to stand with me in front of that peasant to take their hats off and take heart . Well , I had the crowd with me right along . Then Hughes came and he took American Spirit as his text , and he made it quite evident what his campaign is going to be ; that it is going to be a charge , veiled and very poorly supported by facts , that we have not known where we were going , that we were vacillating , that we did not have any enthusiasm , that we did not arouse the people and make them feel proud that they were Americans . How in the mischief he is going to get away with this , I do not understand . Whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , or everybody in the world ? Were we to war with the entire outfit ? He seems to be able to have satisfied the Providence Journal , which is run by an Australian who has been running the spy system for the British Embassy , and has been printing a lot ... about Germany and all the German press . If he can get away with this he is some politician . I see that Teddy has had an understanding with him . Von Meyer was there yesterday to hold a conference with him . But I do not think that we lost anything in the discussion of yesterday . There were not any Democrats there who were not on their toes at the end of the meeting ; but , of course , practically everybody in Rhode Island is a Republican . It is the closest thing to a proprietary estate that I have ever seen . ... I left at 6 o'clock and on my way back met President Vincent , of Minneapolis , and George Foster Peabody . You knew that Frank Kellogg was nominated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clapp running third ? ... FRANKLIN K. LANE @# TO MRS . ADOLPH MILLER Washington , July 4 , 1916 ... I see you with blooming cheeks and star-lit eyes peeping out from under a sun-bonnet , enshrined in all the glories of the mountain redwoods , and I long to be with you if only to get some of the freshness and joy of the California mountains into my rather desolate soul . How is the old clam ? Do his lips come together in that precise Prussian way , and does he order the universe about ? Or does a new spirit come over him when he gets with nature ? Is she a soothing mistress who smooths his stiff hair with her soft hand , and pats his cheek and nestles him in her arms , and with her cool breath makes him forget a federal , or any other kind , of reserve ? Why has nature been so unkind to me as to make me a lover but always from afar , never to come near her , never to compel me to a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to so surround me as to keep out the world of fools and follies and pharisees ? You know , I would like to write some servant girl novels . I believe I could do it . My love-making would either be rather tame and stiff or too intensely early Victorian . But I should like to swing off into an ecstasy of large turgid words and let my mind hear the mushy housemaid cry , " Is n't that just too sweet ! " ... I enclose a copy of my speech made at Brown University . Perhaps it will interest that old farmer potato bug . He does not deserve to have it said , but I miss him very much . Please obey him an you love me . Cut out all social activities , giving yourself up to the acquisition of a few more of the right kind of corpuscles in your too-blue blood . As always , yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To Mrs. Franklin K. Lane Essex-on-Champlain Washington , July 4 , 1916 ... There is no news that I can give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer . I think Heney will run for Senator in California , probably against Hiram Johnson . Will Crocker is also said to be a candidate for the Republican nomination . I could get the nomination by saying that I would accept . Phelan told me yesterday that he would see that all the necessary money was raised ,  --  that I could win in a walk . Dockweiler says the same thing . The latter is here and we have seen much of each other . What do you say if I run for Senator ? I really feel very much tempted to do it at times because things have been made so uncomfortable by some of my fool colleagues who have butted in on my affairs ; and then I feel I would like the excitement of the stump and to make the personal appeal once more . You could go round with me over the State in an automobile . While I would not insist upon your making speeches for me , I know that your presence would add greatly to my success . There is no telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landslide for Wilson , it may be a landslide the other way . We have the hazards because we have the decision of questions . There is bound to be a lot of objection to whatever course we take with regard to Mexico . I fear from what Benjamin Ide Wheeler told me the other day that Germany any day may decide to put her submarines into active service again on the old lines , especially if things on land go as they have been going lately against the Teutons . ... I shall not decide in favor of accepting the nomination until I hear from you . In the meantime do n't lose any sleep over it . And so my Nancy has a beau ? Well , the little rascal must be given some good advice now . So I shall turn my attention to her ... F.K.L. Washington , July 24 , 1916 ... To-day I have spent most quietly ,  --  had Bill Wheeler up for breakfast and then went to the Cosmos Club for lunch with Dockweiler . He is very anxious to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want Chief Justice White , but I fear the President wo n't ask him ... Dear old Dockweiler is an awfully good man ... From youth he has gauged every act by his conception of the will of God , and in doubt has asked God 's representative , the priest . What a comforting thing to have a church like that ; it makes for happiness , if it does not make for progress . Why is it that progress must come from discontent ? The latter is the divine spark in man , no doubt , " O to be satisfied , satisfied , Only to lie at Thy feet . " is a hymn we used to sing in church . We yearn to be satisfied and yet we know because we are not satisfied we grow . ... " The mystical hanker after something higher , " is religion , and yet it should not be all of religion ; for man 's own sake there should be some cross to which one can cling , some Christ who can hear and give peace to the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I can not feel that once you have a free spirit that it is right to go back into the monastery , and shut yourself up away from doubts , making your soul strong only through prayer . There are two principles in the world fighting all the time , and the one makes the other possible . There is no " perfect , " there is a " better " only . And in this fight one does not become better by prayer  - -  prayer is only the ammunition wagon , the supply train , where one can get masks for poison gas and cartridges for the guns . Pfeiffer said a good thing the other day , quite like him to say it , too . We were talking of churches and he said he never went to one because he did not believe in abasing or prostrating himself before God , he saw no sense in it ; God did n't respect one for it , and moreover he was part of God himself and he could n't prostrate himself before himself . I asked him if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " No , the higher you hold your head the more God-like you are . " Humility , to me , seems to be the basis of sympathy . We stoop to conquer in that we are not self-assertive and self-assured , for if we " know " that we are right we can not know how others think or feel . We can not grow . You know there are two great classes of people , those who are challenged by what they see , and those who are not . Now the only kind who grow are the former . But what is it to grow ? If we " evermore come out by that same door wherein we went " surely there is no object in being curious . Can there be growth when we are in an endless circle ? ... Now after all my struggle , I fall back not on reason but on instinct , on a primal desire , and perhaps this is my rudimentary soul , the mystical hanker after something higher . That is a real thing . The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make it very important to me . That being so I can not overlook it , and must obey it . The thing that pleases me as I look back upon it , is the thing I must do ; that sets the standard for me ; that is morals and religion . If there is any chap who the day after sings with joy over being a devil  --  that man I never heard of  --  but if he takes delight in what he did that was fiendish , then he must follow and should follow that bent until he SEES that it is fiendish . He has to have more light . But I really do n't believe there is any such fellow , who clearly sees what he did and rejoices in it . All of us sing , " I want to be an angel . " THERE is the whole of revelation , and all things that tend to make us gratify that desire are good . I guess that is pragmatism , in words of one syllable . You see that all religion comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically , in the old time , to the devil and tried to propitiate him , so that harm would not come to us . That is stage number one in our climb . Then we find the good spirit and pray to him to whip the devil , which is stage number two . Then we ask the good spirit to give us strength to whip the devil ourselves . That is stage number three . Buddha and Christ come in the number three stage , and that is where we are . We may find , as stage number four , that the good spirit is only a muscle in our brain or a fluid in our nerves , which we strengthen , and become masters of ourselves  --  greater , stronger , more clear-sighted  - -  without any OUTSIDE Great Spirit . That we are all things in ourselves , and that we are , in making ourselves , making the God . I fancy that is Pfeiffer 's idea . It is Mezes ' , I believe . Then comes in the mystery of transmitting that highly developed spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of most carnal nature whose children are held down to earth and gross things , and her fine spirit is lost , unless it lives elsewhere . So we come back to the question , how is the good preserved ? " Never any bright thing dies , " may be true , but if so it means an immortality of the spirit . This is all confusion and despair . We do not see where we are going . But we must climb , we must grow , we must do better , for the same reason that our bodies must feed . The rest we leave with all the other mysteries ... @# July 28 , 1916 I am going to dinner ... and before I go alone into a lonesome club , I must send a word to you . Not that I have any particular word to say , for my mind is heavy , nor that you will find in what I may say anything that will illumine the way , but why should we not talk ? What ! may a friend not call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his idle babble ? O these pestiferous dealers in facts and these prosy philosophers , the world must have surcease from them and wander in the great spaces . To idle together in the sweet fields of the mind  --  this is companionship , when thoughts come not by bidding , and argument is taboo ; to have the mind as open as that of a child for all impressions , and speak as the skylark sings , this is the mood that proves companionship . I shall be lonely to-night , going into a modern monastery and driving home alone . The world is all people to me . I lean upon them . They induce thought and fancy . They give color to my life . They keep me from looking inward , where , alas ! I never find that which satisfies me . For of all men I am most critical of myself . Others when they go to bed or sit by themselves may chuckle over things well done ; or find satisfaction in the inner life , as George does ; but not so with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a foreign shore . And this I know is not as it should be . Each one should learn to stand alone and find in contemplation and in fancy the rich material with which to fashion some new fabric , or build more solidly the substance of his soul . I like to have you talk , as in your latest letter , of the making of yourself . It seems so much more possible than that I could do the same . But I am a miserable groping creature , cast on a sea of doubt , rejecting one spar to grasp another , and crying all the time against the storm , for help . I do not know another man who has tortured himself so insistently with the problems that are unsolvable . You are firmer in your grasp , and when you get something you cling to it and push your way like a practical person toward the shore , that shore of solid earth which is NOT , but by the pushing you realize the illusion , or the reality , of progress . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps pedantically ; well , we agreed to talk , did n't we , of anything and everything ? You have the birds , the lake , the mountains beyond , the children next door , and the Fairy all our own , and I have my desk to look at and outside brick blocks and the sky . If I ever do hypnotize myself into any kind of faith , or find contentment in any one thing , it will be the sky . The reason I like the water is because it is so much like the sky . There is an amplitude in it that gives me chance for infinite wanderings . The clouds and the stars are somehow the most companionable of all things that do not walk and talk . Well , we have walked a bit together and have come to the edge of the field where we look off and see the unending stretch of prairie and the great dome . ... FRANK @# To William R. Wheeler Washington , August 21 , 1916 MY DEAR BILL ,  --  Owing to your departure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . You left on Thursday and on Friday night I went to bed ... The doctors do n't know what I had , excepting that I had things with " itis " at the end of them . I have had allopaths , Christian Scientists , osteopaths , and Dockweilers . The latter has been my nurse at night , his chief service being to keep me interested in the variety of his snoring . I really have had one damn hell of a time . The whole back and top of my head blew out , and I expected an eruption of lava to flow down my back . The only explanation of it is a combination of air-drafts and a little too much work and worry . I am now somewhat weak , but otherwise in pretty good condition ... I have no intention of saying anything in reply to Pinchot .

I hope she lives a long time to give you the inspiration of that beautiful smile . The Mexican business does not hasten as I had hoped . Brandeis ' withdrawal was a great surprise to us and I ca n't quite understand it . Meantime the railroad situation engrosses our attention fully , and Mexico can wait ... Hughes ' speeches have been a surprise and disappointment to me ... One might fancy a candidate for Congress doing no better but not a man of such record and position .

The Republican organization is perfect , but the people are not as gullible as once they were . Tell me some more about the Latin-American . How much form should I put on ? Can you warm up to them ? How do you get the truth out of them ? And how do you get them to stay by their word ? What are they suspicious of , silence or volubility ? Do they expect you to ask for more than you expect to get ? Do they appreciate candor and fair dealing , or must you be crafty and indirect ? If they expect the latter I am not the man for the job , but I can be patient and listen . My love to the Lady Maud . FRANK @# To Hon. Woodrow Wilson The White House Washington , August 28 , 1916 MY DEAR MR . PRESIDENT ,  --  I have had talks this morning with three men , all of them Democrats , all of them strongly for you under any circumstances . None of them are related to railroads or to labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city and believe that they have a knowledge of the feeling of the country . All express the same view and I want to tell it to you in case you write a message to Congress . They say that the people do not grasp the meaning of your statement that society has made its judgment in favor of an eight-hour day . This , the people think , is a matter that can be arbitrated . They ask why ca n't it be arbitrated ? They say that the country feels that you have lined yourself up with the labor unions irrevocably for an eight-hour day , as against the railroads who wish to arbitrate the necessity for putting in an eight-hour day immediately , and irrespective of the additional cost to the railroads . They say that the men are attempting to bludgeon the railroads into granting their demand which has not been shown to the people to be reasonable . This demand is that the men should have ten hours pay for eight hours work or less . They say that if this question can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that freight rates and passenger rates instead of going down , as they have for the past twenty years , must inevitably increasingly go up . They say that the people do not realize that you have been willing to entertain any proposition made by the railroads , but that you have stood steadfastly for something which the men have demanded . Now , all of this indicates a lack of knowledge of what your position has been . I am giving you the gist of these conversations because they represent a point of view so that if you desire you may meet such criticism . You must remember , Mr. President , that the American people have not had for fifty years a President who was not at this period in a campaign bending all of his power to purely personal and political ends . Your ideality and unselfishness are so rare that things need to be made particularly clear to them . Faithfully yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# In the beginning of September Lane was appointed Chairman of the American-Mexican Joint Commission , the other Americans being Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secretary of the Young Men 's Christian Association . The Mexican members were Luis Cabrera , Minister of Finance , Alberto Pani , and Ignatio Bonillas , afterward Ambassador to Washington . It was the hope of the Administration that this Commission would lay the foundation for a better understanding between America and Mexico . The Commission started its work in New London , but later as the hearings dragged on , they went to Atlantic City . Just before this Commission was named , Lane wrote to his brother , " I have been turned all topsy turvy by the Mexican situation . I have suggested to the President the establishment of a commission to deal with this matter upon a fundamental basis , but Carranza is obsessed with the idea that he is a real god and not a tin god , that he holds thunderbolts in his hands instead of confetti , and he wo n't let us help him . " @# To Alexander Vogelsang Acting Secretary of the Interior American-Mexican Joint Commission September 29 , 1916 MY DEAR ALECK ,  --  Do n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be all right , and so will the office . I am not worrying about you because I have n't got time to . I 'll take your job if you will take mine . The interpreting of a city charter is nothing to the interpreting of the Mexican mind . Dealing with Congress is not so difficult as dealing with Mexican statesmen . I have had some jobs in my life , but none in which I was put to it as I am in this . Now I have not only a question as to what to do in the making of a nation , the development of its opportunity , the education of its people , the establishment of its finances , and the opening of its industries in the establishment of its relations with other countries , but also the problem as to where the men can be found that can carry out the program , once it is made .

We are working from ten in the morning till twelve at night , and not making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament . They want to start a government afresh down there ; that is , go upon the theory that there never was any government and that they now know how a government should be formed and the kind of laws there should be , disregarding all that is past , and basing their plans upon ideals which sometimes are very impracticable . They distrust us . They will not believe that we do not want to take some of their territory . I despair often , but I take new courage when I think of you , of the struggle you are making and the brave way in which you are making it . What a superbly glorious thing it would be if you could master the hellish fiend that has attacked you ! ... My best love to you , dear Fritz , affectionately yours , F. K. L. @# To Frank I. Cobb New York World American-Mexican Joint Commission Atlantic City , November 11 , 1916 MY DEAR COBB ,  --  My very warm , earnest , and enthusiastic congratulations to you . You made the best editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would give more for the editorial support of the New York World than for that of any two papers that I know of . The result in California turned , really as the result in the entire West did , upon the real progressivism of the progressives . It was not pique because Johnson was not recognized . No man , not Johnson nor Roosevelt , carries the progressives in his pocket . The progressives in the East were Perkins progressives who could be delivered . THE WEST THINKS FOR ITSELF . Johnson could not deliver California . Johnson made very strong speeches for Hughes . The West is really progressive . ... Speaking of the election , there are two things I want you to bear distinctly in mind , my dear Mr. Cobb . One is that the states which the Interior Department deals with are the states which elected Mr. Wilson . ... And the second is that we kept the Mexican situation from blowing up in a most critical part of the campaign , which is also due to the Secretary of the Interior , damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the Secretary of the Interior is the most important part of this whole show ! Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To R. M. Fitzgerald American-Mexican Commission Atlantic City , November 12 , 1916 DEAR BOB ,  --  I am very glad to get your telegram . I know that it took work , judgment , and finesse to bring about the result that was obtained in California . What a splendid thing it is to have our state the pivotal state ! The eastern papers are attempting to make it appear that the state turned toward Wilson because of the slight put upon Johnson by Hughes . These people in the East are not large enough to understand that the people think for themselves out West , and are not governed by little personalities , that we do n't play " Follow the leader , " as they do here . The real fact is that Roosevelt undertook to deliver the progressives and could not do it in the West . Now we must hold all these forward-looking people in line with us and make the Democratic party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were boys , thirty years ago , and took part in our first campaign . There is room for only two parties in the United States , the liberal and the conservative , and ours must be the liberal party . Cordially yours , Franklin K. Lane @# To James K. Moffitt Atlantic City , November 12 , 1916 My dear Jim ,  --  It was fine of you to send me that telegram , and I am not too modest to " allow " as Artemus Ward used to say , as how the Interior Department is rather stuck up over the result . The Department certainly had not been very popular in the West . ... All of us will be taken a bit more seriously now , I guess . I wired Cushing and the others who led in the fight and I am going to write a note to Benjamin Ide Wheeler , who from the first , be it said to his credit , claimed California for Wilson . Wheeler is certainly a thoroughbred . I wish I could get your way soon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just received a telegram from Bryan , reading :  --  " Shake . Many thanks . It was great . The West , a stone which the builders rejected , has become the head of the corner . " Cordially yours , Franklin K. Lane @# To Benjamin Ide Wheeler Atlantic City , November 14,1916 Dear Mr. Wheeler ,  --  I know that you rejoice with all of us . You were the first man to tell me that Wilson would carry California , and I never believed it as truly as you did , but I have taken many occasions lately to say that you were a true prophet . And speaking of prophets , what a lot have been unmade ! Did you see that I wanted to bet a hat with George Harvey that he could not name four states west of the Alleghenies that would go for Hughes ? The truth about the thing , as I see it , is that you ca n't deliver the Western man and you ca n't deliver the true progressive , anyhow . The people of the East are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . Here they live by sufferance , by favor ; they are helpless if they lose their jobs . Out there hope is high in their hearts and they feel that there is a fair world around them , in which they have another chance . The resentment was strong against Roosevelt undertaking to turn over his vote . Of course I am glad of Johnson 's election , as he is a strong , stalwart chap , capable of tremendous things for good . He will probably be a presidential candidate four years from now , and I see no man now who can beat him , nor should he be beaten unless we have a good deal better material than our run of ... rank opportunists . I am working on a treadmill here . Perhaps by the time you come on in December I will be able to report something accomplished . But oh ! the misery of dealing with people who are eternally suspicious and have no sense of good faith ! We went with the Millers to the James Roosevelt place up at Hyde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an exquisite time . I put in four or five days campaigning , and this was the end of my trip . My speeches were all made in New York where I thought they might count , but the organizations were too perfect for us . President Wilson will leave a mere shadow of a party , unless he takes an interest in reorganizing it . He has drawn a lot of young men to him who should be tied together , as we were in the early Cleveland days . Of course , we must have a cause , not merely a slogan . Mrs. , Lane is here while I am writing this and she sends her love to both you and your wife , as do I. As always , cordially yours , FRANKLIN K.

Many an old chap there felt called upon suddenly and apologetically to blow his nose .

Lane Washington , February 9,1917 MY DEAR GEORGE ,  --  I am going to write you in confidence some of the talks we have at the Cabinet and you may keep these letters in case I ever wish to remind myself of what transpired . A week ago yesterday , ( February 1st ) , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and sink all ships going within her war zone . This was the question , of course , taken up at the meeting of the Cabinet on February 2nd . The President opened by saying that this notice was an " astounding surprise . " He had received no intimation of such a reversal of policy . Indeed , Zimmermann , the German Minister of Foreign Affairs , had within ten days told Gerard that such a thing was an " impossibility . " At this point Lansing said that he had good reason to believe that Bernstorff had the note for fully ten days before delivering it , and had held it off because of the President 's Peace Message to Congress , which had made it seem inadvisable to deliver it then . In answer to a question as to which side he wished to see win , the President said that he did n't wish to see either side win ,  --  for both had been equally indifferent to the rights of neutrals  --  though Germany had been brutal in taking life , and England only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutrals unite . I ventured the expression that to ask them to do this would be idle , as they could not afford to join with us if it meant the insistence on their rights to the point of war . He thought we might coordinate the neutral forces , but was persuaded that an effort to do this publicly , as he proposed , would put some of the small powers in a delicate position . We talked the world situation over . I spoke of the likelihood of a German-Russian-Japanese alliance as the natural thing at the end of the war because they all were nearly in the same stage of development . He thought the Russian peasant might save the world this misfortune . The fact that Russia had been , but a short time since , on the verge of an independent peace with Germany was brought out as evidencing the possibility of a break on the Allies ' side . His conclusion was that nothing should be done now ,  --  awaiting the " overt act " by Germany , which would take him to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet on February 6th , the main question discussed was whether we should convoy , or arm , our merchant ships . Secretary Baker said that unless we did our ships would stay in American ports , and thus Germany would have us effectively locked up by her threat . The St. Louis , of the American line , wanted to go out with mail but asked the right to arm and the use of guns and gunners . After a long discussion , the decision of the President was that we should not convoy because that made a double hazard ,  --  this being the report of the Navy ,  - -  but that ships should be told that they MIGHT arm , but that without new power from Congress they should not be furnished with guns and gunners . The President said that he was " passionately " determined not to over-step the slightest punctilio of honor in dealing with Germany , or interned Germans , or the property of Germans . He would not take the interned ships , not even though they were being gutted of their machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans would be held inviolate , and that interned sailors on merchant ships could enter the United States . If we are to have war we must go in with our hands clean and without any basis for criticism against us . The fact that before Bernstorff gave the note telling of the new warfare , the ships had been dismantled as to their machinery , was not to move us to any act that would look like hostility . February 10 Yesterday we talked of the holding of Gerard as a hostage . Lansing said there was no doubt of it . He thought it an act of war in itself . But did not know on what theory it was done , except that Germany was doing what she thought we would do . Germany evidently was excited over her sailors here , fearing that they would be interned , and over her ships , fearing that they would be taken . I said that it seemed to be established that Germany meant to do what she said she would do , and that we might as well act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always believed this , but thought that there were chances of her modifying her position , and that he could do nothing , in good faith toward Congress , without going before that body . He felt that in a few days something would be done that would make this necessary . So there you are up to date  --  in a scrappy way . Now do n't tell what you know . Ned is flying at Newport News . He sent me a telegram saying that the President could go as far as he liked , " the bunch " would back him up . Strange how warlike young fellows are , especially if they think that they are preparing for some usefulness in war . That 's the militaristic spirit that is bad . Much love to you and Frances . Give me good long letters telling me what is in the back of that wise old head . F. K. @# To George W. Lane February 16 , 1917 MY DEAR GEORGE ,  --  That letter and proposed wire were received and your spirit is mine  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you are absolutely sound as to policy . At the last meeting of the Cabinet , we again urged that we should convoy our own ships , but the President said that this was not possible without going to Congress , and he was not ready to do that now . The Navy people say that to convoy would be foolish because it would make a double target , but it seems to me the right thing to risk a naval ship in the enforcement of our right . At our dinner to the President last night he said he was not in sympathy with any great preparedness  --  that Europe would be man and money poor by the end of the war . I think he is dead wrong in this , and as I am a member of the National Council of Defense , I am pushing for everything possible . This week we have had a meeting of the Council every day  --  the Secretary of War , Navy , Interior , Commerce , and Labor  --  with an Advisory Commission consisting of seven business men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national industries and resources so that we may be ready for getting guns , munitions , trucks , supplies , airplanes , and other material things as soon as war comes  --  IF NOT TOO SOON . It is a great organization of industry and resources . I think that I shall urge Hoover as the head of the work . His Belgian experience has made him the most competent man in this country for such work . He has promised to come to me as one of my assistants but the other work is the larger , and I can get on with a smaller man . He will correlate the industrial life of the nation against the day of danger and immediate need . France seems to be ahead in this work . The essentials are to commandeer all material resources of certain kinds ( steel , copper , rubber , nickel , etc. ) ; then have ready all drawings , machines , etc. , necessary in advance for all munitions and supplies ; and know the plant that can produce these on a standard basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-pat that I am almost hopeless as to moving them to do the wise , large , wholesale job . They are governed by red-tape ,  --  worse than any Union . The Chief of Staff fell asleep at our meeting to-day  --  Mars and Morpheus in one ! To-day 's meeting has resulted in nothing , though in Mexico , Cuba , Costa Rica , and Europe we have trouble . The country is growing tired of delay , and without positive leadership is losing its keenness of conscience and becoming inured to insult . Our Ambassador in Berlin is held as a hostage for days  --  our Consuls ' wives are stripped naked at the border , our ships are sunk , our people killed  --  and yet we wait and wait ! What for I do not know . Germany is winning by her bluff , for she has our ships interned in our own harbors . Well , dear boy , I 'm not a pacifist as you see . Much love , FRANK To George W. Lane Washington , February 20 , 1917 DEAR GEORGE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our policy will be as to Germany . We evidently are waiting for the " overt act , " which I think Germany will not commit . We are all , with the exception of one or two pro-Germans , feeling humiliated by the situation , but nothing can be done . McAdoo brought up the matter of shipping being held in our ports . It appears that something more than half of the normal number of ships has gone out since February 1st , and they all seem to be getting over the first scare , because Germany is not doing more than her former amount of damage . We were told of intercepted cables to the Wolfe News Agency , in Berlin , in which the American people were represented as being against war under any circumstances  --  sympathizing strongly with a neutrality that would keep all Americans off the seas . Thus does the Kaiser learn of American sentiment ! No wonder he sizes us up as cowards ! ... F. K. L. @# To Frank I. Cobb Washington , February 21 , 1917 MY DEAR COBB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here and give the story of how Bernstorff handled the newspaper men , and thus worked the American people , ... He ought to get out of the newspaper men themselves , and he can , the whole atmosphere of the Washington situation since Dernberg left ,  --  Bernstorff 's little knot of society friends , chiefly women , the dinners that they had , his appeals for sympathy , the manner in which he would offset whatever the State Department was attempting to get before the American people . He would give away to newspaper men news that he got from his own government before it got to the State Department . He would give away also the news that he got from the State Department before the State Department itself gave it out , and he had a regular room in which he received these newspaper men , and handed them cigars and so on , and carried on a propaganda against the policy of the United States while acting as Ambassador for Germany , the like of which nobody has carried on since Genet ; and worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunningly . ... Hall will be able to get a ripping good story , I am satisfied ,  --  a good two pages on " Modern Diplomacy , " which will reveal how long-suffering the United States has been . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To George W. Lane Washington , February 25 , 1917 MY DEAR GEORGE ,  --  On Friday we had one of the most animated sessions of the Cabinet that I suppose has ever been held under this or any other President . It all arose out of a very innocent question of mine as to whether it was true that the wives of American Consuls on leaving Germany had been stripped naked , given an acid bath to detect writing on their flesh , and subjected to other indignities . Lansing answered that it was true . Then I asked Houston about the bread riots in New York , as to whether there was shortage of food because of car shortage due to vessels not going out with exports . This led to a discussion of the great problem which we all had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships out with guns or convoys ? Daniels said we must not convoy  - -  that would be dangerous . ( Think of a Secretary of the Navy talking of danger ! ) The President said that the country was not willing that we should take any risks of war . I said that I got no such sentiment out of the country , but if the country knew that our Consuls ' wives had been treated so outrageously that there would be no question as to the sentiment . This , the President took as a suggestion that we should work up a propaganda of hatred against Germany . Of course , I said I had no such idea , but that I felt that in a Democracy the people were entitled to know the facts . McAdoo , Houston , and Redfield joined me . The President turned on them bitterly , especially on McAdoo , and reproached all of us with appealing to the spirit of the Code Duello . We could n't get the idea out of his head that we were bent on pushing the country into war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will  - -  within a year , I believe . I tried to smooth them down by recalling our past experiences with the President . We have had to push , and push , and push , to get him to take any forward step  --  the Trade Commission , the Tariff Commission . He comes out right but he is slower than a glacier  --  and things are mighty disagreeable , whenever anything has to be done . Now he is being abused by the Republicans for being slow , and this will probably help a bit , though it may make him more obstinate . He wants no extra session , and the Republicans fear that he will submit to anything in the way of indignity or national humiliation without " getting back , " so they are standing for an extra session . The President believes , I think , that the munitions makers are back of the Republican plan . But I doubt this . They simply want to have a " say " ; and the President wants to be alone and unbothered . He probably would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Honolulu , where the land problem vexes . I do n't know whether the President is an internationalist or a pacifist , he seems to be very mildly national  --  his patriotism is covered over with a film of philosophic humanitarianism , that certainly does n't make for " punch " at such a time as this . My love to you old man ,  --  do write me oftener and tell me if you get all my letters . F. K L. @# To George W. Lane Washington , March 6 , 1917 Well my dear George , the new administration is launched  --  smoothly but not on a smooth sea . The old Congress went out in disgrace , talking to death a bill to enable the President to protect Americans on the seas . The reactionaries and the progressives combined  --  Penrose and La Follette joined hands to stop all legislation , so that the government is without money to carry on its work . It is unjust to charge the whole thing on the La Follette group ; they served to do the trick which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lodge people would not let any bills through and were glad to get La Follette 's help . The Democrats fought and died  --  because there was no " previous question " in the Senate rules . The weather changed for inauguration  --  Wilson luck  --  and the event went off without accident . To-day , we had expected a meeting of the Cabinet to determine what we should do in the absence of legislation , but that has gone over ,  --  I expect to give the Attorney General a chance to draft an opinion on the armed ship matter . I am for prompt action  --  putting the guns on the ships and convoying , if necessary . Much love . K.F. @# To Edward J. Wheeler Current Opinion Washington , March 15 , 1917 MY DEAR MY . WHEELER ,  --  I wish that I could be with you to honor Mr. Howells . But who are we , to honor him ? Is he not an institution ? Is he not the Master ? Has he not taught for half a century that this new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , for an American not to take off his hat to Howells would be to fail in appreciation of one 's self as an object of art  --  an unlikely , belittling , and soul-destroying sin . I do not know whether Howells is a great photographer or a great artist ; but this I do know , that I like him because he sees through his own eyes , and I like his eyes . If that be treason , make the most of it . Cordially yours , FRANKLIN K. LANE @# To George W. Lane Washington , April 1 , 1917 MY DEAR GEORGE ,  --  I took your letter and your proposed wire as to our going into war and sent them to the President as suggestions for his proposed message which in a couple of days will come out  - -  what it is to be I do n't know  --  excepting in spirit . He is to be for recognizing war and taking hold of the situation in such a fashion as will eventually lead to an Allies ' victory over Germany . But he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can stand Germany 's insolence and murderous policy no longer . Burleson , Gregory , Daniels , and Wilson were the last to come over . The meetings of the Cabinet lately have been nothing less than councils of war . The die is cast  --  and yet no one has seen the message . The President has n't shown us a line . He seems to think that in war the Pacific Coast will not be strongly with him . They do n't want war to be sure  --  no one does . But they will not suffer further humiliation . I sent West for some telegrams telling of the local feeling in different States and all said , " Do as the President says . " Yet none came back that spoke as if they felt that we had been outraged or that it was necessary for humanity that Germany be brought to a Democracy . There is little pride or sense of national dignity in most of our politicians . The Council of National Defense is getting ready . I yesterday proposed a resolution , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supplies be made upon the basis of a three years ' program . We may win in two years . If we had the nerve to raise five million men at once we could end it in six months , The first thing is to let Russia and France have money . And the second thing , to see that Russia has munitions , of which they are short  --  depending largely , too largely , upon Japan . I should n't be surprised if we would operate the Russian railroads . And ships , ships ! How we do need ships , and there are none in the world . Ships to feed England and to make the Russian machine work . Hindenburg is to turn next toward Petrograd  --  he is only three hundred miles away now . I fear he will succeed . But that does not mean the conquest of Russia ! The lovable , kindly Russians are not to be conquered ,  --  and it makes me rejoice that we are to be with them . All sides need aeroplanes  --  for the war that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany is strongest . Ned will go among the first . He is flying alone now and is enjoying the risk ,  --  the consciousness of his own skill . Anne is very brave about it . This is the program as far as we have gone : Navy , to make a line across the sea and hunt submarines ; Army , one million at once , and as many more as necessary as soon as they can be got ready . Financed by income taxes largely . Men and capital both drafted . I 'm deep in the work . Have just appointed a War-Secretary of my own  --  an ex-Congressman named Lathrop Brown from New York , who is to see that we get mines , etc. , at work . I wish you were here but the weather would be too much for you , I fear . Very hot right now ! Sometime I 'll tell you how we stopped the strike . It was a big piece of work that was blanketed by the Supreme Court 's decision next day . But we came near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear boy . F. K. L. Grosvenor Clarkson , Director of the Council of National Defense , in recording the activities of that body says :  --  " It is , of course , well known that Secretary Lane , as a member of the Council of National Defense , played a dramatic and successful part in the settlement of the threatened great railroad strike of March , 1917 . By resolution of the Council of National Defense of March 16 , 1917 , Secretary Lane and Secretary of Labor Wilson , as members of the Council , and Daniel Willard , President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , and Samuel Gompers of the Advisory Commission , were designated to represent the government , at the meeting in New York with the representatives of the railroad brotherhoods and railroad executives  --  the meeting that stopped the strike .

Immediately , I think we should take all the coastwise ships , or the larger portion of them . The Navy colliers and Army transports can be put into the business of carrying supplies to France . We are to have a meeting of the Council of National Defense to-day , and I am going to take this matter up . I have been pushing on it for several weeks .
