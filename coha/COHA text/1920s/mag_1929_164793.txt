UP TO Now-Alfred Emanuel Smith-Viking ( $5 ) . <P> Marketable commodities are the private opinions , the private reminiscences of public men . Alfred Emanuel Smith , office holder for more than 30 years , never forgets the voting , book-buying public 's predilection for personal revelations .

For a time I had a West Indian goat , four dogs , a parrot and a monkey , all living in peace and harmony in the garret . ...

In my first term I confined the menagerie to ponies , dogs , birds . . . later I had at various times raccoons , bears , elk. deer , monkeys , rabbits , pheasants , a red fox , barn owls , and for awhile a goat named Heliotrope . . . .
