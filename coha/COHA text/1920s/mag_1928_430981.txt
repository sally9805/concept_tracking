T HERE is an anecdote told me by his mother , who wished me to understand his character , as follows : The young William Carlos , aged let us say about seven , arose in the morning , dressed and put on his shoes . Both shoes buttoned on the left side . He regarded this untoward phenomenon for a few moments and then carefully removed the shoes , placed shoe a that had been on his left foot , on his right foot , and shoe b , that had been on the right foot , on his left foot ; both sets of buttons again appeared on the left side of the shoes . This stumped him . With the shoes so buttoned he went to school , but . . . and here is the significant part of the story , he spent the day in careful consideration of the matter . It happens that this type of sensibility , persisting through forty years , is of extreme , and almost unique , value in a land teeming , swarming , pullulating with clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last twenty of these years it has distinguished Dr Williams from floral and unconscious mind of the populace and from the snappy go-getters who'der seen wot wuz rong in er moment . It has prevented our author from grabbing ready made conclusions , and from taking too much for granted . There are perhaps , or perhaps have been milieux where the reflective and examining habits would not have conferred , unsupported , a distinction . But chez noun , for as long as I can remember if an article appeared in Munsey 's or McClure 's , expressing a noble passion ( civic or other ) one cd. bank ( supposing one were exercising editorial or quasi-editorial functions ) on seeing the same article served up again in some fifty lyric expressions within , let us say , three or four months . Our national mind hath about it something " marvelous porous " ; an idea or notion dropped into N. Y. harbour emerges in Sante Fe or Galveston , watered , diluted , but still the same idea or notion , pale but not wholly denatured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower , than any " record " hitherto known . We have the defects of our qualities , and that very alertness which makes the single American diverting or enlivening in an European assembly often undermines his literary capacity . For fifteen or eighteen years I have cited Williams as sole known American-dwelling author who cd. be counted on to oppose some sort of barrier to such penetration ; the sole catalectic in whose presence some sort of modification wd . take place . Williams has written : " All I do is to try to understand something in its natural colours and shapes . " There cd. be no better effort underlying any literary process , or used as preparative for literary process ; but it appears , it wd . seem , almost incomprehensible to men dwelling west of the Atlantic : I do n't mean that it appears so in theory , America will swallow anything in theory , all abstract statements are perfectly welcome , given a sufficiently plausible turn . But the concrete example of this literary process , whether by Williams or by that still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems an unrelated and inexplicable incident to our populace and to our " monde ? or whatever it is ? litteraire . " We have , of course , distinctly American authors , Mr Frost for example , but there is an infinite gulf between Mr Frost on New England customs , and Mr Gould on race prejudice ; Mr Frost having simply taken on , without any apparent self-questioning a definite type and set of ideas and sensibilities , known and established in his ancestral demesne . That is to say he is " typical New England . " Gould is no less New England , but parts of his writing cd. have proceeded equally well from a Russian , a German , or an exceptional Frenchman ? the difference between regionalism , or regionalist art and art that has its roots in a given locality . Carlos Williams has been determined to stand or sit as an American . Freud wd . probably say " because his father was English " ( in fact half English , half Danish ) . His mother , as ethnologists have before noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late years ( the last four or five ) Dr Williams has laid claim to a somewhat remote hebrew connexion , possibly a rabbi in Saragossa , at the time of the siege . He claims American birth , but I strongly suspect that he emerged on ship-board just off Bedloe 's Island and that his dark and serious eyes gazed up in their first sober contemplation at the Statue and its brazen and monstrous nightshirt . At any rate he has not in his ancestral endocrines the arid curse  | of our nation . None of his immediate forbears burnt witches in Salem , or attended assemblies for producing prohibitions . His father was in the rum trade ; the rich ichors of the Indes , Hollands , Jamaicas , Goldwasser , Curacoas provided the infant William with material sustenance . Spanish was not a strange tongue , and the trade profited by discrimination , by dissociations performed with the palate . All of which belongs to an American yesterday , and is as gone as les caves de Mouquin . From this secure ingle William Carlos was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting but exterior ; as he cd. not by any possibility resemble any member of the Concord School he was able to observe national phenomena without necessity for constant vigilance over himself , there was no instinctive fear that if he forgot himself he might be like some really unpleasant Ralph Waldo ; neither is he , apparently , filled with any vivid desire to murder the indescribable dastards who betray the work of the national founders , who spread the fish-hooks of bureaucracy in our once , perhaps , pleasant bypaths . One might accuse him of being , blessedly , the observant foreigner , perceiving american vegetation and landscape quite directly , as something put there for him to look at ; and this contemplative habit extends , also blessedly , to the fauna . When Mr Wanamaker 's picture gallery burned in the dead of winter I was able to observe the destruction of faked Van Dykes etc , comme spectacle , the muffler 'd lads of the village tearing down gold frames in the light of the conflagration , the onyx-topped tables against the blackness were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French Revolution . Mr Wanamaker was nothing to me , he paid his employees badly , and I knew the actual spectacle was all I shd. ever get out of him . I can not , on the other hand , observe the national " mansion " befouled by Volsteads and Bryans , without anger ; I can not see liberties that have lasted for a century thrown away for nothing , frontiers tied up by imbecile formulae , a bureaucracy and system exceeding " anything known in Russia under the Czars " without indignation . And this comparison to Russia is not mine , but comes from a Czarist official who had been stationed in Washington . And by just this susceptibility on my part Williams , as author , has the no small advantage . If he wants to " do " anything about what he sees , this desire for action does not rise until he has  | meditated in full and at leisure . Where I see scoundrels and vandals , he sees a spectacle or an ineluctable process of nature . Where I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rumination leads to anger it is an almost inarticulate anger , that may but lend colour to style , but which stays almost wholly in the realm of his art . I mean it is a qualificative , contemplative , does not drive him to some ultra-artistic or non-artistic activity . Even recently where one of his characters clearly expresses a dissatisfaction with the American milieu , it is an odium against a condition of mind , not against overt acts or institutions . 2 The lack of celerity in his process , the unfamiliarity with facile or with established solutions wd . account for the irritation his earlier prose , as I remember it , caused to sophisticated Britons . " How any man could go on talking about such things ! " and so on . But the results of this sobriety of unhurried contemplation , when apparent in such a book as In the American Grain , equally account for the immediate appreciation of Williams by the small number of french critics whose culture is sufficiently wide to permit them to read any modern tongue save their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with a seriousness and by a process comprehensible to an European . One might say that Williams has but one fixed idea , as an author ; i.e. , he starts where an european wd . start if an european were about to write of America : sic : America is a subject of interest , one must inspect it , analyse it , and treat it as subject . There are plenty of people who think they " ought " to write " about " America . This is an wholly different kettle of fish . There are also numerous people who think that the given subject has an inherent interest simply because it is American and that this gives it ipso facto a dignity or value above all other possible subjects ; Williams may even think he has , or may once have thought he had this angle of attack , but he has n't . After a number of years , and apropos of a given incident he has ( first quarterly number of transition ) given a perfectly clear verbal manifestation of his critical attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of all good critics . It is also symptomatic of New York that his analysis of the so-called criticisms of  | Antheil 's New York concert shd. appear in Paris , a year after the event , in an amateur periodical . The main point of his article being that no single one of the critics had made the least attempt at analysis , or had in any way tried to tell the reader what the music consisted of , what were its modes or procedures . And that this was , of course , what the critics were , or would in any civilized country have been , there for . This article is perhaps Williams ' most important piece of critical writing , or at any rate his most apposite piece ; failing a wide distribution of the magazine in which it appeared , it shd. be reprinted in some more widely distributable journal . As to the illusion of " progress , " it wd . seem that this illusion chez noun is limited to the greater prevalence of erotic adventure , whether developed in quality or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding ; as to any corresponding " progress " or catching-up in affairs of the intellect , the illusion wd . seem to rise from the fact that in our literary milieux certain things are now known that were , not known in 1912 ; but this wd . not constitute a change of relation ; i.e. , wd . not prove that America is not still fifteen years or twenty years or more " behind the times . " That is to say we must breed a non-Mabie , non-Howells type of author . And of the possible types Williams and Gould perhaps serve as our best examples ? as distinct from the porous types . I mean , not by this sentence , but by the whole trend of this article : when a creative act occurs in America " no one " seems aware of what is occurring . In music we have chefs d'orchestre , not composers , and we have something very like it in letters , though the distinction is less obvious . Following this metaphor , it is undeniable that part of my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very little of Dr Williams ' energy has been so deflected . If he did some Rimbaud forty years late it was nevertheless composition , and I do n't think he knew it was Rimbaud until after he finished his operation . Orchestral directing is " all right " mais c'est pas la meme chose . We are still so generally obsessed by monism and monotheistical backwash , and ideas of orthodoxy that we ( and the benighted Britons ) can hardly observe a dissociation of ideas without thinking a censure is somehow therein implied . We are not , of course we are not , free from the errors of post- reformation Europe . The triviality of philosophical writers through the last few centuries is extraordinary , in the extent that is , that they have not profited by modes of thought quite common to biological students ; in the extent that they rely on wholly unfounded assumptions , for no more apparent reason than that these assumptions are currently and commonly made . Reputed philosophers will proceed ( for volumes at a time ) as if the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ si licet , taking personal examples : Mr Joyce will argue for hours as if one 's attack on Christianity were an attack on the Roman church in favour of Luther or Calvin or some other half-baked ignoramus and the " protestant " conventicle . Mr Eliot will reply , even in print , to Mr Babbitt as if some form of Xtianity or monotheism were the sole alternative to irreligion ; and as if monism or monotheism were anything more than an hypothesis agreeable to certain types of very lazy mind too weak to bear an uncertainty or to remain in " uncertainty . " And , again , for such reasons William Williams , and may we say , his Mediterranean equipment , has an importance in relation to his temporal intellectual circumjacence . Very well , he does not " conclude " ; his work has been " often formless , " " incoherent , " opaque , obscure , obfuscated , confused , truncated , etc . I am not going to say : " form " is a non-literary component shoved onto literature by Aristotle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form is not a non-literary component . But it can do us no harm to stop an hour or so and consider the number of very important chunks of world-literature in which form , major form , is remarkable mainly for absence . There is a corking plot to the Iliad , but it is not told us in the poem , or at least not in the parts of the poem known to history as The Iliad . It wd . be hard to find a worse justification of the theories of dramatic construction than the Prometheus of Aeschylus . It will take a brighter lad than the author of these presents to demonstrate the element of form in Montaigne or in Rabelais ; Lope has it , but it is not the " Aristotelian " beginning , middle and end , it is the quite reprehensible : BEGINNING WHOOP and any sort of a trail off . Bouvard and Pecuchet was n't even finished by its author . And of all these Lope is the only one we cd. sacrifice without inestimable loss and impoverishment.  | The component of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dr Williams indubitably has in the best , and in increasingly frequent , passages of his writing . In current American fiction that has often quite a good deal of merit , and which has apparently been concocted with effort and goodish intentions , the failure to attain first-rateness seems to be mainly of two sorts : The post-Zolas or post-realists deal with subject matter , human types etc , so simple that one is more entertained by Fabre 's insects or Hudson 's birds and wild animals ; and the habits or the reactions of " an ant " or " a chaffinch " emerge in a more satisfactory purity or at least in some modus that at least seems to present a more firm and sustaining pabulum to reflection . Secondly : there are the perfumed writers . They aim , one believes , at olde lavender ; but the ultimate aroma lacks freshness . " Stale meringue , " " last week 's custard " and other metaphorical expressions leap to mind when one attempts to give an impression of their quality . One " ought " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fadeur ; though like all mediocre dilutations it is harder to analyse than the clearer and fresher substance . When I was fourteen people used to read novels of the same sort , let us say The House of a Thousand Candles etc of which one may remember a title , but never remembers anything else , and of which the author 's name has , at the end of five or ten years , escaped one . It is perfectly natural that people wholly surrounded by roughnecks , whether in mid-nineteenth century or in The Hesperian present , should want to indicate the desirability of sweetness and refinement , but . . . these things belong to a different order of existence , different that is from pity , terror , To Kax6v , and those things with which art , plastic or that of the writer is concerned . Now in reading Williams , let us say this last book A Voyage to Pagany or almost anything else he has written , one may often feel : he is wrong . I do n't mean wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write it . He ought n't to have said that . But there is a residue of effect . The work is always distinct from the writing that one finds merely hopeless and in strict sense irremediable ,  | There is a difference in kind between it and the mass of current writing , about which there is : just nothing to be done , and which no series of retouches , or cuttings away wd . clarify , or leave hard . Art very possibly ought to be the supreme achievement , the " accomplished " ; but there is the other satisfactory effect , that of a man hurling himself at an indomitable chaos , and yanking and hauling as much of it as possible into some sort of order ( or beauty ) , aware of it both as chaos and as potential . Form is , indeed , very tiresome when in reading current novel , we observe the thinning residue of pages , 5o , 30 , and realize that there is now only time ( space ) for the hero to die a violent death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages . To come at it another way : There are books that are clever enough , good enough , well enough done to fool the people who do n't know , or to divert one in hours of fatigue . There are other books ? and they may be often less clever , and may often show less accomplishment ? which , despite their ineptitudes , and lack of accomplishment , or " form , " and finish , contain something for the best minds of the time , a time , any time . If Pagany is not Williams ' best book , if even on some counts , being his first long work , it is his worst , it indubitably contains pages and passages that are worth any one 's while , and that provide mental cud for any ruminant tooth . 4 And finally , to comply with those requirements for critics which Dr Williams has outlined in his censure of Mr Antheil 's critics : The particular book that is occasion for this general discussion of Williams , A Voyage to Pagany , ' has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel writing , " which Dr Williams has fairly clearly abjured . Its plot-device is the primitive one of " a journey , " frankly avowed . Entire pages cd. have found place in a simple autobiography of travel . In the genealogy of writing it stems from Ulysses , or rather we wd . say better : Williams ' The Great American Novel 8o pages , Three Mountains Press 1923 was Williams ' first and strongest derivation from Ulysses , an " inner monologue , " stronger and more  | gnarled , or stronger because more gnarled at least as I see it , than the Pagany . The other offspring from Ulysses , the only other I have seen possessing any value is John Rodker 's " Adolphe 1920 . " The two books are greatly different . The Gt . American Novel is simply the application of Joycean method to the American circumjacence . The Adolphe , professedly taking its schema from Benjamin Constant , brings the Joycean methodic inventions into a form ; slighter than Ulysses , as a rondeau is slighter than a canzone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general progress of writing , having as have at least two other novels by Rodker , its definite shaped construction . And yet , if one read it often enough the element of form emerges in the great American Novel , not probably governing the whole , but in the shaping of at least some of the chapters , notably Chapter VII , the one beginning " Nuevo Mundo . " As to subject or problem , the Pagany relates to the Jamesian problem of U. S. A. vs . Europe , the international relation etc ; the particular equation of the Vienna milieu has had recent treatment " from the other end on " in Joseph Bard 's Shipwreck in Europe , more sprightly and probably less deeply concerned with the salvation of the protagonist ; I think the continental author mentions as a general and known post-war quantity : the American or Americans who comes or come to Vienna to find out why they ca n't enjoy life , even after getting a great deal of money . In the American Grain remains , I imagine Dr Williams ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the looseish structure of the Pagany I do n't quite make out what , unless it be simple vagary of the printer , has caused the omission of The Venus ( July DIAL ) , pages obviously written to occur somewhere in the longer work , though they do form a whole in themselves , and pose quite clearly the general question , or at least one phase of the question posed in the Pagany . In all the books cited , ' the best pages of Williams ? at least for the present reviewer ? are those where he has made the least effort to fit anything into either story , book , or ( In the American Grain )  | into an essay . I wd . almost move from that isolated instance to the generalization that plot , major form , or outline shd. be left to authors who feel some inner need for the same ; even let us say a very strong , unusual , unescapable need for these things ; and to books where the said form , plot , etc , springs naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exteriore they probably lead only to dulness , confusion or remplissage or the " falling between two stools . " I do n't mean that Williams " falls " ; he certainly has never loaded on enough shapings to bother one . As to his two dialectical ladies ? Of course he may know ladies who argue like that . There may be ladies who so argue , aided by Bacchus . In any case the effect of one human on another is such that Williams may elicit such dialectic from ladies who in presence of a more dialectic or voluble male wd . be themselves notably less so . No one else now writing wd . have given us sharp clarity of the medical chapters . As to the general value of Carlos Williams ' poetry I have nothing to retract from the affirmation of its value that I made ten years ago , nor do I see any particular need of repeating that estimate ; I shd. have to say the same things , and it wd . be with but a pretence or camouflage of novelty . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrality , I take it we ought to be thankful . We retain a liberty to speculate as to how he might have done better , what paths wd . conduce to , say progress in his next opus , etc. to ask whether for example Williams wd . have done better to read W. H. Hudson than to have been interested in Joyce . At least there is place for reflection as to whether the method of Hudson 's A Traveller in Little Things wd . serve for an author so concerned with his own insides as is Williams ; or whether Williams himself is n't at his best ? retaining interest in the uncommunicable or the hidden roots of the consciousness of people he meets , but yet confining his statement to presentation of their objective manifests . No one but a fanatic impressionist or a fanatic subjectivist or introversialist will try to answer such a question save in relation to a given specific work .  |
