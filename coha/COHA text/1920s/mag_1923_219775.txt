The home of Jean Franois Millet at Barbizon , France , where he " lived the simple life " in a chestnut forest with the rest of the famous Barbizon Group ( Corot , Rousseau , Diaz , Harpignies ) 50 years ago , has been restored by two of his pupils at their own expense , and will be opened to the public as a memorial . The simple life was no affectation for the peasant Millet . Often he and his wife did not eat , but gave the little food that they had to their children . Today , if Millet were alive , he could easily maintain a yacht from royalties of reproductions of The Angelus alone .
