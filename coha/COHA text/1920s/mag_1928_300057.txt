Twenty years ago the Fisher brothers organized their motor car body business as a Michigan corporation . It prospered collaterally with the motor industry . Two years ago Fisher Body 's net tangible assets were practically $90,000,000 . General Motors , their chief customer , had by that time acquired three-fifths of their stock ; the Fisher brothers owned most of the rest . Finally they traded all their holdings to General Motors for General Motors stock . <P> Now Charles T. Fisher is a G. M. vice president and director ; so too , Fred J. Fisher . Lawrence P. Fisher is a director and president of the G. M. 's Cadillac division , William A. a director and president of the Fisher Body division . The $36,000,000 G. M. stock that they received for their business has increased manyfold from G. M. extra dividends and stock split-ups and stock market offers . <P> What to do with their wealth ? Fred J. Fisher apparently took the lead . He went into the stock market . On a large scale , he bought shares of various corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked him with Arthur W. Cutten of Chicago , an out- &-out,; but secretive market operator . They compared him with William Crapo Durant , ousted founder of General Motors and now one of the shrewdest , hardest hitting operators in Wall Street . <P> But Fred J. Fisher , canny , was buying his stock with keen purpose . Revelation came last year when hard-bitten President Samuel M. Vauclain of Baldwin Locomotive roared that he would let no " outsider " on to Baldwin Locomotive 's board of directors . Fred J. Fisher ( and Arthur W. Cutten ) made little rebuttal . But at the next Baldwin Locomotive board meeting Fred J. Fisher was truculently made a director ( also Mr. Cutten ) . He controlled sufficient stock ( as did Mr. Cutten ) to force his election as director . <P> Someone has been buying heavily into Westinghouse Electric &; Manufacturing stock . That someone seems to be Fred J. Fisher . But not yet has he done anything overt towards entry into the corporation 's directorate . <P> But he did not wait long to make felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For last week the New York Central directors who control N. Y. C. 's most important subsidiary , the Big Four ( Cleveland , Cincinnati , Chicago &; St. Louis Railway ) , elected Fred J. Fisher a Big Four director . It was freely predicted he would become a N. Y. C. director next month .
