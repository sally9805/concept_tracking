All crimes can not be neatly dovetailed into the law . Anna Laura Lowe committed no crime when in 1920 she married an ancient , incompetent Creek Indian named Jackson Barnett . It was no crime for her to hire lawyers , who successfully induced Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke to release $1,100,000 of her husband 's royalty oil riches for distribution to herself and the American Baptist Home Mission Society ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . <P> But her conduct was " reprehensible " in the findings of **41;6275;TOOLONG Pierce Butler Jr. , son of Associate Justice Butler of the U.S. Supreme Court , who last week finished a thoroughgoing review of the Barnett case . Mr. Butler found : 1 ) the Interior Department had no power to give away Barnett 's wealth ; 2 ) the U. S. could sue to annul Barnett 's marriage to Anna Laura Lowe ; 3 ) suits to recover Barnett 's wealth were justified ; 4 ) nobody had been guilty of criminal conspiracy or fraud . <P> Said the Butler report : " However reprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mercenary purposes and to procure the assistance of lawyers to aid her in becoming possessed of his property as his wife , it is not a crime nor is her procurement of assistance a conspiracy to commit a crime . " <P> The report exonerated Commissioner Burke , whose resignation last week was accepted by President Hoover . Mr. Burke said he was " very happy " to get out . A Federal grand jury in Oklahoma almost indicted him last summer on this very case . Said the President : " I have the highest esteem for Judge Burke . . . and I propose a little later to offer him another important position in public service . " <P> Meanwhile Secretary of the Interior Wilbur promised an entirely new policy of Indian administration .
