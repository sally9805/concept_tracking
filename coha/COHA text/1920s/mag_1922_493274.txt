The Mantle of the Prophet QUARTERED in an army barracks on the isle of Malta , so fearful of assassination that the skylight in his mess-room must be boarded up with planks , the tired man who just stopped being Sultan looks out upon a world in ruins . In swift succession came the announcement from a " National Assembly " at Angora that Mohammed IV had been deposed ; then the decision to break up the temporal and spiritual powers that had hitherto been linked together ; and finally the Sultan 's own sudden flight to refuge aboard a battleship that flew the Union Jack . Presumably he is safe enough today , in Malta . But how about the British ? Mohammed IV is broken , tired , ill . I talked with him one afternoon , two months before his flight . He spoke slowly , puzzling for the words he wanted , reaching in the air with a forefinger and a thumb to find the right one when it would n't come . His face was sallow , lined with creases thickest at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he 'd stop to catch his breath in short , exhausted gasps . His courtiers called him " weary . " Certainly this last adventure must have taxed his strength . . . . Suppose he dies suddenly , there in Malta ? ' . . . A refugee Sultan is a bomb timed to explode at an unknown hour . There are thousands of hot-spirited patriots in the Moslem world who could never be convinced that Britain had not lured this hostage into ambush to betray him . Mohammed is an exile ; and , so far , only one of all Islam 's leaders has spoken out in protest against the action of the Angora Assembly . Abdullah , king of Transjordania , denies that this division of temporal and spiritual powers can ever be effected . The two , he says , are one and indivisible . Whoever plays the role of Caliph must have " power to protect his fold . " And Mohammed 's successor in Constantinople , shorn of all temporal authority , can never claim to rule the Moslem world . , Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdullah the newest of all Moslem kings ; yet in this challenge from the desert the fugitive in Malta may find a crumb of comfort . Doubtless he asks himself if the mantle of the Prophet can be torn so easily from the shoulders of his Caliph . Doubtless he counts on India and Egypt to protest against this stripping of the Caliphate of its claims to temporal power . Islam is in turmoil ; this deposition of Mohammed may have far-reaching interest for the Western world . What is actually involved in the dispute about the Caliph 's role in modern Islam -- the dispute whether he is emperor as well as priest , or simply the spiritual leader of a church , with no more temporal power than the Pope in Rome ? It has been many years since a Caliph actually ruled un ? challenged in any part of Asia . Originally Islam 's temporal and spiritual powers were truly one and indivisible . And that was because the Moslem missionary spread conversion with a sword . The first Mohammed , in the process of bringing western Asia around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally . And every great reformer who succeeded him has followed the same course . The last of them was Ibn Saud . A hundred years ago Saud swept across the desert , preaching a puritan reformation , and building up a nation as he went along . He might have smashed his way into Africa and Europe as Mohammed 's soldiers did , ten centuries before him . What stopped him was the invention of the cannon . That was a century ago ; and not since then has a Moslem leader ridden into battle in the double role of soldier-missionary . The old unity of sword and Bible lapsed . The political prestige of the Caliphs has been slipping . It is not only the fact that great stretches of the Moslem world like India and northern Africa have long since been wrested from the Turkish Empire by the Western powers ; even inside his own domain , and even before the war , the political power of the Caliph was challenged by great masses of his subjects despite their reverence for him as the leader of their faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Arabs of the desert re ? volted each time the Turk was whipped in Europe ; the tribesmen of Mesopotamia showed effectively that they still scorned their masters as mere up ? starts ; the provinces of Yemen and the Hedjaz were up in arms , ten years before the war began . Even the Turks themselves rebelled against their Caliph . In 19o8 a " Young Turk " revolution top ? pled the mighty Abdul Hamid from his throne . And the war sped up this swift decline in temporal power . When it began , the Sultan exercised one of his most sacred prerogatives , and proclaimed a " Holy War . " Four-fifths of Islam ignored his proclamation . Then came the peace ? and , with it , the hacking off of Syria , Palestine , Arabia and Mespot from the old Empire . Noth ? ing was left to the Caliph save Asia Minor and Stamboul itself .. . Mustapha Kemal Pasha soon took the former off his hands ; the latter fell to an Inter-Allied High Commission . . . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separation of the temporal and spiritual powers of the Caliph , that unhappy monarch had just one acre he could call his own ? the little parkway ofthe Dolma-Bagtche palace . One acre ; and one public ceremony . That was the " Selamlik , " when he prayed each Friday in his palace mosque . Tourists from Liverpool and Dayton flocked there , once a week , to watch him . To Moslems in far-off corners of Asia he was still a symbol . That was all . In the realm of temporal power the Caliph of all Islam had become a matinee . And so Mustapha Kemal Pasha robbed his spiritual leader of very little , when he decreed an end to the Caliph 's power as a sovereign . Not even Syria and Palestine and Mespot would have the Sultan back today ; they are none too happy with the French and British as their masters ; but they want independence , not the Turk . . .. It is not an empire , with the Caliph as its sovereign that is now at stake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the spiritual unity of Islam . For four hundred years and more , ever since a Mohammed called the Conqueror planted the green banner of the Prophet on our side of the Bosphorus , Constantinople has been a Holy City for the Moslems . It has also been , from time to time , a Holy City for the Russians . And throughout the long struggle of Britain versus Russia , in the politics of the Near East , it has been a Holy City for one school of British diplomats . That is one reason why British diplomacy has occasionally toyed with the idea of setting up a new Caliph in the desert . There is a family in Arabia known as Hussein . It claims descent from the Prophet himself . Its stronghold is Mecca , the holiest of all holies in the Moslem world . And with these two assets , the head of the house of Hussein has on more than one occasion attempted to assert himself as the true Caliph of all Islam . Frequently the British Foreign Office has thrown its influence behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for an empire embracing a hundred million restless Moslems , to have the Caliphate shifted from a perilous spot like Constantinople , tangled up with European rivalries , to a quiet little hamlet in the wholly worthless desert . British support of Hussein has never met with great success ; but now that Mustapha Kemal Pasha has overturned one Caliph and replaced hint with another , it is possible that Hussein will again reach out for recognition . He is more strategically situated , now , than he has been before ; his oldest son is king of Transjordania ; his second son rules Mespot . It seems unlikely that Hussein can actually win the allegience of the Moslem world , but quite possibly he will make the effort . Hussein himself , despite his miles of desert , has little " temporal power " ; and yet that question of " temporal power " would undoubtedly be his strongest issue . It may be true , as we have ' aid , that when the National Assembly in Angora stripped the Caliphate of political sovereignty and left it solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square miles and human souls ? was quite inconsequential . Nevertheless , some myth of sovereignty has always clung to the Sultan . ate . No Moslems , save the Turks themselves , actually wanted a Turkish Sultan ruling over them . But perhaps all Moslems wanted to feel that he was capable of so ruling ? to feel that in the spiritual overlord of Islam they had a Great Protector . And this they wanted ? because the aggressive , con ? quering West rode down upon their pride , and humbled it . And so ? unrealistic though it may be , in terms of real authority ? it is this question of " temporal Power " that is likely to prove the most important of any new issues resulting from Mohammed 's deposition . The rest is easier to prophesy . The old Sultan 's day is done . . . . Islam will continue to look toward Constantinople as its capital . . . But " temporal power " is another matter . Already it is reported that some of Kemal 's own Cabinet Ministers have resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unknown quantity is the attitude of the larger Moslem countries like India and Egypt . Remember that it was not a Congress of all Islam that decreed this separation of church and state . That bit of modernism was the iconoclastic work of a single national assembly ? rather parvenu , at that . Often it is assumed that spiritually , at least , the world of Islam is indissolubly united . No doubt there are factors that hold it in close union : the institution of the Caliphate itself , the characteristic teachings of the Prophet , the pilgrimage to Mecca ? above all , a common resentment against the aggression of the alien West . But there are forces of disunion , too . . . . Great gulfs in language , race and culture ; the old quarrel of the Sunnites and the Shiites ; the ambitions of the Sheiks of Mecca ; the semi-independence of great fraternities like the Sennussiya . Since the war , thanks to the aggression of the Western powers , every active force in Islam has been making for a closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is unquestionably a good Moslem issue . There is irony in the fact that the first great post-war hero of the world of Islam , Mustapha Kemal Pasha , may also be the first to put the post-war unity of Islam to any sort of test . a CHARLES MERZ . The Farmer and the Unseen Thing IN a weird little tale by AmbroseBierce the leading character is attacked by an unseen thing with which he grapples desperately for his life . This describes the present plight of the American farmer . From a world of apparent security mysterious forces have hurled themselves upon him . He now lies gasping , with the Unseen Thing gripping his throat . To test in part this figurative summary one need only recall the evidence brought to light by the last census : that between 1910 and 1920 the number of farms free from mortgage , of 9wned farms , decreased 20 percent ; that the increase in the number of mortgaged farms was over II percent ; that the amount of mortgage debt increased 132 percent , that the average debt per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that there was another definite shift in the tenure of farms away from ownership and toward tenancy . Only 61 percent of the farms are now operated by owners . It should be remembered that the last census was compiled at the crest of the post-war economic comedy , called prosperity . The facts which the census then revealed are already antiquated , for as great a change has taken place in the agricultural situation during the past three years as during the preceding ten years . Cases come to mind of farmers then on the road to moderate success who are now either insolvent or on the verge of it . And the census fails to tell the tale of the crop mortgage , an instrument that practically destroys the farmer 's freedom of marketing . The Unseen Thing made its real attack after the census was taken , though it was nursed to maturity in the period preceding . One glances at a recent copy of the Broomhall Corn Trade News , the leading English grain paper , and reads the following : " Sellers in North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needy , are bound to market a portion of their harvest to meet their current expenses , and the lower prices fall the greater will be the quantity which they will have to market in order to settle their standing charges . " Such clinical observation is galling . One can be persuaded of a trace of European gloating over the necessities of the American farmer . But it is the bitter truth .
