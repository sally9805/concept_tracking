The Presidents of Universities climbed onto lecture platforms last week , and gravely addressed the Freshmen . <P> For the most part the discourses were similar . The Freshmen , slightly ill at ease , or somnolent , were urged to achieve " divine curiosity " ( Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler ) , to create an intellectual atmosphere ( Dr. John Grier Hibben ) . In general , they were implored not to behave like Freshmen , but like bright , contented students . <P> Only the Freshmen of Cornell were urged to something different . For they were told by their president , Dr. Livingston Farrand , that they ought to sleep more than Freshmen hitherto have slept . <P> Warned Dr. Farrand : " The failure to get the proper amount of sleep is one of the growing evils of American undergraduates . Your efficiency , your competency , your health and your future can be wrecked without the proper amount of sleep . " <P> Freshmen were later informed that Dr. Farrand was a Doctor of Medicine , and onetime editor of the American Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were impressed , and resolved not to sit up all night at bridge . <P> But others wondered whether the Freshmen were always allowed to sleep at will , whether Sophomores did not often disturb . Was there not , they asked , an old fraternity song which told about Freshmen who trembling on their couches lie : <P> Wake ! wake ! Freshmen wake ! <P> Wake while our song smites the sky , <P> For now , ere we leave you , <P> We heartily give you <P> A welcome into Delta Beta Psi .
