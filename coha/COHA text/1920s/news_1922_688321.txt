txt The twelfth article of the armistice convention signed at Mudania on Oct. 11 reads : " The presence of the " allied troops shall be maintained in " the areas where they are now sta " tioned  --  areas which the Grand Na " tional Assembly of Turkey under " takes to respect until the decision " of the peace conference . " The areas then specified were parts of the Constantinople and Gallipoli peninsulas , including the City of Constantinople . But on Saturday , RA FET Pasha , Turkish Nationalist Governor of Thrace , having taken over by his own fiat  --  and the consent of the population  --  the civil Governorship of the city , ordered the Allies to get out . Since the change in Administration had been followed by riots , which tho allied troops had to repress with some loss of life , the commanders refused . The peace conference , which was to meet at Lausanne next Monday , has been postponed , according to London dispatches . If this sort of thing goes on much longer there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks are respecting the Mudania agreement only in so far as suits their convenience . It is asserted , though denied , that they are moving troops into the neutral zone before the British position at Cho nak . Certainly they seem to have collected in Thrace a force considerably larger than was permitted by the Mudania agreement . For these breaches of faith there is some excuse in the bad record of the great Powers in dealing with the Turks and all other Near Eastern peoples , but it must he evident in Rome and Paris , as well as in London , that the promises of this new set of Turks are worth little more than those of ABDUL HAMID , The Constantinople garrison apparently does not number more than 10,000 men . Such reinforcements as the British have sent have mostly gone to Chanak . The fleet could keep a Turkish army from crossing into Europe , but would be worse than useless in a situation not unlikely- to arise in the near future  --  a rising of the Turkish population of the city against the Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gendarmes or private citizens who may drift in from Thrace . In that situation the garrison would be in a tight place . Of course , MUSTAPHA KEMAL 'S Government wants to keep order in the capital . It wanted to keep order in Smyrna , too . But whatever may have actually happened in Smyrna , it is plain enough what may happen in Constantinople . Large numbers of Turks who have resented the presence of a foreign army of occupation are likely to seize the first opportunity to get even with the nearest foreigner , and there are plenty within reach in Stamboul , to say nothing of Pera and Galata . Already the Turkish Government has notified foreign Powers that warships will not be allowed to pass without qwq Russia . They are still allies ; hence TROTZKY 'S idea that the only way to insure the freedom of the Straits is to load them with Turkish fortifications . Then there would be nothing to prevent the Russians from coming out through the Straits If they felt like it so long as the Turkish alliance lasts .
