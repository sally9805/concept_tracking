txt Evidence that the . , Hoover : Administration , which is seeking farm relief legislation in Congress , is ' faced also " by a more immediate and serious problem because of the piling up of huge stocks of . wheat , appeared ? today when the executives of several of the more important Eastern ' carriers , in agreeing to accept , temporarily , sharply reduced rates on export wheat shipments , . announced that they recognized " that an emergency of national : proportions exists nedessitating every possible aid to the immediate removal of this surplus out of the . country . " The executives are understood to have assembled in conference ' here at the request of the'administrattOn . It also is known that the wheat surplus problem has been the subject of extended conferences among- the government . officials .

Department 's Announcement No formal statement was , issued at the White House , but late in the . day the following announcement was made by the Department of Agriculture as representing the department 's position : " At a meeting of the presidents , of Eastern railroads , held in Washington this morning , it . was decided to put into effect a reduction of the freight rate . on wheat for export ... " These reductions will approximate 2 cents per bushel on wheat moving from Buffalo , 4 cents from Chicago and 5 cents from St. Louis . The reductions will be temporary and will expire on Sept. 30 , 1929 . " These reductions are made- in response to suggestions from President Hoover , in which Secretary Lamont and Secretary Hyde concurred ...

They were less temperate than . the . Department of- Agriculture in . a statement which they issued through Robert N.

" At a meeting in Washington today of presidents and traffic executives of Eastern railroads , " this statement read . " consideration , was given to wheat and faces the prospect , just as do the farmers of the United States , of a new crop of bumper proportions to be harvested within a relatively short time . Experts here offered various forecasts , among them that the Canadian interests might take steps to meet the new competition from America which would result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests take no steps , it is felt that the rate reductions by the railroads of this country will aid materially in getting the American surplus into the export trade .

" In this desire for cooperation in solving the problem of storage for the farmers they have made reductions which are a substantial contribution to stimulation of movement into foreign ports . " The railroads in the East have been largely guided by the wishes of the President and the Cabinet in this and are hopeful that the action taken will be taken as it is.intended ? that is , as a friendly effort of cooperation to solve the difficulty with which the farmers are confronted , that is. adequate storage for their grain . ? Such action is taken at this early period in order that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmers are prosperous the railroads themselves can not prosper . " While the proposed reductions are made applicable generally to the grain rates , the real problem faced by the administration and the railroads is that of moving the wheat surplus into the export trade . // the emergency in agriculture caused by the great accumulation of grain on farms and in elevators in the West . " This grain , together with the abnormally large crop maturing and which will soon be ready for market , must meet the competition of the unusually large carry-over and production in foreign countries , with consequent lowering of the price level in the principal markets of the world . " As the result of studies by the Department of Agriculture and individual investigations by the railroads based upon the representations Of that department , the railroads recognize that an emergency of national proportions exists necessitating every possible aid to the immediate removal of this surplus out of the country . " The rates of the Eastern railroads applicable to export grain have been recognized by the commission and are shown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Part 7 , to be on as low a basis as justified . In consenting to extend their aid to agriculture in meeting this great emergency prior to the movement of the new crop , the Eastern railroads feel that general public recognition must be given to the fact that rates on grain lower than their present ' export rates would be far less than can be regarded as reasonable rates , and should not , in justice to these carriers , be referred . to hereafter as constituting a fair measure of export rates on grain . " The Eastern railroads have taken this action with the hope that the owners of the grain . the United States Shipping- Board and steamships serving United States ports , as well as other agencies involved in the haadling of export grain , will cooperate and do their part toward relieving the serious condition that is confronting the farmers of the United States .

Nine-Cent Cut to Seaboard Is Aim . The Eastern railroad executives took action for lowered rates after a brief study of statistics prepared by the administration . The general scheme , if the Western carriers meet along similar lines , will be to reduce the rail rate on wheat from its origin to seaboard by about 9 cents a bushel . This would go far to make it possible for the American farmers and middlemen to compete with the Canadian wheat shipments . It is hoped in this way to get rid of a considerable part of the present surplus and prepare for the incoming shipments from the farms of the new ' crop , which will be well under way by about July 15 . It was admitted . however , that only developments which included the attitude which Canada might assume , would determine just how successful the effort set in motion today would be . Th : present indications are that the new crop will exceed the 800. - 000,000 bushels harvested last year . Some of the railroad experts felt that the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planting , and reports that Canada would increase its acreage by 2,000,000 acres , with an estimated yield of sixteen bushels an acre , emphasized this point , they felt . Early reports also are to the effect that the Argentine crop will be a big one . The fact that American exports of wheat ' have been falling off sharply over a period of several months has been a subject of some concern to the administration . This shrinkage in exports , which has been accompanied by a sharp increase in Canadian exports , is shown in the following table , covering the Rate Reductions Agreed ' To . nine months ' periods , July to March , " It has been concluded to , seek inclusive , for 1929 and . 1928 : authority from the Interstate Cora- Commodity.1928. merce Commission to make tariffs Wheat ( bushels ) . 321,892496. mo 1:13,131,1113.000 heat ( vat. in dol. ) $98.499.000 $185,800,000 Wheat flour ( 13131 ( 8.1. 9,906,000 10,288,000 Wheat flour ( val . in dollars ) $18,960,000 $67,576,000 Estimates on March 1 by the Department of Agriculture showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the greatest total on any similar date since 1919 , when the total was 362,947,000 bushels .
