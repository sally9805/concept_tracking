txt Mr. Cuvillier 's Position . Referring to THE TIMES article , " Want Bar Delayed on Hotel Cooking , " permit me to state the Committee on Judiciary of the Assembly refused to report favorably the Hofstadter bill , IM. ** 1840 , to amend the Tenement House law , so greedy and unscrupulous owners and builders , looking only for their pockets in high rents , could defeat the plain intent of the law in constructing residential apartment hotels . The committee based its decision , first , on the ground of fire hazard to the tenants ; second , the owners and builders well knew when constructing these residential apartment hotels they were violating the law ; third , unfair competition with legitimate hotels . If over $300,000.000 are invested In these residential apartment hotels , the action of the Legislature will be a warning in the future to bankers and Insurance companies in lending money to owners and builders to see they comply with and respect the law . LOUIS A. CUVILLIER , Member Committee on Judiciary . Albany , April 29 , 1927. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
