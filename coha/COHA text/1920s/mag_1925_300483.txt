Here follows a condensation of the President 's message to Congress : <P> Introduction . " The age of perfection is still in the somewhat distant future , but it is more in danger of being retarded by mistaken government activity than it is from lack of legislation . " <P> State Rights and Federal Subsidies . " Local self-government is one of our most precious possessions . It ought not to be infringed by assault or undermined by purchase ... <P> " Society is in much more danger from encumbering the national government beyond its wisdom to comprehend or its ability to administer , than from leaving the local communities to bear their own burdens and remedy their own evils . " <P> Economy . " We still have an enormous debt of over $20,000,000,000 , on which the interest and sinking-fund requirements are $1,320,000,000 . Our appropriations for the pension office and the veterans ' bureau are $600,000,000 . The War and Navy departments call for $642,000,000 . Other requirements , exclusive of the postoffice , which is virtually self-sustaining , brought the appropriations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure of close to $30 for every inhabitant of the country ... <P> " Only one of these great items can be ultimately extinguished . That is the item of our War debt . Already this has been reduced by about $6,000,000,000 , which means an annual saving in interest of close to $250,000,000 . The present interest charge is about $820,000,000 yearly . . . . <P> " Proposals have been made to extend the payment over a period of 62 years . If $1,000,000,000 is paid at the end of 20 years , the cost to the taxpayers is the principal and , if the interest is 4% , a total of $1,850,000,000 . If the same sum is paid at the end of 62 years , the cost is $3,635,000,000 , or almost double ... <P> " Real improvement , however , must come not from additional curtailment of expenses , but by a more intelligent , more ordered spending . Our economy must be constructive . While we should avoid as far as possible increases in permanent current expenditures , oftentimes a capital outlay like internal improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its best sense . " <P> Appropriating and Spending . " The purpose of maintaining the Budget Director and the Comptroller General is to secure economy and efficiency in government expenditure . No better method has been devised for the accomplishment of that end . " <P> Tax Reduction . " With commendable promptness the Ways and Means Committee of the House has undertaken in advance of the meeting of Congress to frame a revenue act ... In its present form it should provide sufficient revenue for the government ... <P> " I approve of the bill in principle . In so far as income tax exemptions are concerned , it seems to me the committee has gone as far as it is safe to go and somewhat further than I should have gone . Any further extension along these lines would , in my opinion , impair the integrity of our income tax system . " <P> Foreign Policy . " The policy of our foreign relations , casting aside any suggestion of force , rests solely on the foundation of peace , good will , and good works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
