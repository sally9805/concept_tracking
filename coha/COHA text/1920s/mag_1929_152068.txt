The Rainbow Man ( Sono-Art ) . A new , independent producing company has probably fulfilled its intention of building a box-office success on the Jazz Singer formula around Minstrel Eddie Dowling . When Dowling 's pal , an acrobat , is dying after a fall from a trapeze , he promises to take care of the acrobat 's little boy and keeps his promise through some amusing and a number of saccharine episodes , a love affair , and recurrent Irish-tenor melodies . Best shot : the audience in the Arcadia Opera House . Best song : " Sleepy Valley . " <P> The Hole in the Wall ( Paramount ) . A band of crooks , recruited from the best talent of the legitimate stage , robs gullible ladies who come for messages from the dead , until one real ghost , through the mouth of brilliant Claudette Colbert , gives away the gang 's secret . Best shot : a kidnaped baby on a wharf-ladder . <P> Through Different Eyes ( Fox ) . When the jury decides that Edmund Lowe was the fellow who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtroom and tells what really happened . In spite of this framework , the courtroom atmosphere is pretty real and the story depends enough on character to interest its actors . Best shot : mixed bridge in the Manning 's livingroom . <P> Show Boat ( Universal ) . The problem of knitting episodes of a novel in a way that will reduce or eliminate , for picture purposes , the chapters introduced to show the passage of time , is emphasized in Edna Ferber 's romance of Mississippi minstrels because her story touches three generations of show people and includes the life of one of them from childhood to maturity . This was not the only problem that confronted Producer Carl Laemmle when , having bought the cinema rights to Miss Ferber 's book , he bought also the rights to the musical comedy that Florenz Ziegfeld had made out of it . Somehow the stretched narrative had to be delayed long enough to make it vocal . The best singing is done in a prolog , related to the text only by its tunes , in which Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lips of Laura La Plante , sings " My Bill " and " I Ca n't Help Lovin ' That Man . " Of the progress of the showboat , Cotton Palace , down the river , Director Harry Pollard has made a picturesque , oldfashioned , tedious melodrama , full of conventional photography and exaggerated acting . Magnolia ( Laura La Plante ) , an awkward young woman with a long jaw , elopes with Gaylord Ravenal ( Joseph Schildkraut ) in a rowboat . Later she becomes a great actress , though this is hard to believe because Miss La Plante is such a bad one . Best shot : the play given on the stage of the show boat . Silliest shot : Schildkraut drunk .
