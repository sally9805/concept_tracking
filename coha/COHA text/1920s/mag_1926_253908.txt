Alvin Victor Donahey is Governor of Ohio . A Democrat , he is mentioned along with dozens of others for his party Presidential 1928 nomination . The country generally does not know Mr. Donahey , often wonders just how he would become the White House 's dignity . <P> Last week at Columbus , Ohio , Mr. Donahey conversed with one John A. Cline , Cleveland attorney , over a road paving question . Referring to the undated resignation which Governor Donahey requires his cabinet members to give when they accept appointments , Mr. Cline asked : " Suppose , Governor , the highway director had not conformed to your vote for concrete , would you have put that resignation into effect ? " <P> Mr. Donahey answered . Said he : " That 's a foolish question . . . . You will act the gentleman in here or I will exercise the prerogative I have , and take you by the seat of the trousers and throw you out of my office . " <P> " Just start it , " countered Mr. Cline . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
