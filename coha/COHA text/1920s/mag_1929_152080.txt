A large ungainly motorbus , powdered white with dust , drew up before the hacienda Las Delices at Maracay , last week , and disgorged a party of journalists . They had come 50 odd miles from the capital city of Caracas to pay their respects to piratical old Dictator-President Juan Vicente Gmez on the eve of Venezuela 's Presidential election . Once more he was the only candidate , would receive all the votes , they presumed , unless there should be a revolution on election day . Almost a generation before Benito Mussolini was heard of , Juan Vicente Gmez was dictating in Venezuela . He has made a habit of confiscating the property of those who oppose him , sending them into exile or imprisonment . Excellent roads are constantly under construction by sweated gangs of " political prisoners . " The comic opera sequence of petty-grafter Presidents who preceded him has been definitely terminated . He has given Venezuela the blessings of a stable regime on his own extremely harsh terms . He dominates the National Congress which elects the President of Venezuela . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about for Grandpa Gmez , who is by act of the Venezuelan Congress , " Gmez the Meritorious . " They saw an old man , his eyes shielded by thick-lensed blue glasses , seated in a wicker rocking chair beneath a spreading rubber tree . Armed guards stood on either side of the Dictator , ministers of state and important guests sat on other wicker chairs in a respectful circle . Innumerable hand some , big-hipped , black-eyed wenches wandered about the patio and the modern cafeteria-dancehall directly opposite , which " Gmez the Meritorious " has provided for their use . Buxom girls ( many of them Indians ) , the President 's lemans are as famed as he . Respectfully the correspondents approached the rubber tree , were courteously welcomed . The old man in the blue glasses suggested that they might enjoy viewing his fine new concrete cowshed , containing nearly 1,000 Indian humped cattle . After that they ought to visit his private zoo , see his pet cockatoos , peafowl , chimpanzees ; watch the big-eared African elephant blowing dust through his trunk , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> But when an indiscreet U. S. correspondent asked Dictator Gmez about the coming election , the eyes of " The Meritorious One " flashed behind their thick-lensed glasses . Snapped he : <P> " The conversation , gentlemen , will be limited to livestock ! "
