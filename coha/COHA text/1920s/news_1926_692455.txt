txt By a vote of 36 to 33 the Senate today rejected Senator Walsh 's report of the Judiciary Committee on the affairs of the Aluminum Company , assailing the Department of Justice and Secretary Mellon , one of the stockholders . This was a general surprise , as it was expected by supporters of the report , chief among whom was Senator Walsh , that the Senate would approve the report , especially after Senator Walsh had stricken out the last paragraph , which proposed a further investigation by the Judiciary Committee . Senator Walsh had consented to a joint resolution to be offered by Senator Robinson , Democrat , of Arkansas , which would have avoided the purpose of the Montana Senator to " direct " President Coolidge , as in the Teapot Dome case , to appoint special counsel to take the case before a Grand Jury . The Robinson resolution simply would have " authorized " the President to do so .

Senator Walsh greeted this sally with the dry remark that the speech ought to hold in line some of the Republicans . Today 's vote was as follows : FOR TILE WALSH REPORT-33 , Demoera ts-26 .

The result was made possible by the two Democrats , Blease of South Caro- lina and Bruce of Maryland , who refused to vote with their party . If they had remained regular the report would have been adopted , 35 to 34 . The voting followed a spectacular debate which included bitter personalities between the principal figures . The sharpest words came near the end of a four-hour speech by Senator . Walsh . He assailed Senator Reed . for presenting the fact yesterday that Secretary Mellon and his brother , Richard B. Mellon , owned about 161/2 per cent . each of the stock fit the Aluminum Company , and referred to the Pennsylvania Senator as the " representative " of Secretary Mellon and " of his - company . " Senator Reed resented this , but Senatory Walsh declared he had no apology to make , and the Pennsylvanian , pounding his desk , declared : " The idea that , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his holdings ) I should be charged here with being the representative , in the Senate , of Mr. Mellon , or the Aluminum Company of America , does no credit to the Senator who makes the charge . I am here representing the State of Pennsylvania , and the nation of which it is a part , and I take no insults from the Senator from Mon , tana about that . " Senator Moses interrupted later with a discussion as to the real object of the attacks , in which he declared that , while they were directed against Secretary Mellon. they did not stop there . " The real target , " Senator Moses said , " at which the Senator and his associates are aiming , is the Administration and the President of the United States : The Senator tried this method once before , in 1924 . He knows how the country reacted to it . " , I The Senate 's action completely halted manoeuvres that were under way to have the Aluminum Company subjected Ito further inquiry . Early in the session the Judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the executive departments to " check up " as to whether the company had violated a " consent degree " of 1912 under the anti-trust laws . Following this preliminary investigation the committee voted , 9 to 7 , in favor of the report of Senator Walsh . All but two of the Republicans opposed it , SenIators Borah and Norris voting with the I Democrats . ? The concluding paragraph of that report contained the recommendation that the Senate obtain from the Federal Trade Commission . the data on which it made Charges that the company had violated the consent decree . A special Senate resolution was adopt , ed for this purpose . A recommendation was made that the committee be instructed to conduct I another investigation , with a view , if thought justified , to offering a joint resolution directing the employment of special counsel . This week , Democrats signified their unwillingness to support , as a party , further investigation , I but indicated they would approve a ' , resolution like that drawn by Senator Robinson simply authorizing the President to name counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the report , Senator Reed called attention to a sentence left which , if the report had been adopted , would have put the Senate in the position of criticizing Secretary Mellon and Attorney General Sargent . This sentence read : It is not expected that the Attorney General will be conversant with the details of all litigation before his department , and he may well be entirely ignorant of some matters having or calling for its attention , but it is not too much to expect that he will at least be informed concerning a charge by his predecessor and another branch of the Government , in effect , that a fellow member of the Cabinet , at least a corporation of which he is a dominant factor , has beeen guilty of contemptuous disregard of an injunction of a Federal court . " Bruce Explains His Vote . I After the roll-call Senator Bruce said he had failed to go along with his Democratic colleagues partly because of the foregoing paragraph and also because he desired to vote on a question the way he deemed right ? even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his resolution when the result became known . Senator Walsh said that only a change of heart on some one 's part would make reconsideration possible on today 's vote , which , under Senate rules , may be demanded within two days after a decision . Mr. Walsh discussed the alleged relationship between the Aluminum Company and a Norwegian company , and cited to show that the Supreme Court did net support Mr. Reed 's view  --  that I stock control of one organization over another could not exist unless the first concern owned 51 per cent . of the other organization 's stock . Mr. Reed interrupted to say that the Senate committee 's report said that A. W. Mellon 's stock holdings in the Aluminum Company constituted control . Mr. Walsh mentioned that the figures of stockholdings of the Aluminum Company had not been furnished . Cans Mellon Real Defendant . Senator Reed replied that the figures had been given for the Secretary of the Treasury , who was the real defendantnn the case , according to Senator Walsh . " It is none of our business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are some things that are still- entitled to privacy in the United States in spite of recent tendencies . " Senator Walsh declared : " I do n't object to the Department of Justice telling us that they did not have access to , the books , and so could not tell us anything about it , or else saying we did have access to the books , and these are the facts . We are expected to take their conclusion about these matters : But suppose an examination of the books does not disclose a holding of more than 16 per cent . by Mr. Mellon said 16 per cent . more by his brother , what does that ' aignify.f Mvery.body. knows that in many of these corpora- , tions stock often stands on the books : of a company in the name of one man where the real ownership is in some I one else . So all he has got to do Is to take an endorsement of it and as he controls the corporation he does not need to make any transfer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Walsh had insinuated that there was a falsification of the records and that the Secretary of the Treasury really had more shares than it was shown he had by the books of the company . " The Senator knows , " replied Mr. Walsh , " that there is no falsification about it . It appears to stand on the books of the company , but that person may easily endorse that stock over to anybody else . " The clash between the Pennsylvania Senator and Mr. Walsh was the outcome of Senator Reed 's obvious resentment of a remark of Senator Walsh with reference to Mr. Reed 's : statement that Secretary Mellon and his brother , R. B. Mellon , each owned not over 16 per cent , of the stock of the aluminum company , " giving these two gentlemen one-third control of the company , " to quote Mr. Walsh . To this Senator Walsh had added : " I Suppose as a matter of course , the Senator from Pennsylvania must be speaking , in this matter , as the representative of the Aluminum Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walsh Charge . Mr. Reed replied : " Now , Mr. President , can not a Senator address a question to some individual without being accused of being his representative on the floor of the Senate ? I asked Mr. Mellon how much stock he had , and , whether he had any objection to making a statement what the figure was . He answered the question . But I resent the charge that . I appear here as his representative or the company 's representative . Mr. Walsh.declared he had no apology to make for his statement , saying that he wanted to enforce the point that the Senate had no information upon the subject at all . " Mr. Mellon chooses to make the Senator from Pennsylvania his private confidant concerning this matter , " he said . " and we are not informed by any record before us on the subject . " If the Senator will ' permit me further , " Mr. Reed replied , " it is just as competent for me to ask Mr. Mellon , as I did , and for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I did , to confirm what Mr. Mellon said as it is for the Senator from Montana to quote anonymous undated statistics given by his friend , Mr. Anderson , in a magazine published last Januaty . " " I regret that I can not call Mr. Anderson a friend of mine , " Mr. Walsh retorted . Senator Reed then ** replied : - " The idea that because I have asked that question I should be charged here with being the representative 1r the Senate of Mr. Mellon or the Aluminum Company of America does no credit to the Senator who makes the charge . I am here representing the State of Pennsylvania and the nation of which it is a part and I take no insults from the Senator from Montana about that . " Mr. Walsh rejoined the colloquy , dedaring : " Of course , that is not quite parliamentary language for the Senator to use , but we will let it go . The Senator from Pennsylvania is giving us Information in connection with this report of the Department of Justice which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , and is only information , as a matter of course , gained from private sources . " Sees Busy Time Ahead . Senator Reed of Missouri made some observations which brought a retort from Senator Reed of Pennsylvania . " This is going to be a busy Senate , then , if it is going to run down every possibility of corporate affiliation , " said Mr. Reed of Pennsylvania . " I think if we followed Mr. Mellon Into all of his lairs and all of his affairs we would be very busy , but I think that is a job to undertake , " answered Senator Reed of Missouri . Then Senator Moses baited Senator Walsh . " I took the occasion in the debate that took place in the Senate some weeks ago , " he said , " to_the point out to the Senator from Montana that it was enough , from my point of view , to say that a certain thing might happen , and the Senator indignantly excoriated me for taking that position . I want to congratulate him now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Walsli then attempted " to correct the impression " of Senator , Reed " that we are conducting a trial here . " Mr. Walsh said Mr. Reed " is a keen enough lawyer+ to know that we are not , but of course in the galleries a different view might be taken about the matter . " Mr. Walsh denied that Secretary Mellon was being tried . Explaining his position he said : " We are insisting that the facts disclosed here are sufficiently grave to demand a trial of Mr. Mellon if you wish to put it in that way , a trial of the Aluminum Company in court  --  a trial of the aluminum company and its responsible officers as to whether it has or has not violated the decree of the Federal court . We find that the Department of Justice will not do so . We are considering the question as to whether the facts warrant us in providing that the work shall be done by some other officers in a branch of the Government under the Department of Justice . " Another interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator with a good deal of attention thus far , " . Mr. Moses said , " I have reached two conclusions as to what are the contentions he sets up . First of all , that the Department of Justice is not conducted in the manner in which it will be conducted in that far-distant day when the Senator from Montana shall become Attorney General of the United States ; and , second , that the ingot , rivet and screw mills of the Aluminum Company of America are not managed as the Senator from Montana would manage them , "
