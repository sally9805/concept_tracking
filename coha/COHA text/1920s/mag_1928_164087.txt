The Supreme Pontiff &; Vicar of Christ must not , does not and can not lower himself sufficiently to become one of two persons who are quarreling . The truth of this statement became luminous , last week , as discussion waxed hot in Italy upon the recent and contradictory speeches of Pope Pius XI and Prime Minister Mussolini-speeches which had seemed to place them on opposite sides of a dispute as to whether the education of Italian youths shall be purely secular and Fascist , or partially religious and Roman Catholic ( TIME , April 9 ) . Round 1 of the apparent quarrel had ended when Il Duce backed up his speech by suppressing all non-Fascist youth organizations , including the Roman Catholic Boy Scouts . Therefore it behooved the Vatican to explain , last week , that no quarrel had ever existed . The task of tidying up and if possible effacing the whole incident fell to a remarkable man : Count Giuseppe Dalla Torre , editor of the news organ which speaks for the Vatican , L'Osservatore Romano ( The Roman Observer ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps 200 Ibs. and stands half a head taller than most Italians . His complexion is very fair and his hair almost blond . Withal he is of noble and ancient Venetian lineage , though he was born a Paduan . Even enemies find him affable , but few except his friends realize his extraordinary and sensitive keenness of mind . <P> As a devoted Son of the Church , Count Dalla Torre conducts L'Osservatore Romano under the charter of a strictly private corporation , but indicates its true status by printing daily as its device the Papal mitre and crossed keys . He maintains absolute the decorum of L'Osservatore 's news and editorial columns , but does not scorn to accept advertisements of fountain pens , filing cabinets , asperin , hair tonics , and that esteemed internal remedy Le Pillole Pink . <P> Thus , Editor Count Dalla Torre is both a loyal Son of the Church and a businessman of the world . As such he signed his authoritative initials , last week , to a leading article in L'Osservatore Romano which purported to explode the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Pope 's pronouncement was confined solely to a moral plane , and was in no way politically inspired , and did not constitute intervention in the affairs of the State . . . . <P> " The Pope did not mean to condemn the Fascist party for monopolizing the education of youth , but simply to insist ... as a Father speaking to his children . .. that education should be effected in a Christian spirit . . . . <P> " This only the Church can accomplish . . . . <P> " It is quite untrue that any conflict . . . has taken place or is about to take place . ... It is well to say that such an interpretation is not true , although it is recognized that such an impression may have arisen from the sudden action of the Italian Cabinet* so soon after the Pope 's speech . " <P> " The words of the Pope do not affect the Roman Question . . . but Catholics must remember that it is the prerogative of the Pontiff alone to deal with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressing the Catholic Boy Scouts , etc.
