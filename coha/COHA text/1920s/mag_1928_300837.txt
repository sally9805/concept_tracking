Strange to see in the Ohio primary ( see below ) was the second defeat in a year for Charles P. Taft II , stalwart , cheerful , encyclopedic son of the Chief Justice of the U. S. As the youthful ( 31-year-old ) Prosecutor of Hamilton County ( Cincinnati ) he was beaten in December in his attempt to convict George Remus , onetime ' legger and convict , " insane " wife-murderer . As an energetic idealist , Son Taft worked with a Citizens ' Republican Committee to reform the G. O. P. in Cincinnati . He preached liberalism , integrity . But it did not go down . He was beaten for his own office , last week , by Nelson Schwab , a son of the late Dr. Louis Schwab , Cincinnati Mayor in the gang-ridden days of the late Boss Rud K. Hynicka . All but one of the Taft ticketmates were beaten , too . People said it was because the Citizens ' Republican Committee " slung mud , " i.e. , preached reform so militantly that its foes became goodfellow martyrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I can say that the people of this community have rejected the ideals and aims for which it the Citizens ' Republican Committee stood .
