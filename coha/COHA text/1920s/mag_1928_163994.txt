That ardent Communist , M. Le Deputy Pioqemal , pounded furiously upon his desk in the Chamber , last week , thus sounding the familiar prelude to one of his eruptions . <P> The Chamber had been debating with approval certain changes and relaxations of the bill recently introduced to curb the activities in France of foreign oilmen ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . <P> In its new form the measure had been shorn of provisions to create a French monopoly of oil vending in France . Deputy Pioqemal , pounding his desk , demanded to know why these provisions had been knocked out . Answering his own question he cried : " I assert that the Cabinet has received and heeded an injunction from America forbidding the monopoly which the people of France have been promised over their oil imports ! " <P> Straightway the Minister of Commerce , suave attorney Maurice Bokanowski , rose to defend the bill . He did not deny that the Cabinet had received protests and intimations from Standard Oil of New Jersey , Royal Dutch Shell and Anglo-Persian Oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The State does not know the importers ! The State is merely anxious to provision the Nation with oil to the best advantage . " <P> After prolonged debate the Chamber concurred in this view , voting 335 to 185 for the bill in its new form . If passed by the Senate , it will leave the Standard , Shell and Anglo-Persian oil firms in virtual dominance of the French market , though theoretically curbed by a new licensing commission with limited powers . <P> Minister of Commerce Bokanowski is still remembered in Washington , D. C. , as perhaps the most broadminded and conciliatory member of the French debt commission which came abortively to the U. S. , chairmanned by brilliant but brittle-tempered Joseph Caillaux ( TIME , Oct. 5 , 1925 , et seq . ) . In France Barrister Bokanowski is not only potent in the councils of financiers but is rated as an authentic patron of the bold , new movement in French art and decoration . Following his tilt in the Chamber over oil , last week ( see col. 1 ) , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Italy , made necessary by the recent French tariff increases ( TIME , March 12 ) . France concedes to Italy lower duties on buttons , canned tomatoes , fruits , ventilators and women 's hats , etc. ; while Italy grants reductions on rabbit skins , precious stones , carpets , cheese , etc . <P> The recently created National Cinema Censorship Commission had taken no action , up to last week , on any of the 380 U. S. films now awaiting its approval . Since sales to French exhibitors for the forthcoming season are customarily made in April , U. S. film representatives were fuming with uneasiness in Paris , last week , lest the Commission diddle and dawdle until the films submitted to it lose most of their sales value .
