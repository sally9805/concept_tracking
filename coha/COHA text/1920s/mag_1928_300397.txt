To the British steel industry came last week a series of mergers , from which may result the formation of a British steel cartel to meet foreign competition in world markets . First came a triple merger involving three British steel makers ( Vickers , Vickers-Armstrong , and Cammell , Laird &; Co. ) who united all their interests , except their armament works , in a company to be called the English Steel Corp. , Ltd . Capital : about $100,000,000 . Then came another merger-the union of Dorman Long , Ltd. with Bolckow Vaughan &; Co. , Ltd . Capital also about $100,000,000 . An export agreement has been concluded and an effort will be made to secure a protective tariff on steel . <P> Capitalizations of $100,000,000 may represent huge companies in British steel , but U. S. citizens point to the " billion dollar " U. S. Steel Corp . as the real standard of steel magnitude . Whether because of its association with such names as Carnegie , <P> Gary , Morgan , or because it was a " billion dollar " corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alarm than they are today , U. S. Steel remains as it has been for many years , the popular embodiment of U. S. capital , U. S. industry . When U. S. Steel directors meet , there is news ; when they elect directors , it is an event . Thus the U. S. public was last week more interested in the election of two new U. S. Steel directors than in British steel mergers , however far-reaching . <P> The two new directors are Junius Spencer Morgan Jr . and Walter Sherman Gifford . Junius Spencer Morgan Jr . is named for his great-grandfather , the Junius Spencer Morgan who in 1854 left the Boston dry goods field to become a partner in the London bank of George Peabody &; Co . It was this Junius Spencer Morgan ( not John Pierpont Morgan I ) who originated the famed remark that " Any one who sells a bear on the United States will go broke . " The present Junius Spencer Morgan Jr . was graduated from Harvard in 1914 , is a Morgan partner , a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierpont Morgan who was largely responsible for the formation of U. S. Steel in 1901 , and son of the John Pierpont Morgan who is now Chairman of the U. S. Steel Board . The appointment of Morgan Partner Thomas William Lamont to the U. S. Steel Finance Committee , last week , further italicized the Morgan sense of responsibility for U. S. Steel and gave rise to rumors that Mr. Lamont might succeed Mr. Morgan to the board chairmanship. *
