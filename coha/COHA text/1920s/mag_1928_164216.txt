Father of two children , citizen of Louvain , one Edmond Morren , a master stonemason , stealthily entered the new Library of Louvain just before dawn one morning last week . <P> Previously Mason Morren had removed all nearby ladders into the building , locked all doors , cut the telephone line . He now ascended and climbed out upon the balustrade , for which Belgium 's Hero Primate , the late Desire Cardinal Mercier , approved the following inscription : <P> Destroyed by Teutonic Fury : Restored by American Gifts . <P> The inscription was finally omitted by order of Monsignor Ladeuze , Rector of Louvain University ( TIME , July 9 ) , who caused to be erected first a stone balustrade without inscription which was smashed by his own students , and second an equally inscriptionless plaster of Paris balustrade . <P> Stealthily , last week , and then boldly Citizen Morren of Louvain proceeded to wield a stonemason 's pick on the balustrade for 45 minutes , destroying 160 small columns . <P> As the last splintered fragment fell , Citizen Morren waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , crying : " Long live Belgium ! and France ! and America ! We Belgians are not all Boches like Monsignor expectorating Ladeuze ! ! " <P> Climbing down , unlocking door , Citizen Morren surrendered to the police , quietly remarked : " The Germans did us too much harm . Without the inscription , the balcony looks as if we had forgotten . " <P> Grim , resolute , Monsignor Ladeuze ordered a new balustrade of which about half was rushed into place last week . The expense was understood to have been borne by Rector Ladeuze personally , though his moral support is from U. S. groups headed by President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University and having the blessing of Candidate Hoover .
