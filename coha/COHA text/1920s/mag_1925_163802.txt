Fruits of Labor <P> Nine grave gentlemen last week presented to the President and the public the product of some eleven weeks ' deliberation . The nine , headed by Dwight W. Morrow , washed their hands of a troublesome job . They had done their duty and they were free . The President and the public could do what they liked about the report of the President 's Air Inquiry Board , Summary : <P> Preamble . " The conflict is one between the old and the new , emphasized by the sharp adjustments required in a period immediately following a great war . Such conflicts of thought have gone on from the beginning . They will go on until the end . It is in many ways desirable that they should go on , even in armies , subject always , of course , to that essential discipline without which an army becomes a mob . What is needed , is a more generous appreciation by each side of the difficulties of the other side . On each side there is need of patience with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem may not be settled . It may , however , be understood if men will approach it with less feeling and more intelligence . " <P> Part I ( Questions which the Board asked itself and which " despite the conflict of testimony admit of answers " ) . <P> 1 ) In determining an aviation policy for the United States Government , what should be the relation between the military and civilian services ? " Our answer to this question is that they should remain distinctly separate . " The peacetime activities of the United States have never been governed by military considerations . To organize its peacetime activi- ties , or what it is thought may ultimately be one large branch of them , under military control or on a military basis would be to make the same mistake which , properly or improperly , the world believes Prussia to have made in the last generation . The union of civil and military air activities would breed distrust in every region to which our tension . " commercial aviation sought extension . " <P> 2 ) How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end that this important field should receive the attention that it deserves , we recommend that provision be made for a Bureau of Air Navigation under an additional Assistant Secretary of Commerce . We recommend the progressive extension of the Air Mail Service , preferably by contract , and also that steps be taken to meet the manifest needs for airways and air-navigation facilities , including an adequate weather service maintained by public authority and planned with special reference to the needs of air commerce . " <P> 3 ) What should be the military air policy of the United States ? <P> " Here our obvious general policy should be to maintain our naval aviation in due relation to the fleet . Our national policy calls for the establishment of the air strength of our army primarily as an agency of defense . " <P> 4 ) Is the United States in danger by air attack from any potential enemy of menacing strength ? <P> " Our answer to this question is No . <P> " This conclusion is based on the facts as they now are . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a useful military load and of returning to safety is now in existence .
