The manufacture of woolen and worsted cloths in the U. S. has been comparatively unprofitable , chiefly from this chain of causes : clothiers have believed that U. S. men and women will not buy much new clothing this year ; so clothing manufacturers have been buying as few bolts of cloth as they dared , and still be able to serve their retailer customers ; so woolen and worsted weavers must cut their business close to demand ; that leaves much machinery idle and forbids profitable increase of prices . Particularly hard hit in this way have been the three great U. S. woolen goods fabricators-American Woolen Co. , Arlington Mills , Botany Consolidated Mills . The newly formed Wool Institute has not so far been able to help . <P> Although the same events affect the Canadian manufacturers , five of them last week attacked the situation by merging . Canadian Woolens and its subsidiaries , Milton Spinning Mills and Otonabee Mills , with R. Forbes Co. and its subsidiaries , Orillia Worsted Co. , were the parties to an agreement whereby a new company-Dominion Woolens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dominion Woolens &; Worsteds is A. O. Dawson of Montreal , who has been Canadian Woolens ' president .
