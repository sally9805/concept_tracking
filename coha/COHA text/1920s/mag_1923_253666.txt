Charles H. Grasty , experienced journalist , called on the President last week and discussed The Marion Star . <P> A copy lay on the President 's desk . " It was a big paper to be published in a county seat town of 30,000 population , " says Mr. Grasty . " It was 18 to 20 pages , about half and half as between advertising and reading matter . <P> " I was curious to know how it had been possible to develop such a volume of line advertising , quoting store items , as in newspapers in large cities . The President said that it was because the stores in Marion were in a position to command local trade , which , in the case of many towns , was drawn off to nearby cities . They had discovered the economic value of newspaper advertising . " <P> " The lovelight was in his een , " said Mr. Grasty of the President , gazing at his paper . " He still has a newspaper heart .
