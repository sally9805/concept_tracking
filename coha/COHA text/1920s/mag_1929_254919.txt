Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd last week flew east from Little America , discovered : 1 ) mountains running north and south between west longitude 150 and 145 ; 2 ) indications that the Scott Nunataks , Alexandra and Rockefeller Mountains were island-tops . Meanwhile Geologist Laurence McKinley Gould , looking for earth and rocks to dig , with George ( ' ' Mike " ) Thorne of Chicago ( rescuer of Boy Scout Paul Siple last summer and regarded as perhaps the hardiest man in the Byrd Expedition ) and John S. O'Brien , tried to climb Liv Glacier up which Byrd 's plane flew to the South Pole . Thwarted , they attacked windy Heiberg Glacier.
