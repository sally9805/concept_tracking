At Geneva the 37th meeting of the Council of the League of Nations opened with Signor Vittorio Scialoja of Italy in the chair . <P> An attempt was made to deal at once with the Mosul question ( TIME , Nov. 30 , et ante ) and to make a final settlement of the Greco-Bulgar dispute ( TIME , Dec. 14 et ante ) . Both the Turks and the Greeks , however , strongly resisted the adjudication of these matters which the Council seemed disposed to give ; and it was decided that further investigations should be pursued before the Council hands down its ultimate decisions . Definite action was taken on only one matter : <P> Disarmament . Pursuant to a resolution passed by the Assembly of the League of Nations ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) , the Council proceeded to take cognizance of the work of the subcommittees which have been preparing the earliest groundwork for a League Disarmament Conference , and began to deliberate upon what further preliminary steps should be taken . <P> It was decided to convoke a Special Disarmament Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to clear the way for an ultimate International Disarmament Conference or Conferences under the auspices of the League of Nations . <P> The Special Disarmament Committee will in itself constitute an international conference of the first magnitude , and invitations were accordingly despatched to the U. S. , Germany and Russia , as the chief nonLeague states , requesting them to send representatives to this important preliminary gathering . <P> The agenda of the proposed Special Disarmament Committee was embodied by M. Benes of Czechoslovakia into a long and complicated technical program , which provides that the following factors bearing on disarmament shall be considered : <P> 1 ) " Visible Armaments " : the actual armies , navies and air forces possessed by the various nations . <P> 2 ) " Invisible Armaments " : the population , geographical situation , industrial strength and war mobilizing power of the nations . Under this head special attention will be given to the possession by a nation of large fleets of commercial aircraft or chemical factories instantly convertible to war purposes . <P> 3 ) " Degree of Security " : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Locarno Pacts and the Covenant of the League of Nations . <P> Observers noted that the chief conflicts over this agenda centered about the well worn subject of " security . " Viscount Cecil for Britain steadily opposed the inclusion of the " Degrees of Security " or " Invisible Armaments " clauses in the agenda . To him and to the British press , disarmament was evidently a subject which had to do chiefly with scrapping tangible implements of warfare . However M. Paul-Boncour , in the name of France and the smaller nations , insisted that the " intangible " factors actually outweighed the " material " in importance .
