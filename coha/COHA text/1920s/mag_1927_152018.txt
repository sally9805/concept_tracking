Last week the New York World , no friend of the Republican Administration , printed the following quotation from the speech delivered by President Coolidge last fornight at Hammond , Ind . ( TIME , June 20 ) . <P> " The making of parks is not a new idea in the world . We can trace it back to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the practice of the early Egyptians from whence it leads down through all the Old World history . " <P> With this quotation , the World printed the following extract from the New International Encyclopedia ( p. 723 , Vol . XIII ) : <P> " The practice of reserving public parks for the use and delight of the people seems to be as old as civilization . The Egyptians had parks from the earliest times . " <P> Sophisticated , the World did not assume that the President plagiarized the encyclopedia , left the responsibility in the hands of whoever supplied the data for the speech .               @ @ @ @ @ @
