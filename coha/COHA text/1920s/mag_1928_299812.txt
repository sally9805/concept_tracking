They are neither man nor woman-They are neither brute nor human , They are Ghouls ! <P> - Poe . <P> <P> Rumanian frontier officials ghoulishly pried open the coffin of a Hungarian diplomat last week , as it was about to be shipped out of Rumania . <P> The corpse at which they peered was that of Herr Richard Eichorn , late Hungarian Consul at Klausenburg , Rumania . Hungarian news organs charged in a frenzy of indignation that Hungarian diplomatic seals on the coffin had been broken and the corpse " subjected to gross indignity . " <P> An international incident seemed to impend when the Rumanian ghouls incautiously admitted that they had pulled the corpse this way and that , in an effort to find contraband goods in the coffin . No more deadly insinuation could have been hurled against the honor of the Hungarian diplomatic corps . <P> Alarming rumors that ghouls and vandals have stolen the ashes of Poet Dante Alighieri from his imposing tomb , in Ravenna , Italy , caused the local Podesta ( Mayor ) to issue orders , last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pomp and reverence . <P> From Sweden , Jugoslavia and Poland came reports that bungling , amateur ghouls had been chased out of graveyards and some arrested , at Upsala , Zagreb and Warsaw . In the generic , Asiatic sense , a ghoul is one who not only opens a coffin or tomb but also eats the corpse . No such instance of pure ghoulishness came to light last week .
