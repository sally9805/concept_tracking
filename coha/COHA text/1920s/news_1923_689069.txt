txt President IVIEUCLEJOHN , not satisfied with trying to educate his students , was endeavoring to educate his alumni . In his valedictory of Wednesday . he argued , with good reason , that this was a necessity if the alumni influence in college affairs was to be intelligent , and not a. mere expression of ancient sentiment . Yet here , as elsewhere , the stubborn nature of matter makes it difficult to translate aspiration into accomplishment . The Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors transcribes from the Amherst Graduates ' Quarterly some account of what may be called the continuation courses far alumni . The plan involved the organization of groups for study and reading , under the direction of members of the college Faculty , in the larger cities where Amherst men were numerous , with occasional group conferences to talk things over . " It marks , " said Dr. MEIKLEJOEIN , " the end of the day " when men could talk of colleges as " places of mere boyish association , as " places of mere sentimental connec " tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? ? ? It means " ? * * that men must be living in ' " great associations of ideas and " thoughts and problems and attempts " to understand . " Doubtless that is one of the things that American college life , and particularly alumni life , has badly needed . If it works , it will be an excellent thing . It is perhaps too early to say how it is going to work . As in so many other colleges , one man or group of men must be the power and another the brakes . The programs laid out for Amherst alumni study are calculated to put a heavy burden on a man who has other work to do and can improve himself only in spare moments . Dr. Mnixtsson:s spoke of Trustees as men who could not give the proper attention to college affairs because they were too busy with other things . Apparently no such burden lies on alumni . They have all the time in the world for syllabi and programs of reading . This appears in this very report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of " the alumni were interested in hayfi ing the department " ( economics , in this case ) " give them something to think about . " One envies the typical Amherst alumnus , living in cloistered seclusion with nothing to kill time but the quarterly clipping of coupons , turning back to the old college in final desperation and begging it to give him something to think about ; while the college is suffering under the control of Trustees , unlettered men who have risen from the plow or the shovel and are consequently too busy to pay attention to the problems of education . If things are not quite so bad as they seem , they are bad enough . There is no doubt that most alumni do look back to athletics , fraternities and social life when they think of college ; it comes into memory lately or not at all as a place where men might learn , and learn to think . That it may go on helping them to think , even after graduation , is an important function which colleges are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The alumni need to be . educated ; so do the Trustees ; so , perhaps , do the professors , too , even young professors .
