The musical bills for the week hold the name of Albert Spaulding . This violinist is a musician of steady growth . He seems constantly deepening in warmth and musicianship . <P> Spaulding belongs to the famous Spaulding Sporting Goods fortune . His father was a brother of the late Albert G. Spaulding , the old baseball player who founded the establishment . Albert Spaulding , the violinst , was born to money . Desiring to become a musician , the way to musicianship was gilded for him . He could study where and with whom he pleased . But the family wealth has hurt him in his public career . He complains that people say of him that there is no reason for his playing a fiddle , since he does not need the money . Others hold that he has got to the top not through musicianship , but through his pocketbook . The violinist states with a little emphatic bitterness that he has refused to take any financial aid from his family since the day that he first played in public . He insists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he lives precisely as any other musician does , eating and lodging on the proceeds of his art .
