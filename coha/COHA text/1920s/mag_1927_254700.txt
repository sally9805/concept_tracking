In 1907 William Hurd Lawrence was a successful right-handed illustrator . In 1927 he is a successful left-handed painter . In 1937 , he hopes to be a successful ambidextrous illustrator &; painter . This evolution resulted from an accident that occurred 20 years ago . Then Mr. Lawrence illustrated for Harper 's Weekly . His wife took sick , so he was forced to concentrate upon illustration almost to the exclusion of his first love , water color . His sketches demanded travel-Europe , the West Indies , South America . It was on a South American tour that the sun beat him into partial paralysis . His right hand hung disabled . <P> It was pain for Artist Lawrence to look upon purple and blue landscapes then for they served only to remind him that his talent was lodged with him useless . But he bore in mind the image of Daniel Vierge , the Spanish painter , who refused to be cheated of his brush by a failing hand . Vierge had learned to paint over again with his left hand . Mr. Lawrence determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man past youth to set himself . Yet it was accomplished . Six months after his misfortune , he had attained sufficient skill to have occasional works again accepted by Harper 's . Now that a full score of years has passed , he is able to exhibit water colors painted with his left hand better than illustrations painted with his right . <P> Ironically enough , now that the left hand has learned the cunning that was lost by the right , the right shows symptoms of returning to health . " See , " says Artist Lawrence , slowly lifting his paralyzed arm , " I will soon be able to use them both . "
