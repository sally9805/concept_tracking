William Tatem Tilden broke even . He was ousted from amateur play by the U. S. Lawn Tennis Association ( TIME , July 30 ) and he was temporarily reinstated for the finals of the Davis Cup play by the U. S. L. T. A. at the behest of Myron Timothy Herrick , U. S. Ambassador to France . Gallantly , recklessly he conquered Rene Lacoste of France , and was later trounced in straight sets by Henri Cochet of France . Ambassador Herrick , a quick-acting diplomat , knowing that the French would not feel satisfied unless Tilden was in action , promptly said the necessary words to the U. S. tennis officials . A final decision on Tilden 's status will be made when he returns to the U. S.
