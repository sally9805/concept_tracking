S PEAKING of contempt , nothing could be more contemptible than the course of Attorney General Daugherty and President Coolidge in the case of Comptroller Craig of New York City . He is not pardoned , but his sentence of sixty days in jail for criticizing Judge Mayer is " remitted , " an action which it is expressly stated does , not constitute a vindication . In other words Mr. Craig is told : You are guilty , but because you are a prominent man and the newspapers have made a great hubbub , we are afraid to let you go to jail . Mr. Craig could be spared from his office as readily as Mayor Hylan has been , nor would his family be left in want as in the case of many a poor devil of a John Doe . The recommendation of the Department of Justice in the Craig case is in striking contrast to its pusillanimous poltroonery in regard to political prisoners , where there has been no such club of moneyed and poweilul opinion brandished in its face . The one cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry the issue into Congress . Mr , La Guardia proposes that conviction for contempt , when based on any act outside the courtroom , shall be possible only through trial by jury . We would go further and abolish the institution of contempt of court , except where there is a refusal to carry out , or an attempt to obstruct , a judicial order . The crime of lest majeste should have no place in a democracy . A judge is entitled to no protection from criticism which is not provided in existing laws against libel , slander , and disorderly conduct . OMEBODY might remind " our Mr. Weeks , " who pre-b .. 3 sides over the War Department , that the cost of a bull in a china shop is not primarily the board and lodging of the bull but the crockery he smashes . Thus the Secretary of War 's economical soul rejoices in announcing that the upkeep of our army , navy , and marine corps absorbed only 14 per cent of the federal budget for the last fiscal year . Delighted ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt for past wars , the upkeep of the Veterans ' Bureau , and the expenditure for pensions ( not to speak of a bonus in the offing ) ? Mr. Weeks does not give us the total percentage for warfare past and present . For the year 1920 government statisticians computed the total as 93 per cent ! Owing to reduced annual expenditures , it has fallen a little since , but it is still too staggering for Mr .. Weeks to care to compute it . Incidentally , the War Department is still getting rid of material which apparently is a hold-over from its riotous purchases during the World War . A correspondent sends us a catalogue of a sale in which appear 4,220 cans of allspice provided by some thoughtful commissary ; also 549,880 currycombs . " Were there that many horses and mules in the army , " he wonders , " or did the men use them for back-scratchers ? " F ORECASTERS have been prophesying that the Conservatives would come through the British election for a second time with a minority of the votes cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted a million majority for free trade  --  but , under the electoral system which prevails in England as here , the protectionists may nevertheless tip the scales in Parliament . At the last election the Conservatives cast only 39 per cent of the votes , but they won 54 per cent of the seats . Labor , with 30 per cent of the votes , got only 25 per cent of the seats , and the two wings of the Liberals , with almost as many votes as Labor , together had only 19 per cent of the seats . In the last Canadian election the Conservatives polled 962 , - 601 votes and won 50 seats ; the Progressives polled only 726,730 votes , but won 65 seats . Whenever there are three parties to a contest the system creaks and groans . In Queensland this year Labor won 43 seats to the Opposition 's 29 , although it polled fewer votes ; the Opposition 's forces were divided . The answer , of course , is proportional representation .

I read that letter to our national congress at Levallois ; it made clear the importance and significance of our International Union . Those words come back to me today . I speak through you to the French soldiers of the army of occupation .

Understand on which side of the struggle lie your interest and your destiny before you commit the crime of obeying your officers .. C ARLO TRESCA 'S conviction on November 27 for advertising an Italian book on birth control in his paper , Il Martello , seems to be the final step in an indecent and dishonest persecution of a man who is said by our State Department to be " causing friction between two governments " and who is hungrily awaited in Italy for his successful efforts to prevent Fascista organizations in this country . When the Post Office Department stated that the advertisement in question was not mailable it was deleted , and the issue was then accepted for mailing . Two other papers carrying the same advertisement have not been brought to the bar . The proprietor of an Italian bookstore in New York City which sells the book has not been molested , nor did the customs authorities make any attempt to hold up shipments of it . The book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tresca who insists on attacking Fascism and thereby becomes a pestiferous fly in the cup of friendship between Mussolini 's country and Harry Micajah Daugherty 's . O N June 17 the police refused to allow Tresca to speak in Buffalo . The July 21 issue of Il Martello was suspended from the mails without warning and no specific charges were brought ; the case was finally dropped . On August 14 Tresca was arrested for what amounted to a crime of lese majeste , an article , then three months old , against the Italian monarchy .

The issue of November 24 , containing the charge that Mussolini appropriated for his election expenses a sum intended for D'Annunzio in Fiume , has been declared " unmailable . " And now , finally , the conviction of November 27 . It took six months , but the long arm of Mussolini has finally reached him , here in the home of the free . " . . . that all who come to this shrine which we are dedicating to our dead may be forced to stop and think , and thinking , see for at least one moment the reality and the truth of war as known by our fallen comrades , and against which they fought and gave their lives .

Post No. 113 expects a storm of protest which they say will mean this ? " that the general public hates to face reality and does not except when so compelled to do , " and that " in our memorial it has seen the truth and , seeing , rebels against the horror of war .

We are reminded by a communication from the Round Table , a student organization , that " any group within the college has perfect freedom to invite anyone they wish to speak here , and the administration gives the use of the college buildings for the address . " Scott Nearing spoke last winter and William Z. Foster last month . Of the address by the latter we read in the college daily : " The crowd , which was probably hostile before the speaker began , was softened by Mr. Foster 's first sentence , in which he stated that it was a privilege to speak at Dartmouth because it was one of the few prominent colleges that retained the right of free speech .

Just what it proves we do not know , but doubtless the statistician felt a gratifying sense that he had concluded a unique and original research . It would be just like this cynical age for some young whippersnapper to arise and remark that the stenographers were responsible for the difference , and that if Washington had only been reported by a gi-aduate of S. S. Sap 's Stenographic School , which teaches a preference for periods in place of semi-colons , he would have outranked Calvin himself . " C OMRADE OLIVER " BALDWIN is the son of the Prime Minister of Great Britain . While his father is stumping Britain for the Conservative Party young Oliver is stumping Buckinghamshire for the Labor Party . His opinion of his father 's Government is clear-cut : The Government has been in office twelve months and what have they done ? They have done nothing save twiddle their fingers . Their foreign policy is terrible . The Government talks about protection . The only protection I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may need it when he gets back home  --  though we suspect that the Prime Minister , on trial for his political life , enjoyed his son 's campaign against him as much as anyone else in Britain . It is as it should be . If Oliver Baldwin ever becomes a Labor minister , we hope that his son will take the stump for the Tories . There is no health in a family ' Where successive generations think and vote according to an ancestral tradition . HAT story of eleven-year-old Leo Granoff , the Boy T Trotzky of Harlem , for instance , filled us with enthusiasm . Leo , it seems , found his empty home unbearable when his mother went to the theater ; finally he was , as he put it , so scared that he went down to the street and , as the police would say , " loitered " near the corner drugstore . He loitered so disconsolately that a policeman became interested . The next thing Leo knew he was being searched , and in his pockets , among the normal contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist tracts . Horrors ! Leo was arrested ; a sharp detective discovered that Leo was secretary , or third vice-president , or something , of the Harlem Branch of the Young Workers ' League . Leo was photographed , and interviewed , and finally released . The next day Miss Etta Leighton , a white-collar slave , as Leo would say , who works for the National Security League , sallied forth to study the horrid phenomenon . She found Leo gaily roller-skating with a new brand of literature in his pockets  --  copies of the newspapers containing his picture and an interview in which Leo declared that he preferred life in America to life in Russia because he felt his message more needed here . The white-collar slave also interviewed Leo , and forthwith gave out a statement to the papers in which she exclaimed : " It 's no joke ; it 's a tragedy , " and expressed her fears for the foundations- of the republic . The republic will stand ; as Heywood Broun remarked , Leo is as likely as not to grow up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Roosevelt was his fearlessness in taking a stand on public questions , no matter how ticklish . In regard to the Ku Klux Klan , at least , his eldest son has inherited his father 's directness . A K. K. K. speaker at Freeport , Long Island , was recently reported to have extended the organization 's support to " Young Teddy , " whereupon the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sent a telegram of inquiry to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy . " I have not heard one thing about the Ku Klux Klan indorsing me , " wrote Mr. Roosevelt in reply . " I can not conceive that it is so , because I came out flatfooted against them in a public speech at the National Republican Club on Lincoln 's Birthday last year . " This is good Americanism , and in the long run it will prove to be good politics . We do not need laws or rival organizations to fight the Klan ; we do need to know the attitude of every candidate for public office toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equality , and fraternity to those who are white , Gentile , and Protestant . M ISS " BILLY " TICHENOR is white , Gentile , and Protestant , so she is not hounded by the Ku Klux Klan . Yet in this land of **27;1540;TOOLONG she , too , has her troubles , as one gathers from her letter to the Board of Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church , recently in session in New York City , whom she feelingly addressed as " Revered Leaders " : I am a member of the Methodist Church South , and so are my parents . So were my parental grandparents and great-grandparents . You Northern Methodists are forbidden to dance , play cards , and go to the theater or circus under penalty of expulsion . Both Northern and Southern branches , separated before the Civil War by the slavery question , are probably soon to reunite . Would the amusement ban later apply also to us Southern Methodists ? My vocation is now that of an exhibition dancer . Bishop Berry has said actors are not welcome as Methodists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church membership which means so much to them ? Would I be required to resign if the Southern group amalgamates with the Northern Methodists ? Wo n't you please use your influence with annual conferences and the 1924 General Conference to get these blue laws lifted ? After giving this letter , we assume , their best consideration , the " revered leaders " replied : Concerning the various matters discussed in your letters , authority does not lie with the bishops of the church ; and we feel , therefore , that answers to your questions are not within our province . But the bishops assure Miss Tichenor of their good wishes , and pray God that she and her parents may have the divine blessing . It is nice of the " revered leaders " to extend to Miss " Billy " the hope of " divine blessing " ? even if she has to seek it on the back stoop instead of inside the church .

An instructor in psychology at Columbia University is conducting serious experiments to discover whether two trained subjects , working half a mile or more apart , can select the same picture from duplicate sets at the same time . St. Mark 's Church in New York City announces as a feature of its annual festival of St. Nicholas " an explanation of the occult world by a committee under the guidance of Mrs. Samuel Untermyer . " Probably Mrs. Untermyer and her committee can explain the occult world at least as well as anybody else . Naturally they would not attempt to explain the visible world or the actions of human beings , of which at present we have only the vaguest understanding . No theaters are crowded to find out why humans put each other in jail and kill each other and run for Congress and send Christmas cards . Some problems are too hard for experts in psychology .
