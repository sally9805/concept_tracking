City managers are not so numerous as politicians . But Cincinnati , having decided that she prefers one of the former rather than one of the latter for her lord and master , last week announced her choice : Lieutenant Colonel Clarence O. Sherrill of the Engineering Corps of the Army . She will bring him a dower of $25,000 a year . <P> Colonel Sherrill is a North Carolinian . In 1901 he was graduated from West Point , second in a class of 142 . As an Engineer officer he served in the Philippines , at Mobile on the Rivers and Harbors Commission , at New Orleans during the severe floods of 1912 and 1913 , and on the Panama Canal . He went overseas with the A. E. F. and became Chief of Staff of the 77th Division . In 1921 he was made Director of Public Buildings and Grounds of the District of Columbia , a post which carried with it the duties of Chief Military Aide to the President . But he made so much of his job in the city that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide " at formal White House functions . <P> Hear the rhapsodic description of him which the Washington correspondent wired to the Enquirer for consumption by the eager citizens of Cincinnati : <P> " Not a day passes that he is not called upon to act as engineer , architect , artist , interior and exterior decorator , landscape gardener , tree doctor , florist , gamekeeper , director of outdoor sports , and censor of beauty , morals and safety . " He is the man who provides ' love nests ' for the birds and squirrels in Washington 's numerous parks and playgrounds , shelter for the park policemen , benches for the weary as well as the lovelorn , golf links , tennis courts , and bathing beaches for the thousands of Government workers . He blazes bridle paths through the cool woods , supervises the care of the flowers and cherry trees along the Potomac speedway , and provides the camp for summer tourists amid a setting of blooms and municipal gardens . <P> " He cooperates in selecting sites for monuments , makes plans for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At his command , the United States flag flings its challenge of pride from the tops of public buildings , or at half mast expresses grief at the loss of a patriot . <P> " He causes public squares to bloom , fountains and bands to play , and sandpiles to grow for the kiddies . <P> " He arranges patriotic parades and celebrations , issues permits and invitations , makes traffic regulations , erects pavilions , receives delegations , reviews high school cadets , and serves on floor committees of charity balls . <P> " Formerly he might have been seen in the daytime conferring with the mistress of the White House concerning a leak in the roof . That night , in gold trappings and with soldierly bearing , he would be announcing the guests to the President and the First Lady . <P> " Economy has played a large part in Colonel Sherrill 's efficiency scheme ; he has learned how to squeeze the eagle until it can be heard squealing down at the Treasury .
