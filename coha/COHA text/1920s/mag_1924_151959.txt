Eleven German workmen entered Paris . They had been invited , yet no sooner had they arrived than shooting began . The Germans defended themselves , shot back with great accuracy . Three of their shots found a mark-the goal of a French workmen 's soccer team . The German goal , at the other end of the field in the Buffalo Velodrome , came off unscathed . It was the first Franco-German sporting event ( outside the Rhineland ) since the Armistice . Said despatches : " Ten thousand Frenchmen cheered the winners . There was no hissing . "
