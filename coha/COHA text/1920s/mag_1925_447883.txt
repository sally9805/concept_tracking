TRANSCONTINENTAL motor-trips are not unique in themselves . Whatever distinction mine may have possessed was due in great part to the Duchess , ' Bobby , and attending circumstance . To begin with , I was convinced that I could pay for gasoline , food , and incidentals through the sale of oil sketches and pastels made along the way . Incidentally , I was determined to tackle any kind of work for which , as artist , ex-soldier , and vagabond of some experience , I might be fitted . I asked of the Fates only that they afford a good summer 's experience , pleasant adventure , and enough monetary reward to pay expenses . At the outset I borrowed three hundred dollars to pay for a car and a month 's living . If quick returns were not produced the expedition would go on the rocks somewhere in the Middle West , where so many road-shows have met their doom . But this one-man troupe must be a success ? if only to vindicate my repeated glowing assertions of its possibilities , by which skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed money in my pocket , I chose an encouragingly sunny May day on which to search for a car . The instant I laid eyes on the Duchess I knew she would do . Another type of Ford had been in my mind ? a commercial body fashioned after the manner of the ambulance in which I toured France for two years . But the Duchess , though fundamentally nothing but a well-worn touring car , possessed a superstructure at once unique and desirable : a special enclosed top , with glass panels and isinglass windows , which disappeared into the upper reaches after some persuasion , leaving the interior as well ventilated as a roof garden . Why did I call her the Duchess ' ? Because there is always something humorous about a duchess , and because there was about the car a certain intangible dignity which later took her proudly into the company of the most rudely hilarious . I drove out into the press of machines on Fifty-third Street feeling decidedly self-complacent , for young painters of my small reputation and with my aversion to present-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a three-year-old . No intrigante ever whispered more persuasively of Romantic Adventure at the ear of attentive youth than did her ladyship in mine . Outfitting any kind of trip , be it only a week-end in the suburbs , is a profound effort to me because of my propensity for taking everything that might possibly be of use in any climate under any conditions . Now for equipment . In the first place , enough clothes were essential to withstand long and arduous days on the restless seat of a Ford ; to cope with chill mountain mornings , hot prairie afternoons , and innumerable rainy nights ; to meet such an emergency as a speaking engagement before the Women 's Club of Oshkosh or a visit to the home of a cordial millionaire . By heroic manipulation I succeeded in getting everything into two suitcases ? everything except a heavy overcoat , a raincoat , and a st raw hat . The latter was somewhat of a problem , but was finally placed in a paper bag and pinned to the top of the car . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traded to a newsboy for a Sunday pa per . Next came sleeping accommodations ; a culinary department complete enough to handle at least three good meals a day , with an extra set of eating implements for the chance guest ; a repair outfit capable of meeting all exigencies not complicated by serious breakage ; and a revolver for defense . Condensation began to be imperative . To eliminate a tent I had the back of the front seat cut clown the sides and hinged at the bottom so that it would turn over to join with the rear seat in forming a bed , comfortable in inverse proportion to the height of its occupant . Personally I am over six feet . For bedding I got out the old army-blankets and rolled them up inside a ground-sheet . The cooking and dining appurtenances ? an odd assortment of telescoping pans , tin cups , mess kit , and jars of flour , sugar , salt , pepper , and the like ? were compactly stored . in a pail and a tin tool-box . Out of respect for tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the rear seat where , when the car was well packed , they were as completely inaccessible as they would have been inside the cylinders . A small spade went on the running-board beside the grill for camp-fire cooking . More trouble lay ahead in the shape of painting materials . Salted down . they consisted of a suitcase filled to capacity , a folding easel , a folding parasol , a large portfolio , two gold frames ( very essential to the selling campaign ) , and a large amount of prepared wall-board , in lieu of stretchers and canvas . This , I calculated , would take me to Alaska by way of Buenos Aires , if necessary . All that remained to be considered now were the diversions . A fourth old suitcase took care of a library of one hundred and fifty five-cent books . A place was found for a small phonograph on the running-board . After a heated debate with myself I compromised with one golf club and a dozen balls . I should have preferred a ? tennis racket , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not care to have ; neither did I take a crossword-puzzle book . Up to the moment of stepping on the starter , I had planned to go entirely alone . But the inquiring , hopeful expression which animated Bobby , my dog companion of many adventurous wanderings , proved impossible to resist , and I whistled to him and made room beside me on the seat . A word about Bobby , for he , like all family pets , is no ordinary one . It was in the Vosges Mountains of France in the winter of 1917-18 , when my section was resting after a strenuous turn at Verdun , that we first became acquainted . I was a nineteen-year-old buck private , he a three-week-old ball of energized fur . He was given to the section as a mascot and for a year and a half toured the Western Front with us , saw Belgium at the time of the Armistice , and shared our spring vacation in the Army of Occupation . He did not , as a lady once asked me , drag the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he frolicked through the vicissitudes of camp life with such comic abandon and unfailing spirits that he more than served his turn in keeping up the general morale . I thought him only an exceptionally intelligent mongrel ; but when , after our discharge , I took him to dog authorities in Paris , I found he was a wire-haired griffon of good points . And so it was that the Duchess , Bobby , and I started West . II I stopped at the near-by filling-station for an initial load of gasoline . Here I found the first example of that friendly interest in the motor traveler which I had not expected until I reached the Western auto-camps . The garage man as he pumped the gas looked my conveyance over . You 've got quite a load there . Going far ? ' As far as I can push her ? California , I hope . ' That so ? I just drove up from Texas myself . Better drive around that way . That 's a pretty heavy load you ' ye got there , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a good-sized load you ' ve got . Well , good luck to you . ' I steered my course through dripping , glistening Manhattan , ferried across a W histler 's Hudson , and , disembarking on the Jersey shore , headed for Philadelphia along the Lincoln Highway . We reached the environs of Philadelphia late in the evening , and I was glad to spend the night with some friends . As yet I had evolved no system which promised any success in making up my bed while it rained , without unloading half the car and getting the contents well soaked . I preferred to practise on a dry night . I proceeded to tour Philadelphia in search of an egress that did not run to Atlantic City . This outlet-hunting in a large town is a problem unless you are on a marked thoroughfare , and it was with a sigh of relief that I found a surprising sign which announced that San Francisco lay ahead . I was back on the already familiar Lincoln Highway , well designated by red . white-and-blue poles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had previous experience is a pleasure akin to renewing friendships . As soon as the city limits were reached , I gave the Duchess her head and we bowled along merrily through the beautiful emerald valley country in which lie Lancaster and Gettysburg . The skies were smiling again , and the freshly laundered fields and groves were a joy alike to my eyes and to Bobby 's nostrils . Even the Duchess purred her content . How the fields of Gettysburg should stir the imagination , and how poorly do they do so in their present condition ; for a thousand ugly white monuments scattered over too well-kept lawns make it difficult for even a war-time vision to reconstruct in fancy the three great days commemorated . ' Better marked topographically and artistically than any other battlefield in the world , ' the Blue Book tells one . That night I felt in the humor to drive right on to California , and it was well on toward midnight before sleep seemed imperative . Finding no inviting spot on the highway , I turned off on a crossroad . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of a possible pasture bedroom , a thing not easy to locate in the dead of night with none-too-good headlights . At last a break in the fence on one side was discovered and I drew off the road , not daring to go far into the freshly ploughed field ahead . I unloaded a few layers of cargo , putting the excess under the machine , and made my bed by the light of a young moon , to the throbbing accompaniment of the insect world . Bobby found traces of many exciting animals in the neighborhood and it was with difficulty I persuaded him to turn in beside me . The night so pleasantly begun was not to be uneventful . Barely had sleep overtaken me when I was startled by a staccato report . It took me some time to think of looking in the right place , for although I had expected trouble with the ancient tires possessed by the Duchess I was not prepared to have them blow out when I merely rolled over in bed . Making ready to renew my slumbers , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having a hilarious chase after a galloping herd of cows silhouetted at the top of an adjacent hill . By the time I had persuaded Bobby to return to bed , the first cock was calling lustily for more light . His wish was shortly granted , and with the dawn came the farmer , a solemn-faced Swede , who announced from his perch on a harrow that I should have to move from the one entrance to his field . The tire changed , breakfast accomplished , and Bobby dragged away from the spot where he had been barking for an hour under the fond delusion that he had treed a rabbit , I called a farewell to the ploughman and then steered back to the main highway . Up , over , and down the long Allegheny grades we rolled until well along in the afternoon the suburbs of Pittsburgh unfolded themselves to my view and I stopped to ponder over the beauty of Turtle Creek . Here , in a setting surpassed by only one American city , man has created a unique masterpiece fashioned of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , descending alike on massed shacks and cottages , towering chimneys and scarred hillsides , has composed them into a gray tone-poem . Little seedling locomotives scurrying around on the floor of the valley engender vast columns of virgin-white smoke to add a colorful accent . The throbbing machinery drones an accompanying chant that finds an echo in my singing heart . It is seldom that Big Business , either by accident or intent , has woven such a spell of enchantment about itself . I was tempted to try putting my impressions on canvas , in spite of ? perhaps because of ? the familiar use of the subject by Pennell and Lie . Besides which it was high time I began to think of adding to my hoard . What better place to start than Pittsburgh , where the International Exhibition , then in progress , should have educated people up to the importance of owning pictures ? ' real hand-painted ' ones ? So I settled down for an hour to do a sketch to fit the smaller of my two frames , the while I dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my study , like it , and offer to buy it for a fabulous sum . But my only audience was a group of young miners homeward hound . Gee , ' said one of them , after watching awhile in silence , if I could do that I would n't work . ' The painting as complete as I cared to make it , I hunted for and found a near-by auto-camp in which to lie over until the morrow . As I was making preparations for dinner a shiny new Cadillac drew up beside the Duchess , and out of it climbed a family of three , father , mother , and a girl of twelve ? all dressed in spotless sport-clothes fit for a country-club verandah . The child immediately became interested in Bobby and we all exchanged greetings . Mother ' had difficulty in suppressing her amusement over my outfit , circling it several times . Meanwhile Father ' watched with keen , absorbed interest my wood-cutting and fire-building activities . Threatening darkness convinced them that they should begin their own meal , and the preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . First they unloaded a large straw hamper containing a complete cooking and eating outfit : bright new silverware , aluminum pans , nickel cups in a leather case ? everything for an emergency , and all new and apparently unused . Then a large steak , potatoes , and various accessories were unwrapped . But it was the appearance of a Boston Cook Book that incapacitated me for the time being , and it soon was apparent from their remarks that none of them had ever attempted to cook a meal before . I tried to be oblivious to their struggles , but dreaded the thought of what would probably happen to that succulent steak . ( I was dining on frankfurters . ) Finally they came to an impasse , being entirely at odds over the problem of whether coffee should be cooked twice or only half as long as potatoes . ' Mother ' finally approached me for advice . My reply must have sounded authoritative , for it was not long before I was installed as chef while the enchanted family stood about and beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , even to Bobby , who gorged himself on frankfurters . After breakfast next morning I brought forth the sketch with an eye to business , but although my wealthy neighbors were politely interested it never occurred to them to offer to buy it . I had been so confident that sales of this kind would be easy that , disappointed on my first attempt , the sketch looked like a white elephant to me , the trip already imperiled . But the clay was too fine to permit of prolonged gloom , so I breezed into Pittsburgh feeling reckless enough to go into a barber shop for a shave . Then , too , I had been told that barbers were gullible souls and could be persuaded to buy almost anything . I set my sketch , with its still glittering gold frame , in a conspicuous place and gave myself contentedly into the barber 's hands . Interest was keen enough , but it was centred more on myself and my clog than on the picture , and when sonic new calendars showing buxom bathing girls were exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another failure , Had I only thought to bring some life-class studies ! Once more I turned the Duchess westward . On the outskirts of town I stopped at a gas station with an almost empty tank . As the attendant drained the hose I had an inspiration . Again the picture was produced . Say , buddy , ' I began airily , I 'm a New York artist down here to see the Exhibition . I dashed off a sketch on the other side of town and , although I could take it back to New York and sell it for fifty dollars , it seems as though somebody in Pittsburgh who knows the place ought to own it . What do you say ? how much am I offered for it ? ' Well , ' he drawled back , ' I 'd like it better if it was Tennessee , but I 'll trade you the gasoline even . ' I staggered from the blow , but thought fast . All right , partner , it 's a bargain , though it pains me to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southerner dubiously staring at his new possession ? wondering , I suppose , if he had been a sucker and what his wife would say . III From Pittsburgh I followed my nose toward Cleveland and Chicago . On the transcontinental roads , one passes many so-called hikers , ' some of whom carry large signs on their backs announcing that they are going all the way across . They turn to you with pleading gestures and beguiling smiles , especially when you are in a Ford and alone . Several times , feeling in the mood for a little companionship and hoping to find an interesting personality , I stopped and took one aboard . Bobby never was pleased with these arrangements , for it meant that he had to perch on top of the luggage in the back seat . Each time I tried this experiment of being congenial I had such bad luck in my choice that I usually swore never to do it again . It happened that I was in for my share of hold-ups . The first occurred during a black midnight hour on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches clutched at the Duchess from the dense mass of trees on either side as if resentful at being disturbed thus late . My mind going back to war memories , I turned off the lights for a moment to find whether or not I could still hold to an invisible pathway . Darkness rushed in on all sidec so swiftly as to make the experiment foolhardy . I again switched on the lights . The two beams leaped forward and , pushing farther and farther ahead , illumined the figure of a man standing in the road . His costume was shabby ; a cap was pulled low over his eyes . He held up one empty hand , but , when the Duchess showed no intention of even hesitating , the other hand menacingly brought forth an automatic . Thinking spontaneously , ? it was all over in a fleeting , breathless moment , ? I slipped my own revolver from its holster beside the seat while I applied the pedals as if to stop . Then , coasting up to the man , I suddenly jerked the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the moment his gun was pointing heavenward as he sought to regain balance . I pressed the foot-throttle deep . The Duchess leaped past down the highway , roaring defiance , while I discharged my gun through the open window . I took no aim ? it was merely a warning , or a small boy 's gesture of bravado . The bandit proved equally anxious to show that his was no glass toy filled with candy , for lie sent a bullet winging through the back of the car before we could careen around a sheltering curve to safety . My second bandit proved to be the traffic policeman of a small town . When I unwittingly disregarded his gesture to stop , he became irate enough to board another car and overtake me at the next corner . I seemed not to help matters by explaining that lie looked not a particle like any policeman I had ever seen . He was all for taking me back to the town hall and fining me . But before this could be done Bobby stepped in to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat beside me . He now rose up for a stretch . The constable took notice of him for the first time and showed unmistakable signs of being a dog-lover . I jumped at the opening . Of course you never saw one like him before . There are probably not a dozen in the country . Got him in France ? war-dog ? used for hunting over there . ' Then I got out of the car and , sitting on a convenient park bench , put Bobby through his not inconsiderable repertoire of tricks : counting , saying his prayers , catching food tossed from his nose , recognizing the difference between my imitation of an exploding shell and a dud ( squatting for safety for the latter and playing dead for the former ) , turning around and rolling over , knowing his right from his left , skipping rope with me , and others of similar variety . deleted material Well , I 'm anxious to show you what I can do . I 'll let it go for this meal and a tankful of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' all right , go ahead . If I like the thing it 's a bargain . ' After I got out my painting materials and he decided I was not a revenue officer , lie joined heartily in the proceedings , arranging a light and rigging an impromptu scaffolding . As my success depended upon his liking the picture , I sounded him for a favorite subject . Of my suggestions he seemed to prefer a figure-painting to pure landscape and , as he was an ex-gob , I thought water would be safe for a background . To cinch the deal , I outlined a ' Venus Rising from the Sea . ' No Zuloaga ever created more interest . I laid it in rapidly with large brushes , using plenty of turpentine , and inside of two hours I had a regular Frank Brangwyn . As it began to be intelligible the proprietor became most enthusiastic . Every now and then he would rush out to the street and return with a fellow townsman , until a good-sized audience had collected . I have always regretted not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the New York Public Library , but this coup of mine was the next best thing . My patron was so pleased with results that he passed out drinks to the crowd , filled up the Duchess ( Bobby and I were already complete ) , gave me a five-dollar bill from the till , and begged me to stay for an impromptu party . I excused myself , saying I had a hard day ahead , and drove off . IV Dire necessity urged me to a long final drive to my immediate destination , an attractive town of some twenty thousand inhabitants situated amonggently rolling hills on the banks of the Des Moines River . The neighboring countryside promised much pleasant material for my , work . Arriving in the early evening , I manoeuvred the Duchess , who was footsore , to the home of my cousin . Here a cordial invitation to stay as long as I desired was extended and gratefully accepted ? how gratefully he will never know ! Still more pleasing was his enthusiastically expressed wish to aid in the selling enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , during the slackness in his own trade , ? that of a tinsmith , ? ready to bend all his energies toward the sale of my handiwork , good or bad . The following day , after having procured a little advance advertising in the Daily Bugle , we two conspirators set off in search of some attractive landscapes . These proving plentiful , I selected one on the river bank , and while Bobby romped with some swimming urchins , and the cousin plied me with questions concerning technique , I laid in a swift study of a graceful bridge arching the rampant waters . Having carried this far enough to be intelligible , I moved downstream , accomplishing another before lunchtime . In the afternoon I tried painting the flat prairies outside the town , using a low horizon and attaining picturesqueness by piling up tier on tier of the frisky puffball clouds typical of the region . Of the three canvases I much preferred the last , as it seemed more characteristic of the country ; but when , a few days later , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen of the brookside variety could be sold to one of the prairies . Oh , Iowa is n't really as uninteresting as that , you know . It 's just full of cosy little picnic-places . And see all the hills here in town . You 've made it look too monotonously level . ' Only an occasional individual seems to feel the unique beauty of the limitless grain-fickle , with silos and farmhouses hiding in groves that dwindle and melt into the beckoning blue distances . - At the end , then , of this first clay of painting I had produced two small sketches to fit the nine-by-twelve-inch frame , and one to fit the sixteen-bytwenty . Consulting with the cousin , we decided to ask seven dollars and a half for the smaller and fifteen dollars for the larger size , hoping by these modest prices to attract the many people who ordinarily never think of owning anything but a print because they have heard that all originals cost up in the hundreds . At these prices the clay 's work should net thirty dollars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He even talked of modern efficiency methods applied to painting in order to speed up production , and thereafter , whenever I brought in a canvas with more than one foreground tree , he loudly protested at the use of too much time-absorbing detail . And when he found that the precedent of three a day was not to be lived up to he called it one more proof of the tradition that all painters are loafers . Once engaged , the cousin proved a heartless manager . He relentlessly insisted on my accepting an invitation to speak before the Business and Professional Women 's Club . This was terrifying . ' But think of the advertising , ' reiterated the cousin . ' If you land with the ladies , your name will be a household word . ' The outcome was foregone , and I sat up all night to produce a paper that to me was a masterpiece . I read it aloud at breakfast . Very pretty and high-sounding ; but what 's it all about ? ' the cousin inquired . My heart sank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , ' he announced , ' it means nothing to this tinsmith . What , pray , are " values " and " interesting line " and " good color " and " mood " ? ' It was apparent that the paper had failed in the very purpose for which it had been conceived . After some meditation I thought of a possible way out . Instead of telling my audience of what that mysterious thing called Art consists , I would show them ! So on the evening of the appointed day I appear . ed before the assembled ladies garbed in a smock ( for atmosphere ) , and loaded down with painting materials , pictures , and much literature . I read some of my would-be serious paper , made a few random remarks on the development of modern painting , illustrating with reproductions , showed my recent canvases , and finished up by painting a fifteen-minute sketch before their eyes . When I feared interest was lagging I recounted a few anecdotes of the studios . What it lacked in unity and coherence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was gratified by my apparent success in holding the attention of the gathering . The cousin was enthusiastic about subsequent newspaper notices . That 's a great start ? I guess you knocked them for a row of pins that time . Now when you do the same for the Kiwanis Club next Thursday we ' II have the town eating out of our hand . ' Kiwanis Club , ' I moaned . ' What is this game ? ' Thursday ? twelve sharp ? at the hotel , ' was the unperturbed reply . You will be allowed twenty-five minutes at the close of the luncheon programMe . You go on after the Girl Scout orchestra . ' Too weak to argue , I attacked the new problem with what good grace I could muster . Entertaining a roomful of business men , hilarious after a large meal and a general song-fest , is a different matter from seeking to interest the more impressionable other sex . On Thursday at 1Q55 , when ' Mr. Robert Alden Reaser , New York artist , ' was introduced , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of personal war-anecdotes . Whenever at a loss for words , ? often the case , ? I resorted to a rapid crayon sketch to illustrate or point my story . To my immense relief the idea caught on with the crowd . My stage fright vanished , and when the time was up I was so enjoying the fun of working for laughs in true vaudevillian manner that I should have liked to continue indefinitely . These talks added materially to my growing reputation about town and , as our stock of landscapes had grown , we thought it time to invite some sales . But time flew without results and I began to be nervous . An exhibition downtown seemed to be the best means of arousing interest , but I had no resources with which to back such an enterprise . Quite obviously we could not hope to sell the pictures unless someone could be persuaded to look at them . Accordingly we made out a list of possible victims , piled the Duchess full of canvases , some still wet , and proceeded to tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entr ? e could be obtained . This method , after all , is the ideal one for placing pictures , for they can be picked out to fill and properly decorate a barren wall-space , which function is their real reason for existence . I wish I could relate all the humor of that house-to-house canvasing . Of the ladies who spent hours trying to choose between two pictures at seven-fifty or one at fifteen dollars , although the cousin attempted to help by pointing out that the larger pictures were three times the area of the smaller ones andonly twice the price . Of the individuals who thought the prices too high , or vice versa : ' What ! Only fifteen dollars ! And will everyone in town know that that is all I paid for it ? ' And of the sales ruined because husband and wife could not agree on the subject-matter : Well , that 's my choice . You can do anything you like about it . ' The ultimate results of my sojourn in Iowa were most gratifying ? I sold all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three more important works . The most pleasing of these was an order for a good-sized landscape decoration in the new high school . For this a local subject was voted , so that it could be pointed out to possible embryo artists as an example of what might be done with the native scenic material . I selected the favorite panoramic view near town ? a fine , sweeping vista including a bend of the river , hilltop groves , vivacious skies , and a stacked cornfield in the foreground . It was pleasant , indeed , to have the opportunity to leave this big canvas in a public building , where to me it will always be a commemoration of the most successful episode , artistically and commercially , of my journey . At last I had eased off the shadow of my debt and was free to ramble where and as I willed , with no further need of pot-boiling for months to come . Although business showed no signs of a slump , I now felt compelled to tear myself away . It was the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my journey ahead of me . I was told that it was not safe to cross the mountains after the fifteenth of September because of the danger of becoming snow-bound . But sadder even than having to leave a thriving enterprise was the necessity of going on without Bobby . Reports continued to come to me that clogs were not wanted in California and I. took no chances . He was put on a train and shipped back home , while the Duchess and I , missing his companionship , shook the dust of Iowa from our treads and prepared to tackle the mud farther west . V From Iowa I worked north to Minnesota , then turned westward once more along the Yellowstone Trail . I was totally unprepared from anything I had seen or read to find the wheat-fields of the Dakotas so thrilling . An ocean of soft gold and mellow violets , caressed into motion by faint breezes and traversed by majestic shadow-ships ! An ocean more perfect in the quality of its color-harmonies than an Atlantic or Pacific , and saved from mere prettiness by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles , and a high wind that blew out all my windows , I remember the days spent in crossing these States as some of the pleasantest experienced along the way . I made friends with the Indians on the Northern reservations and found them more picturesque than I had been led to believe . Although they have succumbed to an extensive use of our hideous male habiliments , they still retain enough love of color and ornament to save them from lapsing into the monotone of the whites . The women have even profited in many cases by a gypsylike use of full , brilliantly dyed skirts and gay kerchiefs , although there are injudicious ones among them who verge on burlesque ? such as , for instance , the maiden I encountered who wore an emerald-green silk shirt , pink knickers , and brown shoes and stockings . It is strange that we have had no really fine paintings of our Indian life . Certainly there is no more picturesque figure-material to be found ; yet , in spite of the fact that there is a group of painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we get nothing but a weakly decorative type of canvas more suited to be used as backgrounds for groups at the Natural History Museum than as genre paintings of artistic importance . I have never , in standing before one of these Indian pictures , been made to feel that the painter had a deeply sincere understanding of or sympathy with his subjects ? such as , for instance , one feels on viewing Millet 's peasants , Zorn 's bathers , the aristocrats of a Gainsborough , or the music-hall performers of a Degas . Of the many States I have traveled through in my search for Beauty , Montana reigns supreme with me ? which statement has nearly cost me my life in California . Running , as it does , from the gray plains of sage- and rabbit-brush , through verdant river-valleys bordered by green-swept hills . to those most exquisite examples of mountain loveliness within the confines of Glacier Park ? it is a symphony of endless fascinating variations . Nowhere can Yellowstone approximate the ethereal melody of Lake Bowman , toward which I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty from the usual asphalt-loving tourist . My few attempts at mountain scenery were not entirely successful , and I again came to the conclusion that it does not form good painter 's material . Our pigments are too earthy , our techniques not subtle enough to entrap the evanescent moods and intangible loveliness of mountain woodlands and lakes . Perhaps it is just as well not to challenge Nature at her best ? she has plenty of commonplace moments with which to vie . Feeling this , I was content to roam on foot or on horseback over these royal hillsides , or , sitting beneath a giant fir , to lose myself in contemplation of some lake unruffled by my gaze . But this feeling of incompetency was not a justifiable excuse for my inaction , it appeared , for on the few occasions when I dared to wield a brush I disposed of the results , unsatisfying as they were , with surprising ease . As a grand finale to the pilgrimage across Montana , my path into Idaho led through almost a hundred miles of virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception , as to make our Eastern ones seem very puny indeed . I think back upon them now with more pleasure than upon the California redwoods , for the latter are tremendous egoists that have stamped out other forms of vegetation , leaving in place of the rich pattern of tangled undergrowth beloved by all woodsmen only a brown waste as barren as a well-worn campground . The nights I spent beneath those awesome Northern trees , ? a full moon picking out their regal old trunks with her light and bathing an occasional snooping bear in a pool of phosphorescence , ? those nights will rank with the most spectacular of happy reminiscence . As September advanced and the threat of snow became more ominous , I pushed on through the Rockies and the Coast Range to the Pacific at Seattle . From there , now following the shore line , now bearing back into the big-timber country for a glimpse of a national park , I drifted southward . For the first time I found my old love , the ocean , disappointing . Though still fascinating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily whispered promises , it seemed not so beautiful as I had hitherto found it . The color was often monotonous , often too pretty , and my eyes missed the endlessly varying mountain shapes over which they had been roving with such infinite pleasure . Reveling in it all , I gradually worked my way into California , until one fine October day I entered Oakland and crossed by ferry to San Francisco . As the Duchess sputtered merrily over the steep grades in this picturesque American city , I thanked her affectionately for the splendid fashion in which she had accomplished the arduous journey . For , although we spent many more pleasant days together in rambling about California , this was our virtual objective , the attainment of which fulfilled my most sanguine hopes . I said good-bye to my car somewhere in Los Angeles . Business in the East called and , although the Duchess had been the most faithful of mistresses , there was no way of taking her back with me . Besides which she had a serious internal complication that might at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of a secondhand dealer the day I planned to leave . How much is she worth ?
