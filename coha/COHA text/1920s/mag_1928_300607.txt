Out of the smoke that was the Schubert Centennial there took shape one definite , perhaps permanent , project which showed itself last week for the first time under the name of the Schubert Memorial , Inc . On the notion that Schubert lived his life unrecognized , that today many talented young U. S. musicians are threatened with the same plight , it organized for the purpose of establishing a contact between them and " the representative musical public . " Baldly , its plan is to sponsor debuts , dress them glamorously that many and important listeners will be attracted , including-and it was severely stressed-leading critics whose verdicts supposedly are to be of inestimable value to the worthy young dbutants . <P> Last week in Manhattan the Schubert Memorial gave its first concert , presented Violinist Sadah Shuchari , 20 ( onetime Sadie Schwartz ) and Pianist Muriel Kerr , 17 , both pupils of the Juilliard Foundation . External circumstances favored them . They had 80 members of the Philharmonic-Symphony to play with , Willem Mengelberg to conduct , Prof. John Erskine ( also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had many and important listeners , including leading critics . They had marked talent , both of them-but for Brahms ' violin concerto , for Rachmaninoff 's second piano concerto it was not enough . Nor did the leading critics appear to remember their assigned roles . Said Lawrence Gilman in the Herald Tribune : " Miss Shuchari gave a creditable conservatory performance , flawed by occasional impurity of intonation , poor tone quality , inaccurate double-stopping , and an infelicitous delivery of the finale , which she played awkwardly , timidly , and insecurely . . . . Miss Kerr 's pretty and facile playing was swamped in the tides of Rachmaninoff 's grandiloquence . " Pitts Sanborn wrote in the Telegram of the Brahms as " nothing for a young miss in flounces to toy with . "
