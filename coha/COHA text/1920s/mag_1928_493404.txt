TO SUM up one 's impressions about Russia is of necessity to engage in speculations about its future . Even the belief that has inspired what I have hitherto written , namely , that the most significant aspect of the change in Russia is psychological and moral , rather than political , involves a look into an unrevealecl future . While the belief is doubtless to be accounted for by con ? tacts that were one-sided , with educational people , not with politicians and economists , still there is good authority for it . Lenin himself expressed the idea that with the accomplishment of the Revolu ? tion the Russian situation underwent a great trans ? formation . Before it had taken place , it was Utopian , he said , to suppose that education and voluntary cooperation could achieve anything sig ? nificant . The workers had first to seize power . But when they had the reins of government in their hands , there took place " a radical change in our point of view toward Socialism . It consists in this , that formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political struggle and the conquest of power . Now this center of gravity is displaced in the direc ? tion of pacific cultural work . I should be ready to say that it is now moving toward intellectual work , were it not for our international relations , and the necessity of defending our position in the international system . If we neglect that phase and confine ourselves to internal economic relations , the center of gravity of our work already consists in intellectual work . " He went on to say that the cause of socialism is now , economically speaking , identical with that of the promotion of cooperation , and added the significant words : " Complete co ? operation is not possible without an intellectual revolution . " Further testimony to the same effect developed in an interview some of us had with Krupskaia , Lenin 's widow , an official at the head of one branch of the government department of education , and naturally a person with great prestige . Consider ? ing her position , her conversation was strangely si ? lent upon matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about incidents of a human sort that had occurred in her contact with children and women , incidents illustrative of their desire for education and for new light and life ? evincing an interest on her part that was quite congruous with her distinctly maternal , almost housewifely type . But at the close she summed up the task of the present regime : Its purpose is , she said , to enable every human being to obtain personal cultivation . The economic and political revolution that has taken place was not the end ; it was the means and basis of a cultural development still to be realized . It was a necessary means , because without economic freedom and equality , the full development of the possibilities of all individuals could not be achieved . But the economic change was for the sake of en ? abling every human being to share to the full in all the things that give value to human life . Even in the economic situation the heart of the problem is now intellectual and educational . This is true in the narrower sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possibly be carried through without preparation of skilled technicians in all lines , industrial and administrative . What Wells said about the world is peculiarly true of Russia ; there is a race between education and catastrophe ? that is , industrial breakdown . It is also true in a fundamental sense that the plan can ? not be carried through without change in the desires and beliefs of the masses . Indeed , it seems to me that the simplest and most helpful way to look at what is now going on in Russia is to view it as an enormous psychological experiment in transforming the motives that inspire human conduct . There are , of course , two points of view from which it is not a genuine experiment , since its issue is foredoomed . The fanatic of individual capital ? istic business for private gain and the Marxian dogmatic fanatic both have the answer ready in advance . According to the first , the attempt is destined to failure ; it is fated to produce , in the words of Mr. Hoover , an " economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from individualism to collectivism of action is the abso ? lute and inevitable result of the working of laws that are as positively known to social " science " as , say , the law of gravitation to physical science . Not being an absolutist of either type , I find it more instructive to regard it as an experiment whose out ? come is quite undetermined , but that is , just as an experiment , by all means the most interesting one going on upon our globe ? though I am quite frank to say that for selfish reasons I prefer seeing it tried in Russia rather than in my own country . Both beliefs in their dogmatic form have served a purpose . The first ? the " individualistic " phil ? osophy ? has enabled men to put up with the evils of the present order of things . If it is as fixed as human nature , and if human nature is built upon the pattern our present economic order manifests , there is nothing to do but bear up as best we can . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge this regime . But ignoring both of these dogmatic faiths , I should say that what is going on in Russia is an experiment having two purposes . The first and more immediate aim is to see whether human beings can have such guarantees of security against want , illness , old age , and for health , recreation , reasonable degree of material ease and comfort , given them by social conditions that they will not have to struggle for purely per ? sonal acquisition and accumulation , without , in short , the strain of competitive struggle for personal profit . In its ulterior reaches , it is an experiment to discover whether the familiar democratic ideals ? familiar in words , at least ? of liberty , equality and brotherhood will not be most completely real ? ized in a social regime based on voluntary coopera ? tion , by conjoint workers ' control and management of industry , with the accompanying abolition of private property as a fixed institution ? a somewhat different matter , of course , from the abolition of private possessions as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulterior aims brings us back to the idea that the economic revolution is not final , an end in itself , but is a means to the realization of a universal " culture , " in which di ? rect sharing in the management of work is a neces ? sary part and precondition . It was at this point that my own antecedent no ? tions ? or , if you will , prejudices ? underwent their // most complete reversal . I had the notion that socialistic communism was essentially a purely economic scheme . The notion was fostered by the almost exclusive attention paid by Socialists in west ? ern countries to economic questions , and by the loudly self-proclaimed " economic materialism " of Marxian Communists . I was , therefore , almost totally unprepared for what I actually found : namely , that , at least in the circles with which I came in contact ( which , however , included some working men as well as educators ) , the develop-merit of " cultivation " and realization of the pos ? sibility of everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , most astonishingly , that only in " bourgeois " countries are Socialists primarily-concerned with improving the material conditions of the working classes , as if occupied with a kind of public as distinct from private philanthropy in rais ? ing wages , bettering housing conditions , reducing hours of labor , etc . Not , of course , that the present Russian regime is not also occupied with such matters , but that it is so definitely concerned with expanding and enlarging the actual content of life . Indeed , I could not but feel ( though I can offer no convincing objective proof ) that foreign visitors who have emphasized widespread poverty as a ground for predicting the downfall of the present regime are off the track . In the first place , poverty is so much the historic heritage of the masses that they are not especially conscious of the pinching of this particular shoe ; and in the next place , there are large numbers , especially of the younger gener ? ation , who are so devoted to the human and moral ideal of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they do not feel it as a sacrifice . Perhaps I should have been prepared to find this attitude . That the movement in Russia is in ? trinsically religious was something I had often heard and that I supposed I understood and believed . But when face to face with actual conditions , I was forced to see that I had not understood it at all . And for this failure , there were two causes , as far as I can make out ? I am , of course , only confess ? ing my own limitations . One was that , never having previously witnessed a widespread and moving re ? ligious reality , I had no way of knowing what it actually would be like . The other was that I asso ? ciated the idea of Soviet Communism , as a religion , too much with intellectual theology , the body of Marxian dogma with its professed economic ma ? terialism , and too little with a moving human aspiration and devotion . As it is , I feel as if for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moving spirit and force of primi ? tive Christianity . I even hate to think of the time , that seems humanly inevitable , when this new faith will also have faded into the light of common day , and become conventional and stereotyped . I am quite prepared to hear that I exaggerate this phase of affairs ; I am prepared to believe that , because of the unexpectedness of the impression , I have exaggerated its relative importance . But all such allowances being made , I still feel sure that no one can understand the present movement who fails to take into account its religious ardor . That men and women who profess " materialism " should in fact be ardent " idealists " is undoubtedly a paradox , but one that indicates that a living faith is more important than the symbols by which it tries to express itself . Intellectual formuke seem to be condemned to have about them something pathetic ? ally irrelevant ; they are so largely affected by acci ? dents of history . In any case , it is hard not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tional workers in Russia ; not , indeed , for their material and economic status , but because a unified religious social faith brings with it such a simplifica ? tion and integration of life . " Intellectuals " in other countries have a task that is , if they are sincere , chiefly critical ; those who have identified themselves in Russia with the new order have a task that is total and constructive . They are organic members of an organic going movement . The sense of disparity between the Soviet official theology , the Marxian doctrines , and the living re ? ligious faith in human possibilities when released from warping economic conditions , remains . A similar disparity seems to have attended all vital movements hitherto undertaken . They have had their intellectual formulations ; but the use of these has been to provide a protective shell for emotions . Any prediction about the Russian future has to take into account the contradiction and conflict be ? tween rigid dogmas on the one side and an experi ? mental spirit on the other . Which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but suppose that the Russian people will , in the end , through a series of adaptations to actual conditions as they develop , build something new in the form of human associa ? tion . That this will be communistic in the sense of the leaders of the Revolution , I doubt ; that it will be marked by a high degree of voluntary co ? operation and by a high degree of social control of the accumulation and use of capital , seems to be probable . Symbols , however , have a great way of persisting and of adapting themselves to changes in fact , as the histories of Christianity and democ ? racy both show . So , unless there is some remarkable breach of continuity , it is likely that the outcome , whatever it may be in fact , will be called Commun ? ism and will be taken as a realization of the creed of its initial authors . Education affords , once more , the material for a striking illustration of the role of experiment in the future evolution of Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from Moscow , there is a district fairly typical of northern rural Russia , in which there is an educational colony under the direction of Schatzky . This colony is the center of some fourteen schools scatteredthrough a series of villages , which , taken together , constitute an extensive ( and intensive ) educational experiment station for working out materials and methods for the Russian rural system . There is not in my knowledge anything comparable to it elsewhere in the world . As the summer colony was in operation , we had the satisfaction of visiting the station and also noting its effect on the villages that have come under its influence . A somewhat similar undertaking under Pistrak exists in Moscow to deal with the problems of urban workers . It was closed on account of the vacation period , and so my knowledge is not at first hand . But it is in active and successful operation . Then , as has been noted , each province has its own experimental sta ? tion to deal with specifically local problems . These enterprises are under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also in existence a Supreme Scientific Council having a pedagogical section . The duties of this Scientific Council are in general to form plans for the social and economic development of Russia ; the program , while flexible , looks ahead over a term of years and includes much detail based on researches that are continuously conducted . Of this undertaking , probably the first in the world to attempt scientific regulation of social growth , the pedagogical section is an organic member ; its business is to sift and audit the results of the educational experiments that are carried on and to give them a form in which they may be directly incorporated into the school system of the country . The fact that both Schatzsky and Pistrak are members of this Council ensures that conclusions reached in the experiment stations receive full attention . This matter is referred to here rather than in the account of Soviet education to which it properly belongs , in order to suggest , through a concrete ex ? ample , that , however rigid and dogmatic the Marx ? ian symbols may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is flexible , vital , creative . In this connection it may be worth while to quote from Pistrak , the words being the more significant because he is a strict party member . " We can not apply the same rules to every school con ? dition ; that procedure would be contrary to the essence of our school . It is indispensable to develop in teachers aptitude for pedagogical creation ; with ? out this , it will be impossible to create the new school . The notion that pedagogues are artisans rather than creators seems to us incorrect . Every human being is more or less a creator , and while an individual in isolation may fail to find a creative solution of a problem , in collectivity we are all creators . " No one would claim that this ideal is as yet realized , hut no one can come in contact with educational activities without feeling that this spirit marks the Russian school leaders to an extent un ? known in other countries . In my first article , be ? fore coming into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of vitality and liberation that was got from contact with the face of the Russian scene . The later educational con ? tacts confirmed this surface impression , while they also left the feeling of being initiated into a definite movement in which the new spirit was concretely realizing itself . I ' do not believe that any person 's particular guess about the exact form of the outcome of the present Russian movement is of any importance ; there are too many unknowns in the equation . If I venture to move in the direction of a prediction , it is only by way of calling attention to two movements already going on . The factor of greatest importance seems to me to be the growth of voluntary co ? operative groups . In the orthodox theory , these form a transition stage on the road to the predes ? tined end of Marxian Communism . Just why the means should not also be the end , and the alleged transitory stage define the goal , is not clear to me . The place occupied by the peasant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires , however disagreeable that consultation is , the con ? stant concessions made to him in spite of official preference for the city factory worker , strengthen belief in the probability of a cooperative rather than a strictly communistic outcome . Side by side with this factor , though of less immediate practical force , I should place the experimental aspect of the educational system . There is , of course , an immense amount of indoctrination and propaganda in the schools . But if the existing tendency develops , it seems fairly safe to predict that in the end this indoctrination will be subordinate to the awakening of initiative and power of independent judgment , while cooperative mentality will be evolved . It seems impossible that an education intellectually free will not militate against a servile acceptance of dogma as dogma . One hears all the time about the dialectic movement by means of which a move ? ment contradicts itself in the send . I think the schools are a " dialectic " factor in the evolution of Russian Communism . These remarks do not ' detract from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather , in my mind , they add to it , and to the need for study of it by the rest of the world . And it can not be studied without actual contact . The no ? tion that a sixth of the world can be permanently isolated and " quarantined " is absurd enough , though the consequences of acting upon the absurd ? ity are more likely to be tragic than humorous . But it is even more absurd to suppose that a living idea that has laid hold of a population with the force and quality of a religion can be pushed to one side and ignored . The attempt , if persisted in , will re ? sult in an intensification of its destructive features and in failure to derive the advantages that would accrue from knowledge of its constructive features . Political recognition of Russia on the part of the United States would not go far in bringing aboutthe kind of relations that are in the interest of both countries and of the world , but it is at least a neces ? sary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that subject except that recognition was in line with our better political traditions . I came away with the feeling that the maintenance of barriers that prevent intercourse , knowledge and understanding is close to a crime against humanity . The phase of Bolshevism with which one can ? not feel sympathy is its emphasis upon the necessity of class war and of world revolution by violence . These features of Soviet Russia tend to recede into the background because of the pressure the author ? ities are under to do a vastly difficult constructive work in Russia itself . But the spirit that produces them is fed by the belief that the rest of the world are enemies of Soviet Russia ; that it must be con ? stantly on the defensive and that the best defense is aggressive attack . I do not think that free inter ? course with the rest of the world would cause an immediate disappearance of the idea of stirring up civil war in capitalistic countries . But I am confi ? dent that such intercourse would gradually deprive the flame of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derives the impression that the Third Inter ? national is Russia 's own worst enemy , doing harm to it by alienating other peoples ' sympathy . Its chief asset , however , is non-recognition . The with ? drawal of recognition by Great Britain has done more than any other one thing to stimulate the extremists and fanatics of the Bolshevist faith , and to encourage militarism and hatred of bourgeois nations . I can not conclude without mentioning one point that is not strictly connected with the remainder of this summary . In times of peace the Third International does , as I have said , more injury to Russia than to other countries . But if there is a European war , it will , I believe , spring to life as a reality in every European nation . I left Russia with a stronger feeling than I had ever had before of the criminal ineptitude of those statesmen who still play with the forces that generate wars . There is one prediction to which I am willing to commit myself . If there is another European war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrors of foreign war in every continental country , and every capital in Europe will be a shambles in which the worst horrors of the days of revolution in Petrograd will be outdone .
