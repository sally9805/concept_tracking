In Old England of a winter 's morning , almost anywhere in the hedge-rowed counties , you may see a solemn line of gruff-looking gentlemen proceeding down a quiet lane or across a close-cropped field to a pheasant wood . The " stands , " where the killing is done , will be an open stretch hard by the wood 's edge . The gentlemen implant their seat-sticks and have a cigaret while the beaters are surrounding and entering the copse at its distant end . Behind each gentleman will be a rough-looking chap , or a trim chauffeur , with cartridge-boxes and the gentleman 's other gun . His is the job of ejecting and reloading . Gentlemen do nothing but shoot . <P> From the deep heart of the copse comes a multilateral clickety-clacking-the beaters ' sticks upon the tree boles . A quiet , low-flying shape is seen among the younger saplings , headed straight at the line of patient gentlemen . " Yours , I think , " says Col. **25;11218;TOOLONG , V. C. ( retired ) , to his neighbor . " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises his gun . <P> If the young Lord misses , it does n't matter very much . The doughty Colonel and his guns can kill anything the size of a bumblebee at 60 paces . He will " wipe the eye " of His Lordship if necessary . It is for that purpose , largely , that the Colonel was invited to the shoot . English estates are partly supported by the pheasants that are raised upon them and slain by gentlemen and marketed . <P> From his Lordship 's point of view a miss means nothing because a dozen , a score , a hundred more pheasants will presently come sailing out over his head for him to shoot at . The air will tremble with a cannonading . The sky will rain dead birds or crippled . No one ( except the Colonels ) will know precisely who killed exactly what . But then there will be a nip of brandy to restore everyone 's spirits . A pushcart will come by to collect the tumbled creatures ( 100 brace at one ' " stand " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next " stand , " perhaps at a low hedge , along a field of stubble , out of which great flocks of partridges will be driven . <P> U. S. bird-shooting is different . In pheasant , woodcock , quail or partridge country , of a frosty morning , you may see one or two but never more than four figures-not always " gentlemen " - moving quietly along behind a dog or a pair of dogs . The dogs , noses out , are searching the ground . They become agitated , increase their pace-and suddenly stiffen in a " point . " The nearest hunter moves forward cautiously . Up burns the bird , or maybe a dozen birds . They fly away from what has frightened them . Of course , he shoots straight and promptly who cuts a feather . . . .
