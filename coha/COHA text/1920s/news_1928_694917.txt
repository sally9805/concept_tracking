txt Every now and again we In America are reminded by stories in the news that travel by air is common in several European countries , notably in Germany . By way of example , a recent dispatch told of the predictions by Dr. Hugo Eckener , German aeronautical expert , looking to safe and inexpensive travel across the Atlantic by dirigible . Germany is air-minded , talks about the air , and not only talks but travels . It causes one to wonder why Americans have been comparatively slow to adopt air transportation . Here is something new , adventurous , me-. chanical , and swifter than any other known means of locomotion . By traditional right of the American temperament we should all be zipping and zooming through the air in airplanes and airships and the country should be criss-crossed with air lanes and dotted with airports . But as a people we are not zipping and zooming , and our geography is being adapted to aviation only by dint of hard hammering propaganda . When we might be streaking cross country at one hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty mile an hour trains and automobiles . That there are good and sufficient reasons is apparent . Germany was primed to take to the air because its railroad rolling stock , its motor equipment , and Its roads had suffered during the war . In this country the railroad is everywhere , and where it is n't there is the automobile , one to every six persons . Progressive states are a networks , of roads , passable in all seasons . Moreover , we are ri comfort loving its well as an adventurous people ; we like our speed plush upholstered , and at hour 's drive to an air held , several hours of noise and vibration accompanied by periodic sinking sensations , and another drive at the other end , even though several hours are saved , is no inducement to change from our balloon tired sedan or our Pullman seat and berth . Still we wonder why America has not taken to the air . There ? ere reasons , but American love of novelty and speed is not supposed to be based on reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bit ? Is Germany 's eager interest in the air a psychological reaction ? Is the real answer once again the fact that we sere among the winners , while Germany technically suffered defeat ?
