SINCE the beginning of Man , religion has been at once his chief stronghold and his greatest source of annoyance . It has annoyed him because , however beautiful and comforting , it seldom worked perfectly . Yesterday we noticed , in a bookstore , a e ! ; . little volume called " Religion That Works . " We pondered that pragmatic title a long while , for it occurred to us that if anybody can make religion work , the American businessman , with his genius for organization , can . He has made everything else work ; why not religion ? Nor will he lack the opposition that spurs his competitive spirit : the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism is always on the job , and their president ( a Mr. Smith ) is listed in the New York telephone directory as " Smith Chas atheist . " THE incipient theatrical season has already brought forth a play in thirty-four scenes ( or maybe it only seemed thirty-four ) and the managers are at their annual plotting to astonish us with novelties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he . Back in 250 B.C. folks in Rome who went hopefully from their apartment houses to the theatre saw the same old sort of cast line up at the end of the last act and chant a joyous final curtain . Rome knew everything we know about stars , angels , the claque , thunder machines , and the property sword which collapses into its hilt . Greece had the aside , masks , and trapdoors . Twenty-five hundred years ago the Athenians marvelled , or possibly did n't , at real trees on the stage , living animals , canvas scenery that turned around , and gods that flew out of the flies on ropes . Athens had amplifiers , stage money , and comedians who gagged the audience  --  with the same old gags . As for plots , the tragic were all used up in the first hundred years , and by Plautus ' time the comic writer gave up trying to think of any new ones and none of them since has tried to do more than borrow . The principal change in the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flogged . VERY once in a while the people EVER who run the elevated trains ( " The Air Line " ) get fanciful . Being an obedient customer , we always trail right along with them . The new posters in the car windows touchingly compare travel on the " L " with airplane riding . To help you along with this suggestion they point out similarities and present a drawing showing the grand old structure with a Zeppelin and several airplanes flying close overhead . Sitting opposite this , and letting ourself go , we readily attained the illusion that we were high in the clouds . We chose a tri-motored Ford for the ride and found it lots of fun . We soon realized , moreover , that we could carry the mood even further . By closing our eyes just before one of those jolting , harsh stops the " L " specializes in , we got all the sensation of jumping from the plane and hitting the ground after the parachute failed to open . AN erstwhile friend discovered the other day that we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With startling suddenness the friend 's attitude toward us changed : there came to his voice a strange new note of sadness and disappointment . " What 's the matter with being connected with THE NEW YORKER ? " we shouted , possibly a little irritably . The friend replied that a magazine ought to take a definite stand on something  --  like the New Masses . Patiently we explained that we , too , had a mission , although we were pretty careful not to let it get round . " But , " said the friend , with a brooding pity , " people do n't want humor every week ! " Kitty , Kitty A LOT of the valuable time of Mr. Fielder J. Coffin of the Sun Oil Company and officials of the New York Central was taken up lately by a cat belonging to Mr. Coffin 's daugh-ter , aged seven , which escaped from the arms of a valet while she was boarding a train and whist ! was gone . The terminal manager and the general pas-senger agent were notified and they mobilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a bag-gageman told them that if one of their number would go to the baggage truck-ing room and wait the lost animal would inevitably be recovered , as large mounds of catnip are kept there to attract the cats of the neighborhood , of which , surprisingly , there are dozens . The cats catch mice , of which there are hundreds . After a day and night of vigilance the missing cat appeared , as predicted , and was captured , and the New York Central went on about its business . Brion ; Notes AFRIEND of Tunney is back from Brioni with news of what the ex-champion and his bride have done for that little island in the Adriatic . It somewhat parallels the story of Morley and Hoboken  --  about that far-reaching . Anyway Brioni was a dreamy nook before Tunney rented his ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  --  villa . A small group of conservative Europeans used to sojourn on the island , quietly . There is no casino . There was never really a crowd . One hotel sufficed . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a genial Viennese , who inherited Brioni from his father and was peacefully living his middle age . When the Tunneys arrived the drowsiness began to dissipate . Within the past few months American notables have called in numbers , as well as the run of teachers , artists , and brokers . Vincent Astor 's yacht lay off the harbor for a week , as did Otto Kahn 's . Tom Chadbourne called with his yacht in July and took the Tunneys for a cruise . George Bernard Shaw turned up , explaining that he had been attracted by Tunney 's vivid description of the place . The Bernard Gimbels arrived later and put up in a suite at the hotel . Herr Kupelwieser has been flustered by it all . He could n't tell one notable from another and still is n't good at it , but he says this will come in time and , rising to the occasion , has announced plans for new hotels and a casino . He also will rescind an order prohibiting automobiles on the island . His was the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allowed to keep by special dispensation . Additional Phone Fact MR . MATTHEW C. GRIFFIN 'S name , together with his office and home telephone numbers , are not only listed in the Manhattan and Bronx books , where they properly belong ( Barclay 6600 , Kellogg 5110 ) , but in the other directories of the city too  --  Brooklyn , Staten Island , and Queens . This is true of some other people also . We find that anyone can have this done , by paying an additional rate . It takes about a week , however , explaining reasons to the phone company and getting the idea over . As a matter of fact , while the phone company has assented in several instances , it still has n't got the idea . It just surrendered . For instance , if a man in Staten Island thinks to himself , " Now I shall call Mr. Griffin of 2305 University Avenue , the Bronx , " how is he going to know that he can find the number in the Staten Island book  --  and the Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it goes . One of those things it 's best to quit thinking about . ? THE latest confusion reported at Macy 's resulted when a woman ordered a carton of the mentholated cigarettes called Spuds , to be delivered to her home . She received a pretty heavy box of something . It turned out to be Idaho potatoes . Selling Air ROSEVELT FIELD on a Sunday now is like a carnival or a county fair . Crowds go out early and linger all day . A giant loudspeaker , erected at one end of a bleachers which holds hundreds of people , describes what is going on in a voice audible for an eighth of a mile . Airplanes , red , green , striped , zoom up from in front of the bleachers and land there . The announcer tells who the pilots are , what they have dune , the makes of the various planes , the facility and delight of air-travel . His voice is never still . " Now , folks , watch that big red plane tuning up there  --  the one Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they 're getting your wind  --  he 'll wind ' er up all right though , folks  --  easy as rolling off a log .. There she is ! That plane has a replicah  --  a repli-cah of the Wright Whirlwind motor that Lindbergh flew to Paris . Now , folks , here come two eminent New York gentlemen who are going up for their first flight , Mr. ? alt -- George 0 . Cleep and Mr. C. R. Doakes , of Man-hattan ! " On a recent Sunday a Mr. Galleger , aged 101 , made his first flight . That helped the cause of aviation a " Why , it rides as gently as a baby 's cradle , folks ! Now there 's Mr. Galleger climbing out , smiling too  --  and look at the young lady down there getting in the little red plane , " etc. , etc . Air-mindedness is thus sold to the mob in great clamorous phrases and resonant assurances . It sells like hot-cakes too . The people who go up are as mixed in type as a six-day-bicycle-race audience : flippant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crowds are entertained in various ways . Big cerise-colored balloons are sent up and Roosevelt Field pilots hunt them down  --  run into them aloft and explode them . Dummy bombs are dropped at targets . There 's an occasional parachute drop . In between thrills , the people mill around from hot-dog counters to soft-drink stands , which do a tremendous business . We saw a man open up more than a hundred Coca-Cola bottles without stopping . Four of them were for a quartet of young bloods dressed in gaudy pajamas  --  the place is as faddish as a second-rate watering resort . The Sunday that the Sun God plane from Spokane arrived at the field and was re-fueled in the air , for the pleasure of the crowd , admissions were charged at Field No. 2 , where the refueling planes started and alighted . Field No. 2 is quieter  --  it has no loudspeaker  --  and more famous . People go there to meditate silently before the stretch of flat , immortal , gravelly earth from which Lindbergh , Byrd , and Chamberlin took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge against which Fonek 's plane cracked up . The Sun God dropped several notes , the last of which was weighted down with a heavy piece of lead . The pilot aimed badly and the thing fell like a shot , landing near a clump of people . " Mercy ! " screamed a woman , " Misjudged , " quietly said one of several pilots standing about  --  all unmoved by the incident which shook the nerves of the common people . Someone picked up the note , which was scribbled in pencil on a scrap of dirty paper and wrapped in an oily rag . " We have everything we need , Frank , " it read . " Going to Cleveland . " Frank , who is Captain Hawks , the man who flew across the country and back in less than thirty-six hours , read the note and tossed it away . There was a scramble for it , and a fattish husband won . Flit hurried away with the prize , like a dog guarding a bone , his wife 's hand squeezing his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Nook HE Earl of Feversham , who aril- rived on the Berengaria , was whisked away by American friends for a dinner at a place in the Fifties . The next day a fellow passenger , meeting him , asked how he had enjoyed his first evening in the city . " Splendidly , " said the Earl . " We had a delightful dinner at a charming little restaurant  --  do you know it ? ? The Speakeasy . " Fire-Bug Man H ' ' ' to stop a fire is the fire chief 's problem ; how it got started , that of the fire marshal , Thomas Brophy . One does n't hear so much of the latter and his staff , but they do interesting work . Inspection is a large part of it  --  peering into areaways of buildings for oily waste and rubbish , examining fuse boxes for pennies , which are handy to use when a fuse blows out but likely to cause fires if there is a short circuit , and taking the pulse of buildings generally . The marshal can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is pyromaniacs  --  it is almost his hobby . He keeps a card-index of known fire-bugs at his home in Brooklyn as well as at his office . The marshal , or one of his staff , goes to the scene of all " suspicious " fires  --  while they are blazing , if possible  --  to examine into the cause . Often the manner of the fire , or the particular region , coincides with the habits , or haunts , of some well-known fire-bug . If the fire was set for profit , the arsonist has probably made his escape , but the plain " bugs " ? those who burn for thrill  --  are . sometimes apprehended on the spot , because they like to stand around and tell about the fire . Brophy has caught a number of them by mingling quietly in a crowd at a blaze until he hears some wide-eyed fellow loudly describing the way it started . Brophy knows all the old habitual fire-bugs well . He sends them to institutions when they are caught , counsels them when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some lay the torch aside and become good citizens . Othersincurables  --  backslide and usually fall into Brophy 's hands again , thanks to his carefully kept record of their comings and goings . Until recently Marshal Brophy carried no weapons . He had a sort of phobia against them . When he was a child his father , a policeman , took him to a hospital where the lad 's uncle , also a cop , lay wounded from a shot fired in a gang battle . The injured officer said he had n't used his own gun because he dreaded " having some poor fellow 's blood on his hands . " The Brophy squeamishness was thus passed on to Thomas , but he got over it one night when he was attacked by five men in a dark hallway while investigating a fire-for-profit . Brophy had only an electric torch but with it he felled and captured two of his assailants and sent a third reeling into a policeman 's arms . The marshal now carries a blackjack and a revolver as his night equipment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty twenty-four hours and has three chauffeurs assigned to him , each working a different eight-hour shift . Brophy is often summoned from Father Cashin 's famous early morning services at St. Andrew 's , which he regularly attends , to investigate a fire . One of Brophy 's cronies , W. J. Daly , of the Board of Transportation , is a fire-buff . He keeps a fire-alarm by his bed and will get up at any hour of the night to go to a big fire . Once he dropped into Brophy 's office when the latter was questioning a pyromaniac . Brophy whimsically introduced the abnormal fellow to Daly and asked him what he thought of a gentleman who was so interested in seeing a fire he would get out of bed on a cold winter night and go to it . " Plain nut , " said the incendiary , solemnly . Broadway A YOUNG man with aspirations to be an actor called on Chamber-lain Brown , the casting director , last week , bearing a letter from Mr. George Pierce Baker . Mr. Brown read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History and Tech-nique of the Drama and Director of the Yale School of Drama , looked up at the applicant , and asked : " Can you hoof ? " Garbled HE story we had two weeks ago 1 about the Chrysler Building and No. 1 Wall Street was more thoroughly-in error than anything we have printed this year to date . It must have been bad gin . We said both buildings had been announced as the tallest in the world , that Mr. William Van Alen was architect for both , and was thereby embarrassed , etc . The fact is No . Wall Street , Voorhees , Gmelin &; Walker , architects , has no ambitions to be the tallest building in the world . It 's the Manhattan Building . When finished it will be eight hundred and thirty-six feet high , twenty-eight feet higher than the Chrysler Building . From the many architects and others who telephoned and wrote us about this we did , however , get facts on the **28;348;TOOLONG situation which we trust are conclusive . Two new structures are planned which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lexington Avenue between Forty-first and Forty-second Streets , and a sort of airplane lighthouse which Colonel Green , Hetty 's son , has in mind for his estate near New Bedford . It will be one thousand fret high , considerably higher than the Eiffel Tower , and the tallest structure of any kind in the world . Hard To Please ONE of those querulous , put-upon executives looked up from his desk to see an underling standing at his side , ready to make a report . " The telephone system has been entirely reorganized throughout the offices , as you ordered , Mr. Balch , " said the underling . " Do the phones cause any trouble , sir ? " Mr. Balch was in one of those moods of his when nothing satisfies him . He glared . " They still ring ! " he bawled . Birds on the Bowery MR . LOUIS RUH E , with a shop at 351 Bowery , handles most of THE NEW YORKER 17 the city 's wholesale canary-bird business . He sold about half a million last year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jays , and parrakeets besides . Business has been booming and he thinks the fashion for living in penthouses has had something to do with it . Perched so high in the air , people suddenly become bird-conscious , so to speak , and install aviaries . Not all Mr. Ruhe 's traffic is in birds , however . Some years ago he added a side-line of lions , tigers , boa constrictors , and such , intending to sell them to circuses and public zoos . He soon found that there was a private demand for these animals as well . Mr. William Randolph Hearst is a steady customer , buying antelope by the hundred for his ranch at San Simeon , California . Many Long Islanders now maintain private menageries . Mr. Arnold , of the original Arnold , Constable , has a collection embracing almost every known kind of cockatoo on his estate at Babylon . Mr. J. S. Phipps and Mr. W. C. Browning both have large and well-kept zoos on their country places . Mr. Ruhe has agents scattered through all the jungles of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Japanese robin to an elephant . He has his own menagerie , out in Woodside , where he keeps the more unwieldy animals until called for . The birds , however , are all kept in the shop on the Bowery . There are four floors of them , and they average about two thousand to the floor . Love birds , pale blue and paler yellow , arc caged by the hundreds , like little choirs , twittering and caroling , and there are whole roomfuls of canaries , divided according to their song . The loudest singers are called " choppers : " they give forth a long clear trilling note and are the most expensive , costing about eight dollars each . The " Andreasberg rollers " are the coloraturas among canaries , while the Harz Mountain type have a mixed trill and roll . As a matter of fact , almost all the canaries in the world are bred in the Harz Mountains of Germany ; whole towns there have no other occupation than breeding birds . It is all a matter of climate ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canaries in this country . Love birds cost about ten dollars a pair , though some rare varieties run as high as two hundred and fifty dollars . They are never sold singly ; they pine away , alone . Recently , there was a flurry in the love-bird business : the Japanese were buying them in unheard-of quantities . Prices soared , but fell again soon after , when the Taps began dumping homegrown love birds on the market ; they had discovered that they could raise them too . Until then , France had a corner on the supply . Revenge A a result of switching bootleggers , a gentleman of Sutton Place had a distressing experience . He was gaily serving about a dozen friends with new stock when his butler summoned him to the telephone . " This is your new bootlegger , " said a strained voice . " Say , lay off the Scotch I sent you . I find it 's all bad and you ca n't tell what might happen . " The host paled , then gathered himself and helped the butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . The latter , after examining two of the party who had been taken into the host 's confidence , was reassuring . Next morning , after a restless night , the gentleman was relieved to find , by discreet in quiry , no evidence of ill-effect upon the part of his guests . Later in the day he was something other than relieved to find that it was n't his new bootlegger who had phoned , but the old , abandoned one , who had done it out of cussedness.
