txt GAME REFUGE BILL . Proposal for Government Purchase of the Club Property . To the Editor of The New York Times : It seems strange that in all this controversy about Mr. and the proposed Gulf Coast Club nothing has been said in print about the National Game Refuge bill , which is to be reintroduced at the next session of Congress , and how that measure would clear up the whole situation . Mr. , it appears , would prefer to have the land under discussion a game refuge rather than a hunting club . He is ready to sell , according to newspaper statements , to responsible parties who could provide adequate warden patrol . Now , the main idea behind the National Game Refuge bill is the setting aside of suitable areas as permanent refuges for all the varieties of migratory birds . Since this area controlled by Mr. is among the most suitable for this purpose in the whole United States , it would , if the Game Refuge bill were law , be one of the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If all the energy which is being devoted to the pros anal cons , the rights and wrongs , of the Club should be directed toward getting the Game Refuge bill through the next Congress , the controversy would be happily settled , and the Audubon Society and other well-intentioned agencies would be relieved of the necessity of raising special.funds to purchase this property for preservation a ? a refuge .
