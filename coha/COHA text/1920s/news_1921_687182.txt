txt The agreement of the Powers about China is like the renewal of a note with the old collateral and nothing paid on account . There are additional names  --  the Hay doctrine had the assent of six Powers , eight have accepted the Root resolutions as the basis of an agreement . That acids nothing to the security , for the nations who pledged themselves to abide by the Hay doctrine are all solvent , capable of fulfilling their obligations . The trouble was that the obligations were not fulfilled . The nations agreed to respect the independence and territorial intcgrity of China . The Shantung business violated half of that agreement , the twenty-one demands tore the other half to tatters . ' And ' the nations did nothing about it . The difference is that while the Hay greement and the Lansing-Ishii egreement were brought about by the ordinary method of inconspicuous 6iploinatic correspondence , the acceptance of the Root resolutions is an act accomplished with the fullest publicIty . It is the act of a great council of the principal nations done in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed in eager hope and expecta ) ion . The Powers consenting to these 1. , solutions can not treat them with the tool indifference meted out to earlier agreements of the kind unless they ere willineto admit before all the peoples of the world that their pledged faith is a thing which no man need respect since they do not respect it themselves . As to the main point , that of good faith , without which nothing else will count for much , it may be accepted as settled that the Allies intend to abide by their present " firm intention " in respect to China . If they do not there will be war sooner or later , and they are met to take measures against war . The resolutions are cautiously written , very general , not inclusive of some questions of weight and moment . And they meet only a small part of the demands made by China a few days ago , which seemed to be assentingly received by the delegates to the conference . What is to become of Shantung does not appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retroactive . Manchuria and its railroad system is left equally in doubt . When Secretary KNox proposed a neutralization of the Manchurian railroads we were politely , formally , elaborately and majestically snubbed by Russia and Japan , and that was an end of the matter . But China can not be independent , her administrative integrity will not be free from most serious infringements , her opportunity to set up a stable goVernment will be impaired and the principle of equal commercial opportunity will be thwarted so long as the Manchurian railways and the line from Kiao-Chau to the interior remain under foreign control . China is not herself a party to the egreement contemplated or executed in these resolutions . Yet it would be weil to accept her offered commitment not to alienate any portion of her territory or littoral . The third of China 's ten points , that the Powers shall not execute between themselves treaties affecting the interests of China or generally peace in the Far East without giving China an opportunity to participate , is vital to good understanding in the Pacific and should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions as a most hopeful and helpful app ; . aach to an understanding rather than as the body of an Agreement itself . Manifestly an instrument that repeats the language of the old disregarded contracts may want of confidence , notwithstanding the imposing multiplicity of seals with which it is adorned . There must be a more formal undertaking in the end , and it is to be hoped that withou any undue ruffling of anybody 's sensi bilities the language may be mad directly applicable to certain condition well known to exist . The Anglo-Japa nese Treaty is no more popula now than it ever was in thi country and in the dominions Naturally nothing is said abou that ; nothing will be said abou it , since it is for Great Britain ano Japan to recognize the fact that an : new agreement worth making , an ; agreement that will actually remov the risk of trouble In the Pacific , wil make the renewal of that treaty en tirely superfluous .                 @ @ @ @
