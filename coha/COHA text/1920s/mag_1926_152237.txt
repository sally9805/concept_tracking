Cocky little boats with pale sails , maneuvering this way and that on quiet water like a fleet of river butterflies , swerved at the sound of a gun and passed between a committee yacht and a red buoy , putting out of Larchmont harbor into Long Island Sound . They were the interclub sloops ( Marconi-rigged yachts , 19 feet on the water line ) , the new racing boats ; and their appearance meant that the yacht-racing season had begun again in Eastern waters . Soon the boats of the other classes - the graceful , low-leaning " S " boats with their big spread of canvas , the shorter " Victory " boats ( single-masted crafts with self-bailing cockpits , easy to handle in rough weather ) , the midget " Fish " and " Star " classes , 15-footers in which yachtmen 's young sons and younger daughters dabble and pull ropes and get wet-soon these , and all the other bright pleasure craft of the Sound will be brought out of boathouses and moored at the ends of private jetties , ready for summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in charge of the races , said that he liked the new sloops . One called the Bandit , owned by Samuel Wetherill , crossed the line first ; the Ardelle , with the water boiling under her side , won in the " R " class . . . . <P> Similarly on yachting waters elsewhere in the U.
