txt Like other steel companies Bethlehem Steel is now reaping the benefits from active production and greater price stability . In addition the corporation is now getting the advantages of lower costs . All these developments are making for substantial improvement in earnings , and results for the first quarter of this year are  --  ikely to be in the neighborhood of $3.75 or $4 a share on the 1,800,000 shares of common stock outstanding . This would compare with 94 cents a share earned in the first three months of last year . and with $6.52 for ' the entire 12 months of 1928 . This year started at an unusual pace . Demand for steel was good and Bethlehem ran up its operations steadily during all of Janisary , so that earnings for that month were approximately $1.25 or $1.30 a share . February . though having three less working days . almost reached the high mark of the preceding month , due to further gains in production and somewhat improved prices , so that for the two months the balance for the common was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March started with operations at 91 , ; . , of capacity and these will be increased according to present indications so that the revenues for the month could reach something around $1.50 a common share , bringing the result for the quarter to the figure forecast above . Improverrnonts Loos erect Costs Of vast importance to the future of Bethlehem is the reduction in costs which has been made possible by the heavy expenditures for plant additions and improvements which were carried out in recent years and which have now been practically completed . Whatever expenses are incurred for these purposes for some time will be minor compared with what was done in this connection in the recent past . Naturally bringing plants and equipment upto-date will be reflected in the future earnings of the company . This work of rehabilitation of mills was carried out progressively for several years . The price situation also is much more favorable . Late in 192S Bethelehem announced a price list on leading products , which was somewhat below .0-eallecl " regular " market quotations . However , they actually represented advances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large buyers who had been getting special consideration previously . Establishment and maintenance of these figures probably contributed materially to the excellent results which arc now expected for the quarter to end March 31 , next . Future Dividends While Bethlehem common dividends were resumed only at the last meeting on January 24. by declaration of $1 a share for the quarter i it is not at all certain that holders of the con , ' mon stock will be limited to $4 a share this year The substantial improvement in earnings coilld logically bring this question up for considers- ' Lion some time bethre the eni of 3929 with the result that stockholder s , . % oulct receive some- ' thing more . In some quarters it would not cause surprise . for Instance , if an extra dividend of SI a share were paid during the summer to corn- ' pensate holders for the years v. hen no distribution was made on the stoc k Continuation of present conditions in the steel industry would lustily such action .
