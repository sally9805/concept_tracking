txt The public has very little interest in Mammoth Oil stock . Some people in as , good position as anybody to know'the facts estimate less than 500 shares are held by the public of the 2,000,000 shares of Class " B , " non-voting , shares issued . All of the stock sold at the offering price of $39 a share last year , when as much as 400,000 shares were ! available , was subsequently repurchased by the promoters at higher prices . Indeed , these repurchases aggregated some 2,000 shares more than were sold by the promoters , indicating a short interest of that amount . As much as 15 points above the offering price of 39 was paid for some of the repurchased stock . The fact that the stock is very closely held and was not absorbed by the public explains its decided inactivity in the outside market . Asile from the 500,500 shares of Mammoth " B " held by Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corp. , the holdings of H. F. Sinclair and those of his private investment  --  company , Hyva Corp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a few individuals under a pool , tagreement , which does not expire for some months . These latter holdings , undoubtedly , formed at least fart of the shares offered publicly at 39 and subsequently repurchased . ' COMPARISON IN VALUES The nominal market price of 63 a share for Mammoth Oil stock places a valuation of $106,000,000 on the 2,000,000 " B " shares ; there 'll ; no market for the 5,000 " A " shares which have all voting power . This market valuation , nominal though it is , is in striking contrast . with value placed on oil companies with substantial oil production and years of operations . A case in point is California Petroleum Co : whose combined preferred and common stock issues are selling in the stock market at an aggregate valuation of approximately $33 , - 000,000 , less than one-third Mammoth 's market value at the purely nominal price of 53 . California Petroleum is producing around 50,000 barrels daily contrasted with 4,600 barrels daily for Mani , moth . California Petroleum earned nearly $17 a share on its common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share , and in first quarter , of 1923 reported about $7.50 a share for both common and preferred after all deductions . While Mammoth Oil may not he considered a disappointment from point of view of its nominal Market value , operating results in the field arc decidedly disappointing . Twenty-one wells have been drilled on Teapot Dome , under its contract with the government , and results to date are 4,600 barrels daily production from 14 wells ; four gas wells and three failures . More than half the 4,600 . barrels production is coming from one well situated on a tract the title for which is in litigation . This adjoins Salt ' Creek and production , is from the Salt Creek formation and not from Teapot formation . DEVELOPMENTS Perhaps the most disappointhlg development in Teapot drilling is that the well completet , on top of the structure , to the . second Wall Creek sand is productive only of gas . it should be remembered that the big Salt Creek field abuts Teapot Dome and it was this fact that caused the government to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lease it for development because of drainage by offset wells in southern Salt Creek . But completion of this well as a gasser on top of Teapot structure showed conditions there to be different from Salt Creek . In latter district there are no gas wells . There is plenty of gas but it flows with the oil . To be similar to Salt Creek field conditions the Teapot well on top of the structure should have been a substantial oil producer . Another element of disappointment is that aside from the large well completed in Salt Creek formation , wells in Teapot producing from second Wall Creek sand are far down on the structure , a condition Which invariably indicates small oil recovery . noirr . Ire pEttrrat SAND In discussing the disappointing results in Teapot drilling , Wyoming oil men are frank in saying the only hope for any sizeable production in Teapot Dome lies in finding production in the deep Lakota sand . They consider it rather significant that Mammoth has started two wells and made location for a third well to this deep sand although contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,300 feet . This depth was undoubtedly stated in the contract because the Lakota sand was found in the Big Muddy field of Wyoming at 4,200 feet , the well making about 150 barrels a day . In the Salt Creek field a well was drilled on top of ' the structure , in section 25 , which found the Lakota sand at 2,700 feet and made about 250 barrels a day . There is a difference in depth of wells in Salt Creek from those in Teapot Dome , drilled to the same sands , the latter wells between 1,000 and 1,500 feet deeper . PROPOSED ExriesrurrEttres H. F. Sinclair , testifying before the Senate committee on development work in Teapot Dome , said : " Our obligations would perhaps equal the spending of from sixty to seventy million dollars to carry out the contract . " However , about $21,000,000 of this will be represented by the main pipe line from Wyoming to mid-continent lines In Missouri . This is not arr expenditure by Mammoth Oil , but by Sinclair Pipe Line Co .. owned equally by Sinclair Consolidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planning to use the line to run Salt Creek crude cast . So , ton , in the case of the large steel storage program in connection with the pipe line . This is being done by Sinclair ( ' rude Oil Purchasing Co. , also owned equally to Sinclair Consolidated and Standard of Indiana . Already 2,000,000 barrels tankage has been erected at Teapot and another 7,000,000 barrels capacity is being built 27 miles from Teapot , involving several million dollars . Estimate of total expenditure of $60,000,000 to $70 , - 000,000 undoubtedly took into consideration , in addition to pipe line and steel storage , the maximum number of wells required under the contract . This provided drilling 20 wells in first six months . If a production of 20,000 barrels daily was not obtained , it was agreed to drill two additional wells for each well making 100 barrels a day over a month test period ; further provision was made for drilling two additional test wells , for each of the first two series making 100 barrels a day , providing production was not up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil would be required to drill a total of 120 wells . At an average cost of - about $36,000 a well , this drilling would involve about $4.800,000 and in addition Mammoth has spent about $2,500,000 on camps , roads and other facilities at Teapot .
