A passenger train on the Santa F railroad rumbled smoothly through the night over the plains of Texas . A proud train crew was in charge ; proud because back in one of the Pullmans slept a handsome , motherly middle-aged woman , no less a personage than Mrs. Miriam A. ( " Ma " ) Ferguson , Governess of the whole huge state . <P> Some one had left a switch open . The train leaped up a siding and buried its snorting nose in a freight train . The flier 's engineer was killed , his mates injured painfully . Back in the sleeper , the motherly woman awoke , thought she had heard a thunder clap , dropped off again . She was fatigued after her previous day 's campaigning for renomination by the Democrats . When she heard what had happened , she proceeded to her home townlet of Temple right nearby , telephoned the executive mansion at Austin to say she was all right , and , when the sun shone once more , went on making political hay by calling in friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As a matter of fact , it would have made little difference to the outcome of her campaign had Governess Ferguson been brought to bed by the wreck . Practically speaking , it was not her campaign at all but another campaign by her vigorous , fire-eating husband Jim against two other candidates : red-headed Attorney General Dan Moody , aged 32 , and a politically inconsequential wight named Lynch Davidson . <P> Jim 's Past . In 1916 during his second term as governor , Jim Ferguson was careless enough to get impeached by letting it seem as though he may have used state funds and a " loan " from brewers to save a bank of his from collapsing . Though deprived of civic eligibility , he thumbed his nose and ran again in 1918 anyway . He even ran for President in 1920 , getting 100,000 votes . Two years ago he conceived and executed his brilliant scheme of having his wife elected Governess on an Anti-Klan plank . An amnesty bill was ram med through the legislature to make him thoroughly respectable once more ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at the executive desk helping his wife out , he was careless again and let some highway contracts get by , which necessitated the resignation of two highway commissioners and the return to the state of $600,000 in excess profits from one contracting company alone . <P> Jim 's Talk . The essence of Fergusonism is good , vigorous home-and-family blather , the kind of thing a contented Americano is supposed to shout in at the wife while he is shaving in the bathroom and she is trying to sneak in another snooze . Jim can talk to Fundamentalists or Evolutionists with equal equanimity in his hearty , informal way . <P> Thus , to Fundamentalists : " These Evolutionists are monkey-faced Baptists and they are worse than an archists or the Ku Klux Klan . " ( Antiphony : " Amen , Brother Jim ! " ) <P> To Evolutionists : " Oh , forget it ! The Ferguson family ca n't settle it , anyhow . Ma said to leave it in the books ' cause it did n't make any difference . And I said : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's yank her out . ' And there you are . " ( See p. 17. )
