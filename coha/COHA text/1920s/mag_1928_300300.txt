C , If the new German Republic has an ally it is Soviet Russia . Therefore President Paul von Hindenburg bestowed the most important diplomatic appointment in his gift , last week , when he sent Dr. Herbert von Dirksen , erstwhile Chief of the Eastern Division of the German Foreign Office to Moscow , as German Ambassador . The new appointee succeeds late famed Ambassador Count Brockdorff-Rantzau . Dr. von Dirksen served during the War as an officer of Uhlans , began his diplomatic career with the Republic in 1918 , has never before held ministerial position or ambassadorial rank . C. Prime Minister Hermann Miiller appointed and despatched officials to administer $5,000,000 in unemployment doles to the 250,000 workmen now locked-out in the Ruhr . The gigantic dole was approved by special act of the Reichstag . With great difficulty the deadlock between employer and employed was temporarily settled , last week , when workmen agreed to resume work on the old wage scale pending a decision by Minister of the Interior Doctor Severing as to whether or not their wages should be rightfully increased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news from Saarbrucken in the French occupied Saar . The local mayor had celebrated the decennial of French occupation , it appeared , by delivering a fiery public speech in the course of which he bellowed : <P> ' ' Experience has shown that continuance of the present regime until 1935 , the year fixed by the Treaty of Versailles for holding a plebiscite to determine the final nationality of our Saar , is an intolerable prospect ! Our only wish is to be reunited with Germany , unconditionally and without restriction . " <P> Needless to recall , France seized the Saar with its immensely valuable mines , as War booty .
