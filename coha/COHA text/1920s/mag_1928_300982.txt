His Majesty 's Chancellor of the Exchequer , the Right Honorable Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill , was expelled last week by the union from which he recently and jocularly obtained a card proclaiming him to be a bricklayer ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) . <P> Such drastic action was taken not lightly , but after hours of anxious wrangling by the Executive Committee of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trades ' Workers . In its final and awful form the order of expulsion against whimsical Mr. Churchill charged that " he has never laid bricks , except as a pastime on his own estate , and furthermore he does not intend to earn his living by laying bricks , or to take any part in the internal affairs of this union . " <P> When official notice of this excommunication was conveyed to the Chancellory of the Exchequer , there came in retort from that sanctum a weighty , mocking reply : <P> " Mr. Churchill does not see how he could accept expulsion without endangering the position of other members of the union who , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have assurance that they can not be turned out for political reasons . <P> " It would be injurious to the interests of the union if doubt were thrown upon the validity of the signatures and authority of its responsible officers . Mr. Churchill hopes , therefore , that the matter may be further considered and the correspondence studied by the Executive Committee . "
