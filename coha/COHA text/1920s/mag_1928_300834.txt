Andre Maurois , able French author ( Ariel , Disraeli ) , is adept at picking representative material-albeit trite-in order to write a book , to father an essay . Deftly , for the New York Times , he took the main points for and against Prohibition , dangled them before the reader 's eye , then put them away , told what dangling Prohibition arguments have taught him . Says M. Maurois : <P> " I believe , everything considered , that I should retain the Eighteenth Amendment ( because I could not do otherwise ) and that I should resolve to apply it . I should continue the suppression of the saloon and of all public sale of alcohol . I have never seen the American saloon , but judging from what I have heard of it , it was a dangerous institution . On the other hand , I should try to induce Congress to amend the Volstead act so as to permit the private consumption of wine and beer in the states which desire it . But I should place a heavy tax upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time prevent drinking from becoming excessive . . . . "
