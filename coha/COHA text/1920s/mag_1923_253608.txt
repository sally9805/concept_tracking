Lenin est mort ! Vive Lenin ! <P> Nikolai Lenin , Prime Minister of Soviet Russia , is sinking fast . No hope is entertained for his recovery . <P> The Premier recovered in so far as he was able to sit up and toy with half a grape fruit . The paralysis has entirely left his throat , leaving his power of speech free . His words were : " So this is Russia . " <P> Lenin is out of danger and is expected to leap from bed at any moment to take up the reins of government . <P> Nikolai had a slight relapse . Trotzky stands Red Army free vodka . <P> Lenin much better . Denies that he is a relation of " Old Nick . " <P> Trotzky feeling bilious , but orders Red Army to clean buttons as the Chief is expected to resume control during the day . <P> Lenin worse ; not expected to live . <P> Trotzky , Rykov and Stalin have a free fight for the dictatorship . Trotzky , remembering his military strategy , waits until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kremelin , Trotzky makes an amazing announcement : " Who is Lenin anyway ! "
