A great loggerhead turtle is posed in frantic flight in an exhibition case of Manhattan 's American Museum of Natural History . Its neck is stretched far forward ; its flippers beat the water ; its runty tail sticks straight out behind . Driving after the turtle are several varieties of sharks-leathery bodies , cold , piggish eyes , blunt snouts all straining towards the prey . <P> Sharks and turtle are dead &; stuffed , mounted realistically to show museum visitors what roving sea life is like . That exhibit is the best and key of a whole Hall of Fishes of the World , formally opened in the museum last week . Groups represent lake , river and ocean fish life , from trout to rays ( flattened sharks ) . Each scene makes the visitor feel as if he were under water , peering inquisitively . <P> Creating such realistic scenes is the new aim of natural history museums . The American Museum has several groups of wild animals in natural surroundings . Last week it received seven lion skins , brought back from Tanganyika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lions will be posed at the edge of a thicket near one of the great granite boulders that stick up out of the African plains . In the distance will be herds of game ( painted on a back drop ) . It will be sunset , the lions wakening up , stretching themselves . One lioness , with a few bristles on her Irishman 's long upper lip , will be on her feet , ready to hunt. * <P> The date of the American Museum 's opening of its Hall of Fishes was a sad mischance . Guest of honor was to have been Dr. Bashford Dean , retired and honorary curator of ichthyology , who had planned the fish collection . An astonishingly different interest of his was in arms &; armor . He knew more about arms &; armor than any man in this country and aimed to make the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art rank next after those in Paris , Madrid and Denver . Rarely has a man held active curatorship in two great museums , and of such separated fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every written reference to fishes , from classical times to the present . It made three great tomes and brought him a National Academy of Science medal . <P> He yearned to attend last week 's opening . But he was bed-ridden at Battle Creek , Mich. , from a major operation . The night after the opening he died . <P> <P> - Proud though the American Museum is of its fish and animal collections , it is prouder of ( and more famed for ) its bird and dinosaur collections . Pride of other U. S. museums : Chicago 's Field , botanical material ; Washington 's National , technical progress ; San Francisco 's Golden Gate , habitat groups of North American animals ; Denver 's Colorado , arrow heads and prehistoric bison : Washington 's Red Cross , war material : Yale , fossil vertebrates ; Harvard , birds and glass flowers .
