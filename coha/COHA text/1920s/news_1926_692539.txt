txt The United States has said most emphatically that it does not want to enter the League of Nations ; therefore , why , in the name of common sense and decency , does it allow a seat in the Council to be kept for it ? With all the nations of Europe , big and little , and Brazil fo ? good measure , quarreling to the breaking point over the question of seats and only escaping an actual break by weak procrastination , is n't there a very marked and disagreeable suggestion of the dog in the manger in our having it kept for us ? We do not want it , and Europe does so why not let Europe have it ? It would not be deserting a sinking ship , as , probably , proLeaguers would say , because to deset-t anything one must first be in it , and we are not in the League and never have been . The League Is In the doldrums of its own tragic futility . Its powerful members have always utterly disregarded it when questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and made the arrangements that pleased themselves ; but , as " a sop to Cerberus , " they nave let it do the little things with a splendid blare of trumpets . The wars and troubles which are now going on , the many questions it has never faced , make a long list . Dawes went to Europe and did in three months , or thereabout , what the League had been unable to do In years . " The Spirit of Locarno , " that superb cloud of dust meant for an applauding world , is in danger of vanishing like a pricked toy balloon because of a sEnseless quarrel about seats at the feast of nations where Peace was supposed to be the guest of honor . It is a perfect example of ? ? adult-infantilism . " Under the surface of all that has been going on in Geneva is the old Eurcpesn idea o ? the balance of power , the subconscious desire to get back to the old standards , because the old distrusts , the old jealousies , the old ambitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to raise their heads again . The terrible world-destroying mines are all there , and the League , for all Its boasting and magnificence , can not or does not put out the burning fuse . There is a very old-fashioned saying about " do n't mix your drinks , ' " which could be applied to the League . If Peace had been Peace , and the League the League , two distinct I things , there might have been hope . but the combination has proved impossible , as Senator Lodge foresaw so clearly it would . That fatal corn- C. bination is one of the tragic land .. marks of history . If the United States would give its empty and useless seat to the League it might save the situation . Like the Carpenter , " I doubt it , " but at least we should cease to be that selfish beast , a dog in the manger , and we might save the peace of the world .                  @ @ @
