Directors of the Standard Oil Co. of N. Y. , by electing Charles F. Meyer ( one of their number ) president last week , * emphasized a unique commercial parallelism . <P> Standard 's great rival in the international oil markets is the Royal Dutch-Shell group , which Sir Henri Wilhelm August Deterding heads . <P> Both Meyer and Deterding are in their middle sixties . Meyer 's ancestors were Germans . Deterding 's father was a Dutch sea captain . <P> Both men , before they became great in the world 's oil industry , kept business accounts . Meyer at 22 ( in 1886 ) found work as bookkeeper in the old Standard Oil 's Boston office . Soon he became statistician . Deterding at 22 quit work as Chief Clerk in an Amsterdam bank to adventure in the Dutch East Indies , where he sold among a multitude of general items kerosene lamps . The East Indians who used those lamps filled them with Standard oil shipped in square cans from the U. S. Sumatra , Batavia , Borneo , Java and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the Royal Dutch-Shell was to control . First oil of the region was discovered at Sumatra in the late 1880 's ; the Royal Dutch Co. ( the Dutch royal family are important stockholders ) was incorporated at The Hague only in 1890 . <P> In 1892 , Deterding became a Royal Dutch employe , at their Batavia headquarters . <P> In 1893 , Standard Oil sent Meyer to manage their Bombay office . <P> In 1896 , Deterding became general sales manager in the Far East for Royal Dutch . <P> Mr. Meyer went to Manhattan to be a member of Standard Oil 's foreign trade committee in 1907 , to be vice president and director in 1920 . But already , at the beginning of this century , Sir Henri had moved to his Royal Dutch headquarters in The Hague , and from there he directed the fight for customers . <P> Worth struggling for has been the field - China with 400,000,000 people , East Indies with 50,000,000 , India with 318,000,000 . Everywhere Standard Oil was first . In China , to get natives to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , for a cheep as inebriates of Singapore used to say . Mei Fooy is the Chinese name for Standard Oil . Shouting Mei Fooy out loudly once saved the life of Lucy Aldrich , John D. Rockefeller Jr . ' s sister-in-law , when in 1923 Chinese bandits captured her . It was the only phrase she knew ; and the bandits , if they knew not its potency , knew its beneficence . They quickly released her . <P> In India Sir Henri has used gang tactics for abusing Standard Oil . His English Shell Transport relations have brought him British government aid . Indian duties against Standard oil are higher than against Royal Dutch-Shell oil . <P> <P> In the East Indies the tactics have been almost the same .
