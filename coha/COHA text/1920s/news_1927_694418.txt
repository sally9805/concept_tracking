txt VANCOUVER , B. C. , Oct. 17. -1 That funds from the turbulent Orient are seeking secure investment I in western Canada is a conclusion reached here as a result of a series of large deals involving Vancouver real estate and British Columbia mining and farm . land . The purchases have been made by General Frank Sutton , adventurer extraordinary , late military adviser to the North China war lord , Chang-Tsolin . General Sutton , a Major in the British Army , distinguished himself in the recent fighting in China by introducing some elements of European strategy into the tactics of the Northern forces . For many years it has been the practice of wealthy Chinese to invest in property under British or other foreign protection in China , the Occidental sacredness of property rights creating that preference . Latterly , with the Nationalists openly avowed to break the control of foreigners on Chinese territory , real estate in or around foreign concessions has been rated considerably lower as an investment by the shrewd capitalists of the Far East . General Sutton signalized his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of placer leases in the once famous Cariboo gold fields of Central British Columbia . Subsequently he bought a large ranch adjacent to the placer ground and put regular forces to work on both enterprises . In Vancouver he caused a sensation when he bought , for more than $1,200,000 , one of the largest offise buildings in the heart of the city and followed that by acquiring another office building for $400,000 . He bought a Fokker airplane and announced that he would cruise in north central British Columbia to study the prospects for extending the Provincial Government 's Pacific Great Eastern Railway into the Peace River country . He intimated that he might arrange finances not only for that undertaking but for the purchase of the railway by private capital . He boarded a boat to visit Victoria and talk things over with the Provincial Government , and on his way down the Gulf of Georgia an island caught his fancy . He looked up the owner in Victoria and bought it . " It will be a pleasure resort , " he said . " I 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a club house . It would make an admirable site for a pheasant farm , too , would n't it ? " As this is written this man who has so impressed British Columbians with large talk and large cash payments is canoeing with a party of guides from Summit Lake down the headwaters of the Peace bound for Peace River Crossing in Alberta . He is doing his own reconnoitring . The late Premier Oliver of this Province offered the Government 's Pacific Great Eastern Railway virtually as a gift to the Canadian Pacific and to the Canadian National Railways about a year ago , but the transcontinental lines were not interested . Extension of that railway at a cost of about twelve or fifteen million dollars , it is claimed , is the logical way to tap the latent agricultural , timber , hydroelectric and mineral wealth of the Peace River country . British Columbians are not greatly concerned whether General Sutton is backed by Peking or Pittsburgh capital . If he can produce a reasonable deal or can so focus attention on the resources of the untouched country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the line to its original goal . he will be firmly established in the eyes of this Province as a military man who has won a victory of peace .
