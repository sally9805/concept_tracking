txt In your Sunday edition of Oot. 18 , Under the heading " Our Town and Its Folks , " Bertram Reinita among other things , wrote at length on the decreased population of the lower east side , so - called , attributing it to the restriction of immigration and the increased prosperity of those who formerly lived there and no doubt many of those who are still residents of the locality . In any case , when our immigrants become " real Americans " they are no longer willing to live in unheated flats without bathrooms or white walls . And in mtde caeca they head for the Bronx , which will explain In part measure , at least . the phenomenal growth of that borough . But , in corroboration of Mr. Relnitz'e statements , I have this to say : On Sunday evening I happened to be one at a gathering where several of the city 's educational leaders were present . and In the course of conversation one of these remarked that the schools of the lower east side were becoming so depleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to close . This coincides with Mr. Reinitz 's report of the vacant apartments or flats . Immediately It occurred to me that if the lower east aide was to be deserted by its former tenants It might be taken up by new ones of she Greenwich Village variety , or even those of lower Fifth Avenue and the recently resurrected East River In the vicinity of Fifty-seventh Street , Including Sutton Place . Compared with the latter locality , the lower east side has many advantages . It is nearer New York Bay , hence should be cooler in Summer . Many of its streets twist and turn in a manner truly artistic , and often suggestive of the Latin Quarter in Paris . It is within reach of Brooklyn Bridge , a splendid promenade , where the views of city and bay at sunset ? why not sunrise 7 ? are unsurpassed in the world for magnificence . All sorts of the best shops not to mention stores and markets , are already in existence is lower Manhattan . It is here the stenographer and her sisters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lingerie , hats , shoes , gloves and adornments of all kinds . It is here the commuter selects the best fruit , poultry and vegetable ( to be found in the city . Washington Market is near at hand . And what better thoroughfare in the world than Broadway after business hours or on Sunday , leading down past City Hall Park to the Battery ? Of course , the old flats would have to be renovated , but why not ? Think of the increased rents and the increased real estate values I Instead of dingy cold-water flats would be entirely new interiors  --  Colonial , of course . And the Colonial is right there ready to the hand . Often I stop and gaze at some shabby , dirty exterior , riveted by a fan and sidelights that would glorify a pretentious home . And the musty brick , cleaned , no doubt In many cases would reveal real old Holland , as beautiful and red as much of Washington Square . Well , cleaning and paint would restore the exteriors ; but the interiors would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something to have a wall and skeleton interior in these days of bricklayers ' salaries , as well as the cost of cellars , foundations , and  --  but why go further , with an army of real estate men ready to the Job ? Yes , I can set the whole cycle of New York : the doww.own moves uptown and the uptown moves downtown , and In the process the city grows beautiful ; so that in the end there shall be no slums , and a lot of dear old New York shall be saved forever and ever . The Monroe House will thus find Itself In fine company , the same , in fact , as in the days of Its prime . And who knows but that a President of the United States , not to mention Secretaries and diplomats , may yet sleep in the same Part of New York that Washington did when he lived In Cherry Street ? Or , if not exactly in that street , what could be a better sight for a magnificent hotel than facing the Battery ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the view on all nights I
