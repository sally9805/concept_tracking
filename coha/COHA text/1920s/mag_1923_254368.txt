Senator Brookhart , Iowa , favors a studied informality in the matter of dress . <P> " If I am asked to the White House , or to attend any other state occasion , I shall go as I am , with cowhide shoes and the clothes I wear on the farm . If my constituents wish me to do so , I shall go to the extreme of donning overalls .

He remarks further : <P> " I have never owned evening clothes and never propose to . I do not care for social functions and would prefer to remain away . If the occasion requires that I should be present I will go just as I am . " <P> Washington hostesses have not yet attempted to exploit the Senator as a curiosity . <P> General Isaac R.

" He holds that official designation through the fact that he is still serving the term to which he was elected in 1916-when the Progressive Party still had an official existence in California . <P> Last fall Mr. Johnson was re-elected by a constituency exclusively Republican . A " plain Republican " he must be after March 4 . <P> Warren G. Harding , author , is on many bookshelves throughout the land .
