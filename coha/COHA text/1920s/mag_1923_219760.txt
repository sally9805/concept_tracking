The Fort Worth Record was sold to William Randolph Hearst for $375,000 . Fort Worth , Texas , is the smallest city in which Mr. Hearst publishes . John E. Cullen will command the recently acquired Baltimore division of Hearst 's newspaper empire . William Roscoe Thayer , popular historian and biographer of John Hay , Roosevelt and Washington , will edit . Thayer , like his employer , is a Harvard man , and is generally considered to be the most " cultured " of all Hearst 's men . Mr. Hearst took over the Baltimore American ( morning ) and the Baltimore News ( evening ) from Frank A. Munsey two weeks ago . The News retains its old format , but The American already bears its master 's mark on every page .
