A surgeon , about to make a transfusion , scientifically matches a donor 's blood to his patient 's to such purpose that no shock results . In like manner Congress has ordained that Immigration shall be scientifically matched to the U. S. racial bloodstream . <P> It is far simpler , however , to match up the blood of individuals than the many mixed bloods of a populous nation . In attempting to execute the orders of Congress , a large corps of census experts , statisticians and genealogists have wrestled for four years with the problem of tracing back for 140 years the ancestry of 120,000 people . The chief results so far have been expert disagreements and rancorous race disputes . <P> Quotas . In 1921 the quota system was first applied to restrict European immigration into the U. S. A slot method of admission was set up , its size crudely fixed at 3% of the number of foreign-born U. S. residents enumerated in the Census of 1910 . This slot seemed still too large . In 1924 it was closed to 2% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Origins . This was not a scientific way to filter aliens into the U. S if the original native stock of the country was to be preserved . The 1924 law therefore carried a provision for the establishment of quotas based on National Origins Scientists were to determine the racial composition of the present day U. S. , starting from the first U. S. census ( 1790. pop 3,900,000 ) , analyzing the growth of population to date with reference to national ancestries and thus , in effect , fixing the proportion each foreign country contributed to U.S. " native stock " and the development of that stock since . To the U S were then to be admitted 150,000 immigrants annually , in direct proportion to the contributions their native countries have made to the whole U. S. population , past and present , Negroes excluded , new policy was to go into effect by Presidential proclamation July 1,1927 . <P> Postponement . The British burned most early U. S. census details in the sack of Washington in 1814 . Native stock , clear in the early days , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scant or unreliable . Racial names have become meaningless through social changes . So the 2Oth Century scientists bogged down in confusion and Congress in 1927 , postponed the effective date of National Origins to July 1 , 1928 ; later to July 1 , 1929 , where it now remains . <P> Hoover . Herbert Hoover , as Secretary of Commerce , with the Secretaries of State and Labor , constituted a special commission to report the scientists ' findings . This report said : " Although this is the best information we have been able to secure , we wish to . . . state that in our opinion the statistical and historical information available raises grave doubts as to the whole value of these computations . <P> As a Presidential candidate Herbert Hoover again said : " The basis now in effect 2% quota carries out the essential principle of the law and I favor repeal of that part of the law calling for a new National Origins basis of quotas .
