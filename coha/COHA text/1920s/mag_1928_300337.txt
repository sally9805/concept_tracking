Cutten-Sinclair ( See front cover ) <P> On a wall in the offices of Blair &; Co. , bankers , at No. 24 Broad St. , Manhattan , hangs a portrait of J. Insley Blair , founder . Revered is the memory of Mr. Blair , but stocks and bonds no longer interest him . The inheritor of his power , though not of his title , is Elisha Walker , senior partner of Blair &; Co. * There is little about Partner Walker to distinguish him , outwardly , from other Blair &; Co. partners such as Polo Player J. Cheever Cowdin . He has dark hair . He is of medium size . He is decidedly middle aged . He likes to play poker . He is impatient of obstructionism . It is on Mr. Walker , however , that the destinies of Blair &; Co. most vitally depend . In an association , theoretically , of equals , Mr. Walker stands unquestionably a superior . He it is who decides where the potential energy of Blair &; Co. millions shall be cynamically applied . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , suffering from overproduction and savage competition now shows signs of straightening out its difficulties . Carefully surveying the oil industry , Mr. Walker discreetly arrived at a conclusion . The result of that conclusion was last week 's transfer of some thirty million dollars of Rockefeller holdings in the Prairie <P> Oil &; Gas and the Prairie Pipe Line Co. * to Blair &; Co . Inc . These holdings totalled some 10% of Prairie Oil and some 14% of Prairie Pipe Line . <P> By that speculative law through which the act of purchase increases the value of the thing purchased , Blair &; Co. ' s acquisition of Prairie stock shot Prairie quotations upward . Indeed , the deal had hardly been concluded when the rise in Prairie prices made the $30,000,000 holding worth $47,000,000 . Even before the purchase , however , the two Prairie flowers had been blossoming with unprecedented brilliance . Prairie Pipe Line had a Low for the year of 51 . Last week 's High was 277 . Even Wright Aero , even Radio Corp . have not equalled this record climbing-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Prairie Oil &; Gas has moved from a Low of 26 to a High of 67 . <P> Yet the bull market in oils is not caused only by Partner Walker , not only the work of Blair &; Co . Other and even more powerful interests have influenced the rise in oils . Chief among these other influences is Arthur W. Cutten who has gone into Sinclair Consolidated as Blair &; Co. have gone into Prairie oil . Always a bull , never a bear , Arthur W. Cutten has done more than any other individual to make the overload stock ticker lag far behind the market and Prairie Pipe . He has been in Radio Corp. , in Montgomery Ward , in many another of the soaring stocks that have done most to create the present buying market . In a bull market , among many bulls , Bull Cutten ranks king of the herd . <P> But since No. 209 Lake Shore Drive , Chicago , is still Arthur W. Cutten 's home , it has been necessary for him to have a Wall St. representative actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in his nephew , Ruloff Cutten. + If Uncle Cutten is the brain of the combination , Nephew Cutten is certainly its vigorous tongue , its potent legs . There is no more active bustler on the floor of the exchange than Nephew Cutten.
