In Rome , Ga. , from Rome , Italy , arrived last week a bronze she-wolf , suckling two bronze infants . A gift from Italy 's Benito Mussolini , it was a reproduction of the ancient Romulus &; Remus group , a reminder to Georgian Romans of their etymological ancestry . <P> In Rome , Ga. , is a textile mill . Its cornerstone , another Mussolini gift , was sent last year from the Coliseum 's crumbling walls . The American Chatillon Rayon Co. was started on Italian capital . Therein lay the cause for the Mussolini corner stone , the Mussolini she-wolf , which will be formally presented by an Italian mill executive . In the U. S. there are 13 other Romes . No Italian mills have they , hence no she-wolves.
