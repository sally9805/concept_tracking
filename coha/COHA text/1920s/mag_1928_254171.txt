Like beaten puppies , the snarling folk of Broadway often cringe from the hand that is raised to stroke them . For example , Edgar B. Davis , an obscure but very wealthy operator in oil , produced a play called The . Ladder ( TIME , Nov. 8 , 1926 ) , which dwelt , with confused eloquence , upon a theosophical theory of reincarnation . <P> A feeble fable held no interest for the gay dogs of Broadway ; yet , when they scorned it , Producer Davis took pity on them . " It has a message for you , " he said , and offered free seats to any who would have them . Almost no one could believe that a man would willingly throw away money upon Broadway without hope of return . He threw away $750,000 . " Advertising , " said many . " Dopey , " said others . <P> Last week Edgar B. Davis again surprised Manhattan theatre-goers by announcing that from July 11 until further notice The Ladder would play to paying audiences , if any . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . On the last day of June it will reach its 660th performance . In the duration of its run legends have grown up about the members of The Ladder 's cast , its author , a friend of the producer , whose name is supposed to have been forgotten , its audiences , but most of all the staunch oil man who is its angel . At Houston , the man who got $10,000,000 in oil almost overnight was given an overnight boom for the U. S. Vice Presidency .
