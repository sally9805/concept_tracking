txt Miss Mabel Normand , motion picture actress , whose chauffeur last night shot  --  and seriously wounded Courtland S. Dines , oil operator , of Denver , tonight gave her version of the shooting , a version directly , contradicting that of Horace A. Greer , alias Joe Kelly , under Eirr est for the attack on Dines . Miss Normand was removed late tonight to the Good Samaritan Hospital suffering from what her physicians said was a nervous breakdown . The strain and worry growing out of the shooting caused hed to break down , it was said . She was permitted to see no one after her arrival at the hospital , where Dines also is a patient . Miss Norman.d 's physicians declined to say whether it was planned to operate on her for appendicitis . According to her friends , she was to have undergone such an operation today . Miss Normand told her story of the New Year 's party in Dines 's apartment which ended in the shooting of the Denver man , surrounded by newspaper men and police detectives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whom the police had been searching all day . " We 'll begin at the beginning . " said the screen actress by way of Introduction . She had received her interrogators at home , sitting in a big chair and attired in a trim black velvet dress . Door bells and telephone bells rang unceasingly . Reporters were seeking interviews , chauffeurs were looking for Greer 's job , and friends wanted to speak a word of cheer . But to all these she was not at home . The shades were I drawn ; the room was dark ; Miss Normand spoke in a whisper . " I did n't sleep all night , ' began Miss Normand , " worrying about this thing , this dreadful thing . You tell them , Edith , " she exclaimed , turning to Mrs. Burns ; " well them what we did during the entire . day . " Mrs. Burns then related how Miss Normand had arisen at 10 o'clock yesterday morning , doing little inconsequential things which occupied their time until noon ; told then how Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree trimmings upstairs . " " It must have been then that he got the pistol , " she said . " I know of , no other opportunity he could have to get it . " Used Revolver on Location . Miss Normand explanned she had owned the weapon for four Years , that it was given to her by a friend while on location during the production of one of ' ler film plays , " It was given to me to shoot bottles with , ' she said . ' " I used it all the time for shooting bottles , but only on location ; at least I shot at the bottles . I 'd shoot over here and  --  blah ? I 'd hit the mountain some place else . " " Well , " she continued , arriving at the point in her narrative where the chauffeur , Greer , or Kelly , entered Dine 's apartment while she and Miss Edna Purviance , another motion picture actress were chatting with . the Denver man . " Well , Joe came in and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left the room . " I went into the room where Edna was . She had on her evening gown , but it was n't hooked up . I did n't want this chauffeur to see Edna with her dress unhooked , so went in and said to Edna : ' Say , where 's your powder Puff ? ' " Then , all of a sudden , I heard these terrible things . I thbught , they were firecrackers , I used to shoot firecrackers about this long ? at Ben . Turpin , poor old Ben , all the time , until he threatened to quit his job . That 's what I thought they were  --  firecrackers . They were popping all over the house . Then she ran into the room where Dines had been sitting and found him lying on the floor wounded . She could think of no motive tor the shooting of ' Dines by her chauffeur , she said , and ridiculed the theory that Greer was infatuated with her and shot the Denver man in a fit of jealous rage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . " The man must have been insane . He was only one of my servants and was treated like one . I never talked to him even like I have to my servants in the past . I used to ask my chauffeurs , 7the ones before this one , how they liked a certain scene or something like that  --  but I got tired of all that blah blah . I did n't even hire him . My secretary did that . " Nor could Mrs. Burns think of any motive for the shooting . Mrs. Burns said Joe , " just as calm as you are , fussed around the house , " fixing things until Miss Normand came downstairs and he took her over to Dines ' bungalow . " He left me there , " interrupted Miss Normand . " He did n't see Court at all . I left the car and climbed the steps alone . Court answered the door . Edna was there . ? " ' Come , ' 1 said , ' step into your dancing togs and let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go anywhere , so I went in . " Here Mrs. Burns resumed her narrative . " Joe came back and resumed tearing down the Christmas tree , " she related . " About 6 o'clock Court called up on the telephone . I told him Mabel ought to come home ; that she was ill and had to undergo an operation for appendicitis on the following day and that I would send Joe after her . " ' It 's early yea ' Court said . Then he added : ' All right , but do n't forget my Christmas package . ' " That was all that was said about Mabel coming home . As for the Christmas package , it was one I had fixed for Court  --  a pair of military brushes for him from me . " At this point Mrs. Burns 's narrative diverged decidedly from the story told by Greer . The chauffeur insists that during the telephone conversation with Dines . Mrs. Burns held her hand over the transmitter and told him ( Greer ) that Dines had said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I heard that I ran past Mrs. Burns and up the stairs to Miss Norma'nd 's bedroom where I got the gun and put it in my overcoat. " was the explanation Greer made to the police . Mrs. Burns declared that Kelly 's statement waa not true . " He did not run upstairs . " she said . " He could not go upstairs without passing right by me and he certainly did not do that . He was just as calm as anybody could be . I gave him the package and he left as he usually leaves the house . " Contradicts the Chauffeur . Miss Normand also disagreed with Greer 's account of what happened at the telephone and immediately afterward . " What business has the man got in my bedroom any way ? " she exclaimed heatedly . " That man has been in my , room only twice : once to fix my curler and once to fix an electric plug of some kind . How should he be so familiar with my room as to know where to go to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still clung to their theory that Greer. or Kelly , as he was known in the Norrnaidl household , must hat admired Miss Normand from afar , after the manner of many film fans , and probably sought employment with her in order to be near her ; that he was a silent lover , fearing to betray his infatuation , but feeling it his duty to watch over and protect his employer , and that he imagined himself performing a heroic deed when ! he drew tile pistol and shot Dines . Dines , as a result of the injury , has developed a mild case of pneumonia . it was announced tonight by an attending physician . In explaining the latest development in the patient 's condition , the physician said that the bullet had pierced the lung and that pneumonia ! invariably resulted from such an injury . The doctor said that Dines 's condition continued to be serious , but " not " critical . Dines 's temperature and pulse were said to be normal . He told his version of the shooting affair tonight . Greer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous story of his part in the shooting . plaint The p id olice sa formal charging himtonight with a attempted co mixrder would be filed tomorrow . Greer has a police record in Oakland , where he escaped from the city jail after serving part of a sentence of seventyfive days for the theft of a pair of rubber heels , according to the Les Angeles Examiner . Greer , the Examiner states . admitted his Oakland record when confronted with evidence in the Policei Identification Bureau . " Mrs. Burns was in communication with Dines 's apartment , " Greer told the officers . " She told mc , . as I stood near by that she had heard Dines say that Miss Normand could not come home . I went into a room where I knew she kept her gun , grabbed it and drove to Dines 's place . " After arriving at the place , Greer told the police he was kept waiting for several minutes in response to his knock . " I was peeved and cold . " said Greer . " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . Dines sneered and reached for a. bottle which stocd on a table in the centre of the room and I fired . I did n't wait to see whether I had hit him , but rushed from the room , got in the ear and drove to the police station . I did not see Miss Purviance at the apartment . " Questioned as to whether his motive might have been jealousy , Greer told the police that he thought of her as the rest of her friends did . " I heard Mrs. Burns say she would be better off if she had fewer friends of this class , meaning Dines. " said Greer . " And , it was my purpose to protect her . " " I would n't ever aspire to ? love such a wonderful , beautiful , great movie star , " Greer said today . " Me , one lung , little guy ? I like her and all that , and She 's been kinder to me than anybody I ever met . Gave me some platinum cuff links Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always doing- something for somebody . Well , I told you how Miss Burns . Mabel 's companion , got a call from her , asking to have me sent over to Mr. Dines 's for her . And how she told me a man took Mabel from the phone and hollered that she would n't be home . I went over there . I knew Mabel had to have an operation for , I guess it 's appendicitis . And 1 knew it was n't doing her any good to get soused . But you know Mabel ? she ca n't say ' no ' ? too darn goodhearted . " Rumors of the engagement of ' Miss Purviance to Dines were in sorffe measure explained by Miss Purvaince tonight . " Mr. Dines and I were engaged  --  and yet we were not engaged . If you understand what I mean , " she told newspaper men . " He never gave me an engagement ring , but there was an understanding between us that we would be married . There was no ' date . We had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had been thus engaged . I should say , for about five or six months . " I am not ashamed to say that I am most terribly fond of him . Edna told reporters this afternoon that Mabel had n't called Miss Burns . or anybody else . " I was with her all the time , of course , and I know she did n't use the telephone , " she insisted . " You see all this is tommy-rot , " Dines said today when questioned on Greer 's charge that he threatened to hit the chauffeur . " All this bunk , this stuff about me reaching for a bottle . Nonsense ; I did n't even see the gun when he shot . Ed and I had been to the Ambassador New Year 's Eve and we got home late . We were all feeling low ? so low we 'd have to use a stepladder to get on a snake 's back . And Mabel comes over , and she 's low too , very low .
