One day last week the Senators wended out of their chamber tingling all over with virtue and generosity . To their own and many another person 's great surprise they had passed a Flood Control bill ; passed it so suddenly that they had had to make their speeches on it after voting instead of before ; passed it 70 to 0 , moreover , so that only a " love feast " attended the event , without partisanship . <P> Senate-leaders Curtis ( Republican ) and Robinson ( Democrat ) had put their heads together and determined that , after all , Flood Relief was not a thing to bicker and trifle over . They had agreed to ram Senator Jones ' bill , all points of which had been settled in committee , through to a vote at the first opportunity . The opportunity came when Wisconsin 's Blaine long and earnestly opposed Senator Norbeck 's migratory bird bill , providing Federal bird sanctuaries to be paid for by Federal hunting licenses at $1 each . So long , so earnestly did Senator Elaine and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migratory birds were being filibustered out of sanctuary . So the bird bill was deposed in the order of business and the Flood Control bill was called up . <P> Senator Jones , as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , made the only major speech on the bill , outlining its provisions , which were : <P> 1 ) $325,000,000 ( an admittedly undersized amount for levees and spillways from Cape Girardeau , Mo. , ( near Cairo , Ill. ) to Head of the Passes ( Baton Rouge , La . ) . <P> 2 ) A board of engineers-the Secretary of War , the Chief of Army Engineers , the president of the Mississippi River Commission , two civil engineers to be appointed by the President-to conclude differences in plans and supervise work . <P> 3 ) Recognition of the principle of local contribution to the cost ( as insisted by President Coolidge ) but , since the flooded States have already paid some 300 millions to salvage themselves , no local levy . <P> 4 ) Authority for the Secretary of War to survey the Mississippi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ) An emergency fund of $5,000,000 for immediate control or rescue work on Mississippi tributaries between Cairo and the Gulf . <P> In the House , where flood control hearings began last November with no result as yet , the Senate was congratulated and its work received with interest . The House Flood Control Committee approved the bill and prepared to report it without major amendments .
