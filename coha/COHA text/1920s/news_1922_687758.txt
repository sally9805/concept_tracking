txt That the Commerce Commission can order an average reduction of ten per cent . in freight rates and , in the same breath , predict that the railroads will earn 5% percent . upon their property investment thereunder is , in truth , a triumph of hope over experience . The commission says , just as surely as though it had used these words , that it relies upon continued increase in business , early wage reduction by the Labor Board and lower fuel cost when the mine strike is settled , to vindicate its optimism . In a concurring opinion Commissioner Potter frankly declares that the commission is discounting the future in favor of the shipper . He might have added that if the cheek is returned marked " not sufficient funds , " it is the carriers and not the shippers who will be forced to make good the overdraft . Something of this sort must hate bee : ' . in Commissioner Eastman 's mind when he wrote that it would have been better to postpone rate action until the Labor Board had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered traditional G. 0 . P. luck that Mr. Eastman 's ideas did not prevail . Lacking the full text of the majority opinion , but with Commissioner Potter 's remarks for a clue , it may be surmised that the majority bases its action upon a belief ? one might almost say a fear  --  that on present rates the carriers as a whole will earn more than a fair return in the year following inky 1 next . On the mere . anticipation of such an event it hastens to cut down carrier revenues . In July , 1920 , the commission anticipated an investment return of 6 per cent . under rates it then established ; actually , the carriers earned half that return in the ensuing twelve months . In March , of this year , with their coal traule stimulated by the approaching strike but with maintenance expenditures still . sub-normal , the carriers managed to show the equivalent of en annual six percent . return upon an aggregate valuation made in 1920 , which takes no account of the substantial additional ' investment made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that one swallow makes a summer , buk it unfairly ignores the enormous deficits by which the carriers have failed to earn the commission 's own measure of a fair return in all but one of the 19 months following its last previous genet'l rate action . Must carrier returns be averaged down but never up ? Where the Transportation Act specifies a fair eturn. must it by some occult interpretation be read to mean a dead-line beyond which railroad rrofits must never rise , however far below it they may fall ? This decision is inexplicable on any theory of rational business administration of the Transportation Act , or indeed of the first principles of a national economic policy . With a degree of future good fortune upon which no prudent man ever relies the carriers may survive it , but it ' is an extremely dangerous species of regulation . In a non-election year'the commission would never have committed the property of others , or the transportation necessities of the country , to such a risk .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
