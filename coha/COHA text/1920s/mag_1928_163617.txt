To St. Louis , busy mart , came 1,500 chemists for the 75th meeting of the American Chemical Society ; organic chemists , inorganic chemists , biological chemists , physical chemists , industrial chemists , engineering chemists ; chemists who worked with spectroscope and vacuum tube to find out the structure of the atom , chemists who spent their days with rabbit and guinea pig to ferret out the secrets of growth , chemists who messed about with saps and sawdust to build up substitutes for rubber , sugar , silk . More than 300 scientific papers were read . More than a fifth of these were on the program of the Division of Physical and Inorganic Chemistry , the longest program of any of the 16 divisions . This division united with the Organic Division to give a symposium on " Atomic Structure and Valence , " officially announced as " probably the most notable in this sphere of pure science ever held in the United States . " <P> Reeling Atoms . Probably the most notable paper at this " most notable symposium " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemist . Fourteen years ago C. T. R. Wilson discovered that atoms shot at high speed through a gas , may be made to leave visible trails . Since then Professor Harkins has been trailing helium atoms . He has been busily exploding chunks of " thorium C " and other radioactive substances which shoot off atoms at the mad speed of 12,000 miles per second . <P> " Stepping up " his movie machine , he has taken reels of the reeling helium atoms ; his picture gallery now consists of 100,000 photographs showing the tracks of about 1,000,000 atoms . The atomic trail is infinitesimal , a narrow path ( usually straight but sometimes bent as though the atom had trespassed too close to some minute object which had repelled it ) made of the same water vapor that forms the clouds . Occasionally some dizzily dashing helium atom hurtling through the hundreds of thousands of normal atomic citizens in the air crashes kerplunk into the nucleus of one of them . Only 30 such collisions occurred in all the 1,000,000 trails recorded by Professor Harkins . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nitrogen atom causes an explosion which disintegrates the atom . Out of the wreck a new fluorine atom emerges , but not for long . It explodes immediately , shooting off a furiously fast atom of hydrogen and a slower atom of a new kind of oxygen which is heavier than either the helium or the nitrogen atom . According to Einstein 's theory , when helium is formed from lighter hydrogen atoms , energy is given off ( enough to heat an ordinary house from 500 to 1 , 000 years in the formation of one pound of helium atoms ) . <P> This was the energy that Millikan demonstrated in the cosmic ray ( TIME , March 26 ) . But the helium-nitrogen activity seems to be just the opposite . When helium and nitrogen collide and explode , forming oxygen and hydrogen , energy appears to be stored rather than given off . From this have arisen arguments which support the theory of Prof. Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin-that the earth has been built up by the aggregation of smaller bodies such as meteorites or planetesimals , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
