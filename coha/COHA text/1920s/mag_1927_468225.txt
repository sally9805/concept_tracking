TAST slimmer my dentist spent his vacation in England . A few weeks after his return to this coun-try I called on him for treatment , and he spoke at length on the delights of his visit . And then , in the middle of a =filling operation , he uttered a remark which , for the moment , almost made my lead reel . " What / like about Engand , " he said , " is that people stay in heir own class in that country . " When I had recovered from my asonishruent I observed that such a renark falling from the lips of an Amerisn was nothing but pure blasphemy and hat he , consequently , was a blasphemer o , ainst one of the cardinal social doc-rincs of his country . He replied that he universal American habit of straining o " get ahead of the Joneses " entailed ( forts of a nature which made the game y no means worth the candle and that ne of these days people would realize it , nd the sooner the better .

That , they will stay in the class in which Ley happen to be born and cultivate renity and a competence instead of the ampetitive spirit and a nervous breakywn . " I believe that I am voicing the silent pinion of countless thousands of women den I say that they are the chief vietims of the abuse of the competitive spirit in men . Such a statement may sound paradoxical , since it is the competitive spirit in men which has given women diamonds and pearls , luxury and idleness . But the competitive spirit does not lead a man to give himself . Diamonds and luxury are , in most cases , nothing much more than makeshifts that women demand from men as partial compensation for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , his time , himself as a man and not merely as a successful producer of wealth . The competitive male is ruining not only intimate , but also social life , both of which have always been considered hitherto the special provinces of women . Something of the bitterness of this sense of lack was recently expressed to me by a woman friend who had just decided to separate from her husband . " You ask me what I complain of ? " she said . " You say that my husband is highly successful and very generous to me . I say that he is highly unsuccessful and the very reverse of generous . " I asked her to explain her meaning , which was by no means obvious . " My husband is highly unsuccessful , " she said , " because he has failed in the field in which it is most important that every man and woman should succeed ? that is , as an ordinary social human being . To put the matter bluntly , he is a brilliant success as a merchant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous to me with his money and incredibly stingy with his company . But even if he were to turn over a new leaf and offer me a little more of his society , I should refuse a reconciliation , for his companionship is no longer worth having . He has been ruined by his ghastly abuse of the modern competitive spirit . " And then she proceeded to tell me that , in the first place , her husband had nothing to say ? that is , nothing to say as an ordinary social human male , although he had an immense amount to say in his capacity of merchant . " I am willing to talk merchandise in the Fifth Avenue stores , " was her comment , " but I am not prepared to do so every evening at dinner or between the acts of the play . " Furthermore , he had little but contempt for all the personal graces that were valuable only because they were personal graces . These , my unfortunate friend assured me , he despised because they did not " get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From now on I intend to do things that wo n't get me anywhere ? at least , as judged from my husband 's standpoint ? and 1 intend to cultivate the society of none but those who are resolutely determined to go nowhere , although I suppose that this will make my circle dreadfully restricted . But then , I have always preferred quality to quantity . Anyhow , I 've had twelve years of existence ? I wo n't call it life ? with a ' go-getter . ' Now I 'm going to live among people who have nothing whatever to sell , and least of all themselves . " This is one case , and it contains the elements of tragedy . I have another friend whose case against the competitive male almost evokes a smile . She was engaged to be married to a man in his late thirties who was intent on his business and on very little besides . One night he called to pay his addresses to his fiancee . He carried under his arm , not candy or a gift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how I 'm coming out this month , " he said , as he spread his books on the table . " I 'd be very much obliged to you if you 'd lend me a hand with the figures . " He explained what he wished done with thebooks , and my friend spent the whole evening in doing sums for him , so that he might gratify his curiosity to see how he was " coming out " that month . The following morning she wrote and broke off their engagement . " Did you explain the reason ? " I asked when she told me of the incident . " No , " was the reply , " he would not have been capable of understanding it . " II I think that it is precisely this convic tion of the utter lack of understanding o women on the part of the highly competi tive male which most dismays th , modern woman . Over and over again have I heard complaints of his obtuse ness concerning the inner needs any longings of intelligent women as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter and amusements . These last he under stands , for they are material ; but th desire for a community of interests , fc intellectual comradeship , for some fair recognition of the fact that a woman hr a soul as well as a body and can not in happiness by bread alone is , so the say , incomprehensible to his busines , ridden mind . Some of my friends spec of this void in their lives with tears i their voices ; others have become has ened and satirical . One friend , a college graduate unusual intelligence , has been marrie for about nine years to a highly succes ful business man whose aggressive competitive spirit is an object of vener tion to a large circle of men in his natii city . She has told me that , frustrate in her longing for companionship wir her husband , she now derives some re amusement from a close objective stir ( of his intimates . These she divides in the owls and the eagles . The owls , says , are those men who have " arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin competitors , made fortunes , and ha taken on that owlish cast of countenan which she declares to be the hall-mark the successful , competitive , ignorar and wholly self-satisfied , middle-aged business man . The eagles are those men who , with hard mouths , grim eyes , and shoulders thrown well back , face the world determined to soar and soar still higher , shrilly screaming their wares as they mount and tearing to pieces all competitors whom they encounter in their flight upwards . " You should see them at a dinner party , " she said to me not long ago . " They are not exactly what you might call oil paintings . Is n't it strange to see what a terrible effect competition has on the faces of men ? But if the eagles are ugly , I do n't know how to describe the owls . " And then she added , " My husband has ceased to be an eagle . He has become an owl at a comparatively early age . You see , he is extra competitive and is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he chooses to consider success . " ( Again that intimation that the conception of a successful man is one thing in the mind of the competitive male and something very different in the mind of an intelligent woman . ) But unfortunately all women have not the sense of humor of this light-hearted Friend . They take their disappointment leeply to heart ; and their husbands , . mmersed in affairs , pathetically igno.ant of the real nature of women and , ndeed , hardly even interested in it , go ; heir way , condemning their wives to a ife of solitude that is none the less real ) ecause it is not physical . " Once , when I was young , " said one woman to ne , " I had enthusiasms and a score of nterests . But I suppose I was not one 4 the strong-minded sort . I had to lave someone to share them with if ley were to he kept alive . I loved : ym phony concerts , I loved the plays of ; hakespeare , I loved reading history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things loved my husband just looked at mend grunted . It is many years now ince we have exchanged any conversaion other than on formal commondaces . But he is satisfied ; he is getting head in the world . " III Now , the competitive spirit is particularly strong in the United States and the divorce rate is particularly high . Is there any relation between the two ? Has the intensity of the determination of the average American male to forge ahead , to crash through all barriers to self-advancement , to beat all competitors in the race upward and onward any connection with the startling readiness of American women to get rid of their husbands ? I believe that it has . Up to very recent times the ordinary man thought that he had acquitted himself well towards his wife if he provided for her with liberality . Perhaps , indeed , it would be more accurate to say that he considered he had done well by his wife if he had just provided sufficiently for her . And , no doubt , his idea of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to her by which she could procure better provision than by marriage . In a word , marriage , until recently , meant for a woman protection and economic safety , two conditions of such immense value that wives might well be content to leave well enough alone and not demand much more than these strictly material benefits from their husbands . But today women are able to provide for themselves . NoL only does the average intelligent and well-educated woman manage to gain a bare livelihood , but she frequently succeeds in gaining a very good livelihood indeed . The fact has ceased to be a phenomenon and has become a commonplace . Naturally , such a condition of affairs must have and does have repercussions on the married state . Put bluntly , the old inducement of economic safety as one of the most attractive features of marriage for a woman is no longer enough . She , too , has become a competitor in the economic race , although only a puny one in comparison with men competitors . But at all events , she is holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducements to change her status as a woman . The old inducement which men dangled before her fascinated gaze , except in the ease of an unusually wealthy man and an abnormally mercenary woman , has lost much of its glamour for the simple reason that economic safety for women is no longer the special perquisite of marriage . Consequently , some other inducement must be offered to take the place of the decreased prestige of the economic inducement . Without question , the inducement which the average intelligent and wellbred woman would prefer is that of a high degree of personal attractiveness in an aspiring suitor . By personal attractiveness I do not mean , of course , a merely handsome face , since women are notoriously far less moved by looks in a man than men are by looks in a woman . But I do mean a general attractiveness of personality that commands first the interest , then the respect , and finally the devotion of women . These foregoing remarks on the economic position of women and on attractiveness in marriage suitors may seem a digression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ahead of the Joneses . " But as a matter of fact they are strictly relevant . For the point to which I wish to lead is the fact that the competitive spirit , when highly developed , kills the quality which the modern self-supporting woman demands as a compensation for the much diminished prestige of matrimonial economic safety . In other words , the highly competitive male is entirely lacking in personal attractiveness since the competitive spirit and personal attractiveness are mutually destructive . In the eyes of women he is , indeed , a horror , and the sooner he knows it the better . It does not require any very great amount of imagination or audacity to argue that the prevailing discontent of women with the type of man produced by the modern spirit of competition actsas a persistent irritant applied to the present situation of marriage . But unfortunately the wide prevalence of the type , and its real virulence , are producing social results that do not stop short at any possible effect on the divorce rate . One of these is the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mental capacities . A good deal has been heard lately of the overcrowding of the universities ? particularly of the Western universities ? by young men , a very large number of whom can not possibly benefit by the education offered , so great is th ( discrepancy between their natural menta capacities and the intellectual standar &; of the colleges . The discussion of thi : problem is , however , the task of th ( specialist and will not be touched of here ; but the results arising from th , determination of large numbers o young men to engage in callings and pro fessions far beyond their capacities are matter of more or less public interest . Much has been said about the recen assertion of Mr. Herbert L. Fordharr late of the Bar Association , to the effec that eighty-five per cent of the ner lawyers are unqualified for their prc fession . They are , he said , ignorant crude and generally unfit . Mr. Alla Fox , a member of the Committee o Character and Fitness , supported th statement by saying ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton was about the only figure in Amer can history whom the majority of tE candidates could identify , and that mo of them knew nothing of English literf ture or history . " Asked whether the had ever read any biography , some them this fall have been answerin , Yes , The Private Life of Helen , of Tray . ' Mr. Fox went on to say that anoth , problem vexing the Character Commi tee was the increase in the number girl typists gaining admission to tl bar , most of whom " clearly can nev become competent lawyers . " This example is an admirable " Joncses , " and to wear the simple clothes that her social and financial position should , but does not , dictate . The results of her strivings to keep up with the " Joneses " occasionally lead to ludicrous contretemps . A friend of mine told me that in her small native town in the north of New York State the banker 's wife was the social leader , and whatever she wore was accepted not only as the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day this lady returned home from New York and appeared at a social gathering dressed in a new black satin dress . At the next social affair in the town every woman present was wearing a new black satin dress , the quality of the satin being graded according to the financial status of the respective husbands . One woman , whose rivalry with the banker 's wife was specially hitter , went one better than that lady by generously plastering her new black satin frock with masses of cheap iridescent passementerie , and on that account ( so gossip related ) claimed the victor 's laurels in the contest . Such is the competitive spirit ! IV I often . wonder how our " success " experts explain the towering personalities and marvellous performances of men who lived and died in the days of inherited social status , when success " authorities " were not , and no one dreamed of spending his life in an attempt to beat his fellows in a race to a higher social class than his own . Yet men did rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obscurity for power . Shakespeare was the son of a poor small-town tradesman ; Cardinal Wolsey was the son of a butcher in Ipswich , in the cast of England ; Napoleon Bonaparte was the poverty-stricken son of a petty Corsican lawyer ; Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the son of a poor watchmaker of Geneva ; Voltaire , the friend of a king and the admired of princes , was the son of a notary ; Lord Nelson came of a family which was neither rich nor powerful . And these examples might be multiplied a hundredfold . Yet such men came to the front at a time when the competitive spirit was unknown , or at any rate unknown in its present sense , and when social status was accepted as an inherited condition How did they do it ? They were quite without " success ' authorities or " efficiency " experts They had never been taught from their infancy upward that only the sky wa the limit of their ambitions . Excep Napoleon , none of these men had an : snobbish cravings to soar to classes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I once asked a pushing , one third educated young man whom knew if he really believed what he sai ' when he assured me that modern Amet ica could , at need , produce at leas forty to fifty Napoleons . " Why not ? he replied . " If the eighteenth centur with all its antiquated ideas , rundow methods , and total absence of correc and scientific instruction in efficienc could produce one Napoleon , it stands t reason that this country , which has n antiquated ideas or rundown , method and which abounds in correct an scientific instruction in efficiency , shout and could produce something like fifty I then asked him if he did not belies that Napoleon was an exceptional at very special type of man . " There a no exceptional or special types of men he answered curtly . " There are on determination and scientific methods efficiency . " Thinking to corner him , asked him if he believed that " As lir ( Like It " was written by determinath and correct methods of efficiency . thought we were speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time curt than ever . Is there , then , no way in which t fantastic ambitions of the modern " getter " may be curbed , since I suppc it is too much to expect that they can stifled altogether ? Do we not ha sufficient warning that one pays I price for the proud possession of the competitive spirit ? Have there not been of late a number of suicides in the colleges ? Is not insanity on the increase ? Do not the newspapers constantly report that another vice-president has dropped dead on the subway platform ? Yet our " go-getters " continue to multiply . They have encouraged mediocrity ; they have soured and sharpened social life from top to bottom ; and with their money-sodden minds and those annihilating personalities of which they are so inordinately proud they have rendered themselves obnoxious to any woman outside the ranks of the " gold-diggers . " I say little about the competitive spirit in women , because they have so little of it in comparison with men , and the little they have is paltry in quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine characteristics which men have seized on as evidence of the inferiority of the female sex . It seems clear to me that the whole blame for the social blight produced by an abuse of competitiveness must be laid at the door of the male sex . I confess that I look back with regret it the days of inherited status and corn-. ) aratively limited horizons . Just think ) f life without the " Joneses " ! Forthese detestable " Joneses " arc a modern , and more particularly an American bugbear . Our ancestors in the old countries lived and had their being untouched by their influence ; and we have only to study the chronicles , memoirs , and intimate records of other days to realize that they were lighter-hearted , more joyous men and women than ourselves . But since those days the " Joneses " have spawned and multiplied incredibly and most of us are under their domination in a greater or lesser degree . And with the increasing influence of this family has come the decreasing agreeableness of social life . Taine , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aneien R ? gime , asks the reason of its peculiar charm . And he answers his own question with the verdict that " there was no laborious , forced work in those days , no furious competition , no uncertain careers , no infinite perspectives . Ranks were clearly defined , ambitions limited , and there was less envy . Man was not habitually dissatisfied , soured and preoccupied as he is to-day . " This state of affairs is not progress according to the " go-getters . " But what is progress ? Some of us are beginning to be as puzzled about its nature as Pontius Pilate was about the nature of truth . tiftNilfdwzr. : PASSION A STORY BY SANDRA ALEXANDER I T WAS quite late , five minutes to ten , to be exact , and but few guests of the Hotel Lille et D'Albion remained at breakfast . The many windows of the salle a manger were sealed right against a deceptive radiance of April sunlight . Golden notes , escaping the heavy mesh of the curtains , embraced the black-clad legs of Robert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tables . There was a fine fragrance of coffee , and the barmy smell of freshly baked bread permeated every nook and corner of the room . The whole atmosphere was redolent of serenity and the warmth of well-being . Robert was bringing in the steaming pot of chocolate , the pats of fresh butter , and the pile of crescent rolls ordered by his patron , Mr. Reginald Demming . Robert wished to please Mr. Demming and , with an eye to the huge disc of a clock above the doorway , he revolved around the little table , arranging and rearranging the breakfast equipment in still more tasteful patterns . The chocolate here , with a fold of napkin about the pot to preserve the temperature of the stove it had just left , an infinitesimal push to the stiff glass container with its three daffodils , so . ..

" Mr. Demming rubbed his hands together and glanced in a leisurely fashion around the room before turning his attention to the cup Robert was filling . " Vairy nice morning , sair ! " " Yes , " said Mr. Demming , but it was evident that his attention was elsewhere . Robert watched him anxiously as he lifted the burdened spoon to his mouth and critically sampled the contents of the cup . " Bien , " thought Robert . . . . Both he and Mr. Demming visibly relaxed . A moment more and the rolls and butter had passed inspection . Mr. Demming 's jaws were moving with the stately unction that denoted a mind pleasantly at ease . So different , thought Robert , from the rest of those canaille , his countrymen , who know nothing of food and only take notice when the chocolate is too hot for them to swallow in a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not in a hurry , they were artistes who never knew what they wen eating ! Those Ant ? ricains I What t people ! But M'sieu Demmin ' , now . . Ah , that was a so different matter ! H. knew what he consumed .
