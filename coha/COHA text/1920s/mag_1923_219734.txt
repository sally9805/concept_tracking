The Supreme Court Has Aroused Resentment In deciding that the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Law is unconstitutional , the Supreme Court has subjected itself to criticism on two grounds . <P> The Court has reiterated the opinion that labor is a commodity , and may be disposed of like any other goods . Such an opinion , however , seems to laymen , and even to lawyers , almost a repudiation of the views expressed in Muller against Oregon , in which it was held that a law regulating the hours of employment of women was valid , and in Bunting against Oregon , in which the Court approved a statute providing for payment for overtime at the rate of time and one-half of the regular wage . As the dissenting Justices argued , if the amount of a commodity to be disposed of can be limited in the interest of public health and welfare , why can not the minimum price to be paid therefor be similarly restricted ? <P> The second ground for criticism is that Mr. Justice Sutherland appears to have argued in syllogisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not calculated to convince those in whose interest the law was passed that he had in mind what questions were involved . The opinion suggests too strongly that in the famous case of Lochner against New York , decided in 1905 , in which the Court held that a law prohibiting more than a 60-hour week in a bakery was unconstitutional . <P> The decision in the minimum wage case has most dangerous possibilities . Any amendment which would provide for the true contingencies on the theory that the Supreme Court will be a reactionary body would probably strike at the foundations of the constitution . Resort is therefore being had to the suggestion that the power of the Supreme Court to declare statutes unconstitutional be limited , and there is danger of an ill-advised attempt to obtain a constitutional amendment providing for such a limitation . <P> Some newspapers have intimated that the decision , which related to a District of Columbia statute passed by Congress , would not be considered binding in the event that a state law came before the Court . The power of Congress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Fourteenth , but they are substantially identical in providing for the liberty of contract , and there is little reason to anticipate that any state law will receive more favorable consideration . <P> ( For the reaction of the general public to the Minimum Wage decision see pages 2 and 3. )
