txt A Tribute to Our Town Hall . On the eve of sailing for Europe , I feel I ought to pay my small tribute to one of the most stimulating and constructive institutions in this city , the New York Town Hall . Here in the centre of the world 's greatest city is a public forum , which , with the interpretative criticism that distinguishes its platforms . whether of Europe or the United States , offers what really amounts to an advanced adult education . The value of such an Institution is immense , culturally and otherwise . and it seems to the writer , with an experience of platforms throughout the world , that Stich a cultural medium should be endowed . More and more European attention is being focused upon the New York Town Hall as the nucleus of much that is best in today 's America . SHAW DESMOND . New York . Feb. 3 , 1926.
