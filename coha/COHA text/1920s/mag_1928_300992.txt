Recently carping , scandal-mongering Afghans have been conducting a whispering campaign against their Europeanized King Amanullah . <P> They whispered that the King 's recent European trip ( TIME , Jan. 23-June 4 ) had been a ruinous , reckless extravagance , and that the Treasury 's coffers are nigh to emptiness . <P> Last week , King Amanullah put abrupt end to such rumors . Pridefully he pointed out that his European trip had cost $75,000 , but that the gifts he received were worth $22,500,000 . <P> Observers recalled that in Paris , London and Berlin King Amanullah purchased lavishly on his Royal credit and then sent the bills to the Governments whose guest he was . Since Afghanistan is a land of promising markets for European goods , the bills were paid .
