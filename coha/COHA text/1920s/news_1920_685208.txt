txt I am informed that Premier Millerand is determined to force Premier Lloyd George to a show-down at the San Remo Interallied Conference , which begins on April 19 . The future of the Entente is thus thrown into the balance , for unless the French Premier on the One hand or the British Premier on the other backs down a diplomatic split between the French and British Governments may result . This is true because despite the reassurance of official utterances tending - to smooth over the situation , there exists between the two Governments a fundamental difference of attitude toward the Versailles Treaty . This rock bottom divergence of conceptions of the proper attitude of her conquerors toward Germany conies to the surface in the difference of doctrine as to the enforcement of the treaty . England demands that all treaty enforcement shall be carried out by the Allies together , and declares that under any other system she will withdraw from participation in the allied machinery for treaty enforcement . France , or . the other hand , while wishing the support that the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands the right to act alone in the protection of what she regards as her particular and vital interests in any case where the Allies do not give their aid . This is what happened in the Rhine situation . Germany , technically at least , violated the clauses of the treaty France regarded as essential to the maintenance of her safety . The Allies refused to join with France in acting , so France acted alone in occupying Frankfort and four other German cities . France Keeps a Free Hand . England demanded in a note delivered yesterday that France agree not to act alone and to act only in accord with her allies , or else the British Ambassador would retire from the Committee of Ambassadors , with all that step involved . France replies today that she will always seek an agreement of her allies " before acting . " Thus she maintains her right to act independently when she believes it justified . There are the surface indications of the fundamental differences of France and England toward the treaty and toward Germany . England believes the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet again even at the expense of mitigating the treaty . France does not admit that Germany is regenerate and sees across the Rhine her hereditary enemy with revenge in her heart , and France is determined to act on her theory that the victory of the Allies gave the French a right to insure that Germany shall not be able to attack her again for a long time to come . I have emphasized in recent dispatches that the Ruhr-Frankfort situation is but one step in the development of France 's policy and consequently in accentuating the divergence of the French and British official views . Other steps will be taken and other differences will arise as long as the two Governments pursue the policies based on the diverging doctrines . It may be predicted that the Rhine situation of today will smooth itself out . But Millerand intends at San Remo to bring up the question of German disarmament and force Lloyd George into the open as to what policy he will pursue . For Lloyd George , the French declare , believes the disarming of Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard and let it rust , while France believes the disarming of Germany consists of taking the rifle away . France is determined to get the rifle even If she has to get it alone . France feels she is not standing alone . Belgium has taken her place by France 's side , and today the Japanese Ambassa- dor notified the Foreign Office his  --  Government approved of France 's action . Italy stands with England , although no official communication has been received from . Rome . But what has especially bolstered French officialdom is a message from Ambassador Jusserand in Washington , saying the State Department is sending a note , which is far different in tone from that of Great Britain , and while not openly approving France 's . action on the Rhine , leaves the way open for France to prove her case . While Lloyd George is doubtless sincere , Millerand is no. less sincere . Millerand can not back ? ' down . and remain ' Premier . Ile has committed himself and the Chamber will hold him to account , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nate he has Just sent to London , and he has been notified he must anew outline his German policy before the Chamber next week before he goes to San Remo . Unless he stands fast , Briand and other leaders of the Chamber will not give him a vote of confidence . Reply to British Note . Millerand 's note , which was handed to Lord Derby last night . and delivered in London today ; ? reviews events Wading up to the occupation of Frankfort . It says that France acted in response to a treaty violation admitted by Germany after France had refused to agree to Germany 's sending troops into the Ruhr without any guarantee other that the German promise to get out . Then the note says : " How could the French Government be content with the promises of Germany to wthdraw her troops as soon as the Reichswehr had re-established order ? Neither in the matter of reparations nor in the handing over of the guilty , or the supplying of coal or disarmament of the land forces have the Allies received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Government well considered all the danger from these excessive and systematic violations . At what moment does it believe that it ought to call a halt in making concessions ? France in any case is today obliged to say " enough . ' ' She does not ask more than to say it with the Allies . The French Government is not less convinced than the English Government of the essential necessity of maintaining the unity of the Allies in application of the treaty with Germany . This intimate concert of France and of England appears to be indispensable also for the equitable solution of the vast problems which ar3 pending in Russia and the Balkans , aa% in Asia Minor and throughout Islam . " The note terminates with assurance that the French Government " taking into consideration these conditions , declares itself quite disposed to assure itself before acting of the assent of the Allies in all interallied questions which bear upon the execution of the treaty . " It can he seen that this does not constitute a full acceptance of the demand in the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accord with the Allies . There is always the reservation of France 's right to act alone if she thinks it essential to her protection . Germany Asks More Time . The French Government last night received a note from Germany asking that the time in which she is allowed to keep twenty battalions in the neutral zone be extended from ** to July 10 . The German Government points out that owing to the recent disturbances the Ruhr district'cannot be left without any armed force at the present time . Otherwise the armed workers would again take control . It says that by July 10 bodies can be formed which will then permit the withdrawal of the Reichswehr . The ** Government has also asked for delay after April 10 to reduce its army to 200,000 . This matter will not be settled until the San Remo conference , in all probability , but the two notes show that the disarmament ques- : Lion is an urgent one , and Germany is not hastening to comply with the disarmament clauses of the treaty as France demands . The Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that France wishes to maintain the alliance , but insists on a yes or no answer to the question of whether she can depend on England to help enforce the treaty . This , says the Journal , is what must be explained at San Remo . ? The Intransigeant makes an appeal to the British people ; to disavow the note of ' Lloyd George . It . ays : ? " Let the two peoples , British and French , strengthen their bonds , for there is but one alternative  --  to be allies or to be again in danger from 70,000,000 Germans . This great reality will hold us together , and if Germany has two cents ' world of common sense she will see it . " It is announced here today that the Allied ? Council at London had finished its work , and that the French members had been Ordered to return to Paris . On the other hand Lord Derby does not know whether he should continue to attend meetings of the Committee of Ambassadors . He Will probably get instructions before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered the election of Deschanel and the nomination of Millerand as Premier , andwho is a big power in the French ChaMber , continues in his paper L'Eclair , to call on Millerand to stand firm and to attack Lloyd George . L'Eclair says today : " Lloyd George has once more tried to satisfy his Liberal and Socialist adversaries , who are incurably pro-German . Having recently spoken as a statesman or almost , he got homesick for his native demagogy and came back at a gallop and we pay the cost of his excursion . " Lloyd George , approved by the parties a the Extreme Left , will also give satisfaction to the business men of England , whose gluttony is frightful . He thinks he has in this way consolidated his power . But in his eternal somersaults the British Premier will some day break his neck to the applause of all those whom he has derided . " L'Eclair ends by hoping Lloyd George will get beaten at the next British elections . The French Press in its comment shows surprise that the French Government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of German cities in the Rhineland . The Echo de Paris prints an interview with Premier Millerand in which he stated that he expected a new note ! rom London . " As soon ns it is received , " the Pre-flier is quoted as having said , " It is ny intention to call a meeting of Parlament and inform it of the situation . President Deschanel will return to Paris ' rorn the Riviera on Monday. ? If the rezponse from London arrives that day I sill make my declaration to Parliament the same afternoon . " Millerand Defends Ills Polley . PARIS , April 10 ( Associated Press ) . Premier Millerand , speaking to The As . iociated Press today , said : " France 's position is absolutely aim ) le . We were in the presence of a series if German violations of the treaty , the ast of which affects precisely those irticles of the teaty which were covered ) y the French-British-American agreement , under which England and America were to come to our assistance . " I enumerated to the French Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed under the treaty , refusal to surrender those tuilty of atrocities , failure to comply with-the terms of the . articles on reparaIons and refusal to disarm . I said then that France could not always accept ? assiVely violations of ' the treaty . " The German Government asked permission to send troops into the Ruhr . Why ? Because they knew that the lending of troops into that  --  region was ' orbidden by the treaty . We refused : o give that permission . ' Nevertheless , . he German Government ordered troops into the Ruhr . The only thing possible ! or us to do was immediately to occupy rrankfort and the other German cities . " We had given notice to our allies hat we intended to do so , and they had lot objected . Our information was abtolutely clear and authoritative that the ; ending of troops into the Ruhr was lot necessary in the interest of public irder . ' They were being sent there simAy as an infraction of the treaty . " France 's position is quite different rom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germany and ye feel the danger of our position in a way in which America could not fee it . Why hag Belgium taken an identics Position with France ? Because the Bel Irian people are in the same dangerou situation . They are living next door t Germany and are obliged to protec themselVes .
