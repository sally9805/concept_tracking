txt // beam passing through it when the received current is strong ( indicating a brilliantly illuminated section of the scene at the transmitter ) , and only a very small portion of it , or none at all , when the received current is weak , or nil . When no current is passing through the suspension loop of mirror , P , the narrow beam of light reflected from the mirror is projected close to the diaphragm aperture , E , but no light passes through it . As soon as a current flows , causing a deflection of the mirror , some of the light beam passes through the aperture and falls on to the second oscillograph mirror , D. This mirror , through the agency of the tuning fork phonic wheel combination , and a Soo-cycle alternating current , vibrates iii exactly the same manner , and in step with its counterpart at the transmitter . Thus , by means of the reflected light falling upon the vibrating mirror and being reflected on to the screen , T , the picture is reproduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television could not be achieved , due , partly , to the unsuitability of the selenium cell as a means of converting light into electricity ; but principally to the fact that the optical system is incorrect . Mihaly describes his oscillograph mirror as being " a thin flat mirror . " Referring to Fig. 4 , // if the mirror , D , has a plane surface , no image will be reflected on to the screen , E , but only a blur . The difficulty of the light-sensitive device has been the stumbling block over which , until recently , all television experimenters have tripped , and in the next chapter we shall devote some space to a consideration of lightsensitive devices in general . CHAPTER IV LIGHT-SENSITIVE DEVICES IT will be interesting , at this stage , to consider the principal barrier which has prevented so many television schemes from achieving success . The vast amount of research work which has been done in this field can only be appreciated by those who have made an intimate study of the subject ; and it seems at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to he comparatively simple , should have proved so infinitely baffling in practice . We have seen , in the preceding chapters , that one of the most vital factors in all television schemes is the light-sensit ive cell , whose duty it is to transform light impulses into electrical impulses . All light-sensitive devices depend for their action upon what is known as the " photoelectric phenomenon . " This phenomenon has been subdivided into two distinct types , photo-conductivity and photo-emissivity . The first of these was originally discovered , 32 // as described in Chapter II , by a telegraph operator , who noticed that when sunlight fell on some resistances made of the metal selenium , the needle of his instrument moved . This discovery led to a detailed investigation of the phenomenon by the leading scientists of the day , notably Willoughby Smith , with the result that the fact was established that so long as selenium is kept in darkness its resistance to electricity is extremely high . As soon as it is exposed to light , however , its resistance drops very considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of selenium as a means of transforming light into electricity , and for this purpose special devices , known as selenium cells , were constructed , the usual method of manufacture being as follows . Two wires , spaced about ? 5 mm. apart , are wound simultaneously over a flat piece of insulating material . These wires do not make contact with each other at any point . A coating of amorphous selenium is then spread over the wires , filling the spaces between them , and a heat treatment is then applied which has the effect of turning the selenium into the grey crystalline form which has been found to be most sensitive to light variations . The method of construction is shown in Fig. 7. // An average cell made up in this manner has an electrical resistance ( between the ends of the two wires over and between which the selenium is spread and baked ) of between 6o,000 and zoo , 000 ohms . By illuminating the cell with a 16-c.p. incandescent lamp placed at a distance of z metre , its resistance drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resistance of the cell when it is in darkness . The theory of the action of a selenium cell , or any other cell belonging to the photo-conductivity class , is that electrons are liberated from the molecules within the substance by the action of light , and these electrons are recombined again when the cell is no longer exposed to light . These processes , especially that of recombination , take a // certain definite time to occur , thus giving rise to the well-known time-lag of the selenium cell . It is this time-lag which makes the selenium cell totally unsuitable for television purposes , for in television , a light-sensitive device is required which will respond instantaneously to the light impulses which fall upon it . As will be seen later , these impulses fall on the cell at the rate of many thousands per second , and such speeds are hopelessly beyond the ability of selenium to respond to . Apart from selenium , a number of other metals exhibit the property of photo-conductivity , notably thalium sulphide , which is the substance used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its properties to the selenium cell , but is said to be more constant and reliable in operation . The phenomenon of photo-emissivity was first discovered in 1888 by Hertz , who found that when light fell upon a spark gap the electric discharge passed more readily , i.e. the resistance of the gap was reduced . This effect was investigated by another German scientist named Hallwach , who discovered that the effect was located at the negative pole of the spark gap . Further investigations by subsequent workers disclosed the fact that all metals , under the influence of light , emit electrons , but the effect is more pronounced in the case of // metals belonging to the so-called alkali group , such as rubidium , potassium , and sodium . By making use of this effect a new type of light-sensitive cell , known as the photoelectric cell , was developed . This type of cell consists essentially of a plate of one of the three metals mentioned above , enclosed in a high vacuum and connected to the negative pole of a battery or other source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cell , the anode consisting of a loop of wire or wire gauze facing the cathode . The potential used to operate the cell is usually of the order of 200 volts . In some cases , where the containing bulb of the cell is filled with a gas at low pressure , the potential used should not be great enough to cause a glow discharge . In the case of a cell filled with neon gas , this optimum potential is of the order of about 175 volts . Besides neon , helium has also been used , and a rubidium cell in an atmosphere of helium is a common combination . Potassium and helium is also a popular arrangement , and gives one of the most sensitive forms of cell . A common circuit arrangement for use in conjunction with a photoelectric cell is given in Fig. 8 . Photoelectric cells are chiefly sensitive to light rays belonging to the violet end of the spectrum , and are almost totally insensitive // to red or other rays at the lower end of the spectrum . Selenium cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red rays , and insensitive to rays belonging to the upper end of the spectrum . The selenium cell gives a vastly greater current output under the influence of light than any form of photoelectric cell . Whereas the latter , when illuminated , will give a current of only a few microamperes , the ordinary selenium cell will give a current // which can be measured in milliamperes . Special large selenium cells have actually been constructed which will pass a current of z ampere , such enormous cells being used in the Cox Selenium Relay , employed in cable work . Photoelectric cells , as already mentioned , depend for their action upon photo-emissivity . That is to say , under the action of light the cathode emits electrons . Since the velocity of electrons is of the same order as that of light , i.e. about i86,000 miles per second , it follows that the response of the photoelectric cell will be , to all intents and purposes , instantaneous . This proves to be the case , so that it would appear , at first glance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand , and many workers seized upon it with avidity as a solution to their difficulties in connection with light-sensitive devices . They were doomed to disappointment , however , for , as previously stated , the output of a photoelectric cell is of the order to a few microamperes only . Attempts have been made to amplify the output to the required extent by means of thermionic valve amplifiers , but the degree of amplification necessary to achieve results in television is so great that even modern amplifiers can not satisfactorily attain it . Valve amplification can only be pushed to a certain limit , beyond which difficulties // appear in the shape of parasitic noises due to battery irregularities , irregularities in electron emission from valve filaments , etc . These parasitic irregularities , which can he heard as noises if listened to , take the visible form , in television , of white spots , lines , and bars , occurring with such frequency on the receiving screen as to mar or totally obscure the received image . In an effort to overcome the low output handicap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Research Department of the Westinghouse Electric Co. , devised an in teresting form of cell which incorporates within the same glass bulb the elements of a three-electrode valve . The lower portion of the bulb contains the valve elements , whilst the upper half , which is screened from the valve portion by a light-tight partition , contains the photoelectric cell . The light-sensitive substance used in the cell is potassium hydroxide , and this is spread in the form of a coating over one inner side of the upper part of the glass bulb . The valve filament is of the oxide-coated variety , which operates without perceptible glow . By using such a filament , no unwanted light from this source can reach the light-sensitive coating of the cell . With this arrangement , using a hard valve , Zworykin claims to be able to obtain an out- // put of i milliampere . For higher outputs a type of 4-electrode valve is used , using the first grid as an anode with a low potential of the order of about 3o volts positive . The second grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive potential of the order of 15o volts impressed upon it . By a proper choice of spacing between electrodes , and grid mesh , it is possible to obtain a good relationship between the degree of illumination and current output within certain limits . It is claimed that a continuous current output of 5 milliamperes has been obtained with the 4-electrode valve combination , the limiting factor being the heat developed within the photoelectric cell . Since alkali metals are highly volatile , overheating of the cell causes distillation of the metallic coating , which condenses upon the transparent glass and insulating parts . It was stated , however , when this development was first made public , that this difficulty can be remedied to a great extent by improved construction . Other devices which might be classed as light-sensitive devices are the bolometer and the thermopile . These are not sensitive to light , as such , but register any rise in temperature due to it ; and light , such as sunlight , may be detected by the rise in temperature caused when it falls upon such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very thin metal foil , usually platinum . When this strip is subjected to heat its resistance increases , so that if it is connected in series with a sensitive galvanometer the deflection of the latter gives a measure of the temperature rise , and , consequently , of the intensity of the light which gave rise to the temperature increase . The thermopile takes advantage of the fact that if two different metals are placed in contact , and the junction is heated , a small electric current is generated , the voltage depending upon the temperature of the junction . This device may be used indirectly to measure light intensity in the same manner as the bolometer , but neither form of instrument is sensitive enough to render it suitable for television purposes , and both are far too slow in their response . Summing up , we find that selenium , while sensitive enough for television purposes , is far too slow in its response . The photoelectric cell , on the other hand , is practically instantaneous in its response , but it is lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many workers succeeded in transmitting shadowgraphs , or silhouettes of objects placed before the transmitter . In this case the question of the sensitivity of the cell is not of such importance , for it can be directly // illuminated by a beam of light which may be as strong as we care to make it . As the object the shadowgraph of which is to be transmitted is interposed between the source of light and the photoelectric cell , all the latter has to do is to distinguish between a strong direct light and a dark shadow . When transmitting shadowgraphs the illumination of the cell by the light source is direct ; in television it is indirect . That is to say , when true television is to be accomplished , the source of light must be arranged to shine directly on to the object to be transmitted . Then the amount of light which reaches the photoelectric cell is that which is reflected back from the object on to the cell . To those unacquainted with the subject there may not appear to be any particular significance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be realised when it is explained that the total amount of light reflected from an object such as the human face , when it is illuminated by lamps of a thousand candle power , is less than that of a single candle . Furthermore , owing to the image-scanning process which occurs in television , whereby the image is subdivided into thousands of tiny pieces , or elements , only an infinitesimal fraction of this already very small amount of light reaches the cell at any given instant . CHAPTER V THE TELEVISION EXPERIMENTS OF MM . BELIN AND HOLWECK IN FRANCE , AND MESSRS . JENKINS AND MOORE IN AMERICA IN recent times the problem of television has been taken up seriously by Mr. J. L. Baird in this country , MM . Belin and Holweck in France , Mr. C. Francis Jenkins in America , and , more recently still , by the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co . It is proposed to devote this chapter to an account of the work done by Messrs . Belin and Jenkins . M. Belin ( whose name is well known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holweck , of the Radium Institute , Paris , has , it is stated , succeeded recently in sending shadows of simple objects . A diagrammatic outline of the apparatus used is given in Fig. 9 , from which it will be seen that the arrangement of the transmitter is not unlike that of other systems . Essentially the transmitter consists of two little vibrating mirrors , E and F , one placed above the other . The lower mirror , E , of very narrow width , oscillates vertically at 43 // a frequency of 500 cycles per second . The upper mirror , which is somewhat larger , oscillates horizontally at about zo vibrations per second . A beam of light from the arc lamp , A , passes through the system of lenses , B , the aperture in the diaphragm , C , the lens , D , and impinges upon the lower vibrating mirror , E. From this mirror the beam , oscillating vertically 500 times per second , is reflected on to the top mirror , F , which is vibrating horizontally zo times per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror there is reflected a beam of light oscillating at two different frequencies , the planes of the two sets of oscillations being at right angles to one another . If this beam were now projected upon a screen , the Soo-cycle oscillation would cause it to traverse the screen continuously from right to left and back again from left to right ; but as the beam is at the same time under the control of the ro-cycle oscillation , the 500-cycle lines , instead of being traced one on top of the other , will be drawn one below the other , as the zo-cycle oscillation steadily moves the beam in a downward direction . The entire screen would be illuminated in this way in one-tenth of a second , so that it would appear to an observer to be fully and continuously illuminated . // A screen has been mentioned in the above explanation so that the reader may grasp how the light beam is caused to cover such a surface , and with what rapidity . In the Belin apparatus the place of this screen is taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transmit , or by the lantern slide , G. Passing through the slide , the beam of light , made strong or weak in accordance with the transparent or opaque portions of the slide , is directed through the lens , H , which concentrates the fluctuating light beam on to the photoelectric cell , K. The output of this cell is amplified and sent to the receiver , where it is caused to control the intensity of a cathode ray . The cathoderay oscillograph which is used in this apparatus is the work of M. Holweck . This oscillograph , the external details of which are shown in Fig. 9 , is very similar in arrangement and operation to the cathoderay tube already described in connection with Boris Rosing 's experiments , although the details of the construction of the Holweck instrument are somewhat different . These details are shown in Fig. 1o . Above the filament , E , is placed a grid , G , which is a circular plate with a hole in the centre . Above this is a disc of similar form which acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This plate also has a hole // in the centre , and over the hole is fitted a little copper tube . This arrangement con centrates the electron stream from the fila ment into a thin pencil-like discharge . The filament is brought to the correct electron emission temperature by means of a 2-volt battery . The varying input potential ( i.e. the amplified output of the photoelectric cell of the transmitter ) is applied between the grid and the filament . The plate voltage // required is 1,500 volts , which is supplied by a special battery . When this instrument is in operation , there is produced between the filament and the plate a stream of electrons which is " canalised " in the vertical tube , which is surrounded by the little concentrating coil , D. The action of this is to concentrate the stream of electrons into a very fine ray which is rendered visible when it strikes the fluorescent screen , AB , placed in the upper part of the oscillograph . The entire apparatus shown in Fig. zo is kept in a high degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the incoming current from the transmitter is to cause a disturbance in the normal emission of electrons , a disturbance which corresponds exactly with the variations of the modulated current at the transmitter . This disturbance is similar to that which takes place within a 3-electrode valve when a varying voltage is impressed upon the grid . A positive charge on the grid attracts some of the electrons , thus reducing the number of them which reach the plate . The grid of the cathode oscillograph acts in the same way , increasing or diminishing the total number of electrons which reach the fluorescent screen , in accordance with the current variations received from the transmitter . The luminous point produced on the // oscillograph screen varies in intensity in exact agreement with the beam of light falling upon the photoelectric cell at the sending station . If the point is kept fixed on the screen , its variations in intensity are very apparent . We now arrive at the question of how the pencil of rays is caused to move to and fro across the fluorescent screen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electron stream can easily be diverted from its course by means of a magnetic field . This is demonstrated very clearly , in the oscillograph under con consideration , by the small coil , D , which " canalises " the electron stream . When the coil is not excited the stream of electrons fills the copper tube , but when a current is switched on to the coil the stream is con tracted and the trace which it produces on the screen shrinks up until it is only a tiny brilliant point . To achieve this tiny point is really the object of providing the coil , D. If an ordinary bar magnet is brought near the oscillograph , the point of light on the screen will move away from it . If the magnet is removed , the point of light will return to the centre again . Thus , in order to cause the cathode ray to bend to and fro across the screen , in sympathy with the action of the vibrating mirrors at 5o TELEVISION the transmitter , it is only necessary to arrange two electromagnets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathode ray is within the field of both of them . These magnets are shown in Fig. 9 at N and O. One of them is supplied from the same alternating current source which supplies the 5oo-cycle mirror , while the other is supplied from the same source as the zo-cycle mirror . From what has been said above it will be seen that each of the magnetic fields will have the effect of displacing the cathode ray in exactly the same way as the visible light beam is displaced by the oscillating mirrors at the transmitter . As this displacement is effected by means of the same current which drives the mirrors , it follows that synchronism will be obtained between the transmitter and receiver ; but , of course , it is necessary to send the two alternating currents ( 5oo cycles and io cycles ) to the receiver as well as the picture impulses . Three separate channels are therefore necessary . In the Holweck oscillograph the cathode ray , instead of being allowed to strike the screen directly , is first bent round by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen , instead of being in a horizontal position on top of the instrument , is fitted at an angle to the vertical which makes it easy to observe . The arrangement can be // seen in Fig. 9 , at P , the zig-zag lines indicating the track of the cathode ray as it moves to and fro across the screen to construct the image . In the United States Mr. C. Francis Jenkins , who , like M. Belin , is well known in con nection with phototelegraphy , has also suc ceeded in sending shadows , working in collaboration with Mr. MacTaggart Moore . The Jenkins apparatus is of considerable interest by virtue of the fact that the optical system for scanning the image to be transmitted is of an entirely novel character . In the television systems so far described , light beams have been bent and moved about by means of mirrors . A prism , however , will also bend a beam of light . Aware of this fact , Jenkins cast about for some means of causing the beam also to oscillate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenkins Prismatic Disc , represents an entirely new contribution to optical science . One of these prismatic discs is illustrated in Fig. zz . It consists essentially of a disc of thick glass , the outer edge of which has been ground into the shape of a prism , the // section varying gradually and continuously round the circumference , so that at one point the base of the prism is outward , while diametrically opposite this point the base is inward . If a beam of light be directed through the edge of such a disc it will be bent in a certain direction , the angle at which the beam bends depending upon the angle of the prismatic section at that point . For the sake of example let us say that the beam is directed upwards at an angle of 45 degrees . If , now , the disc be slowly revolved , the beam will begin to move . If we are turning the disc in the right direction , the beam will move slowly downwards in a vertical plane , until , when a complete revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found to be pointing downwards at an angle of 45 degrees . By superimposing a second disc over the first ( as shown in Fig. 12 ) , so that their overlapping edges revolve in directions at right angles to each other , a lateral movement can be given to the beam , as well as a vertical movement . Thus Jenkins got the two necessary oscillatory actions . It is necessary , of course , for one of the discs to revolve comparatively slowly , to space the image lines traced over the photoelectric cell , or on the screen ; while the other disc must revolve much more rapidly in order to trace the image lines . // In some forms of the Jenkins apparatus , four revolving discs are used , but this duplication is introduced merely for the purpose of giving optical correction ; it does not alter the principle of operation . In electrical parlance , the two pairs of discs might be described as working in parallel . In order to project on to the photoelectric cell an image of the object or scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which is inserted a lantern // slide of the scene to be transmitted . The beam of light issuing from the lens of the lantern passes through the prismatic sections of the revolving discs . The action of these discs , as explained above , is to sweep the beam ( containing within it the image ) across the photoelectric cell . At the receiver , the incoming impulses from the photoelectric cell are caused to control the degree of brilliancy of a special form of neon tube developed by Mr. Moore . A beam of light from this tube is then focused through a system of revolving prismatic discs similar to that in use at the transmitter . The action of these discs , at the receiver , is to spread the neon tube light beam over the receiving screen and thus reproduce the image . Neon tubes consist essentially of two electrodes sealed into a glass vessel in which the air has been replaced by neon gas at a very low pressure . When a current of electricity is forced through such a tube by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heating of the atoms of gas by the passage of the current . Such tubes are being used a great deal , nowadays , for illuminated advertising display purposes . They can easily be recognised by their brilliant red glow . We have already seen , in connection with our consideration of light-sensitive devices , that in television we have to deal with imTHE // pulses occurring at frequencies running into many thousands per second . Not only is it necessary for the light-sensitive device to respond to impulses at such enormous frequencies ; the source of light at the receiver must respond with equal alacrity . Laboratory tests have shown that lamps of the neon glow discharge type can be lighted or extinguished at the rate of more than one million times per second . Another point of importance in television work is that such lamps produce a degree of illumination which is directly proportional to the amount of current supplied to them . Two views of the type of neon tube , specially developed by Mr. Moore for television purposes , are shown in Fig. 13 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the negative electrode , while the inner electrode , A , is positive . When a difference of potential is established between these two electrodes the gas within the tube glows . Immediately the current is switched off the light instantly ceases . The special construction adopted is such that the illumination is all from the point in the middle of the centre electrode . This not only concentrates the light , making it appear to be more intense , but it also facilitates the use of lenses for focusing purposes . In his earlier experiments in connection // with phototelegraphy , Mr. Jenkins secured synchronism between his transmitting and receiving mechanisms by means of an electrically driven tuning-fork arrangement . As will be explained later on , such an arrangement is not sufficiently accurate for television purposes , and for his television experiments Mr. Jenkins now makes use of synchronous electric motors to drive both transmitter and receiver mechanisms . Details of such motors will be given in a later chapter . For the present it is sufficient to say that two or more such motors , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in step , i.e. run at exactly the same speed . Since large American manufacturers of alternating current generators claim that in all their large installations they can guarantee that the difference in frequency between any two plants is less than per cent. , this , according to Jenkins , guarantees the accuracy of operation of his television machines in many localities where the standard American supply of zro volt , 6o-cycle A.C. is available ; for the only factor which will cause a synchronous motor to vary in speed is a variation in the frequency of the supply . At this low frequency , however , the phenomenon known as phase swinging may prove fatal to reproduction ; for although the mean speed is constant , an A.C. motor , if of low frequency , may vary its instantaneous speed quite considerably , and any such variation would seriously impair reception . In the latest type of Jenkins machine , particulars of which are available , the lens disc carries forty-eight lenses , and the purpose of the apparatus is avowedly to transmit and receive , not television , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Jenkins has recently been broadcasting these special shadow films from his laboratory in Washington . There is no detail in the films , only a plain black-and-white // silhouette of simple scenes such as a little girl bouncing a ball . The films are reeled off through the transmitter at the rate of fifteen pictures per second ? one less than the ordinary cinematograph . They are reproduced at the receiver at the same rate , and the received images , viewed through a magnifying glass , appear to be about six inches square . According to witnesses ' reports , the received shadowgraphs are very clear , and the illusion of motion is excellent . The general layout of the new Jenkins animated shadowgraph transmitter is shown in Fig. 14 . The film reels are mounted on a simple framework , one above the other , in such a manner that the film is pulled downwards by a set of sprockets which are driven by an electric motor . One end of the shaft which drives the sprockets is fitted with a gear pinion which meshes with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft of the electric motor , which is a synchronous A.C. motor capable of running at i , 800 r.p.m . Because of the speedreducing action of the gears , the pictures are pulled past the sprockets , or any fixed point next to the film , at the rate of 900 per minute , or 15 per second . At the other end of the shaft which drives 6o TELEVISION the sprockets is a heavy metal disc , about fifteen inches in diameter and about one inch thick . The edge of this disc is studded with forty-eight separate little lenses , each of which has an " optical speed " of f. 3.5 . These lenses are designed to concentrate the light from a powerful arc lamp into an intensely brilliant " pinhead " beam , which is caused to pierce the film as the latter travels down past the back of the disc . Immediately behind the film is mounted a photoelectric cell , which is so placed that the " pinhead " beam of light , after passing through the film , impinges upon it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the output of which is connected to a further amplifier of similar design , but having eight stages . Both ampli-fiers are very heavily screened by double copper shields . A close study of Fig. 14 will make the operation of the apparatus clear . The lens disc revolves at 900 r.p.m. , or fifteen times per second . The separation between the centres of the lenses is just equal to the width of the film . The latter moves steadily down-wards at the rate of fifteen pictures per second . Its action is not jerky , as in a cinematograph projector . The arc lamp on the left projects a powerful converging beam of light through one of the TRANSMITTING A FILM 6z lenses of the disc , which lens further converges the beam to a point , which " scans " or travels across the film from one side to the other , due to the rotary motion of the disc . When the next lens picks up the beam from the arc lamp , the film has moved downwards slightly , so that the second beam travels across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Succeeding lenses of the disc trace further parallel paths across the film , until each picture has been explored by the forty-eight lenses . As soon as the beam of light from one lens runs off the film , the beam from the succeeding lens starts to pierce the film on the other side . This movement is continuous during the operation of the mechanism . Thus forty-eight separate beams of light travel across each individual picture in onefifteenth of a second . At the start of each fifteenth of a second period a fresh picture slides into position and another series of forty-eight light beams starts to pierce it . While this movement is taking place the light beams , after shining through the film , fall on the photoelectric cell with degrees of intensity which depend upon the density of the parts of the film through which they shine . The electrical output of the photoelectric cell varies in proportion to the variation of the light intensity , and , after // amplification , this varying current is caused to modulate the radio broadcast transmitter . The apparatus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other receivers described in this book . It is illustrated in Fig. 15 , and consists of six essential parts . The heaviest unit is a 3,600 r.p.m. synchronous A.C. motor , to the shaft of which is attached a hollow metal drum about seven inches in diameter and about five inches wide . The centre of this drum is a hollow spindle with a thin wall . In corresponding places on the drum and the spindle are four spiral rows of tiny holes , twelve holes to a row . A short piece of quartz rod between the outside and inside connects each pair of corresponding holes . The purpose of the forty-eight little quartz rods is to conduct light from the inner spindle to the holes in the outer drum with as little loss as possible . Fixed inside the hollow spindle , with the flat little plates facing directly outward , is a special neon tube having four discharge electrodes . This tube is about four inches long and one inch in diameter , the little discharge electrodes , or plates , being about one-quarter of an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as a common element . In Fig. 15 , this tube is shown // withdrawn from the spindle , in order to illustrate it ; in actual use it fits inside the latter without touching it . The other end of the motor shaft is fitted with a z : 4 reducing gear which drives a revolving switch . The revolving element is simply a pair of contact brushes connected together . One brush effects continuous electrical connection with a solid brass ring imbedded in an insulating disc , while the other makes a wiping contact over the four sections of a split ring . The four segments are connected to the four discharge electrodes of the neon tube , while the solid ring is connected to one of the output terminals of the radio receiver . The common element of the neon tube is connected to the other output terminal of the wireless receiver . All the receiving apparatus described so far is contained in a wooden box measuring about two feet long and a foot square at the end . Directly above the top of the revolving drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and over this opening an ordinary mirror is mounted at an angle of 45 degrees to the top . About a foot in front of the mirror , and standing upright , is a magnifying lens about ten inches in diameter . Following the action of the receiver , the modulated picture signals from the distant transmitter are picked up by an ordinary // wireless receiver , amplified , and fed to the moving-picture receiver . Assuming that the contact brushes have just made contact with the upper right-hand ring , as shown in Fig. r5 , and that one of the quartz rods in the first , or outermost circle , is pointing straight up , this condition corresponds with the start of a picture in the transmitter , when the light spot is just commencing to sweep across the film . As the contact brushes have just closed the circuit to the neon-tube electrode at the extreme right , this electrode lights up imme diately and fluctuates in brilliancy exactly in accordance with the modulation of the signal . The fluctuations of light are carried up the quartz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the mirror . The light thus reflected from the mirror follows the shading of the images on the original film , so that a picture is built up in the mirror . This picture may then be observed through the magnifying glass . A complete picture of forty-eight lines ( corresponding to the rate of transmission ) is built up on the mirror with every four revolutions of the drum . At the beginning of the second revolution , the contact brushes turn to the next segment of the switching ring ( because of the gearing ) and the second electrode of the neon tube becomes operative . // The third and fourth quarters of the picture are similarly built up from the third and fourth electrodes , and the cycle then commences again with the first electrode . During one second the drum revolves sixty times . Since four revolutions create one picture , sixty revolutions create fifteen pictures , which gives the speed of fifteen pictures per second mentioned when the action of the transmitter was being described . It is , of course , necessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Jenkins does not provide any special synchronising method . For the purpose of the demonstrations given in Washington the transmitter and receivers were driven by synchronous A.C. motors , and as all the motors took their power from the same power line , it is reported that little difficulty was experienced in keeping the pictures steady . Witnesses describe the pictures , as viewed at a distance of about ten feet from the magnifying lens , as being clean-cut silhouettes against the characteristic reddish background provided by a neon tube . This apparatus is interesting , and distinctly novel , but it should be clearly understood that it does not produce television . It transmits and reproduces only moving shadowgraphs of simple figures and scenes // which have previously been specially prepared and recorded on a standard cinematograph film ; and as there are no refinements of shading and detail to be handled , the problem of designing suitable apparatus is vastly simpler of solution than is the problem of designing apparatus which will enable true television to be accomplished . CHAPTER VI THE PIONEER WORK OF J. L. BAIRD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dealt exclusively with work done abroad by television investigators . Of the many workers who have interested themselves in the subject , we have , for reasons already given , described the apparatus of only a few , but the work of these few may be taken as being fairly representative of the methods and equipment adopted by many others . We must now turn to a consideration of the work done in our own country by Mr. J. L. Baird , to whom belongs the credit and distinction of having been the first man actually to demonstrate publicly true television . Nearly fifty years ago , the inventive genius of Graham Bell , a Scotsman , gave to the world the telephone , and now Mr. Baird , another Scotsman , in successfully demonstrating television , has given us an electric eye to add to the electric ear supplied by Bell . It is now about five years ago since Baird , 68 // compelled by ill-health to abandon an active business career , commenced to devote himself exclusively to a study of the problem of television . Prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his hobby , and in the early days of his training as an engineer he devised an improved form of selenium cell , which led him to develop a crude system of television . When , as a result of the breakdown in his health , he was compelled to lead the life of a recluse , Baird took up the threads of the television problem where he had left off years previously . At first glance the problem seemed simple of solution . Briefly reviewed , the requirements , as we have already seen , may be stated as follows : ( I ) Means of scanning an image , so as to subdivide it into tiny sections , or elements . ( 2 ) Means of transforming the resulting picture elements , or light impulses , into electrical impulses , which can be transmitted to the distant receiver , either by wire or wireless . ( 3 ) Means of reconverting electrical impulses into light impulses , and by means similar to ( I ) , causing them to cover , or illumine a screen , thus reproducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Means of synchronising the transmitter // and receiver , i.e. causing them to run in step , or exactly at the same speed . These are the requirements as Baird reviewed the subject five years ago , and , on paper , the problem seemed simple . Many optical methods were already known which would fulfil requirement ( 1 ) . The selenium cell and the photoelectric cell were in existence and seemed to cover requirement ( 2 ) ; and for ( 3 ) there was the neon tube . Methods of synchronism had already been developed to a high degree in connection with other electrical processes , notably as an aid to highspeed multiplex telegraphy , so that point ( q ) seemed to be covered . It all seemed very simple , so simple , in fact , that the wonder was that television had not already been accomplished . Baird concluded that there must be a catch somewhere . There was ; and as we have already seen , the stumbling block lay in requirement ( 2 ) , the light-sensitive cell . Another catch lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although satisfactory for the purposes for which they were developed , were quite unsuitable for television . After about six months ' work , however , Baird achieved a measure of success , and was able to transmit shadowgraphs . Encouraged by this success , hope ran high , but , as other // inventors have found , he soon discovered that to transmit shadows was one thing ; to transmit the images of the objects themselves was a very different thing . Month after month he worked with apparatus of the very crudest description , until , in April 1925 , he had the satisfaction of giving the first public demonstration of television , transmitting outlines by wireless between two separate machines at Selfridge 's Oxford Street store . As stated , only out-lines were transmitted on this occasion , but they were transmitted by light reflected from the original objects , and were not shadows . In connection with his efforts to progress from the transmission of outlines to the sending of true images complete with detail , Mr. Baird is fond of telling the following story : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of placing before the trans mitter the head of a ventriloquist 's doll , and his efforts were concentrated in the direction of getting not merely the outline , but a complete detailed image of this doll through to his receiving screen . One day , in October 1925 , after months of patient effort , he had the satisfaction of seeing the doll 's face on his receiving screen not as an outline , but as a real image with shading and detail . // Full of enthusiasm and excitement , Mr. Baird rushed out of the laboratory in search of a human " subject " to take the place of the doll . The first human being he met happened to be Mr. William Taynton , who was at that time office boy in the office below . After some difficulty Mr. Baird persuaded Mr. Taynton to come up to the laboratory and take his place before the Televisor . After seating him in the correct position , Mr. Baird dashed through the laboratory to look at the receiving screen . To his great disappointment however , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments he went back to the transmitter , to find that the failure of the experiment was due to the fact that his human subject , afraid of the terrific glare of the lights used to illumin-ate his face , had moved back out of focus . " In the excitement of the moment , " to quote Mr. Baird , he was given half a crown to take up his position again and maintain it . This time the image of the boy 's face came through clearly on the receiving screen . As a matter of historical interest it is some-what strange to have to record that the first human being ever to be televised had to be bribed to accept the distinction ! After several more months of hard work , Baird was able , on January 27th , 1926 , to give to over forty members of the Royal // Institution the first demonstration of true television ever witnessed . The image of moving human faces were transmitted between two rooms , not as outlines or silhouettes , but complete with tone gradations of light and shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , and suffered from other defects , the individual being " televised " could be recognised . This demonstration , and others which followed shortly after , created considerable interest , but Baird 's weird apparatus , consisting of old bicycle sprockets , cardboard discs , and bullseye lenses , all tied together with sealing wax and string , failed to impress those who were accustomed to the shining brass and exquisite mechanism of the professional instrument maker . The importance of the demonstration was , however , realised by the scientific world , and many leading scientists and engineers came to inspect the apparatus . The original transmitting mechanism shown at Selfridge 's is now on exhibition in the South Kensington Science Museum , and its mode of operation will be described with the aid of the diagrammatic sketch given in Fig. 16 , where A represents the object the image of which is to be transmitted , and the revolving discs B , C , and D are the image-scanning , or exploring mechanism . // The disc B , carrying a series of lenses in staggered formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of images of A to pass , in the form of long strips , across the light-sensitive cell , E. Before reaching E , // however , the image strips are broken up by the slots in the disc C , which revolves at about 4,000 r.p.m . Passing through the serrations of this disc , the light impulses must also shine through the spirally slotted disc D , the rotation of which has an effect which is equivalent to giving the light-sensitive cell , E , a back and forward motion , thus dividing the image into a greater number of strips . That is to say , the action of D is equivalent to using more lenses in B. The disc D revolves at a comparatively slow speed . The picture-analysing action of the revolving discs may be summarised as follows . The lens disc , B , divides the image up into , in this case , sixteen strips . This number of strips is doubled by the disc D. Disc C chops up individual image strips into a series of light flashes . Thus the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture elements , which are arranged to fall upon the light-sensitive cell , E , in regular succession . The output of the light-sensitive cell , of course , varies in direct proportion to the intensity of the light flashes falling upon it , and this output , after amplification , is transmitted to the receiver , either by wire or by wireless , Superimposed upon this picture impulse current there is also an audio frequency current from the A.C. generator , shown // coupled to the motor which drives the revolving discs . This audio frequency current is transmitted to enable the receiver to be synchronised with the transmitter . This part of the apparatus will be more fully explained in the chapter devoted to methods of synchronism . At the receiver , shown diagrammatically in Fig. 17 , the synchronising current , superimposed upon the picture impulse current , is filtered out , and caused to operate ( after amplification ) the synchronous motor which governs the speed of the main D.C. motor . At present , however , we are concerned only with the picture impulses . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neon tube , K , which type of tube , as we have already seen , responds instantly to current impulses , transforming them into light flashes . The optical mechanism , or image-scanning device , closely resembles that at the transmitter , with the exception that , in the case of the receiver , the serrated disc , C , is eliminated , leaving the slotted disc , H ( Fig. 17 ) , and the lens disc , G ( Fig. i7 ) . The combined action of these two discs is to bend a beam of light from the neon tube , K , to and fro and up and down , so that the screen , F , is fully illuminated , the fluctuations in the illumination of the neon tube , K , being spread // over the screen so as to reproduce exactly the original scene at the transmitter . Although , as already stated , the abovedescribed apparatus functioned satisfactorily , // and gave true television , the " grain " of the received image was very coarse . Com pared with the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine art reproduction in a high-grade illustrated magazine . The details and the gradations of light and shade were there , and the picture could be recognised , but the reproduction left much to be desired . In an effort to improve the grain of his image , Baird experimented in several directions . Three methods of casting an image are known to optical science . We have the lens , the con-cave mirror , and the pin-hole . Another interesting device has , however , been described in one of Mr. Baird ' s patents . This is a somewhat unusual honey-comb structure made up of a bank of small tubes arranged in parallel rows . The action of this bank of tubes is rather peculiar . If held , for example , in front of an electric-light bulb an image of the filament will appear on a ground-glass screen held close against // the back of the bank of tubes . A surprising feature of the image is that it is constant in size , independently of the distance between the bank of tubes and the lamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices wherein the size of the image is dependent upon the distance away of the object from the imagecasting device . Whether this particular apparatus will find a permanent use in television remains to be seen , but we describe it as an interesting scientific novelty which has been tried experimentally as a substitute for a revolving lens disc . The two interrupter discs , C and D ( Fig. i6 ) , were retained , and arranged to operate in conjunction with the cellular structure as shown diagrammatically in Fig. i8 . As already stated , Baird 's original machine gave an image at the receiver which appeared to be made up of thin closely fitting strips . By using the system of projection tubes mentioned above , the received image takes on the appearance of being made up of a large number of fine dots . CHAPTER VII THE PIONEER WORK OF J. L. BAIRD ( continued ) . THE " OPTICAL LEVER . " MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF the many image-exploring devices devised to date , both by Baird and by other workers , none is so highly interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by him an " optical lever . " The possibility of speeding up all other devices is strictly limited by mechanical considerations , but with the optical lever there is no limit to the speed at which light impulses may be caused to traverse the lightsensitive cell , or a bank of several cells . This invention is described in Baird 's Patent No. 265,64o , and to describe it we can not do better than quote from the original specification and refer to the original sketch , which is reproduced in Fig. ig . Quoting from the patent specification : " The transmitter may consist of a rotating disc , around which is arranged a circle of lenses . In front of the disc is the object to be transmitted , and behind the disc and in the 8o // focal plane of the lenses is a ground-glass screen . As the disc rotates a series of images of the object pass from top to bottom across the screen . " Behind the screen is a second revolving disc containing a circle of lenses . This disc throws an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aperture leading to a light-sensitive cell , and is arranged so that , as it revolves , the images cast by its circle of lenses move from one side to the other across the diaphragm ( see Fig. 20 ) . The image of the object when it reaches the diaphragm has therefore two motions ; from top to bottom , due to the first disc , and laterally , say from left to right , due to the second disc , the second disc revolving slowly relatively to the first , and thus the image traverses the cell . " A ground-glass screen has been mentioned to make the action of the mechanism somewhat clearer , but it is not necessary and , in practice , is omitted . The lenses in the disc may be arranged in spiral or any staggered formation , and to give the lateral motion to the image a revolving mirror polyhedron may be used in place of the second disc . The above is a general statement of the principle of the methods used . To obtain a finer grain in the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6 // cell , and in order to increase the speed without increasing the speed of the revolving discs , or adding lenses , more than one combination of discs is used . Another method of increasing the speed consists of employing a bank of fixed lenses , say three , each lens casting an image of the object on to a ground-glass screen . As the lenses are adjacent the three images will be almost identical . An image of this screen is then made to traverse the lightsensitive cell by any of the means previously described , only , by the use of three fixed image-casting lenses , the speed is trebled . As before , the ground-glass screen may be dispensed with . " The lenses may be arranged to work with more than one cell . For example , a set of nine lenses might be used casting three images on the screen , each of these three rows operating its own cell , which would control its own light source at the receiving station , the light source replacing the cell behind an optical device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to the diagrams , Fig. ig is a plan of the apparatus ; Fig. 20 is a partial end view looking in the direction of the arrow A ; and Fig. 2I is an end view looking in the direction of the arrow B. In the following description , ground-glass screens will be mentioned , as they enable the action of the system // to be followed more easily . Actually they are not essential to the performance of the apparatus , and are omitted in practice . Referring to Fig. zg , the image-scanning mechanism , or transmitter , consists of a rotatable disc , z , in which is mounted any desired number of lenses , 2 . In front of the disc is the object , 3 , or objects , of which a reproduction is to be transmitted . The position of the first ground-glass screen is shown at 4 , it being so mounted as to receive an image projected by one of the lenses , 2 . The line 18 indicates the optical axis of the apparatus , along which projection of the images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , crosses this axis an image is projected upon the screen , 4 . Behind the screen , 4 , is a second rotatable disc , 5 , also carrying a suitable number of lenses , 6 , and so positioned that these lenses , by rotation of the disc , are carried across the optical axis , 18 . The discs i and 5 are mounted on separate parallel shafts , 7 and 8 , which are rotated at any desired speeds . They may , if desired , be geared together . The image projected on to the screen , 4 , constitutes an object of which an image is projected by each of the lenses , 6 , on to a screen , g , placed behind the disc , 5 ; and the rotation of the shafts , 7 and 8 , is made so that the lenses , 2 , cross the optical axis , z8 , in the // opposite direction to the lenses , 6 . With the construction shown , this result is obtained by rotating the discs in the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discs having mounted on it a plurality of lenses as indicated at io , ii and 16 , 17 , these lenses all being arranged to be carried across the optical axis , 18 , by the rotation of the shaft 7 . Similarly , the shaft 8 carries a series of discs each with a plurality of lenses on it as indicated at 13 , 14 , and these discs are intercalated with the discs on the shaft 7 . The lenses on each of the discs as they cross the optical axis 18 , reproject successively from the left towards the right in Fig. i9 , the image cast by the lens on the preceding disc in the series , and as the lenses are moving successively in opposite directions the speed of traversal of each successive image is increased . Any desired number of discs may be used on each shaft so as to provide any desired final speed of traversal of the image . " The most difficult point to understand in connection with this invention is just how it comes about that the speed of traversal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no advantage would result from increasing the number of discs , and that the images cast by successive discs would , in any case , just pile one on top of the other on the last screen of the series . Such , however , is not the case . // All motion is relative . In order to decide what is motion and what is not , and the speed at which an object moves , we must have some fixed point of reference . A person may walk along the corridor of a train at a speed of three miles an hour . Persons sitting in the compartmnets would say he was moving at the rate of three miles an hour , which would be correct from their point of view , i.e. using themselves as the point of reference . But if the train itself were travelling at sixty miles an hour , and the person concerned happened to be walking from the back of the train towards the front , his total rate of progress , using the surface of the earth as the point of reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that the earth itself is moving through space , revolving round the sun , and round its own axis , then we see that the rate of progress of the person walking along the train , and the speed of the train itself , is , if we take the sun as the point of reference , something altogether different to what we imagined it to be . Returning now to the optical lever , the lenses , 2 , of the first revolving disc cast on the screen , 4 , a series of images of the relatively fixed object , 3 . The lenses , 6 , of the second disc , which cross the optical axis in the opposite direction , pick up an image of screen // 4 and cast it on to screen 9 . From the point of view of the second disc , the image on screen 4 is the relatively fixed object , a series of images of which it has to proj ect on to screen 9 . But by virtue of the fact that the image on screen 4 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurring images ; and by virtue also of the fact that the lenses on the first and second discs are moving in opposite directions , the total number of images which will fall on screen 9 in a given time will be twice the number falling on screen 4 . The second disc really handles images at the same speed as does the first disc , but whereas the first disc is projecting images of a fixed object , the second disc is , as it were , projecting images of a number of rapidly moving objects . The third disc , io , now picks up the image of screen 9 ( which , from the point of view of the third disc , is also a relatively fixed object ) and reprojects it on to screen 12 , thus effecting still another increase in the speed of traversal ; and further increases are effected by the succeeding discs in the series . Thus the speed of traversal of the images is increased by what may be described as an optical lever effect ; hence the name which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed of traversal of the images is twice what it was on the preceding one ; and the increase may be carried to any extent by // adding more discs to the series , whilst maintaining the speed of the mechanism itself within permissible limits . As already mentioned , screens are not actually necessary ; they have been quoted in the description given above , and shown in Fig. ig , simply as an aid to the understanding of the apparatus . As they cross the optical axis the lenses on each disc will pick up the images cast in space by the lenses of the preceding disc . With the arrangement shown , the screen ig has cast upon it a series of images which are moved at a high speed upwards ( or downwards , according to the direction of rotation of the shafts 7 and 8 ) , and if a light-sensitive cell were substituted for this screen , it could be moved slowly across the moving image to produce the desired exploration of the whole image . This relative lateral movement between the series of images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate disc , 20 , which is mounted on a shaft , 22 , situated above the plane containing the shafts 7 and 8 , so that the disc 20 overlaps the optical axis , 18 , of the apparatus , as shown in Fig. 21 . The disc 20 carries a series of lenses , 21 , which are moved across the optical axis ( by virtue of the above-described disposition of the shafts ) in a direction at right angles to the // direction of motion of the lenses 14 and 17 . The shaft 22 may be rotated slowly compared with the shafts 7 and 8 , thus causing the images to move laterally across the lightsensitive cell , so as to provide an adequately finely grained picture . The light-sensitive cell , 23 , is situated on the optical axis of the apparatus . The lateral movement of the series of images may be effected in any other desired manner . Thus , for example , the lenses on one of the discs could be arranged in a spiral , as shown on the disc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , so that each of the succession of images produced by the lenses of that disc are displaced slightly to one side of the previous image . Quoting again from the patent specification : " To obtain increase of speed of traversal of the image a stationary bank of adjacent lenses may be used , say three , one above the other , between the object and the first disc , each lens casting an image of the object or view being transmitted on to a ground-glass screen , where the three images adjoin , one above the other . As the lenses are adjacent the three images will be almost identical . An image of this screen is then made to traverse a light-sensitive cell by any of the means herein described , and by the use of three lenses the speed is trebled . // " The lenses may be arranged to work with more than one cell . For example , three vertical banks of three fixed lenses each might be used casting three vertical rows of three images on the screen , each of these rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light source at the receiving station , the light source replacing the cell behind an optical device similar to that at the transmitting station . " It will readily be appreciated that , with apparatus available which will cause light impulses to fall on the light-sensitive cell at any speed , the total number of impulses per second which the cell may be called upon to handle soon becomes enormous . Even if the cell is capable of responding at the chosen speed of operation , there still remains to be considered the medium of transmission . As we shall see in a later chapter , there are limitations to the speed at which signalling can be carried out , i.e. to the number of impulses per second which can be sent over the circuit connecting the transmitter to the receiver . The difficulty of the response of the cell can be overcome by using more than one cell , and in his Patent No. 253,957 Baird describes methods of causing each cell to deal with its own band of the picture , and control its own light source at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the picture dealt with at the transmitter by the cell which controls it . The signals , in this case , are sent along separate lines , or on separate wave-lengths , if wireless transmission is used . If the transmission medium will handle impulses at the required speed , however , there is no reason why the outputs of the light-sensitive cells should not all be trans mitted over the same circuit , the output impulses of each cell being timed electrically to follow those of the preceding cell in the series , all in proper order . By the use of appropriate signal-accepting circuits at the // receiver , the incoming impulses could be sorted out and applied to their proper light sources . In cases where more than one light-sensitive cell is employed , each cell should be provided with its own amplifier . If the cells are connected in parallel and then fed to a single amplifier , they will tend to feed back through each other , causing a partial short-circuit . Even after individual amplification , it is advisable , as described in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output circuit of each amplifier to prevent feed-back . Alternatively , a 2-electrode valve can be placed in the output circuit of each cell direct , whereupon the output circuits of the three 2-electrode valves can safely be connected in parallel to a single amplifier . This latter arrangement is shown in Fig. 22 ( which is reproduced from the patent specification ) , where 43 , 44 , and 45 are the lightsensitive cells ; 56 , 57 , and 58 are the 2-electrode valves ; and 59 and 6o are the output terminals which are connected to the input terminals of the amplifier . CHAPTER VIII THE AMERICAN TELEPHONE &; TELEGRAPH COMPANY 'S DEMONSTRATION . THE LIGHTSPOT SYSTEM AMONGST the latest experimenters to enter the television field are a group of engineers associated with the great American Telephone &; Telegraph Company , one of America 's largest industrial concerns , which depends for its scientific progress upon vast organised laboratories staffed by some of the cleverest telephone and telegraph engineers in the world . A group of engineers attached to these laboratories ( The Bell Telephone Laboratories , Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , succeeded , on April 7th , 1927 , in giving a public demonstration of television over a wire circuit between Washington and New York ; and over a wireless circuit between Whippany , N. J. , and New York . This demonstration was given before a party of guests which included business executives , newspaper editors , engineers , and 93 // scientists . The party assembled at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York , and were enabled to speak to , and simultaneously see , friends over the ordinary long-distance telephone line in Washington , 200 miles away . Walter S. Gifford , President of the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , held a conversa-tion with Secretary Hoover , of the U.S. Department of Commerce , who was in Washington . Mr. Hoover 's remarks were made audible to the assembled guests in New York by means of a loud speaker , whilst the image of his face was made visible on two screens , one a small one for individual use , measuring about two and a half inches square , the other a large one measuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was prepared for the benefit of the visitors , appeared to be somewhat corrugated . This was due to the fact that the squares which made up the picture were arranged in fifty rows , one on top of the other . As the eye became accus-tomed to looking at the screen in the darkened room the image of the distant speaker 's face was recognisable , although the features , which showed up clearly and sharply on the small screen , were considerably blurred by the enlargement , and at times disappeared altogether . // It was plain that , enlarged to the size of an ordinary motion-picture screen , the detail would have been completely lost . It was stated at the demonstration , however , that the invention was far from the picture-house stage of perfection . The images reproduced on the small screen were fairly clear , however , and were described by witnesses as being comparable to faded daguerreotypes held in a shaky hand . In these small pictures the detail of the face appeared in black lines against a shining gold background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neon tube which was used to illuminate the small screen . Following the wire demonstration between New York and Washington , the visitors were entertained to a repetition of the experiments , the transmission on this occasion being by wireless from the Company 's experimental station , 3XN , at Whippany , N. J. , about thirty miles from New York . An important feature of the demonstrations was that there was no difference in the quality of the reproduced image , whether it was transmitted from one end of the laboratory to the other , by wire from Washington , or by wireless from Whippany . The engineers responsible for these demonstrations made it quite clear that their apparatus and methods could not yet be brought // into regular commercial use . The necessary equipment was extremely elaborate and costly , and for the purpose of the public demonstration the services of a total of nearly z , 000 men were required ! Furthermore , the transmission of television , as achieved by the A. T. &; T. , required the use of a large group of frequencies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone circuits . In the case of the wireless transmissions , one wave-length had to be used for sending the picture impulses , one for the synchronising impulses , and a third for speech , as shown in Fig. 23 . In view of the already seriously congested state of the ether , this presents a formidable difficulty . It is stated that much of the knowledge used by the engineers responsible for the development of the system of television under review was gained by them during the course of years of development and research , as a result of which the A. T. &; T. now operates on a commercial basis a system of picture transmission by wire which covers the entire United States . Television and phototelegraphy , either by wire or wireless , have several points in common , or at least closely associated , so that the engineers who developed the phototelegraphy // system were able to make use of much of the information they had gained . An essential feature of all television transmitters is that the scene to be transmitted must be illuminated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light-sensitive device used to transform the light impulses into electrical impulses . With all systems so far developed ( with the exception of one of Baird 's most recent developments ) , it has been customary to flood the entire scene with light , and this light , in most cases , has had to be so intense as to cause considerable discomfort to any person facing it . The intensity of the light has had to be made so great because , when a photoelectric cell of the alkali type is used as the lightsensitive device , its response to light impulses is extremely feeble , the output requiring enormous amplification before it will perform the work required of it . It must be borne in mind that the light which reaches the cell is reflected light , and some idea of the feebleness of reflected light may be obtained from the fact that if a human face be illuminated with a i , 000-c.p. lamp , placed at a distance of three feet , the total amount of light reflected back from it will scarcely amount to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the television apparatus under consideration is no exception . Photoelectric cells were used to transform the light impulses into electric currents , and a very intense illumination was employed , this being provided by a Sperry arc consuming 40 amperes . Between the arc and the scene there was interposed a revolving steel disc which had holes drilled in it near the circumference in the form of a single spiral . Through these holes there shone , at any given moment , only one single spot of light ( see Fig. 23 ) . The rotary action of the disc caused this spot of light to travel from left to right across the scene ' or individual to be transmitted ; then the next hole , set a trifle nearer the centre of the disc , allowed another spot of light to pass through , which travelled across the scene on a parallel track , but a trifle lower down than did the last one . As the disc continued to revolve , this action continued until the entire scene had been covered , or explored . The disc revolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , a little spot at a time , in less than a fifteenth of a second . There were fifty holes in the discs used , so that the scene had fifty illuminated lines traced across it . By this method an intense illumination zoo TELEVISION of the sitter was obtained without its being unbearable . All that could be seen was a flickering spot of light which crossed and recrossed the sitter 's face at an incredible speed . Even when using this method of illumination , however , it was said that the sitter began to feel a sensation of discomfort after a few minutes ' exposure to the intense light spot . In passing , it is interesting to note that Mr. J. L. Baird , the British inventor , used this light-spot method in the course of some of his original experiments , the method being described by him in his British Patent No. 269,658 , of Jan. 27th , 1926 , nearly eighteen months previous to the A. T. &; T. demonstration . The system is illustrated diagrammatically in Fig. 24 . Baird has recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the system has its obvious limitations , owing to the restricted field of view which it is possible to cover with a travelling light spot . The lines , contours , and colours of the sitter 's face cause variations in the degree of brilliancy of the spots of light which they reflect , and these , in turn , cause a similarly varying effect when they strike the photoelectric cells . In the A. T. &; T. apparatus , the person to be televised sat before a box-like instrument , A BAIRD INVENTION ror from a cavity in the centre of which the light spot issued , illuminating his face . Around this cavity , on both sides and on the top , were placed three huge photoelectric cells . These cells measured about 16 inches long , and are probably the largest ever made . Light reflected from the sitter 's face fell upon these cells , the electrical response of which , after amplification , was sent to the receiver . As already explained in a previous chapter , the output of a photoelectric cell is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the use of three of them in parallel , instead of only one . // Notwithstanding this arrangement , the amplification of the output current had to be enormous . In the case of the radio transmissions from Whippany , for example , it was estimated that the photoelectric current was amplified 5,000 million million times before it reached the transmitting aerial ! This amplification , of course , included the power amplification of the wireless transmitter itself . As each detail of the sitter was illuminated , the photoelectric cells instantly responded , initiating a current proportional to the light reflected back on to them ; and hence proportional to the light and shade of the particular detail . As the light spot swung across the scene , working its way to and fro and from top to bottom , the current from the cells varied correspondingly . So swiftly did the beam sweep the scene that the current variations were wide and rapid ? sometimes corresponding to a change from a maximum to a minimum in a twentythousandth of a second . These variations , the so-called alternating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the distant receiver . The speed of signalling was therefore about 20,000 per second . As already mentioned , two forms of receiving apparatus were used at the demonstraSMALL // tion . In each form a neon gas tube was an important element . Such tubes , as has been explained in a previous chapter , are hollow glass vessels in which the air has been replaced by neon gas at a very low pressure . Electrical discharges passing through such a tube cause it to glow , the brilliance of the light being directly proportional to the strength of the current . It will at once be appreciated that , in regard to the relation between light and electricity , the properties of a neon gas tube are exactly opposite to those of a photoelectric cell . In the A. T. &; T. apparatus for use by an individual , a small neon tube was used , the entire tube being caused to glow in accordance with the strength of the current being received from the transmitting station at any particular instant . Between the tube and the observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half inches square , there was interposed a disc exactly similar to the one at the transmitter , rotating in step with it . The result was that the observer saw at successive instants successive portions of the field of view , each of which was illuminated by the glowing neon tube . So rapidly was the scanning of the field of vision carried out that the observer 's I04 TELEVISION sensation was that of seeing the scene as a whole repeated just as it appeared at the transmitter . Had the mechanism suddenly stopped dead , what the observer would have seen would have been a tiny spot of light , admitted to his line of vision through one of the holes of the disc , and constantly fluctuating in intensity . The rotary action of the disc spreads , as it were , the light-spot fluctuations all over the receiving screen , each light or dark spot of illumination being in its exact place to correspond with the scene being transmitted . For the presentation of the image to a large audience a different method was employed experimentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Baird , and is described by him in his Patent No. 222,604 , July 1924 . Instead of using a single relatively small neon tube , successive portions of which are viewed at successive intervals , a very long tube was used , which was folded back and forth upon itself to form a grid , as shown in Fig. 25 , which illustrates the arrangement diagrammatically . The tube was bent into fifty loops , corresponding with the number of holes in the scanning disc at the transmitter . Instead of fitting this long tube with a single pair of // electrodes , like the smaller tube , the grid was equipped with 2,500 electrodes , fifty per turn of the loop . Each electrode then corre sponded to a single elemental area of the picture plane which was scanned by the photo-electric cells at the sending end . These electrodes were connected by wires to a distributor which , in turn , was connected to the circuit coming from the transmitting station . The distributor , which was a form of commutator , revolved in exact synchronism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TELEVISION When a particular spot on the object being televised was illuminated , its position and light intensity were transmitted , in the form of an electrical impulse , to the receiving station , as has already been described . In this case , however , the distributor selected the proper connection with the neon tube grid and lighted a spot on it which corresponded with the spot on the original scene , the illumination of which set up the impulse in the first place . Only one spot on the grid was illuminated at a time , but these glowing spots followed each other with such rapidity that the audience appeared to see the entire grid lighted up continuously , in the form of the scene at the transmitter . The grid was arranged so that it could be viewed either directly , or through a ground-glass screen , to soften the " grain " somewhat . The distributor consisted of a brush contact which revolved in synchronism with the scanning disc at the sending end . This brush , as it revolved , made contact with a commutator arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the neon tube electrodes were connected . Each segment picked up from the rotating brush the appropriate electrical impulse in-tended for it , and conducted it over the con-necting wire to the appropriate electrode on the grid . To each of the 2,500 electrodes 15 // impulses per second had to be delivered , so it will readily be appreciated that the most minute error would have hopelessly scrambled the picture . How the mechanisms were kept in step is described in the chapter devoted to synchronism . This arrangement of a long neon tube and distributor , although it has been tried experimentally both by Mr. Baird and by the A. T. &; T. , is , of course , hopelessly impractical for regular commercial operation , owing to the maze of connecting wires required , and the delicacy of adjustment of the apparatus . The whole arrangement is , in fact , very reminiscent of the experimental apparatus built by Rignoux and Fournier in 1906 . From a purely experimental point of view , however , the apparatus is highly interesting , and it has proved its ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1928 , the General Electric Company of America gave a demonstration of television on lines almost identical with those which have just been described . They used the same light-spot method previously described and used by Baird and the A. T. &; T. Co . Transmission took place by wireless from one of the company 's short-wave stations at Schenectady , N.Y. , on 37.8 metres , while the ordinary medium-wave broadcasting station , ro8 TELEVISION WGY , operating on 378.9 metres , sent out the speech and music produced by those whose images were being televised . At four separate homes within a few miles of Schenectady , television receivers and broadcast receivers were installed , the object of the demonstration being an endeavour to show that the day of the home televisor is not far distant . No attempt was made automatically to synchronise the receiving televisors with the transmitting mechanism , the object of the omission of all synchronising mechanisms being to simplify the device . At the receiving stations , ordinary direct current motors were used to drive the revolving discs , and the speed of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keeping the speed constant by means of a hand-controlled regulator . D.C. motors have a habit of " hunting , " which will be described more fully in the next chapter ; but it is possible to keep them at a fairly constant speed by expert hand regulation . The operation , however , partakes of the nature of a feat of juggling , and simply begs the whole question of synchronism . Even with the most expert manipulation the picture can not be kept steady for longer than very brief intervals . There was no feature of novel interest in // the apparatus employed by the General Electric Company at this demonstration . It has served , however , to render all the more significant the fact that the only television systems which have given results up to the present are worked along lines identical with those first disclosed by Baird and demonstrated by him in this country . Another significant feature is the fact that the G.E.C . have , for the time being at least , abandoned , in favour of the neon tube light source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this system it was proposed to use a seven light spot arc lamp projector , the brilliancy of the light spots to be controlled , before projection on to the receiving screen , by means of shutters controlled , in turn , by seven separate photoelectric cells at the distant transmitter . This , of course , entailed the use of seven separate transmission channels , either wire or wireless . To cause the seven light spots to move together to and fro across the screen it was proposed to use a revolving mirror polyhedron . CHAPTER IX METHODS OF SYNCHRONISM ONE of the greatest problems in connection with television is that of securing and maintaining synchronism between the transmitting and receiving mechanisms . In phototelegraphy , as distinct from television , the problem is relatively simple of solution , for the speed of transmission is so very much slower . Also , as will be made clearer later , synchronism in phototelegraphy need only be carried out in what might be described as a single dimension , as far as the automatic mechanism is concerned ; whereas , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , to two dimensions . In most systems of phototelegraphy the problem resolves itself into the rotation at precisely equal speeds of two cylinders , one at the transmitter and one at the receiver . The recording device at the receiver can be set to the correct starting point by hand , and simultaneous starting of the two cylinders can be effected by some form of prearranged signal . IIO TUNING-FORKS Ill The maintenance of equal speeds of operation of different mechanisms can be accomplished in several ways which have been devised from time to time for different purposes . The methods employed may be roughly divided into two classes , in one of which independent generators of a controlling current of constant frequency are used at both the transmitting and receiving stations . In the other class a constant frequency generated at the transmitter is sent to the receiver and applied there to control the speed of the mechanism . Devices of the former class generally make use of electrically driven tuning-forks or clockwork-operated pendulums as the means of generating accurately timed impulses . For slow-speed work it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact at the end of its swing , but for higher speed work , or for greater accuracy , it is better to make use of the more rapid impulses obtainable from a vibrating fork . The general arrangement of an electrically operated tuning-fork is shown in Fig. 26 . Current flowing through the windings of the electromagnet attracts the fork , pulling it over so that the interrupter contact is opened , thus switching off the current and permitting the fork to return to its normal position , when the contact once more closes and the fork is again // attracted . The action is similar to that of a buzzer , only , in this case , the perfectly tuned fork sets up , in the battery circuit , an intermittent current the frequency of which corresponds exactly with the frequency of vibration of the fork . Representative of the manner in which a fork can be applied to synchronise two remotely separated mechanisms is the system of synchronism developed by Captain R. H. Ranger , of the Radio Corporation of America , and used in the transmission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , and between New York and Honolulu , by combined wire and wireless transmission . These transmissions , it should be clearly understood , constitute phototelegraphy , not television . The circuit arrangements of the Ranger synchronising method are given in Fig. 27 . The heart of the device is the electrically // operated tuning-fork , which is mounted in an insulated case . This case is kept heated to a constant temperature by means of a lamp . By keeping the temperature constant , variations in the frequency of vibration of the fork , due to expansion and contraction of the metal at various temperatures , is avoided . The tuning-fork is caused to vibrate at a frequency of 70 per second by means of the electromagnet and interrupter contacts shown , and a chronometer , operating through a relay 8 // and the correcting magnet , keeps the frequency of vibration constant . In the upper right-hand corner of Fig. 27 is the D.C. shunt-wound motor which drives the photo-transmission mechanism , and the vibrating fork keeps its speed of rotation constant in the following manner . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commutator contacts are closed , the variable resistance in series with the field winding of the motor is short-circuited and the speed of the motor is reduced , due to the sudden rush of current through the field winding . At another moment it may be that the contacts are closed through the tuning-fork and auxiliary commutator segments and slip rings at the left-hand end of the motor shaft . In such a case the field winding of the motor will be short-circuited , and due to the greatly weakened field the speed of the motor will increase . This action goes on repeatedly , so that the average speed of the motor remains constant . The motor is designed to run at a speed of 2,100 revolutions per minute . In order to check the synchronism a neon tube is fitted on to the end of the motor shaft , and revolves with it . This tube receives an impulse for each vibration of the fork , i.e. 70 per second , or 4,200 per minute . The tube therefore // receives two impulses for each revolution of the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stroboscope effect . That is to say , if the motor is revolving in perfect synchronism with the tuning-fork , the neon tube appears to be stationary . If the speed is below synchronism , the neon tube will appear to be turning slowly backwards , like the wheels of a motor-car often appear to be on the cinematograph screen . If the motor speed is above synchronism , then the neon tube will appear to turn slowly forward . Exactly similar driving motors and tuningforks are supplied to the transmitting and receiving stations , particular care being taken over the tuning of the fork , so that the transmitting and receiving mechanisms are certain to revolve at the same speed , i.e. in synchronism . This method , although eminently satisfactory for phototelegraphy , is not suitable for television , for it is rather complicated , and with the greatly increased speed of transmission involved in television the degree of synchronism obtainable is not sufficiently great . The other class of synchronising method , in which the synchronism of the receiver mechanism is under the direct control of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the // receiver of the constant frequency current , and the use of a control mechanism at the receiver which is capable of being operated at a speed which is dependent solely and absolutely on the frequency of the incoming current impulses . It matters little what form of constant frequency generator is employed at the transmitter , so long as the generated frequency is sufficiently high . It may be an electrically operated tuning-fork , or a valve oscillator controlled by a tuning-fork or a quartz crystal ; or it may be a small alternating current dynamo coupled to the shaft of the main driving motor of the transmitter . At the receiver it is usual to cause the incoming constant frequency current to drive a small synchronous motor which is coupled to the shaft of the main receiver driving motor . Synchronous motors consist essentially of an armature , or rotor , supplied with an alternating current ; and a stator supplied with direct current . In an even simpler form , such as that shown in Fig. z8 , the alternating current is fed to the stator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longitudinal iron strips , or an iron wheel with teeth cut out of its periphery . Each A.C. impulse energises the stator magnets and pulls the rotor round , due to the attraction between the magnets and the teeth or strips of the rotor. // The speed at which such motors run is entirely dependent upon the periodicity , or frequency , of the alternating current supply , and upon the number of poles present in the rotor or stator , whichever is receiving the A.C. It follows , therefore , that if the periodicity of the A.C. supply is absolutely constant , the speed of rotation of the synchronous motor is also constant . Furthermore , if such a motor is coupled to another motor which is inclined ( if left to itself ) to vary in speed slightly , the synchronous motor will keep the second motor running at a constant speed also . Thus , by generating a constant frequency current at the transmitter , causing part of it to control the speed of rotation of the transmitter mechanism , and sending part of it // over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor , the receiving mechanism can be kept running at exactly the same speed as that at the transmitter . The above method gives more accurate control over the two mechanisms than does the previous method of independent control . In the latter method , absolute constancy of the frequency of the controlling current is a sine qua non . In the former method , constancy is not a first requisite , for whatever variations affect the transmitter , they affect the receiver in like degree and absolutely in unison . The system can thus be simplified by dispensing with an elaborate constant frequency generator . In place of it , a small A.C. dynamo can be mechanically coupled to the shaft of the motor which drives the transmitting mechanism , the generated current being sent to the receiver , there to drive the synchronous motor . It then follows that if the transmitter motor varies in speed , the frequency of the output of the A.C. generator will vary , which in turn will cause the speed of the synchronous motor and the receiver driving motor coupled to it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , for they vary in exact unison , and synchronism is still preserved . CHAPTER X METHODS OF SYNCHRONISM ( continued ) IF the transmitting and receiving mechanisms of a phototelegraphy system are not running in synchronism , distortion of the received image is the result . If , throughout the transmission , the receiving mechanism is running consistently faster or slower than the transmitter , the received picture , instead of being square in outline , will appear diamond shaped , and all the details of it will be twisted . If the receiving mechanism is running at times faster , and at times slower , the distortion will be even worse , and may easily render the picture completely unrecognisable . A similar wavy effect could be produced on a wet photographic negative which has been immersed in warm water to soften the film , by running the finger alternately up and down it in parallel lines . In phototelegraphy , given synchronism between the transmitter and receiver , the two mechanisms can be stopped at the end of the transmission of a picture , and simultaneously I19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuring that both mechanisms begin at the proper starting point , in step with each other . In television , however , both mechanisms are running continuously , transmitting and receiving , one after another , sixteen complete pictures per second . Under these conditions it is possible for both mechanisms to be running at the same speed and still the image may be incorrectly received at the distant receiver . This difficulty has given rise to a common misunderstanding , prevalent even in technical circles , which , in turn , has caused the difficulty of synchronism in television to be , to some extent , overrated . It has often been stated that a difference of phase of only z per cent . between the transmitter and receiver is sufficient to spoil the definition of the received image . Were such a statement correct the problem of synchronism would indeed be one of immense difficulty . Fortunately , however , an analysis of the facts shows that if the transmitting and receiving mechanisms are out of phase the image is not blurred , but merely displaced . The definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man 's face , instead of being visible squarely in the centre of the receiving screen , were displaced to right or left , so that his face appeared to be cut off // vertically , say , by the nose . On the other side of the screen the other half of his face would then be visible , also cut off by the nose . In the centre of the screen his right and left ears would be almost touching each other . In phototelegraphy a similar effect would be obtained if , on starting the transmitting cylinder at the beginning of a picture , the receiving stylus were set , not at the commencing end of the cylinder , but somewhere in the middle . If , when the recording stylus reached the end of the cylinder it were to be lifted and set at the other end of it , the correct starting point , the result would be that the left half of the face would be on the right-hand side of the picture , and vice versa . This difficulty can not arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting point is arranged first by hand before starting up . In television , with continuously running mechanisms handling sixteen complete pictures per second , it is not possible to arrange the starting point correctly by hand ; some electrical or mechanical means of doing the job must be found . This is what was meant when it was stated that , in television , synchronism must be carried out , in a sense , to two dimensions . The distortion , or blurring of a television image is caused only by different speeds prevailing at the transmitter and receiver ; // that is to say , by lack of isochronism . Two mechanisms may be in isochronism , and yet not be in synchronism ; and as the distinction between the two expressions may not be familiar to many readers , it may be as well to define it . When two machines are said to be running in isochronism , what is meant is that they are running at the same speed , but are out of step , just as two men 's legs may be out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet of both strike the ground at the same instant . A similar case is that of two clocks which are both keeping perfect time , although the hands of one might point to 2.30 and the hands of the other to three o'clock . Isochronism has been achieved in both cases , but for synchronism to be achieved the two men would have to be what the army calls " in step " and the hands of both clocks would have to indicate exactly the same hour . When the first efforts were made to achieve television , attempts were made to obtain isochronism by means of the methods used in phototelegraphy , briefly referred to in Chapter IX . Such methods , however , do not lend themselves to television , for , as already stated , they are either too complicated or insufficiently accurate , or both . By using synchronous motors , however , perfect isochronism can readily be obtained , // and the mechanical and electrical arrangements involved are not nearly so complicated . It was with the aid of such motors that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baird in April 1925 . At first glance , it might be supposed that isochronism between two television mechanisms could be obtained by using two exactly similar motors controlled by rheostats and run at exactly the same speed , as indicated by some form of speedometer . This can not be done , however , for ordinary electric motors continually vary slightly in speed , due to small variations in the supply current and other reasons . These variations occur too rapidly to be adequately corrected by a handcontrolled rheostat . This habit of variation is known as " hunting , " and before television can successfully be achieved , the hunting propensities of at least one of the machines must be brought under exact control . The main driving motor at the transmitter has this usual tendency to hunt ; and if the system of synchronism employed involves the use of an A.C. generator coupled to its shaft to produce the isochronism impulses , it may be allowed to hunt unchecked , for the periodicity of the generated A.C. varies in exact accordance with its speed wanderings . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver is not allowed to hunt independently . Its speed is under the cast-iron control of the synchronous motor coupled to it ; and as the speed of the latter varies precisely in sympathy with the periodicity changes of the distant A.C. generator , it follows that the main receiver motor must at all times be revolving at exactly the same speed as the main transmitter motor . The fact that they both hunt slightly does not matter , for they hunt in unison . Therefore , isochronism is achieved . There remains now the question of synchronism . That is to say , although we now have the two machines running at exactly the same speed , we have , as yet , no means for adjusting the mechanisms so that they run in phase with each other . As stated earlier on , a difference of phase does not cause blurring of the image or loss of definition . It merely causes a shift of the image as a whole , and this image shift is very simply rectified by the expedient of rotating the receiver driving mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view in its proper place . This rotating action is very similar to the method of adjusting the spark gap of an oldfashioned synchronous spark wireless transmitter . In the latter case , since the revolving electrodes were mechanically coupled to the // shaft of the A.C. generator , the two were , of necessity , in isochronism at all times . The spark , however , might easily be out of phase , as indicated by an apparent violent oscillation back and forth of the revolving electrodes , as viewed end on . To bring the spark into phase , the fixed electrodes were simply rotated round the circumference of the revolving disc until synchronism was indicated by the disc appearing to stand still . The phasing of a television image may also be compared to the action performed by a cinematograph projector operator when the picture appears on the screen with the actors ' feet at the top of the screen and their heads at the bottom , with a dividing line across the middle . All that is required is a simple adjustment to " frame " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given of a television receiver driving mechanism . At the extreme right-hand end of the shaft is the scanning disc . Farther to the left , within the carcass , is the main driving motor , which may be supplied with either D.C. or A.C. , whichever is available . To the left of that is the synchronous motor which controls the speed of rotation of the main motor , giving isochronism . The carcass of these motors is mounted on bearings , so that it can be rotated bodily by means of a handle operating through a worm // gear . This feature is more clearly shown in Fig. 30 . It will be seen that this mechanism has the merit of extreme simplicity , and it would appear to work extremely well in practice , for it is essentially the method used not only by Mr. Baird in this country , but also by the // American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. in their demonstration between Washington and New York . Mr. Baird 's Patent No. 236,978 of 1924 describes this method of rotating the mechanism to obtain synchronism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first successfully to // apply these synchronising principles to television . In practice , after running up to speed both transmitting and receiving mechanisms , and thus automatically achieving isochronism ( by virtue of the control exerted by the synchronous motor ) , all the operator has to do to achieve synchronism is to watch the received image on the screen , and turn the worm gear handle shown in Figs. 29 and 30 until the picture appears on the screen in its proper place ; or in cinematograph parlance , until it is properly " framed . " There remains the question of the transmission to the receiver of the A.C. synchronising current generated at the transmitter . It is , of course , impossible at the present time to transmit power by wireless , or over a telephone line . Therefore , some means must be provided whereby the A.C. can be caused to influence the receiver . This is done by causing the A.C. to modulate the carrier current , in the case of wire communication between two points , or the carrier wave , in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the form of a continuous note of audible frequency , corresponding to the periodicity of the generator output . The American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , when they gave their demonstration , used a separate channel for // the synchronising frequency . At the receiv ing station the synchronising note , after amplification by means of valve amplifiers , is fed to the synchronous motor . To make the entire subject clear to the reader , we will describe the exact apparatus and methods used on the occasion of Mr. Baird 's first public demonstration of tele vision , in April 1925 . At this demonstration , which was an early effort with crude apparatus , outlines were shown ; and two separate channels were used , one for the television impulses , and one for the synchronising im pulses . However , the method employed was essentially the same as that described above . The transmitter was connected to two small frame aerials , one of which transmitted the television signals , while the other transmitted the note caused by the A.C. generator . At the receiving station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two similar frame aerials were employed to pick up the two sets of impulses . The synchronising note , after being picked up by the frame aerial and its associated tuning apparatus , was amplified by a 3-valve Mark IV amplifier , the output of which was connected to a Post Office relay . The ampli fied alternating current , therefore , caused the reed of the relay to make contact first in one direction and then in the opposite direction .
