txt The Minister of Finance , Luis Montes de Oca , in an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES last night discussed un111 a late hour a number of salient features in the Mexican financial and economic situation and particularly the Mexican position regarding international obligations . The first and main question put to the Minister was : " Does Mexico intend to resume interest payments to the International Committee of Bankers on Mexico at the end of June ? " ( That is the date of expiration of the present informal moratorium , under which payments to the Lamont committee have remained suspended since Jan. 1 . ) The Minister replied that the bankers ' representatives who recently left Mexico would first have to report to headquarters the results of their intensive studies of Mexico 's economic situation , for which they were afforded the fullest opportunities during their two months ' stay in the capital . Continuing , Senor de Oca recalled that Mexico at present is meeting the monthly notes against the $2,000 , - 000 loaned in July to cover the balance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current year until December , inclusive . The Minister believed that the bankers will deal with Mexico somewhat on the basis of European countries after the World War  --  that is to say , they will not press to an undue extent the Calles Administration , which has made such great strides toward rehabilitation . He held that this would be the logical policy . Says There Was No Pressure . The Minister emphasized that the Lamont committee has not brought pressure in the slightest degree upon the Calles Government . He added that since the visit of the bankers ' representatives and during the time they were in Mexico City lie has not been in touch with Mr. Lamont except telephonically on minor matters and has not discussed the major problem of renewal of the service on the foreign debt . The general view In local circles is that the Minister will make a trip north to confer with the international committee once the latter has had time to study the report of its representatives . That would be adopting the procedure of former Minister Alberto Pani when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Hu e rta . Asked as to the possibility of the bankers ' new agreement with Mexico being drawn up on a sliding scale basis , in the sense of increasingly large payments being under- taken should the Mexican oil income show the increase expected , Minister de Oca was quick to state that he does not favor such conditions , preferring to know exactly what obligations he will have to provide for . Asked for an expression of opinion on the agrarian bond situation , the Minister stated that the bonds are already drawn by lot and are due , having been payable on Jan. 1 . The amount , roughly a quarter of a million dollars , will be paid in full , he said , before the end of May . Regarding the interest on agrarian bonds in general , some of which are held in the United States by land owners , Senor de Oca said that the Banco de Mexico has already been instructed to pay the same . He added that he believed the payments began yesterday . He Is Reserved on Railways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national railways of Mexico , the Minister was not inclined to talk except to state that the railways are a serious problem which must enter directly or indirectly into any new agreement regarding Mexican national finances . One gathered the impression that at present there is no likelihood of Mr. Thornton 's declarations being published . Asked for a statement regarding the Calles program for irrigation and road construction Senor de Oca said the current year 's budget contains disbursements of $10,000,000 for irrigation work and $5,000,000 for new roads or the completion of those already in hand . He added that the Ministry of Finance has already paid for irrigation work $3,250,000 on account of work done this year and $1,500,000 on the road account , thus being well up-to-date on the year 's program , and assuring an earlier return on the capital invested than was anticipated . On Mexican army expenditure the Minister stated that the budget appropriation for troops of the line , plus the manufacture of munitions totaled in round figures 85,000,000 pesos , or a little less than one-third the total expenditure of the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in the army to about 45,000 men , as against its present strength of upward 60,000 can not be taken , for the moment , into the consideration of national finance , as that project must take time to materialize . The Minister emphasized the importance of the discussion in the coming special sessions in the Mexican Congress . opening on May 14 , of the budget law in which must necessarily come out on the floor . ( although Senor de Oca did not say so ) the question of the extraordinary financial powers of the President . Under present conditions , provided the Calles program is carried out , the expenses of each Government department are regulated by the Ministry of Finance . In this connection the Minister revealed the details of all the Government departments ' expenditure for the current year , from which it was apparent that no leakage was possible . Comparing the expenses of his own department now with that of previous years , there was evident a saving of $4,000,000 for 1928 . The outstanding impression gained in the interview was the Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again hit by unforeseen internal trouble ( discounted by there being now every prospect that the forthcoming Presidential transfer will be effected without untoward incident ) , the republic is reasonably sure of attaining normal financial stability with the prospect , should the oil Income develop , of even better financial conditions than have prevailed for some time .
