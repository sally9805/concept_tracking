Idle vessels of the Shipping Board will be sold at any sacrifice . This decision results from the failure of the Ship Subsidy bill to pass . It is the " liquidation and humiliation " President Harding mentioned in his last message to Congress . <P> Liquidation will mean a saving of $50,000,000 yearly cost of operation of the government-owned merchant marine . The humiliation lies in the " surrender of our aspirations and the confession of our impotence . . . before the competing world . " The ships cost $3,000,000,000 ; they will bring $26,000,000.
