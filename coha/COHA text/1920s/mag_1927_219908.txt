Princeton University , exemplar of educational democracy , last week found itself in the exciting position of one who must reaffirm , or retract , or redefine the policy underlying his conduct . For years Princeton has had an honor system and an undergraduate self-government body , composed of seniors . The honor system has functioned almost perfectly . Undergraduate responsibility has been demonstrated to a lesser degree by the senior council , the powers of which have fluctuated , without ever being very clearly defined , between the purely advisory and the actually administrative . The fluctuation has followed naturally from the changing strength of character in successive classes . Thus , in 1924 the council was so unrepresentative and therefore weak that it was obliged to resign . Last week , a council , full of conviction and therefor strong , resigned by its own choice to force the whole issue of Princeton self-government . <P> Automobiles had become a troublesome problem in Princeton , as elsewhere . Five undergraduate deaths , the poor scholastic standing of 200 student automobile owners and the threat to Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in two hours of the day or night , moved Dean Christian Gauss to ask the senior council to pass a prohibitive ruling . He asked twice . The council took no action . It had passed a rule last spring requiring parental permission for student motors . Cars were not allowed to enter the campus . The council believed that was sufficient prohibition . Dean Gauss went to the university trustees and the prohibition was soon published , a university rule to go into effect next autumn . The senior council tendered , not to the senior class , which had elected it , but to the whole student body , a resignation which said : <P> " . . . The status of student self-government at Princeton appears to us indeterminate . . . . We wish it to be clear that we are expressing neither objection nor approval regarding the act prohibiting cars of the Board of Trustees ... " <P> Chairman Joseph Prendergast of the council later added : " We feel that under the present system the senior council is allowed to pass rulings so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
