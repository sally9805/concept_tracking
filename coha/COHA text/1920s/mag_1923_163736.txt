The lone she-wolf in the historic cage on the Capitol of Rome is dead . <P> The passing of this traditional symbol of Ancient Rome is regarded as an augury of misfortune to the Eternal City . Since time immemorial it has been the custom to keep a wolf on the steps of the Capitol , as well as three eagles , to symbolize the Romulus and Remus legend . <P> It is considered unfortunate that this death should have occurred after Mussolini destroyed the ancient municipal government of Italy 's cap ital and substituted a Commissioner . <P> The authorities have announced that as soon as a new and larger cage is ready a fine young she-wolf will be brought from the Abruzzi Mountains .
