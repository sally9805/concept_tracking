Ivory-white , lipstick-red , and a suave , tawny brown are the colors of Florence Jones . These were colors good enough for smart , expatriate Americans of both hemispheres who discovered " Florence " making excellent waffles in the Rue Pigale some four years ago . Her waffles became a fad , and so many rich waffle eaters washed the golden morsels down with amber champagne that , today , Florence Jones te more purseful than many of her clients . The fact that this handsome Negress , genuinely from Harlem , keeps the smartest boite de nuit* in Paris , was evident again last week , when His Royal Highness , 27-year-old Prince Henry of Britain , strolled into Chez Florence , atop Montmartre , at 3 a. m. , with a highly unofficial entourage . <P> Habitus , such as the Princess Murat , and Sem , famed cartoonist , were unsurprised . What if the third son of George V had come in ? They recalled how once the King-Emperor 's eldest son , on a memorable visit to Chez Florence , called across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many poules do you know in Montmartre ? " <P> Replied Florence : " Poules ? ' chickens , ' your Royal Highness ? " Then , dropping into Harlemese , as she seldom does , Miss Jones addressed the crowd , pointing at Edward of Wales : " Poules ! He as ' me ' bout poules ! Hey-ho ! Haah ! Jus ' look who 's askin ' ! " <P> Edward , fairly caught , laughed among the first ; and since then Miss Jones has been an all-licensed Negress . Nightly she coaxes or drags celebrities out on her jazz floor , makes them perform , makes them ridiculous to their own intense delight-for the crowd are all clannishly impersonal and good-humored . Therefore , last week Prince Henry was not irked when Miss Jones sought to draft him as a contestant in an impromptu black bottom contest . <P> Florence 's chic ankles twinkled toward him . Her figure is svelte , lithe-though she does not dance-her voice sultry , a blues voice . At a curt nod from her the huge , perspiring black who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prince Henry hesitated , then rose , followed Florence out on the floor and black-bottomed . <P> " Hey ! Hey ! " she cried . " Give the little boy a hand ! Hey ! Hey ! " <P> Then to pace His Royal Highness at black bottoming , she called up from the crowd Nora Bayes , Georges Carpentier and Florence Walton. * <P> " Hey ! Hey ! Shake that thing ! " <P> To some present it seemed that Nora Bayes black bottomed better than Prince Henry ; but when the moment of judging came they " gave the little boy a hand . " Florence , stamping her small right foot for quiet , awarded to His Royal Highness the first prize , held it aloft before the crowd , explained in mock Negro dialect : " Dis y'ere fust prize am an ostrich feddah suit o ' cat 's pajamas !
