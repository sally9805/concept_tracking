The London Daily Express comments as follows on the dance endurance craze : <P> " Miss Alma Cummings ( of the United States ) has been dancing since Christmas Day , 1783 ; has worn out several hundred weight of slippers and orchestras , several million needles and four thousand gramophones , by occasionally eating peanuts . " We are not quite sure of our facts but that is near enough . We now suggest that all of us enter into competition for getting down to our jobs without any more of this infernal nonsense !
