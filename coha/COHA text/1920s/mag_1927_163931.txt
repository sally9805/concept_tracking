Freighted with international import two bulky volumes , the Corvina Codices , * arrived last week at Budapest from Rome . Priceless , they had been neither bought nor sold . Down the years they have been a princely gift , transferred from one sovereign to another when great matters loomed . Four centuries ago they were the twin diadems of the great library of Matthias Corvinus , King of Hungary , from whom they take their name . After the Turkish conquest ( 1526 ) they were the spoil of Sultans who admired the exquisite illuminations by Attavantes and Francesco del Cherico , but could not read the text , and therefore bequeathed the codices eventually to the Republic of Venice , whence they passed to Austria as a peace offering in 1847 . At last , in 1919 , Italy wrested them back from Austria-Hungary as part of her spoils from the World War . For Signor Mussolini to bestow two such hard won art treasures upon Hungary seemed a grand gesture made with a purpose . What purpose ? <P> Restoration . The question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people want a king . They already have a kingdom , a " kingless-kingdom " ruled by a regent . Premier Count Stephen Bethlen has mastered the Hungarian Parliament , and can cause it to elect any of the chief claimants to the throne - but the Great Powers must be consulted . <P> Therefore Count Bethlen will go to Rome next month , ostensibly to conclude a treaty of friendship with Italy - actually to discuss with Premier Mussolini which of the two chief Habsburg claimants to the throne of Hungary may be elected - the boy or the man . <P> Boy Otto . The Vatican and His Most Catholic Majesty , Alfonso XIII of Spain , are solidly behind the candidacy of 14-year-old " Little Otto , " Archduke of Habsburg , eldest son and legitimate heir of the late Emperor Karl . King Alfonso has given refuge to " Little Otto " since the War , has supplied his mother , onetime Empress Zita , with funds . Today the Archduke Otto is a handsome lad , busy with algebra , languages and the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Man Albrecht . Premier Mussolini regards with no great liking the possible enthronement of a beardless boy obligated to the Vatican ( See FRANCE ) and Spain . Premier Bethlen , from kindred motives , allegedly favors the election of the Archduke Albrecht* of Habsburg , 29 , a man , and a proven Hungarian patriot . <P> The Archduke Albrecht is only a third cousin once removed of the late Emperor Karl , but his popularity in Hungary is such as to practically insure his election over " Little Otto " if a fair vote can be taken . Albrecht 's mother , shrewd Archduchess Isabella , has prepared his candidacy these many years with a deft political hand . <P> The Powers . Britain , reputedly , has no objection to the ascension of either Otto or Albrecht , though Signor Mussolini is alleged to have secured the special complaisance of Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain toward the candidacy of Man Albrecht . On the other hand , France looks askance at Albrecht for his entanglement in the " patriotic " but ill-advised Hungarian counterfeiting of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
