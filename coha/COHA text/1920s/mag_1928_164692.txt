In most sizable U. S. cities , the policemen at traffic stops or walking their beats in residential districts make a practice of accosting peaceful citizens several times a year and shoving forward a printed ticket in a purposeful way . The ticket often resembles , in color and size , the card that one gets for speeding , parking without lights or committing a nuisance . The citizen 's relief is great when he finds that he has not been arrested , that the ticket is merely an admission to the next policemen 's ball or euchre-fest or field day . The citizen now exhibits his nonchalance in the presence of the Law , also his good-fellowship and good-citizenship , by buying the ticket , or several tickets . Not infrequently the citizen caps his gesture by telling the officer to keep the tickets , pass ' em around to his friends and " kiddies . " The policeman , if not an imbecile , soon peddles the same tickets over again . Policemen being what they so often are , Manhattanites were not surprised last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Police Glee Club , exposed as follows : For two concerts , in halls with a capacity of some 1,000 persons , 40,000 tickets were printed and sold , the bulk of them in night clubs , restaurants , speakeasies . Manhattan 's policemen were not vastly surprised , either , to learn that the Police Glee Club 's accounts , handled by two officers of rank , were $22,000 short .
