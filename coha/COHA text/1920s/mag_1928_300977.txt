Over the week-end and into the dawn of Election Day , the pulse of the nation quickened until it sounded like a machine-gun tattoo or a concentrated yip , yip , hooray . <P> Those who would have given their shirts to be on the sidewalks of New York , or in critical St. Louis , or in gaudy Los Angeles , were jumping rashly at conclusions . The only place , for which it was worth casting to the breeze a shirt , was Chicago , the most exciting city in the nation . This was not due merely to pineapples and racketeers . True , there were four bombings as the election approached , but they did not cause much damage and nobody bothered about them . They did not count . In Chicago an election means fun , excitement . Calliopes in the crowded Loop , red-fire in Grant Park , an almost continuous uproar in the Black Belt ; 1,000 stump orators stumping , spouting , shouting on sidewalks , in public halls , in theatres , in real theatres where they have real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about the sidewalks of Chicago , which last week were certainly the most excitable sidewalks in the world . They were more excitable , some said , than during last April 's local elections in which the Thompson machine was broken and a laugh sent round the world . <P> In Chicago , even the ubiquitous art of stumping has a peculiar technique . For example , Anton J. Cermak , wet Democratic nominee for U. S. Senator , got up on the stage of the Garrick Theatre and produced a photostatic copy of a hospital chart , showing that his Republican opponent , Otis F. Glenn , had received treatment for delirium tremens in 1912 . Then Mr. Cermak cried : " I have affidavits here that this man Glenn , accompanied by Prohibition agents , visits stills and breweries , running illegally , and drinks so much that they have to carry him from there . " <P> Thus Chicago , last week-up and away with a whoop and an " I WILL " boost-Harold Fowler McCormick for Smith , Julius Rosenwald for Hoover , William Hale Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible fight for the post of State 's Attorney .
