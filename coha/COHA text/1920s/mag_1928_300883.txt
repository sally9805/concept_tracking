NEW DIMENSIONS-Paul T. Frankl-Payson &; Clarke ( $6 ) . <P> From elaborate exhibits in museum and department store to window displays in cheap furniture shops , " modern decorative art " has been thrust at last upon the U. S. public . Justification is now undertaken by Paul Frankl , enthusiastic creator of skyscraper dressing tables , who traces origins in Austria , Germany , and , above all , Paris , where dressmakers felt the need of new backgrounds for their simple ( but oh so intricate ) knee-length frocks . In a spirit of cooperation , the new decorator therefore scraps everything old ( the pyramids excepted ) , and matches modern life with " simple rhythmic combinations of masses , " and sharp color contrasts , rather than the " sentimental combinations " of Chippendale , of Louis Quinze . <P> Author Frankl does not prove that " simplicity " does match modern life . Nor does he recognize that his " simplicity " is rather the affectation of simplicity-witness a creation entitled " lady 's whimsical desk built like a puzzle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
