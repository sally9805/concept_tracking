txt When Reginald , former British Chancellor of the Exchequer and now one of the foremost English bankers , called on Premier Poincar4 yesterday it was , he explained , merely a courtesy visit . The French Prime Minister , he said , was an old friend with whom he had collaborated in working out his contribution to the Dawes plan . On the Premier 's side the same reticence was maintained . The visit was merely one of courtesy , it was asserted . Today , however , a different character is being put on the visit at least to the extent that the courtesy has been enlarged . Mr. came on a mission and not as a tourist . He came as spokesman , not only of British , but also of American banks , not to give M. Poinca.rd advice , but to indicate to him what would be done in the happy event of France seeing fit to ratify the debt agreements with her creditors and in the other happy event of her stabilizing her money . The French Premier 's success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point at which it was six months ago has been so spectacular that it has contributed not a little to his reluctance to admit that Stabilization by victorious France must be done at a rate far below the pre-war value of the franc . Even now , , when faced with the difficulties incident to the franc having reached nearly the saffid internal as external value , the Premier is unwilling definitely to admit that its complete revalorization is not possible . He has recently sought to gain time in order to see what would happen , and that desire is as much responsible for the delay in the ratification of the Washington agreement as is the opposition in the Chamber of Deputies . Mr. 's visit was made to lay before the Premier an outline of the help which France could count upon in the event of her stabilizing the franc , as the Belgians have done . He has denied that there was any question of a loan discussed between the two , and this of course is perfectly accurate . The matter has not yet reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leave with the Premier , to be communicated in interested quarters was that both British and American financiers were prepared to make large and continuous investments in French industries if and when the franc was stabilized , investments which would enormously help in the debt payments . What influence the conversation will have on the Premier 's policy It is far too early to guess . He is anxious that , so far as possible , stabilization of the franc should be done by France alone , without too great a recourse to foreign credit , and it will be some time before he will be able to see his way clear . Nothing certainly will be done until after the passage of the budget toward the end of December . Help to France Long Discussed . For many months there had been discussion both in this country and abroad as to the likelihood of American financial help to France in her economic rehabilitation . Then two months ago the possibility that British and American bankers would join in assisting France by means of extensive loans if the debt settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the franc was expressed by James Speyer , bahker , on his return from his annual trip to Europe . At that time Mr. Speyer said he was much impressed with the manner in which English bankers had brought the pound sterling back to parity and had discussed that and other financial matters with Sir Montague Norman , the Governor of the Bank of England , at length . He said that it was very much to be hoped that the French people , in their own , as well as in the general interest , would accept the debt settlement terms of the United States and British Governments , which was the prerequisite to stabilization . " The countries of the European Continent must help themselves and each other in a spirit of good-will , " he said . " There is something in the meantime that we can do to help them , and , that is to continue to loan them working capital whenever it is safe and in the public interest to do so . " Stabilization of the French currenclf has been the subject of discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months . The franc , which was on a basis of 19.3 cents before the war , is now quoted at 3.31 cents .
