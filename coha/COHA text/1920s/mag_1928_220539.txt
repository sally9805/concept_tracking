Highest reasons of state caused Premier Raymond Nicholas Landry Poincar to speed , last week , from Paris to Strasbourg . Though the city is chiefly famed for producing pts de foie gras and as the place where La Marseillaise was composed , Strasbourg loomed last week exclusively as the political focus of Alsace-Lorraine . <P> Today two vital events impend in these onetime " Lost Provinces , " which were regained by France from Germany at the close of the War : 1 ) Throughout Alsace-Lorraine there will shortly be tried numerous pro-German citizens charged with plotting against France ; 2 ) At the very time when passions are being stirred by these trials , Alsace-Lorrainers will be casting ballots in the French general election of this Spring . <P> Clearly it behooved Premier Poincar , last week , to meet the challenge of both these coming events by delivering a speech which would fire Alsace-Lorrainer with especial loyalty to France . <P> Mayors . Before a banquet audience of 559 Alsace-Lorraine mayors , M. Poincar rose up to speak , in Strasbourg . He who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forensically vivid .

With the matter of those to be tried thus disposed of , Premier Poincare turned to electioneering pure and simple . Fervently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " France never formulated the idea of revanche* . . . We waited immobile and anxious before the sphinx of Destiny until the day when the Imperial Governments of Austria and Germany , drunk with pride , loosed on their peoples and ours that catastrophe which until the last minute we strove to avoid . . . . On that day of days we were free again , and we swore never to lay down our arms before we had assured the double deliverance of Alsace and Lorraine . ' ' <P> Most significant and worth re-reading are the above sentences , when it is remembered that historians generally deem M. Poincar an authentic pre-War apostle of revanche . By his own statement of last week he welcomed the War , once it had been begun , with an holy joy . Enemies are not lacking to charge that , as President of France ( 1913-1920 ) , M. Poincar schemed with Russia to precipitate the War . <P> " Young Alsace . " Orator Poincar concluded his electioneering appeal last week , thus :      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
