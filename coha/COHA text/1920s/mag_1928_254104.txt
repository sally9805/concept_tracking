Mrs. Theresa Rummel , 82 , sat in a front pew and wept while her son , the Right Rev. Joseph F. Rummel , was consecrated Bishop of Omaha , Neb . Besides Mrs. Rummel , St. Patrick 's Cathedral , Manhattan , held a throng of church dignitaries - Patrick Joseph Cardinal Hayes , three Archbishops , eleven Bishops , 49 Monsignori and not many less than 1,000 priests . <P> Bishop Rummel , whose churchly duties have hitherto been confined to metropolitan regions , must have had strange feelings of dismay mixed with his anticipations of the journey that lay before him . In Manhattan , a pastor 's flock often contains a goodly proportion of black sheep ; but on Nebraska 's plains , what agile and goatish rams must gambol and run ; what wild shy ewes upon its crooked paths ! Nonetheless , when the rites of consecration were over , Bishop Rummel made a short , genial speech , then conferred upon his mother , who was still crying while she knelt , his first Bishop 's blessing .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
