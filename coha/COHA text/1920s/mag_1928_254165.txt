Godfrey-Risko . There is always one fighter among heavyweight fighters who is called the Black Menace . It used to be Wills . Now , as everyone knows , it is George Godfrey , Alabama blackamoor . To be the black menace a fighter must be big . Godfrey weighs 245 pounds when he is thin . The Black Menace must have beaten up a lot of inferior fighters . Godfrey fought 16 times last year , scored 16 knockouts . Above all , to be the Black Menace , it must be rumored that he is : 1 ) so formidable that the heavyweight champion is afraid of him , and 2 ) crooked . Godfrey fulfills these conditions . He is very good-natured and always smiles kindly and hideously at his opponents . His larded body melts with any exertion , making him hard to hold in clinches . He has enormous strength and likes checked neckties , pork chops , going to the zoo , and resting . This week , after much palaver and two postponements because of rain , he climbed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland . <P> McLarnin-McGraw . James McLarnin , lightweight who has a cherub 's face and wears a harp on his bathrobe , who knocked out Sid Terris with one punch but who could n't lay a glove on Champion Samuel Mandell , feinted with his left last week in Madison Square Garden , then crossed his right to the retreating but tough chin of Phillip McGraw , lightweight from Marathon , Greece , knocking him through the ropes into the lap of one of the judges . McGraw climbed back , was knocked down three times more , after which , amid cries of " Stop it , " Referee Dorman lifted Mc-Larnin 's hand . <P> Hudkins-Walker . Ace Hudkins , pal of Charles Lindbergh , bouquet-lover , and broken nosed punch-drinker who fights flail-fisted , lunged after middleweight champion Mickey Walker in a wet ring in Chicago . Rain on the canvas was stained with the blood that flowed from the lips and noses of both men . Walker won two rounds , Hudkins five , the rest were even . When the referee , with finger pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion . . . . " the crowd jumped up and booed for 15 minutes .
