James Cannon Jr. , militant dry , Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , was lately revealed to have had extensive stock transactions with a bankrupt Manhattan bucketshop ( TIME , July 1 ) . Cannon critics questioned whether such dealings were worthy of a Churchman . <P> Last week Bishop Cannon fired back . He sent a telegram to ecclesiastical journals , widely reprinted . Excerpts : " I DESIRE THE CHURCH TO KNOW THAT I SHALL AT THE PROPER TIME ASK FOR FULL INVESTIGATION OF ALL CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST ME , EVEN THOUGH INSTIGATED BY ENEMIES , AND DISTORTED , AND MISREPRESENTED BY HOSTILE WET PRESS . FRIENDS CONFERRED WITH THINK IT UNWISE TO ASK FOR SUCH CHURCH ACTION UNTIL COMPLETION OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS . . . . MEANTIME , I SIMPLY STATE TO MY BRETHREN THAT I HAVE NOT VIOLATED ANY CIVIL OR MORAL LAW . " <P> Meanwhile cannonading began from another side . The New York World , famed capital wetpaper , detailed the following history , calculated further to embarrass Bishop Cannon : In 1917 ( just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 650 barrels of flour in the name of Blackstone College for girls , a Virginia Methodist College of which he was president . The purchase was brought to the attention of Food Administrator Herbert Hoover who referred the matter to Roland William Boyden , Chief Food Administration enforcement officer . <P> Mr. Hoover approved the Boyden report which read : " The man Bishop Cannon is clearly a hoarder . . . because he held flour in a quantity in excess of his reasonable requirements . . . . Even if we assume that he really bought the flour for the benefit of the college , he is still a hoarder , for he held enough for three years ' supply . ... He is , by so doing , depriving some portion of the community of its fair share of a scarce food product . The better educated a man is the more clearly he ought to see this moral principle .
