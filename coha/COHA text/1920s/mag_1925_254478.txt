Figures from Egypt on the general election just held show that ex-Premier Zaghlul Pasha just missed winning a remarkable victory . His party , the Nationalist , won 101 of the 215 seats , but the returns were not complete . <P> The combined anti-Zaghlulist Parties also secured 101 seats ; and of the 13 remaining seats , not more than two were expected to go to the Zaghlulists .

But as Premier he would have been persona nan grata to the London Government , because , as before , he would undoubtedly carry on propaganda through his Nationalist organization , the Wadf , against the " usurper " of Egyptian rights . <P> Another aspect of the case concerns King Fuad , who , by appointing Ziwar Pasha Premier last Autumn , definitely ranged himself against Zaghlul , whom he has never liked . According to current report in Cairo , Zaghlul intended to depose the monarchy and declare Egypt a republic in the event that he received a majority of the votes in the past election . <P> With Ziwar Pasha likely to remain in power , Egyptian policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods , while recognizing Britain 's right to protect the Suez Canal , " the Gateway to India " and loyally cooperating in the joint administration of the Sudan .
