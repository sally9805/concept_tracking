txt It is BARRIE , the creator of Peter Pan , the child who ? never grew up , and of Sentimental Tommy , who also seemed loath to grow up  --  having a suspicion of what was in store for him  --  it is this discoverer of perpetual youth , . this Ponce de Leon of literature , who has proposed a world League of Youth ; seeing that the League of Nations is run by older people . He insists that this is not the suggestion of the whimsical , fanciful , unruly , writing half of himself , whom he calls " McConachie . " It is his " dour and practical and canny " half that is making the proposal with all ; the seriousness of a Prime Minister or a Prasident . Here is his first pronouncement , in what be has called his last speech , addressed specifically to the young men ? of St. Andrews University in ' Scot/and : ; You have more ' in common with the youtfi of other lands than ' the youth of any age can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent out many sons very like ours , from the same sort of homes and the same sort of universities , with the same sort of hearts , who had as little as ours to do with the great ad- , venture of war . Yet the fanciful , whimsical half interrupts and asks whether we . can doubt ? that many of those , from both sides who ' have gone into the beyond and who were once opponents are now friends . Then the ' dour , canny self resumes , " You " ought to league youth as your prac " tical beginning . " Then Sir JAMES intimates that youth will have . to work harder , " possibly not --  so ' much at the same things , " and- will have for one thing to learn other languages . work should some day be lessened by the adoption of a common language of international intercourse , be it some artificial language ' or Latin , which Miss MAUDE ( ADAMS , the personified I'eter Pan , has herself proposed should'be taught . BARRIE is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross , with its millions of youthful Membersik America alone , seized upon the needs of the suffering in other lands during the war to establish relationship which had . a speech all its . own , though for - the - most part of narrow range . Out of it , however , came exchanges . between children of differing- languages= that hare ' even --  enriched . literature ; 6r-example , the letter of the-little French schoolgirl to American children , beginning " It was only a little brook . " The , Boy Scouts have in their " tests " prepared another article for the Covenant of the League of Youth . If the Lord Rector of St. Andrews , with his practical self and his fanciful self united , were to summon the youth of the world to such ' an association , the world could well afford to give not merely the meager apount that Sentimental Tommy 's schoolmaster would have given to know what he " would be ten years from now , " but the whole sum of the interallied debts if only it could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be youth 's earth a few years from row , and we must try to prevent in them the stupidity and jealousy and distrust which may even now be leading their elders " doddering dawri'some brimstone path .
