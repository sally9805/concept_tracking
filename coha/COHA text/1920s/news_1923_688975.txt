txt Harry Houdini , President of the Society of American Magicians , called up THE NEW YORE : TIMES by telephone yesterday and denounced as " an outright fake " alleged spirit manifestations by George Valentine . spiritualistic medium of Wilkes-Barre , which he and other members of a special test committee observed at a seance arranged by the Scientific American at its office in the Woolworth Building last Wednesday night . Houdini then proceeded to tell what happened at the seance , at which a Tiassa reporter was present . By agreement , the results of the test had not been published . J. Malcolm Bird , associate editor of The Scientific American , said last ' night that while the statements made by Houdini about the incidents of the last seance were substantially correct . Houdini 's revelations were made with- i out authority and in violation of an understanding , shared by all members of the committee which managed the tests , that none of the results should be made public until authorization was given by The Scientific American . " And please say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is through right now as a member of that committee and make it plain that he is through because he has violated that understanding . " Houdini 's reason for making his statements was , as he explained , that he had been taunted by his friends with " being such a simpleton " as to take any stock in the seance proceedings , and he could not permit his friends to believe that he was convinced of its genuineness . He asserted that he attended the demonstration under no restriction . Valentine is the first of the recognized mediums of the United States to try to win the $5,000 prize offered by The Scientific American to any one who can produce genuine manifestations of psychic phenomena . He met a selected group of expert observers in a room of The Scientific American hung with black draperies to shut out the light , but equipped with various ingenious devices to detect fraud . Here is Houdini 's story of the result ; Houdini 's Story of the Test . " The man came there to win the $5,000 prize , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what his game was . I went there at the invitation of The Scientific American . and I feel at liberty to tell just what happened . There was no string tied to My invitation and I was not pledged to secrecy , although there has been an awful lot of - reticence : on the part of those Who siere  --  rea:int . " The chairs of , the : - judges . were arranged in a circle , with the chairs - Of the medium and his --  atesistante in the middle of the circle . ' The - chairs in which the medium and his assistant eat were rigged with eleetriea/ cOntacts : so that when the medium got out of his chair contacts were established and excited an electric light in an adjoining room . " In the adjoining rcreni-sat.cithee - servers , including a young-womaa stenographer who , as I understand it , listened through a dictaphone which indicated whether the ' spirit voice ' of the medium or his helper originated at ? .

" He was asked if he had any faith in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's psychic pictures and other evidence : aura:Lofting spiritualism . Houdini explained That Sir Arthur was one of the guests invited to a magic dinner given by the Society of American Magicians a year ago , at which Sir Arthur mystified many of magicians and their guests with an exhibition of motion pictures of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals filmed at a trick laboratory over in New JerseySince that night Conan Doyle has been Quoted as saying some severe things about the magicians , whom he called trialtaters ..
