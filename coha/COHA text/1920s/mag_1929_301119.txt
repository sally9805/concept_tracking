Britain 's Christmas waits ( streetwalking carol-singers ) last week had a new carol to add to their repertoire of Wenceslas , God Rest Ye Merry , Gentlemen , and ' Ark The ' Erald Haingels Sing . Sir Edward Elgar , potent and pontifical British composer and conductor , master of the King 's music , had composed one especially to celebrate the recovery of his Majesty George V. <P> Some weeks ago Sir Edward browsed through a volume of poems by medieval George Gascoigne ( 1535-77 ) entitled A hnndreth Sundrie Floures bound up in one small Posie . Gathered Partely ( by translation ) in the fyne outlandish gardens of Euripides , Ovid , Petrarke , Ariosto and others ; and partely by invention out of our own fruitful orchardes in Englande . Yielding Sundrie Savours of tragical , comical and moral discourse , bothe pleas-aunt and profitable , to the well smelling noses of learned Readers . The well-smelling nose of Sir Edward unearthed a hymn which seemed to him highly appropriate . Its last verse : <P> The rainbow bending in the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God on high And seems to tell the news That as thereby he promised To drown the world no more So by the blood which Christ hath shed . He will our health restore . <P> This he set to music and retitled " Good Morrow ! A simple carol for His Majesty 's happy recovery . " It was far from simple . Sir Edward Elgar 's best known composition is " Pomp and Circumstance . " It is a favorite cinema overture , its ponderous measures boom weekly from radio loud speakers . <P> ' " Good Morrow ! ' " cabled London correspondents , " has stirring crescendos and rich harmonic effects . "
