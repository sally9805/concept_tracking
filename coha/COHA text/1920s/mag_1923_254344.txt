( Prophets say that he may be Presidential nominee in 1924 . ) <P> Senator Robinson is a fighting Southerner who talks with his fists . Born with a red-headed temper , he soon acquired freckles . But years of law and politics have induced a certain amiability , so that he now enjoys fishing . <P> He was permanent chairman of the San Francisco convention which nominated Cox . <P> Most famous of all his speeches was that against La Follette immediately before America entered the war . The most famous fortnight of his career was in 1912 , when he went from Representative to Governor to Senator-elect within 14 days . <P> He managed a Child Labor bill which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional , and the daylight-saving law of war-times . <P> The immediate destinies of the Democratic party are largely within Senator Robinson 's control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
