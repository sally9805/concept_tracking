One day last week , the King-Emperor slipped on his silk stockings , donned regal robes and with the Queen-Empress drove from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster , where sit at their Parliamentary sessions the Lords &; Commons . <P> Through the streets of London stirred a cold fuliginous fog . The King 's coach , drawn by eight superb horses , moved gingerly . The Beefeaters from the Tower of London who marched beside it seemed like ghosts who now and again disappeared into a slowly rolling gust of fog . Ghostly , too , was the scant crowd which peered at the nearly invisible Royal procession . <P> At Westminster , the King retired to the Robing Room where with help of chamberlains he donned " the ermine , the purple and the crown . " Then he and Queen Mary entered the great Gothic hall of the House of Lords . <P> Resplendently clad Peers and heavily robed bishops rose . In the galleries diamonded Peeresses stared , rustled , bowed . Lights blazed and kindled the darting iridescences of a thousand gems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous Cullinan Diamond which , as all could see , the Queen-Empress was wearing ( see p. 50 ) . <P> His Majesty strode to the Throne . His train stretched behind him , his crown flashed . Then he turned and faced his Ministers and the Lords of his Realm . The Commons were summoned and appeared . All was in readiness for the King to open Parliament with his Speech from the Throne . <P> What would the King say ? For everyone knows that it is not really his own speech which the King reads , but Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin 's speech . And everyone knew , last week , that on the previous day the great Liberal peer , Viscount Grey of Fallodon ( Foreign Secretary from 1905 to 1916 , had ended his long political silence , had risen like a disturbing , provoking ghost , and had bitterly flayed the Conservative British Government for concluding with France the recent and notorious naval and military agreement or Pact ( TIME , Aug. 13 , et seq . ) . <P> Ghost Grey reverberantly charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so embittered Anglo-U . S. relations that only the most reassuring moves by the British Government can win back U. S. goodwill . <P> " What we want to be sure of , " cried Lord Grey , " is that the Government has instructed the Admiralty that in drawing up the program of British naval requirements it should not take the United States fleet into account . Previous British Governments have never done that . <P> " The principle on which the Canadian boundary is secure is the only method on which Anglo-American security can be maintained . . . . <P> " The military as well as the naval part of the British and French bargain must be declared null and void . " <P> What answer would the King 's speech make to Ghost Grey , a Liberal whose fame recalls the bygone years when Britain 's cabinet was also Liberal ? <P> Commenced the King : " My relations with the foreign powers continue to be friendly . . . . " Ears strained to hear the bugaboo name of the Anglo-French Pact . But His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renouncing war ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) , and omitted entirely to discuss that other Pact on which all thoughts were focused .
