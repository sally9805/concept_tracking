Illiteracy , like all evils , is sometimes a blessing . So thinks the Russian Ministry of Education , at all events . Of late the Ministry took the Russian alphabet in hand , examined it for superfluous members , pruned here , excised there , threw five letters out bodily , published a new , curtailed alphabet which shortens the written Russian language by one-twelfth and makes its spelling " twice as logical . " It was pointed out that had not illiteracy abounded in Russia , the Ministry would have encountered the same difficulty faced by the late Theodore Roosevelt <P> and other advocates of simplified spelling in the U.S. - namely , that of making a whole people unlearn the teachings of its childhood . Last week 's issue of Science ( news pamphlet for scientists ) contained comment by Dr. John P. Harrington , ethnologist of the Smithsonian Institution ( Washington , D. C ) . Said he : <P> " The changes should effect a saving about four years out of the education every Russian child and they reduce the cost of printing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' For instance , the Russians were " two kinds of ' e . ' One word might require the variety of ' e ' known as ' ye ' and another would call for the ' e ' known as ' yat . ' . . . <P> " The question was raised in the Ministry of Education of introducing the Roman alphabet , which is the one we use in writing English , instead of the modified Greek character in which Russian has always been written . Psychologists claim that the Roman small letters , with their projections above and below the line , present a contour more readily grasped by the eye than the ' solid blocks of Russian lower case characters . Thus MAJILHHK which <P> the Russian word for ' boy , ' in Russian type is a rectangle , while ' boy ' in Roman type has projecting signals . But the advocates of retaining and <P> ' scientificizing ' the Russian alphabet <P> prevailed . "                   @ @
