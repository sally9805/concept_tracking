Had the Mayor of Chicago been in the McMillin Academic Theatre at Columbia University last week he might well have yelped and yarred in anti-British fury . <P> Presiding at a debate was Prof. David Saville Muzzey , author of a U. S. history deemed pro-British and pernicious by " Big Bill " Thompson , and declared by him unfit for Chicago schools . Further his mayoral anglophobia would have been irritated by the fact that three of the debaters were British students . <P> The debaters : from Oxford University , Alan T. Lennox-Boyd , C. S. Malcolm Brereton , Dingle M. Foot ; from Columbia , Lawrence A. Tassi , William T. Matthews , Kenesaw Mountain Landis. * <P> The Subject : Resolved : That America Should Join the League of Nations . <P> The Oxford students supported the affirmative , won the debate by vote of the audience . Fluent , suave Mr. Lennox-Boyd was first speaker . Witty , he amused the audience by describing the difficulties of speaking with an English accent to citizens of the U. S. <P> Later in the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students from Yale . The subject : Resolved : That This House Believes that the Best Life is the Public Life . <P> No vote was taken to determine the winners . Fluent , suave Mr. Lennox-Boyd was first speaker . Witty , he amused the audience by describing the difficulties of speaking with an English accent to citizens of the U. S. <P> The Oxford students have been in the U. S. in accord with an annual custom of sending an English debating team to the U.S. <P> In Boston , Harvard debaters defeated Yale debaters . The audience voted 848 to 225 that " Al Smith Should be Elected President . " <P> *Nephew of famed " Baseball Tsar " Landis , senior at Columbia . He entered the University when he was 15 , wore short pants and black ribbed stockings through his Freshman year . His ambition to be a coxswain was frustrated by his mother who would not permit a nonswimming son on the Harlem River . His hair is usually tousled , his eyes sleepy , and great is his aptitude for poker . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ford , however , would not run . His interest in baseball is only casual .
