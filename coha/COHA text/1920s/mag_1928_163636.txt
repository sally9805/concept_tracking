SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY-Dawn Powell-'Brentano ( $2.50 ) . There is a theory , which many U. S. writers and critics clasp tightly in their teeth , that the Great American Novel will come , like young Lochinvar , out of the Great Middle West . As a result , the saga of Gopher Prairie has been rewritten backward , forward , and on the head of a pin . In its latest form it is the story , mainly , of Dorrie Shirley , a sensitive little girl who had a warm disposition , a prim and unsympathetic sister called Linda , and a grandmother called " Aunt Jule , " who ran a ramshackle hotel in an Ohio village . <P> Dorrie Shirley sat up in the garret with the oldest lodger in the hotel listening to him read ; or she watched , with fascinated interest , the two-a-day theatrical folk , the bawdy country wenches , the flabby townspeople , the cheap sports who came to lodge at Aunt Jule 's place . She was terrified when she saw the loveliest lady who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , beside the town drunkard . She helped Linda get the smooth slick townboy that her sister had always loved ; and she observed with hurt wonder and dismay the way her own high-school boy friends turned away from her as they grew old enough to appreciate the fact that her guardian ran a fairly disreputable boarding place . When the old lodger in the garret died , his grandson came west from Harvard . He was what Dorrie had wanted and she , apparently , suited him . At the end of the story , it is a comparatively safe guess that Dorrie will come to Manhattan , get her poems published and write a novel whose heroine is a dreamy little girl called Dawn Powell . <P> She Walks in Beauty runs true to type ; but it is a sincere book and one that has hunger in it , an important quality and a rare one in flatland fiction . When Author Dawn Powell misdescribes her <P> Harvard man hero , you feel she does it because she , like Dorrie , had a longing for and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , is perhaps the kind of girl who would be pleased if someone called her a dreamer of dreams . But so , almost certainly , is Author Powell ; and it is very pleasant , now , when most first-novelists are either rabid and wild-eyed sophisticates or intellectual inverts with empty heads , to read what has been written by someone who is neither ashamed or proud of naivete , who carries in her mind the torture of youth more brightly than its touch . The book is as interesting as a secret ; it is too bad that Author Powell speaks on page 6 of Aunt Jule 's " black hair piled in sleek coils " and on page 191 of Aunt Jule remembering " her hair , golden like Linda 's . . . " but only people who read books in bed instead of on the subway will notice such trivial but important discrepancies . '
