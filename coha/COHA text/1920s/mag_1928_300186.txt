&gt; There are rare moments in sport when a game becomes more than a game ; when chance permits a climax beyond the ability of art , to arrange a climax remote from the pattern of the game and in itself glorious or sad . Such a moment occurred last week at the end of the football game in which Notre Dame played against the Army . <P> Notre Dame has a famous football coach , Knute Rockne , who never turns out feeble teams . Yet he has off-seasons and he remarked last week , " I am not worrying this year-I only worry when I have a good team and expect to see it win . " Rockne moved about the country followed not by one Notre Dame team but by several ; he arrived in Manhattan with three last week and sent one of them onto the field in the Yankee Stadium where 80,000 people were watching , to play against the Army . Notre Dame has lost two games this year ; the Army has beaten Harvard and Yale but no team has beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Notre Dame cheering section was weak , while two thousand soldiers wrapped in their grey capes roared . They expected to see famed Chris Cagle , the Army halfback , rush through the little men in front of him . Instead , whenever he took the ball , a flock of Notre Dame players started at him like birds which he could not brush away . In the second half it was not Cagle 's brilliance but the slow rush of the whole team that brought the ball up the field for a touchdown ; somehow Notre Dame struggled back again with it and scored six points to tie . Then at the end of the last quarter Rockne sent in a substitute lineman called Johnny O'Brien , who caught a pass on the goal line and made the score 12 to 6 in favor of Notre Dame . The teams lined up for the kickoff ; there was a minute to play . <P> Cagle caught the kick-off and ran 60 yards ; he carried the ball through the line for 15 . It moved to the 20-yard line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then from the sidelines of the dark quiet field the timekeeper blew his whistle . <P> &gt; Maryland , a supposed set-up chosen for the week before the Princeton game , smashed Yale 6-0 , and smashed also Johnny Garvey , Yale 's star halfback . <P> &gt; Navy tied Michigan 6-6 . <P> &gt; Penn played Harvard on a slow field ; but the Penn team was mightier than the sward and won 7-0 . <P> &gt; Carnegie Tech beat Georgetown 13-0 . <P> &gt; A short pass from California 's big Barr to Eisan beat Washington 6-0 . <P> &gt; Herbert Hoover watched Stanford beat Santa Clara in Palo Alto 31-0 . <P> &gt; Georgia Tech , which beat Notre Dame , beat Vanderbilt 19-7 . <P> &gt; Mayes McLain , a redskin Indian , made a touchdown in Columbus , Ohio ; and Iowa beat Ohio State 14-7 . <P> &gt; Unbeaten teams at this point : Iowa , Carnegie Tech , Georgia Tech , Florida . Tennessee , Southern California ( one tie ) , Wisconsin ( one tie ) , Princeton ( two ties ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
