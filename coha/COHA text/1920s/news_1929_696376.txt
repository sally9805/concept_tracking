txt THE TAXICAB PROBLEM . Suggestions Are Made for Lower Rates and Less Congestion . To the Editor of The New York-Times : . It has often been said by those interested . In maintaining a higher rate of fare and more expensive and cumbersome equipment that to eliminate cruising would cause an appreciable loss to operators and a reduction of the number of . taxicabs now operating . Well , . what of it ? It is a fact that if cruising were eliminated taxicabs , as in bygone years , would still be subject to call by telephone and a comprehensive rapid service afforded to the public . This would necessitate the establishing of garages and stands with publicly advertised telephone numbers at strategical points throughout the city where taxicabs could be kept subject to call . The effect of this would be a tremendous relief to congestion , a better taxicab service to the public and a general stabilization of the industry . The argument might be advanced that this would prove ruinous to the independents . But those who'are familiar with the facts know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it might be , . is in effect now among the independents , who for the most part.occupy " . stands established by themselves at certaie subway , elevated and ferry stations and hotels , who have- made it a practice to take the line daily and in this manner have establishedtlielistands . So that here , in fact we find the very solution to the problem of the cruiser who has been the cause either directly or indirectly of the congestion , accidents , increased insurance rates and the . general difficulties arising from operation by the hit-and-miss method of cruising . Competition being admittedly the life of trade , why , then , should we listen to so much bunk about endangering investments by permitting such a vehicle as the Ford taxicab to come in and reduce the rate of fare and the cost of equipment and main-tenance ? Why not let those who manufacture the so-called luxurious , highpriced equipment , with their demand for a higher rate of fare , manufacture a less . costly taxicab , So that both the ? public and the operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic congestion build shorter wheel-base cabs ? ? In the autoniobile industry competition has ever been an important factor . Ford , Chevrolet and a host of other popular-priced makes manage to sell a large number of the lower priced cars . On the other hand , ' Cadillac , Pierce-Arrow , Packard and others manage to get along after a fashion by selling a proportionate amount of higher priced quality cars . Therefore , why should there be any difference among manufacturers of taxicabs if there is a market for the high-class , luxurious type of cab with its necessary high rate of fare ? Why should there not be a lower priced taxicab to be operated at a lower rate ? The public should be left to choose , and the operator would be coMpelled to render a - real highclass service , whether it be with highclass cabs at higher rates or small cabs at a lower rate , by ? the establishing of telephone points and the elimination of cruising , which would result in establishing a greater reliability and responsibility among operators , reduction in accidents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , satisfaction and safety all around . EMIL LEINDORF . New York , June 29 , 1929 . TARIFF AND EQUITY .. - Operation of the Law Ignores the Rights of the Consumer . To the Editor of The New tore ? times : The present remarkable production of Congress in the way of a tariff bill makes one compare the fundamentals governing protection as Fordneyized and Grundyized to other statutes intended to protect interests here . Take as a notable example the interstate commerce law . This declares emphatically that " all rates must be reasonable and just . " It also provides against discrimination between localities and individuals . This is in sharp contrast to any tariff legislation , present or previous , going back in my own memory for half a century . In tariff only one element is considered , the producer . But as I recall the statistics , our largest industry in numbers and capital ' invested is agriculture , with transportation a good  --  second . Neither of these shares in Fordneyism , nor do the people in the capacity of consumers get any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two major elements of industry , not to mention the consumers , get the marble heart . I refuse to see in manufacturing , which- gets all the tariff benefits , any superior sort of clay . vested with divine rights to make the vast majority pay through the nose merely to satisfy the greed of overprotected dealers . Perhaps it might be well to define exactly what constitutes an honest tariff . This should be limited to exact difference of production costs here . and - abroad , less all costs of transportation and customs fees , including consular invoices , which the importer has to pay but from which domestic " dealers are free . Yet today I learn from customs brokers that we are actually applying an American valuation on imports . plus our tariff charges . Upon a strictly square basis , if American values apply , why the need of any tariff to protect from cheaper foreign costs ? These things illustrate how fir from an even deal the high ' tariff fanatics have drawn us . There are numerous . other defects about Fordney-Grundyism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injurious even to its beneficiaries , as undue tariff merely makes smuggling and undervaluation profitable . Like prohibition , it leads to endless fraud and injustice . Is it not time we-started things going right ?

Though , in the meantime , our own leaders - at home ' will continue to wear pink satin night shirts with Sanskrit and other maxims writ upon their turbans . What a set of Boeotians we are !

We shall ? buy armament ; we shall have the strongest navy and the biggest guns and the speediest airplanes  --  not to kill any one with , of course , but to ? police the world . We shall take all the money and keep out all foreign goods ? including harpsichords ( see tariff list , and then * * * ? One grows weary of hearing about human nature , when the most elementary learning , out of one 's home town , shows the fallacies in a widespread ignorance of human traits . There were France and England , their best sons killed or coming home to die miserably or to live blinded ? and America was a neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was her affair also . Our merchants had supplied munitions at a price arid we had objected to the search of our vessels . at sea , though we ourselves had done it on a former occasion  --  but now we contributed our part . The thought of our own loss of beloved sons made many of us pause . Good hearts among us were wrung . Very many of our people , God bless them ! saw clearly what human nature Is when we had joined at last . But there were others . There are those among us , ever vocative , - who refer to a different contribution in. the war . Business ( shall we say it once more ? ) is business , and money was contributed under contract . " They hired the money , did n't they ? " smartly asked one of our , greatest silent men . You can not get back the sons who are dead . No ; no contract can assure that .

What 's the use of rationality unless . it expresses ' the whole undying truth about - human nature  --  that is to say , if we are claiming , as we most tiresomely do , that we base our ? actions upon the beautiful and the good ? ? " Those Europeans were buying ' armament with our money ! " shouted my friend in the Middle West .. It is difficult to believe that he had- identified the particular dollar bills paid for armament , and I think that the exact expenditure was not given . But , however it was , were n't we talking big about new American armament ? Did n't our daughters of revolution want a big navy ? Are n't we ever to learn that experientia docet ? Surely our own experiments ' at home reveal . our unsuitability as world teachers .

The American Method and the Danish . To the Editor of The New York Times : When King Canute commanded the tide not to rise he demonstrated to his courtiers the - inexorable working of natural law regardless of human desire or imperial mandate . President ? Hoover , - somewhat less wise , now undertakes by legislative fiat to regulate . the price of wheat in opposition to the ' natural law of supply and demand .

Meanwhile , the second chapter in this legislation program is being prepare4 and the protective tariff , which is Ms. excuse for farm relief , is to be made more effective than ever in its robbery of the ' American people and in its prevention of that foreign commerce which the American farmer needs more than anything , else . In this connection , it is refreshing to revert to the manner in " which our progressive cousins in Denmark handled the . matter of farm relief during the ' 80s , when they feund themselves unable to compete with the flood of low-cost cereals coining from America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telligent free ' men as they were , 10 make use .. of the free entry of American cereals and to substitute stock raising , .
