U. S. apartment dwellers who grumble monthly at the amount of their rent bills , might well take comfort from a consideration of the rent which Commercial National Bank &; Trust Co. of New York will soon be paying . Last week this bank contracted to pay rent of almost $500,000 a year for 42 years . Its landlord will be unique Henry L. Doherty ; its premises , the first five floors at No. 60 Wall Street ( Cities Service Co. building , now being remodeled ) . Commercial National has signed a 21-year lease with an option for a 21-year renewal . During a prospective 42-year occupancy it will pay $20,000,000 in rent . <P> Extraordinary is this figure , even more extraordinary is Commercial National 's ability to contract for such rental after only six months of business life . The bank was founded at the beginning of the present year-a year notable not for the appearance of new banks but for the disappearance ( via merger ) of long-established banking institutions . Since April 12 , 1926 , when Chase National absorbed Mechanics &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . In 33 of these mergers the smaller bank has completely lost its identity . Furthermore , new mergers are constantly expected , with the banking trend unquestionably toward the formation of fewer and bigger banks . Founding of Commercial National as an independent and comparatively small bank was a marked exception to the prevailing tendency . <P> Exceptional in its character , Commercial National has also been exceptional in its progress . The bank was formed with capital stock of $7,000,000 and surplus of $7,000,000 . A late June statement showed deposits of $76,589,035.84 , undivided profits of $886,351.04 . At this rate the bank , at the end of its first year of business life , will have attracted more than $150,000,000 in deposits and earned more than $1,500,000 . It has about $40,000,000 in cash on hand . <P> This success resulted partly from the character of the directorate , partly from the executive ability of President Herbert P. Howell and his officers , partly from favorable banking conditions . The directorate includes such men as Clement M. Keys ( Curtiss-Wright Corp . airplanes ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Thompson-Starrett , skyscrapers ) , Richard F. Hoyt ( Hayden , Stone &; Co. and Curtiss-Wright Corp . airplanes ) , Robert Lehman ( Lehman Bros . ) , William Wrigley Jr . ( gum ) , R. P. Stevens ( Niagara-Hudson Power Corp. , Morgan utility ) and William H. Vanderbilt . <P> President Herbert P. Howell , onetime Carnegie Steel Co. executive , went from Pittsburgh to Manhattan in 1912 to become vice president of National Bank of Commerce . Here he had ample opportunity to study the workings of a Big Bank of the merging type. * Recognizing the power &; potency of the Big Bank , Mr. Howell realized also that its very bigness left room for a smaller bank operating on more of a personal contact basis . So , after long consideration , and with the assistance of the tycoons mentioned above , he got together $7,000,000 for a surplus and sold $7,000,000 capital stock and formed Commercial National . It was designed to cater to persons who still regarded $1,000,000 as a considerable sum and to corporations not yet large enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
