The state prison at Wethersfield , Conn. , is better than most . It is strikingly clean and kept in good repair by the inmates . Each cell has individual toilet facilities and a catalogue of the prison library of 5,000 volumes . There is also a baseball field , a brass band , a monthly newspaper of which Sheriff Simeon Pease is inordinately proud . Last week , two newspapermen took up residence behind Wethersfield walls , were forthwith made editors of the prison paper . Their flamboyant history led the inmates to anticipate a paper that would be edited with imagination , gusto , craftiness . <P> One of the editors , Raymond E.

Then he insured his life for $75,000 , picked up a family-less boarder in Manhattan , took him to Westport to paint the Lawson house , drugged him . Mr. Lawson went out to chat with a neighbor , taking care to establish the fact that he was going back home to spend the evening . Then he set fire to his own home and left for Manhattan . The police were to find the bones of the drugged boarder charred beyond all recognition ; Mrs. Lawson was then to collect her husband 's $75,000 insurance . But the boarder regained consciousness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawson went to jail . <P> <P> * No relative of Bridgeport 's famed fisticuffer , Jack Delaney , whose real name is Ovila Chapdelaine . <P> * Famed arty town ; home of Hendrik Willem Van Loon , Rose O'Neill , Alan Dinehart , William McFee , etc.
