In a contest between two men , one event may be decisive . In a contest of teams , the teams must play each other many times before it is possible to decide which one is better . Thus it is impossible to decide which football team is the U. S. champion and even sectional championships are usually disputed . If one victory is taken as proof of superiority , it might be shown that a grammar school eleven in Eastern Iowa has the most powerful football team in the U. S. If not , it is only possible to single out individuals and rate them as solitary heroes . This thankless task is attended to by sports writers on whose hands time hangs heavy when the football season is over . What is remarkable about this performance is this : the pickers of Ail-American teams not infrequently agree with each other to some slight extent . <P> The two first important All-American selections-those submitted last week by the New York Evening Sun and Post-were agreed that Otto Pommerening of Michigan should be left tackle , Henry R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stanford , right guard , Howard Harpster , of Carnegie Tech , quarterback , Kenneth Strong of N. Y. U. and Christian Cagle of Army , halfbacks . For fullback , Scull of Penn and Carroll of Washington were leading . <P> Before other news-sheets had inscribed their scroll , the Oregon Aggies ( School of , Agriculture ) came east last week to play N. Y. U. and Stanford came east , like a troupe of gay and warlike hoboes , to play the Army . <P> Neither engagement was a game ; both were routs of such a nature as to make the Eastern teams look foolish . The boys from beyond the Rockies did not seem to take the game as seriously as their rivals ; nor did it appear necessary for them to do so . It was like watching the Princeton Varsity play against St. Mark 's . A great horde filled the Yankee Stadium to watch the Oregon Aggies stop Ken Strong , push over the supposedly indestructible N. Y , U. line and score 25 points to 13 . <P> <P> Another huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western invasion . Biff Hoffman , the Stanford fullback , came out with his stockings down ; other Stanford players were without headguards . Opposite them , but not much in the way , stood the neat , trim , speedy Army eleven with Cagle at its back . The Stanford team , which is not the best in the far West , was ludicrously superior to the Army , which has been considered the best team in-the East . One play , an antique variation of a fake " statue of liberty " never failed to gain ten yards . The members of the Army team , like children who have been playing with toughies , were discovered to be in a condition of total dilapidation , most of them crying , when the game was over . The score was 26-o but it might have been bigger without exaggerating Stanford 's superiority . <P> There was another East-West game played last week in Los Angeles , by Southern California the best of the Western teams , against Notre Dame the only Eastern team which , by virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army . Don Williams , the Californian quarterback , and Jess Hibbs , who cut a swathe ahead of him , were vastly superior to any Notre Dame players . The game was not lopsided like the others , but the score was 27-14. and Southern California won it .
