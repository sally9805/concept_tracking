txt While Governor Miller is giving close study to New York City 's transit problem and expects to scold a message on that subject to the Legislature within a few . days , Senators and Assemblymen from Brooklyn , regardless of party , are organizing for determined and united action on the t:1-ansit situation in that borough . Their action is due directly to the failure of the Senate at its session last night to adopt the Simpson resolution , calling on the Public Service Commission to investigate and report to the Legislature the underlying facts in relation to the abandonment by the Brooklyn City Railroad Company of service on its Park Slope line . At an initial meeting held today and attended by most of the Republican Senators and Assemblymen from Brooklyn , as well as the two Socialist members from that borough , two committees were appointed , one to look into the franchises under which the Brooklyn City Railroad Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company are operating , and another to call on the receiver , Lindley M. Garrftl , to ask when relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed doors it ; the room of the Assembly Judiciary Committee and lasted half an hour . No Democratic member attended , but this was attributed to the fact that notices sent out in advance had been misunderstood by the a ? - - Determined to Get Action . Senator William T. Simpson , author of the resolution which was shunted into the Senate Committee on Public Service , was elected Chairman of the group of protestants , while Senator Maxwell S. Harris of the Fourth Senate District was made Chairman of the Committee on Franchises and Senator Alvah W. Burlingame Jr . of the Eighth Chairman of the Committee on Receivership . " We are determined , " said Senator Simpson after the meeting , " to find out what is the matter with the transit situation and compel some sort of a settlement that will insure adequate service on the Brooklyn traction lines . The committee will devote its first week to the ascertainment of facts , and for that purpose will receive complaints , which may be made to any of the Brooklyn lawmakers . These in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the Franchise Committee we expect to find out whether the companies have complied with the charters under which they are operating . Through the Receivership Committee we expect to find out how soon a settlement may be expected . If the companies are solvent , what need is there of a prolonged receivership ? If not , they should bo declared bankrupt and the accounts settled . We intend to get answers to our inquiries , too . " The aid of civic organizations in Brooklyn , including the Chamber of Commerce , will be sought . " There will be absolutely no let-up until we have compelled action of some sort leading to a satisfactory solution , " the Senator added . Governor Has Own Plan . Governor Miller refused to comment on the action of the Brooklyn delegation and on what occurred in the Senate last night , including the attack of Judge Julius M. Mayer by Senator Burlingame . He said he was engaged at present in working out a solution ? of the tangled traction situation in the City of New York . While his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few persons , some of whom are at the Capitol , it was stated today that his forthcoming message would give no encouragement to the New York State Railways Association in its attempt to get legislation that would provide a flat legislative mandate in favor of increased fares . The Governor has in mind a method of dealing with the situation which is thought to be radically different from that contemplated in the Jenks bills , which , unless the program is changed meanwhile , will be introduced in a few days in substantially the same form as last year , when they went down to defeat . The Governor , while he desires as prompt a solution of the ? difficulties as circumstances will Justify , is more anxious that what is done shall be of permanent value and represent the nearest approach to Justice ' to all intcrested . For that reason it is regarded as not unlikely that he will ask the , Legislature to authorize an investigation by a competent commission of the New York City situation . Such a commission , it equipped with ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn ' panics to squeeze the water out of their stock and with severe safeguards to insure that the increment : would be up ' plied to operation and not dividends . It also could order fare increases tem ' rorarily where such action was deemed essential to insure service , and revoke these when normal conditions in the cost of . labor and materials warranted restorntion of a five-cent fate as insuring ample return on capital actually in ! vested . GARRISON ANSWERS ATTACK . Reply to Senator Burlingame Re . sents Criticism of Courts . The attack made by Senator Burlingame of Kings Monday on Federal Judge Mayer ' and Lindley M. Garrison , as receiver of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , was answered yesterday by Mr. Garrison . Mr. Burlingame had stated that Judge Mayer , who appointed Mr. Garrison , acted more like a czar than a Judge . Mr. Garrison 's statement reads : " The morning papers carry a story from Albany from which it appears that Senator Burlingame brought the ' trolley situation in Brooklyn to the at- ' tention of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver , and upon the courts . " I have not the pleasure of Senator Burlingame 's acquaintance and do not even know to which party he belongs . I wish ' that he had not indulged in any attack upon the courts . It seems to me at this time of unrest It is unwise for prominent men in prominent places to lend any aid to those who would overthrow the forces of law and order . I would , of course , prefer to be praised than blamed , but if blame cast upon me is the only way in which the desperate ; situation of the trolley companies in Brooklyn can be brought to the attention of the public , then I am much indebted to Senator Burlingame and any others who will in this manner or in any other manner bring it to public attention . " The fact is that there either has got to be less service or more money to enable us to give better service . Eventually this has got to be settled by the state of public opinion .
