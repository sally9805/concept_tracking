" Hello , Al . " <P> Wearing a black silk hat , Al looked and promptly replied : " Hello , Paul . " The speaker was Maj. Gen. Paul Bernard Malone . " How are you , Paul . I have n't seen you since 1903 . Was n't it in City Hall Park ? " It was . <P> Paul had been honor man in Al 's class at St. James Parochial School . " He got , " recalled Al , " 100 percent in everything except deportment and that does n't count . " <P> " Good Luck , " said Paul . <P> " Come down , " said Al , " to Washington after the fourth and I 'll give you an easy job . " <P> The Brown Derby in his silk hat was thus with some levity taking leave of a crowd which was as the sands for multitude .

George E. Brennan had died and was now buried . ( See p. 12 . ) <P> The Brown Derby first met Boss Brennan in San Francisco in 1920 . Both were experts in friendship ; quickly and together they fashioned one , Al and George . A fortnight ago George lay dying . Al got daily bulletins . When George died , Al was almost the first to telephone the relict and her daughter . Busy , he bustled through the most pressing business , put aside his speech , got his friend , Contractor Kenny , to come up with the " St. Nicholas " for quick passage to Chicago .

At the La Salle Street Station , massed battalions of Democracy seethed to glimpse an Al arrayed in black . Up Michigan Boulevard sped a strangely guarded Al-dozens of motorcycle police , five detectives , three machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows-people who scarcely saw the Al who almost hid in the corner of his car <P> Arrived at George 's modest apartment , Al went up in the old-fashioned elevator to greet Mrs. Brennan and her daughter Mary . What he said was inaudible . He went to an adjoining room to look upon George 's face and the flowers which covered a bronze coffin . . . . <P> In the parish house of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel , the Democratic Candidate for Governor of Illinois came to see him about farmers . <P> Al was in the fourth row of pews . As the catafalque was laid before the altar , priests were chanting the De Profundis . Solemn Requiem Mass . Funeral sermon . " Death is not a parting , but a meeting . " No eulogy . " Resurrectio sum et vita . " <P> To the cemetery went George 's body , while to the 20th Century went Al . Crowds . . . Paul ... a boy . . . and again , a smile .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
