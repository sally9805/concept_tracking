ONCE I made an Alaskan sled journey with a frontier philosopher and a cowboy , who taught me the limitations of a college education . The philosopher knew his classics through reflection in solitudes , and the cowboy had a logic as clean as the snows and as vivid as the aurora borealis which lighted their vast apron around our campfire . They were the thinkers ; I was the talker . Under the spell of crackling pine logs during the hour of sweet fatigue before rolling up in our blankets , the call to limber a mind removed from the friction of civilization would ' tart . me off in a burst of " languidge , " as the cowboy called it , on the first controversial theme that occurred to me . Though I was always hoping that the two would accept the challenge of my reconnoissance and make it a skirmish , both would continue to smoke their pipes in silence , restricting me to a monologue ; but when one night my dissertation had been unusually long the philosopher did interrupt me . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet of the uninhabited distances which separated us from the turmoil of cities , as he quoted : " Myself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and saint , and heard great argument About it and about ; but evermore Came out by the same door as is I went . " And the cowboy added , considerately : " It 's not for me to understand you , but I know you 're milling ; and it 's time to put more logs on the fire or turn in . " The cattlemen 's word for cattle grinding together in a panic often pulls me up when I find that my thoughts are pursuing an " about it and about " circle of waste motion without accomplishing a day 's work . Then I ask myself , " Who are you and what are you trying to do , anyway ? " and I take a trip to a mountain top in imagination . As I look out over the landscape in which my county is only a pencil-point and my habitation invisible , I stop thinking altogether for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think simply , along a straight trail which the cowboy might follow . The remedy is as old as the ailment . Other forms are golf for our ubiquitous tired business man , or the movies or the beach for the worried housewife , and , in chronic cases , for those who can afford it , long holidays , from which the patient returns to view office and home in a new light , with a fresh eye which has restored the sense of relative values . It is not a new thought , either , that a nation is a collection of individuals . Why should not what is salutary for the unit be salutary for the whole ? Why not a public proclamation sending the United States away to a mountain top at intervals ? It happens that a nation ? the thought of a nation ? may not escape working day in and day out through the newspapers . They are on the table for breakfast and dinner , or protruding from the rural free-delivery box at the gate ; they follow one on your vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the value of their perspective ? our desire for a mountain-top view ? which leads us to attach weight to the first impressions of a foreigner about our country and about subjects on which he is not expert ? a novelist on our education system , a professor of Greek on our politics , and a spiritualist on our labor problems .  | I have the advantage over the foreigner in that I can look the " SeeAmerica-First " folders boldly in the face . I share his perspective ? if not the curiosity which attends his views ? for I have been six months in Europe watching other peoples " milling " in their reconstructive effort . In looking out from the mountain top of my absence I see a landscape which is no new landscape , but one in which I know all the rivers , forests , and roads and the people , whose striving is in my blood . Many days passed while I was abroad without my seeing a copy of an American newspaper . When I came across a file I spent less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single issue when I am at home . The winds of distance seemed to winnow the wheat from the chaff . Two or three paragraphs buried in the back pages often seemed of more public concern in solving our problems than others which , day after day , in the appeal of a continued fiction story , enjoyed the top of the column on the front page . As I looked at the variegated blankets of type I saw them come to life in figures in the commotion of swirling eddies and rushes and counter - rushes , without knowing what it was about , though the effect suggested that revolution was imminent . The longer I was absent , the more impatient I became in my homesickness to be one of the figures in that strenuous pantomime , jostling the other figures and hearing their voices . I write after I have been home for two weeks , while I have perspective for my judgment of impressions which are still fresh and distinct , though not as much so as on the first day , when I thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune without knowing just how to use it and enjoy it . " In Europe I was again and again reminded that we were the richest nation in the world as the result of the war . When I mentioned this at home as a cheerful thought in the midst of our gloom , it seemed of no more interest than if I had remarked that the Mississippi flowed into the Gulf of Mexico . In the last six months we had become even richer , yet the richer we became the unhappier we apparently became , as well we might if the wealth were not broadly distributed . Evidently it was , or there would not be seven million motor vehicles of different kinds in the United States ; and by the number of automobiles in a nation these days you may judge of its prosperity . New York City has more than all England ; London more than Paris ; Paris more than Rome ; a few taxis and private cars still ply in the streets of Berlin , and in Warsaw the only cars that give a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legations , the American relief workers , and a few high officials ? the intrigue of politics having in mind this rare perequisite . If we acquire a few more million automobiles , and plumbers ride in five-thousand-dollar instead of three-thousanddollar cars , I wonder if we may not develop acute melancholia ; for the faces in the triumphant procession of democracy 's luxury along our gasoline-perfumed highways on Sunday mornings did not seem as happy as the faces of the holidaymakers whom I had seen on foot in the Bois de Boulogne , or those of the singing recruits for the army in Poland . Yet one ought to be happier riding than walking . Else , why buy cars ? Evidently we had some kind of a malady , if for no other reason than that we thought that we had . What was it ? A first suggestion that perhaps we were suffering from the dynamic strain of making ouija perform , or the mental strain of mastering the complex terminology of psycho-analysis , was far from any thought of flippancy with reference to the perturbed state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so kind . I confess to being fond of correct definitions . Without them we have no handles for our thoughts ; we can not be discriminate in diagnosis or clear about  | remedies . We may mistake scarlet fever for measles and treat it with diphtheritic serum . The word that I heard oftenest in the commotion on the national landscape was " Bolshevism , " as if that were the name of a quarry which all were hunting . This was startling . Bolshevism was the product of military disaster in an illiterate country of wickedly unequal distribution of wealth , misruled in peace by an autocrat who betrayed it in war . The ignorant soldiers of the beaten Russian army , who had been docile pawns sent to slaughter without pay or adequate munitions , after killing or defying their officers , became ranging groups which knew no law except their own vagarious reign of loot , murder , and devastation . Then , as has happened before under a Jacobite appeal of the brotherhood of man in a new . regime , some leader , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound to form a ruffian army of volunteers and re-establish order under a ruthless dictatorship . Having in mind the contrast between the origin of the authority ' of Abraham Lincoln and that of the late Czar of Russia , I thought that we might well be despondent , considering the feat before us , of achieving the real Bolshevism of our fashionable fears . The soldiers of Europe are too weary from their recent venture in European chaos to undertake the promotion of an American chaos by providing us with the requisite invading army . Even if our army were beaten , we could not eliminate the common-school education which our soldiers possess in order to prepare them for their part ; moreover , so many of them or their families own automobiles or some kind of property that they would fight against universal spoliation . I see grandfather , pitchfork in hand , as he says : " Bolshevist if you will , but you 've got to take me before you take my flivver . Do n't you come another inch , or , by thunder ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you derned loafers ! " If further discouragement be required , consider Poland in patches on the breadline . They tell the story of a Pole who pointed with pride to one section of his coat , as he remarked , " That 's the original which my great-uncle wore at his wedding . " By all the tokens of poverty and war 's devastation , Poland , on the very border of Russia , should be a fertile field for Bolshevism . Yet the Poles would have none of it . The war had not meant defeat for them , but the winning of nationality . Was it possible , when a thousand-ruble note , once worth five hundred dollars in our currency , had depreciated until it was hardly worth the cost of printing , that the propaganda of a bankrupt state , after failing in Poland ? at least , while her armies were victorious ? was sending secret millions across the Atlantic for the successful proselytization of the richest nation in the world to the cult of patches and cabbage soup ? This was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Bolshevist-hunting friends indicated as Bolshevists ; I would meet " doctor and saint , " speech-makers , publicists , intriguers and leaders of groups , and , through hearing their " great argument , " learn the nature of what we called Bolshevism in America . No password was required to take me up back stairs and along narrow passages to three raps and two scrapes on a door which opened on a Nihilistic stagesetting ; but the suspects were " open " for luncheons or for appointments at their offices . There were many so-called " intellectuals " among them , and each one in his environment reflected the luxury of our prosperity . " Do you think that we shall have a revolution in this country ? Do you think that we need one ? " I asked . They would not take my questions seriously . So I inquired about their politics . Some were going to vote the Republican ticket ; some the Democratic ; others would not make up their minds until candidates and policies were  | more thoroughly developed . One thought of voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most radical of them , in his groping for solutions of our problems , did not want his routine of life interfered with by a sudden overturn of our institutions . All the first list of " suspects " were suggestive , interesting , and stimulating without , however , considering suggestion and stimulation as equally valuable or mistaking either for nourishment or sedition . But I was told that I had met only the philosophical type of revolutionary in touch with my own circle of friends , which is the fault of every observer who is not a true reporter . The thing was to go out among the people . Then I would realize their lack of homogeneity ; how we were overrun by foreigners and un-American ideas ; how the " proletariat " hated the " bourgeoisie , " as Lenin would say . The bourgeoisie was numerous as , surely , by the Lenin classification , every one who rode in an automobile must be bourgeois . Where was the proletariat ? It must be the poor folk riding on surface cars and walking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much like you and me ? unless you are feeling snobbish . Where were the foreigners ? I wondered , as I lookedat the faces in the streets . The French , who had heard much of our polyglotry , asked this question when they saw our soldiers marching along the roads of France . In French eyes the men were all of the type Americain . Yet they included foreignborn , as well as sons of every race in Europe . Are you American , their adopted country asked of them in those trying days . They gave their answer in sacrifice at home and in battle , often fighting against an enemy of their own blood . Zalinskis , Einsteins , Schmidts , Bertellis , Katsanjans won the Distinguished Service Cross , thrilling our pride with a new sense of nationalism . Had they now reverted to loyalty to the lands of their origin ? If so , what had wrought the change in their hearts ? To my fresh view all the people were distinctively American in garb and taste ; in their complexion , which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civility , their intensity , their pleasures , and their restless motion . Later , as I became settled at home and more discerning , I might note that this or that person was of Swedish , Italian , German , Hungarian , or Slav stock . Then I would see through the veneer , as I was told . But are n't most of us ? again , not a new idea ? who are " off the reservation , " of foreign stock ? My people missed the Mayflower and came over in 1636 . I could not discern that the descendants of the Pilgrims were more American than I was or than a dark-eyed telephone girl whose father was an Italian immigrant . Not even in the mean streets did I find patches . I saw no shriveling babies in emaciated mothers ' arms on breadlines in the European sense , though conditions were bad enough from the point of view of desired standards which must ever call our ambition away from the stagnation of " everything is for the best in the best of worlds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new stores and restaurants had appeared . How clean the restaurants were compared to those of the same class in Europe ! How wholesome was their atmosphere ! I found them more truly American than a small , extravagantly priced place off the Avenue , where high-powered cars waited outside the door . The food was not worthily French , as the proprietor himself well knew , and the foreign male waiters had not ' the politeness which makes the brigandage of fifty cents for a poor French pastry supportable . Culture , as I understand it ? each of us has his own brand ? did not have a very secure footing in the talk of the diners , which ran on material things as they inveighed against Bolshevism threatening the nation . " This is not home , " I was thinking . " I want home and the thoroughbred American article in America , as I want  | the thoroughbred French article in France . " When I dined at one of the wholesome restaurants which had taken the place of a saloon , the food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind . The talk was more national and real , not to say more human , than in the French restaurant . I spoke to the waitresses ? it was late and they were clearing away things for the night when I rose to go ? to ascertain their views , and the emphatic answers of second generation Irish , Italian , Portuguese , and Teuton convinced me that not one was even a fraction of one per cent . unAmerican . But all the waitresses thought that something was wrong . Their idea of Bolshevists was the profiteers , whose ranks included , I found , some of the most rabid Bolshevist hunters . Then I went to a popular theater . When the catch-phrase , " If you do n't like this country , go back to your own , " was thrown on the screen , the applause was loudest from the galleries . I doubt if there would have been a different response to a call to patriotism before the great Bolshevist hunt began , though surely the response to " We are fighting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic . That was the difference between then and now ? a subject for thought . At another theater I saw some of our old friends whom we meet every day in the newspapers at their tricks in the movies . Could anything be more distinctively American or more conservative than our comic cuts ? Statesmen come and go , actors flash in Broadway successes or disappear on the road after failures , old fads yield to new and Father Time sprinkles our heads with silver ; but we are loyal year after year to the old favorites of the artist 's pencil who have discovered the secret of remaining the same age as on the day when they made their first bow to the public . I shall not worry about a serious revolutionary state of mind until we have a new set of public jesters every full moon . I observed that Fifth Avenue , as the result of the drawing power of patriotic parades during the war , had lost its old character and become a promenade for people who had been restricted to the provincialism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about lack of a common feeling of Americanism , or before it had been tested on the battle-fields of Europe . Was it possible that some of my friends who knew America through the Avenue resented this invasion ? I resented it myself at first , when the crowd prevented my hurrying along at a good pace on my favorite thoroughfare for a town constitutional . Then I saw in the throng the concrete result of what we had been preaching in a war for democracy 's sake . Inevitably I recalled the old days of every vehicle for itself , before we introduced the methods of traffic control of European cities in face of resentment against an un-American innovation . Now European cities were taking lessons from us . Our new system of traffic direction , marvelously efficient , was as Prussian in its rigidity as the drill manual of the late German army . Far from any one disputing the policeman 's authority , to say nothing of conducting a mob movement against him , the rules were being good-naturedly obeyed with what seemed habitual military precision by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-section of human layers as I went the length of Manhattan Island , I saw few faces that had the look of being sworn enemies of society . In each stratum I continued to find that nine out of ten men had on his shoulder the chip , " Do n't you dare say that you are not a hundred-per-cent . American ! " and that nobody was saying he was not an American . I came to blocks inhabited by people fresh from Ellis Island . Even these I found were taking on American characteristics as they foregathered in the different racial haunts where they could hear the language of  | their childhood ; but the next generation preferred restaurants of the American type . The total of our foreign-born out of the hundred and ten millions was only a few millions , inarticulate at the foot of the national ladder . Among these were some fiends who had sent bombs to several public men the year before . But though that might be a reason for a public official to get shell-shock , it was not a reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of that race . A Socialist National Convention was in session . Here should be the object of my quest ? real sedition . It was having as noisy a time as Republican or Democratic conventions . Though the Bolshevist hunters said that socialism and anarchism were one and the same thing , there were no professional anarchists present . The anarchists belong to a more exclusive set which dines at select little restaurants and holds its conventions in hall , bedrooms . Except to the minds of rabid Bolshevist hunters , anarchism and socialism hardly mix , as , roughly speaking , the meaning of one is sweet license without government , and of the other government direction of utilities and state . ownership of property . Socialism was evidently not making much headway with our people when they had favored the return of the railroads to private ownership . Possibly some officials , clinging to their war powers in combating Bolshevism , were succeeding as an example of too much government in accomplishing their object in a way which they had not intended . The Socialist delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not propose to interfere with the traffic policemen on the Avenue ? which they knew would spell disaster for their party . They had the right if they chose to advocate an amendment to the Constitution that the President must be the seventh son of the seventh son of a Jamaican immigrant , or providing for the abolition of our executive , legislative and judicial forms , and that all the population should go to Washington once a year and settle our affairs in a town meeting on a Saturda half-holiday . But no one may conspire to overthrow the government by violence , lest he strike at the very source of the continuity of our institutions which permits a majority to change the form of our government at will . Such is the tradition and the law , costing centuries of effort , which allows poisonous gases to escape into the free atmosphere lest their suppression lead to an explosion and leaves tomfool ideas to the withering frost of public analysis , judgment , and ridicule . This , indeed , is saying another old thing ; but the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists upon its reiteration when Bolshevist hunters , now becoming more reasonable , have been proposing legislative or executive action which endangers the very foundation of American conservatism . Even the most devilish Socialist delegates who favored the immediate adoption of a soviet form of government for America had not the consistency to wear patches and were eating ham and eggs instead of cabbage soup . Some owned automobiles . In their dream of the " internationale " ? which is not wicked if it means the good feeling of all classes of all countries toward one another ? and of their Marxian text-book idea of Leninism coming true , they may have gloated in imagination at the prospect of riding in a high-powered official car and having the seven million automobiles of America and all our people under their despotic sway , which would make Lenin , in a Russia of famine and crippled transport with . the hated bourgeoisie practically extinguished , a mere " piker , " and Trotsky regret that he had ever left a land of such rich promise with so powerful an army and navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism . In many of these extremists one detects a quality of inherent perversity which , if a majority of us were for the soviet , would favor autocratic rule by a banking oligarchy .  | When it came to realities , even in the Socialist convention , the Sovietists were outnumbered . Too many Socialists or potential Socialists owned Liberty bonds to permit a plank to repudiate their payment . A moderate , an " American , " platform was adopted in order to appeal to the voters ; for the Socialists , no less than the Republicans and the Democrats , want votes . Our labor unions are not affiliated with the Socialist party as in Europe . They walk in the middle of the road in their own interest . In England , so intensively an industrial country , there is talk that the Laborites may come into power . In France , where the Socialists include the labor-union voters , they have never been able to secure a majority over the peasants and small property-holders . The prospect of Socialism making serious gains without the labor-union vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not worry us until the Socialist party has at least a dozen members of Congress . Then , if there is danger of their number increasing , we may take the matter earnestly in hand . At present , the mathematicians of the 100-percent. crusade can not show 1 per cent . of un-Americanism . We had no more than that when the Bolshevist hunting began , probably less . Unrest there is , the unrest of post-war conditions and of psychology stimulated by our prosperity . A people at once idealistic and practical , we have been suffering a little from disappointed idealism . During the war we dreamed of a new world which was to be the reward of our sacrifice and effort ; but once the armistice was signed human nature had its way . The subjectivity of the individual succeeded the objectivity of the mass . Reconstruction became a personal matter . Every man wanted to make sure of his own future in that new world ? to earn a living , provide for his family , educate his children , or buy a car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not escape from its effects , which will influence our thought and acts for decades to come . However , we did succeed in forgetting that the natural law of supply and demand , abridged by artificial conditions during the war , was again in force . To meet the call for production by a hungry world , brain-workers were less needed than hand-workers , especially in our country , where ambition presses opportunity hard and the son of the immigrant day laborer becomes a machinist , and the son of the machinist and the farmer , a doctor or a lawyer . Democracy had come into fresh power ; labor saw itself as democracy which was much in demand . While inflation due to war debts increased prices , everybody wanted more pay for his toil in order to meet the high cost of living , which more pay , in turn , further increased . Strikes became inevitable as the industrial world sought equilibrium . The worker was just as human as , and no more so in his limitations , than the employer who yielded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going and increase dividends for stockholders looking for higher returns ; and one side in the dispute may not have been more - short- sighted than the other . The ouij a-board might have been as useful as secret-service men in following the clue of this kind of Bolshevism . Brain - workers and people with fixed incomes ? I know how they feel ? were hard-pressed and gave to the unrest the voice of their influence . Great injustice had been wrought by the war ; that is characteristic of war . In every community men and women who had made sacrifices saw profiteers from the war flourishing their wealth , which they need no longer conceal for appearance 's sake . We were not too preoccupied in seeking more and more money as individuals to realize in mass subconsciousness the bounty which the war had left us in our stupendous national wealth . Nothing is so sensitive as property . A nation of property-holders , we were hearing much  | of chaos across the Atlantic . We had been drawn into a European war ; we might be drawn into European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and divide it equally among the people . Thus the tramp might sign checks against the bank account of the man who had laid aside a sum for a rainy day . And Bolshevism was European . We had many Europeans in our population . Strikes , lack of servants and their exorbitant wages , the charges of thriftlessness and slacking against highly paid labor , inability to carry out contracts for want of deliveries of material , the increased cost every time that one bought a ham or a pair of shoes , the farmer 's complaint that wheat was not dear enough and the housewife 's that it was too dear , and all our restless economic phenomena might be explained by this danger incubating within our borders ; while the scapegoat 's own restlessness over the high cost of living was a sure sign of his guilt . Unoccupied war spy hunters turned Bolshevist hunters ; promoters of war propaganda , feeling still the impulse of its belligerency , especially if they had not been at the front to exhaust their martial ardor , broke into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " The World Safe for Democracy , " and provided themselves with a new enemy to take the place of Kaiserism . Any one who disagreed with their superheated views was unAmerican , as surely as any one who had opposed our fighting the war to a finish was no patriot . This dragooning was hardly in keeping with the old inductive " We Americans " of our melting-pot , whose magic we had seen reflected in the fire of our soldiers ' eyes on the fields of France ; but it seemed likely to defeat its object through hidden resentment , which meant slower absorption . Our war energy which had taken us in a mass drive straight ahead had turned to milling , which is not saying that I would not have been in the thick of the panic if I had not had the perspective of long absence . Bolshevist hunting had lured us , in the excitement of sportive chase , along an aniseed scent trailed by the hunters and away from vital , if unexciting , problems , when time pressed for their solution by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems is shown in our ethical resentment of the extravagances of our prosperity , so good of itself if it does not run away with us and defeat its own end . Our soldiers , while called on to be " 100-per-cent . Americans " when fresh from the battle-fields , now , inoculated with the virus of the money standard , were only keeping faith with the mood of the nation when they demanded bonuses for services which , in the mood that sent them into uniform , were not to be valued in dollars and cents . The interest in spiritualism , the movements to revive religious faith , and the demand for national and individual selfanalysis recognize the need of an impulse which is not a disorganized materialism . Not long ago it was the habit to speak of what a great privilege it was to have lived in the war period as long as the war had to happen . It is a greater thing to live in this new era ; for the new era is upon us , ready for our fashioning into a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncertain future . The disillusion of Utopian idealists , who set about in sophomoric confidence to move mountains , deflect river courses , and rearrange the . face of the earth according to their theories , should not discourage practical idealists , in the course of the day 's work , from looking after a few details whose accomplishment will surprise the Utopians with the fact that others than they were sincere in fighting the war to make a better world . The people do rule in our country and in a larger sense than ever before . It is the best of countries to me . I have had opportunities of comparison in forming an opinion which surely makes it mean as much to me as to a politician who stirs up an-Americanism by appeal to  | the foreign voters and then turns his blasts upon un-Americanism when that will win other votes . For statesmen follow the public lead ; and so do our newspapers . Rulers give policies to subordinates . The people are the rulers who formulate the policies of our government and our institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am aiming to keep the old and simple things in mind . How are we to know what are the right policies unless we are well informed ? If the newspapers do not inform us properly it is our fault . We are the market for the newspapers ' wares ; what we desire to read calls for the window dressing of the head-lines . Every editor and reporter would prefer not to bury a well-considered statement on a great national issue in the back pages and put a sensational theft on the front page . A good plan for the reader is to be entertained in the morning , when time presses , by the comic cuts and the sensations and to lay aside a matter of real importance , such as the statement of his views by an acknowledged leader , for thorough reading later . By being less prolix , some of our statesmen would not play into the oculist 's and the papermanufacturer 's hands ; but if the report , whether of a speech or an event , is not ample enough or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a surprise . A sufficient number of letters of this kind will reinforce his natural inclinations toward a better policy in the future . It is well , also , not to discount idealists and theorists . They are good pathfinders and can help you to enjoy the scenery , though they may be poor hands at putting in an inner tube or curing engine trouble . A banker , too , may not be just a hateful money-maker ; he may know as much about the finances of a nation as a lawyer , and he may be as honest in applying his knowledge for the good of the nation , while he appeals to fact and reason , as a politician who titilates the public fancy . A labor leader may be just as patriotic as an employer . The ruler , who is both judge taking evidence and executive giving orders , must depend upon carefully chosen experts . Everything , in the long run , goes hack to the standards of ruler and subordinates . Holding public servants up to right standards and practicing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils than new laws . Variation in standards has been responsible for the decay of some republics and for the place in-history of great monarchies . All foreigners agree that in no nation is common intelligence so high as in ours . They take this view of us as individuals in our individual affairs . In this time of heavy taxes and the increasing , influence of governmental functions upon individual fortunes , a personal interest more substantial than abstract patriotism calls for us to consider the business of the nation and the welfare of its sons and daughters as earnestly as our own work and the welfare of our own family . Really , a public proclamation is not necessary for a trip in imagination in the nation 's behalf to a mountain top . Each citizen can go for himself . The mountain top being imaginary , there is plenty of room for all .

We may ask ourselves what are the great issues : reform of governmental extravagance , economic reorganization and the man to take charge of it , public education , the League of Nations , better transport facilities , a merchant marine , reform of machine politics , or the cultural necessity of better standards ? Having made up our minds as rulers as to our policies , call in the managers and the experts and see that they keep on a straight road of accomplishment and do not merely run in a circle on a race-track to develop our sporting inter- est or introduce an acrobatic performance to distract us . It is a pity that there are not more experts in Congress on labor , on manufacture , on education . on ethics , as well as on politics , in order to bring to bear on the floor their spe cialized knowledge in dealing with complex modern problems .

We have an example of this in the happiness that the Belgians find in the parks and fields of their garden country , the happiness of making much of little things , which may be commended to our Bolshevists and Bolshevist hunters , too . Faith , the faith of the scientist in his analyses , of the religionist in religion , faith in work and in better things to come , is the inspiration for our struggle to win a few more steps up the spiral staircase of human progress , instead of giving warrant by milling to the philosopher 's disinterested view of the puzzle of civilization : About it and - about ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went .  |p464
