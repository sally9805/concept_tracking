For Wabash College ( Crawfordsville , Ind. ) - triumph . A fortnight ago , her pride , her young Demosthenes , her handsome Maurice ( " Red " ) Robinson journeyed to Northwestern University ( Evanston , Ill. ) with his elocution coach , Professor W. N. Brigance , for the National Contest of the Interstate Oratorical Association , for which he had qualified by winning the Indiana state contest ( TIME , March 1 ) . Other doughty state champions were there at Evanston : a forceful South Dakotan with an oration on prohibition ; a West Virginian propounding that " Science Has a Rendez-vous " ; an lowan primed to deliver " Cat and Cattle . " But none was so shrewd , none so compelling as Hoosier " Red " Robinson ( his home is in Anderson , Ind. ) , who , when he found Illinois humming with talk about that week 's triple murder , scrapped his prepared speech and got up another one overnight called " The Eleventh Commandment . " The seven judges were his to all but one man when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you blame our youth for turning to a criminal career when , in those formative years before character is made or habits fixed , they see handed down to them , from a modern Mt . Sinai of sentimentality , a new and Eleventh Commandment which says , ' Thou shalt get by with it ' ? " <P> His nearest competitors were Carl W. Forsythe , Ypsilanti State Normal ( Mich. ) , and Edson Smith of Monmouth College ( Ill . ) . <P> Orator " Red " Robinson is slender and dapper . Dullards who judge by appearances alone might take him for a dancing man , a talkative " cake-eater. " * Than which nothing could be more misguided . He is a state champion pole-vaulter , a college basketball captain of all-Western calibre . When they heard he had won the oratorical title , his college mates rushed to prepare a demonstration at the railroad station . He had joined the distinguished roster of national intercollegiate eloquence champions , a roster including an author , a bishop , a governor , senators ( including the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many another Who of Who 's Who . Incidentally , he had won for Wabash her fourth national championship in seven years , her second in succession . " If , " said Elocution Professor Brigance with pardonable pride , " if there be such a thing as a crown of American oratory , certainly there could be no disputant of Wabash 's claim to it . " <P> <P> * Species of young human male to be found in mixed company from noon to midnight and after . He is lavish in his attention to dress , complexion , repartee , new dance steps , light refreshment . The name which newspaper readers have sickened of seeing for several years , without fully understanding it , is thought to have originated in Washington or farther south , deriving from the species ' propensity for tea , cakes and soda-fountain goodies .
