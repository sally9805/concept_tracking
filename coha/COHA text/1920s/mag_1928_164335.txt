If the larger radio interests were displeased with the amendments Congress put into the Federal radio law last fortnight , they were better pleased by the Senate 's action last week in confirming all four of President Coolidge 's appointments to the revivified Federal Radio Commission . <P> The radio amendments require the Commission to effect " equitable " assignments of waves and wattages among the broadcasting stations , on a basis of population in five zones of the U. S. The effect may be to cut the franchises of the rich , long-established stations in the New York and Chicago zones to benefit Southern and lower-Midwestern stations . But the bill 's flexible language seemed to permit " borrowing " of unused waves and wattages among the zones . <P> When the appointments came up for voting , there was a fight over only one name , that of Orestes H. Caldwell , the New York commissioner . Mr. Caldwell had been criticized for accepting a compensation fee of $7,000 per annum from his former employers , the McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. , for whom he edited Radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission . Also , Southerners and Westerners charged that he had discriminated in favor of the Radio Corp . of America , which operates stations flung from Worcester , Mass. to Los Angeles . The fight over Mr. Caldwell 's reappointment was sharp but he squeaked through by one vote , 36 to 35 . <P> The other newly confirmed Commissioners are Sam Pickard ( Kansas ) , Harold A. La Fount ( Utah ) , Ira E. Robinson ( West Virginia ) . E. O. Sykes ( Tennessee ) was sole member and acting chairman of the Commission while Congress debated its continued existence last month . <P> Relieved by his reappointment , Commissioner Caldwell issued a statement . " A tremendous opportunity for Service faces the Radio Commission , " said he .
