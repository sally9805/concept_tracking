txt A. man in a brown overcoat and hat last seen driving a Ford sedan , a description supplied by children , was the vague and only clue in the hands of the police last night to the homicidal maniac who , balked in one crime , murdered Mrs. Walter Bauer , thirty-five-year-old mother of two children , at 5 o'clock Tuesday evening in a lonely stretch of Staten Island highway . The police learned positively that no one saw the face of the Man in brown when he brought his small car to a halt in Merrill Avenue , where South Avenue begins , and invited Mrs. Bauer in for a lift . No one saw the ' driver turn into South Avenue  --  children who saw her climb in had gone on by then ? and no one heard the two shots that ended the young mother 's life . These negatives were the achievement of twenty-four hours of unremitting investigation by two-score detectives under Captain Arthur Carey , in charge of the Homicide Bureau , and additional men directed by Captain Ernest Van Wagner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only one affirmative result came from the joint investigation  --  exoneration of one man . Acting on the stories told by two boys , who later thought they might have been mistaken , the police questioned an Insurance agent and collector . He satisfied the police , they said , that he was miles distant at the hour of the slaying . And when a small red stain was found on the under brim of his soft felt hat he explained it away by saying it was from a cut received months ago while shaving . The hat was sent to a Manhattan chemist for analysis of the stain and its age . Orders Ford Cars Checked UP . Obviously unable to get anywhere in the search for the man in brown , the police concentrated on the automobile . Captain Carey ordered a check-up on every Ford car on Staten Island . Public garages were to be searched first and then private ones . In addition three detectives were working last night in Carteret and Elizabeth , N. J .. two points in direct line of flight from Chelsea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred . All motives save that of an attempted outrage were eliminataed by the police . Robbery , advanced at first , was discarded when two missing rings were found at Mrs. Bauer 's home . Dr. George P. Mord , Medical Examiner , completing his autopsy , said that Mrs. Bauer had fought off her assailant . The approach of the police to the blank wall of another unsolved murder recalled two other cases on Staten Island which remain mysteries . On April 7. 1923 , Mrs. Irene Blandino , wife of a Jersey City barber , and Mrs. Bessie , alias " Peggy " Philips , one 22 years old and the other 18 , were slashed to death with a knife . A month later , to the day , the body of George L. Christie , 16 years old , was found hanging unclothed from a tree . His father said the boy was murdered ; the police inclined to the belief that the lad , backward in school , committed suicide . Memory of these cases spurred the police on tthrough the hours of Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Carey to assume command was the signal for reinforcements from Manhattan Police Headquarters . A watch had been maintained on all ferries from Staten Island and all cars that came down the hill to the St. George ferry or that drew up to the small ferry landing from Linoleumville to Carteret , N. J. , were scrutinized . Victim 's Mother Tells Her Story . When Captain Carey took charge his first move was to check up the version of the murder obtained by the detectives under Captain Van Wagner in their preliminary investigation just alterl the crime was discovered . Captain Carey 's men questioned Mrs. George F. Pero , wife of a retired postal clerk and mother of the slain woman . Mrs. Pero was with Mrs. Bauer in the small automobile which the murdered woman left to go to her death . Mrs. Pero told the detectives that she . her daughter and the two Bauer children  --  Maud , 11 years old , and Helen , 71 years old  --  left the Bauer home at 1151 Decker Avenue , Port Richmond , to visit a relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Bauer was driving the car as they passed South Avenue and proceeded along Merrill Avenue , formerly known as Lambert 's Lane . About 600 feet from the intersection a big motor truck bowled along and to avoid collision Mrs. Bauer swung the Ford to the roadside . In doing so the right rear wheel of the Bauer automobile sank into sand fringing the macadam . Unable to dislodge the wheel . Mrs. Bauer said that she would walk down the highway until she came to a house and there get a rope for a tow from some passing machine . Mrs. Pero assured her daughter that she would " mind " the girls in her absence and Dirs . Bauer , expressing the hope that she would not have to walk a mile , started back toward South Avenue . Detectives asked Mrs. Pero specifically whether she had seen her daughter enter the Ford sedan piloted by the man sought . The elderly woman said that she had not seen her daughter enter the car . " I settled back in the . rear seat , talking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Maud only once . She was then walking along the side of the road and was approaching the corner of South Avenue . I did not look at her again . A minute or two later , however , a Ford sedan went passed us heading the direction taken by Maud . I did not pay much attention to the car . " The Story of Two Boys . That was all Mrs. Pero , broken by grief , could contribute to the search . The police then turned to the two boys , the only ones so far found who saw the meeting of Mrs. Bauer and her suspected slayer . They were Ernest Van Chief , 16 years old , of 46 Amity Place , Port Richmond , and George Carson , 17 years old , of 42 Amity Place . The boys were bicycling along South , Avenue , they told the detectives , when they saw Mrs. Bauer stepping into a Ford sedan in Merrill Avenue . They casually noticed that the driver of the car wore a brown coat and a brown hat . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but thought he VMS young . As the result of this questioning the detectives sought information from other children . Five youngsters said they remembered seeing a man in brown ' in a Ford sedan . They were Russell Van Name of 120 Hughes Avenue , George Mira of 128 Hughes Avenue , Michael Summers of 200 Merrill Avenue and Barbara Fahs and her brother Henry of 220 Merrill Avenue . Barbara , 13 years old , a high school student , did not have a very good recollection of what the man looked like . While the other children recalled as seeing only the car go by . " I was taking Harry to the barber . " said Barbara , ' and I was a little way ahead of Harry when I came upon an automobile standing still just inside South Avenue . The door of the automobile was open and the man was talking to a woman , who was standing in the road . I did not hear what she said to the man , but as she was getting in , I heard him say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive you to the nearest garage and we can get a rope . ' " She got into the car and Harry and I watched them as they went off down the road in the direction of Linoleumville . I did n't notice the license number . I wish I had . " The Insurance Collector Questioned . From what the children told them , the detectives looked up the insurance collectot whose route was through the territory adjacent to the crime . Other detectives went to the spot where Mrs. Baueea lifeless form was discovered and ' began a. minute search for a clue . The detectives soon located the collector , and he was taken to the New Dorp Station , where he was questioned by Captains Carey and Van Wagner and District Attorney Fach . The man said that at 5 o'clock Tuesday he had been visiting customers in Mariners Harbor and that he had not passed along the road of the murder until several hours after the crime had been uncovered . He was questioned intensively from morning until 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon , when , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . While he was being examined detectives went to homes he was reported to have visited , and , apparently , the police verified his account of - his movements . The children who had told about seeing the man in a Ford car failed to identify the man who was questioned . In permitting the collector to go Captains Carey and Van Wagner and District Attorney Fach agreed that he could shed little light on the crime . " The police , " said Mr. Fach last night at his office in the County Court House at St. George , " have absolutely no evidence ' in their possession that would warrant making an arrest of any kind in this ' case . While there is no doubt that assault was the motive back r of the murder , that seems to be the only definite thing so far established . We have interviewed literally hundreds of persons in the Chelsea section and near by and no eye-witnesses were found ; in fact , no one was near enough ' to the man at any time to give any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the worst murder cases that a District Attorney of Richmond County ever has had to handle . It should be a lesson to women to stay out of the cars of strangers . " Police Say They Have " Leads . " Captain Van Wagner confirmed the District Attorney 's statement that no evidence had been unearthed in the day 's investigation , but said that he had several " leads " which he hoped would develop a valuable clue . " We have made little headway , " he said , " and right now there is little prospect of an arrest . " Also reporting nothing new , Captain Carey said : " There is no doubt but that Mrs. Bauer was killed by a man whom she had repulsed . As we reconstruct it , the man went past the stalled car in which Mrs. Pero and the children were sitting , and when he caught up with Mrs. Bailer assumed that she had just left the car and was looking for help . " We believe that he spoke to her and confirmed her mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the man before or that he had seen her . We assume that she got into the car on his promise to carry her along until they came to a house where a rope could be obtained . When she fought him the man drew a pistol and struck her over the back of the head . The doctor 's examination disclosed a gash several inches long at the base of the skull . " When she failed to lose consciousness and , perhaps , screant d , the man became frightened . There is ' mason to believe that his first shot was the one which struck Mrs. Bauer in the abdomen and produce death . The second shot entered Mrd s . Bauer 's throat , in front . This wound was a tiny one and at first it was thought it had been made by a thin-bladed knife or a stiletto . " Captain Carey said that the police believed the bullets to have been fired from an automatic pistol of foreign make- They were from a cartridge 9f a .25 calibre and at first the detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carey . however , clung to the conviction that the weapon used was of foreign manufacture . He admitted that neither of the empty shells had been recovered . Slain Inside the Car . One of the chief purposes of the search of the ground where Mrs. Bauer was found was to get the discharged cartridges which would have been ejected automatically from a pistol . Failure to find the used jackets led the police to confirm their theory that the shooting occurred while Mrs. Bauer was seated alongside of the slayer and that the body was then thrown out . Going over the dried grass and twigs fringing the macadam of South Avenue , the detectives failed to find a single clue . There was no evidence of a struggle and it appeared as if the murderer had carried the limp form of his victim from the car , laying it down where it was found . No bloodstains were on the Ground , this being duo to the fact that the direct cause of Mrs. Bauer 's death had been an internal hemorrhage . While this search was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty-five years , was conducting an autopsy in Steers 's Morgue , New Brighton Terrace , Port Richmond , where the body of Mrs. Bauer had been taken . " The death of this woman , " he said last night , " was due to the gunshot wound in the abdomen , which caused an internal hemorrhage . I believe that this wound caused instant death . The second bullet passed through the throat . It cut through the neck muscles and came out at the back of the neck . This wound , in itself , would not have been sufficient , in my opinion , to have caused death . " There were many deep scratches on her face and on her right hand . These , I believe , were made by the man . The scratches on the hand evidently were made wheil Mrs. Bauer used that hand to ward off the attack . Her clothing was not torn and when I made the ex ' amination was not disarranged . There is every reason to believe that this crime was the work of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W ' at its base , which is the trade-mark , I understand , of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company . " Confirming her statement to the police that she could not identify the man in the sedan Mrs. Pero at her home last night said that Der daughter 's last words , as she turned away from the stalled car , were " I 'm going to telephone to a garage , mother , and get help . " Mrs. Pero said that her daughter had been born and reared on Staten Island . As a young girl she attended the public school in New Brighton and later had gone to Curtis High School , but had not been graduated . Was " Home Girl , " Say Friends . Mrs. Bauer , not quite 31 years , old , was about 5 feet in height . She was rather dark in complexion , with gray eyes and a. mass of wavy black hair . She was rather plump . Friends of years ' standing who spoke of her yesterday rejected all suggestions that a love affair might have entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home mother , " was the way one expressed it . Walter Bauer. her husband , employed as an electrical engineer by the UppercuCadillac Motor Corporation of Manhattan , was too grief-stricken to discuss the not know why anybody would mh.Irddeor. have wanted to kill Maud , " said her brother , Charles Pero , of 37 Homestead Avenue , Port Richmond . " She never had any trouble with anybody , was popular , and her married life of seven years had been exceptionally happy . " Three other brothers of the slain woman are Ralph Pero of Port Richmond ; David Pero of Ampere , N. J. , and Addison Pero , pastor of the First Baptist Church of Westville , N. J. The funeral of the murdered woman will be held from her home tomorrow at 2 o'clock if relatives from Canada arrive in time . Further details of the funeral will be announced today . Burial , it was said . may be in Rutherford , N. J. About a month ago the Bauers selected a home in Rutherford and a week ago they closed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
