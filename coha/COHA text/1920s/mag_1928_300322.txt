After all , who did kill Goliath ? Elmer Davis , letting his imagination zoom , said in his novel Giant Killer that it was not David , but his sturdy nephew Joab . Stumbling on the huge carcass , David made bold to slice off the head and stagger back with it to camp , claiming a victory that was not his . <P> On the other hand , cautious scholars who have no imagination have been troubled by the statement in II Samuel 21:19 where the killing of " Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam " is ascribed to one Elhanan . To smooth over the discrepancy , the passage is often made to read " the brother of Goliath the Gittite . " <P> Last week a new Commentary on the Holy Scripture , published in England under the direction of Dr. Charles Gore , onetime Bishop of Oxford and famed as perhaps the greatest theologian in the Church of England , came out flatly in favor of Elhanan . <P> Go Down , Moses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes from Old Testament narrative-Jonah and his voyage in the whale , Methuselah and his ripe old age , Belshazzar and his feast-were ranked by Dr. Gore and his more than 50 collaborators as no more than Hebrew Nights ' Entertainments . . They were explained as " products of the Semitic habit of exaggeration . " <P> Moses did not write the Pentateuch . <P> The story of the Deluge was probably an hysterical account of a local flood at Babylon . The world and the waters and the sky were not created in seven days . The picture of Moses on Mt . Sinai was probably the hallucination of one scared by a thunderclap . <P> Such beliefs as these have been advocated more or less openly for at least the last 100 years , in Protestant circles . That finally eminent theologians should take the trouble to advance them in a book amused some Unitarians , some independent admirers of a man Jesus , who have put by all supernatural elements in Scripture as fictional . They came as a shock only to hardfast fundamentalists of the evangelistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every phrase in the Bible is " gospel truth , " inerrant . <P> Lazarus . It was not the intention of Dr. Gore and his associates to undermine belief in the supernatural . They declared that evidence for the actual existence of Christ and his Resurrection was " overwhelming . " The account of the raising of Lazarus " is accepted with all its implications as the climax of all the miracles of healing . " They warned against any tendency to explain away the vital points in Christian faith . <P> By theologians who take this attitude the doctrine of " inerrancy of the Scriptures " is given another meaning . Much of rhe material in the Old and New Testament is accepted as true in the historical sense , the rest of it is considered true in a symbolical sense . It is true inasmuch as the moral or mystical meaning which it symbolizes is true .
