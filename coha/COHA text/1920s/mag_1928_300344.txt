Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews returned to Manhattan last week and at once went to his headquarters , the American Museum of Natural History . Two years he had been away , grubbing the Gobi desert sands and rocks for Central Asiatic fossils . He found enough to fill 90 large packing cases . Chinese Nationalists tried to prevent his taking the bones to the Museum . They wanted them for their own exhibits . A little blarney , a little diplomatic pressure , a little gold , and a great deal of expostulation quieted the demands of the Chinese patriots . <P> Bones of the " Woolworth " beast were in the cases . Living ( about six million years ago ) , it was bigger than a motor bus . It stood 15 feet high at the shoulder ; its body was 25 feet long , its neck 12 feet long . It must have weighed 20 tons or more than 20 draft horses weigh . In a way it was related to horses . But it resembled more a rhinoceros , another horse relative . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unique , find was the skull of a titanothere , an archaic tapir . The skull is saddle shaped . The nose bone stands straight up and reaches three feet above the eyes . At the top tip is a flat bulblike button . The titanic beast browsed on the marsh grasses of the Gobi plateau before the region became desert . <P> Interesting also were 23 eggs that Explorer Andrews found . Their identity is not yet certain . He believes them laid by the duckbill iguanodon . That old , toothed dinosaur had a bulky , aldermanic body , a thick tail , and a squat , malicious-looking head . Yet it was " a timorous vegetable-eating creature , obliged to be wary of its flesh-eating dinosaur neighbours . To escape them it ran on its great hind legs . Its front legs were short and handy . So in posture it resembled a bird . <P> Dr. Andrews was looking for animal bones . But he found traces of people living in that Central Asiatic district 20,000 years ago . They were hunters , with spears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lived generation after generation in villages built against the shelter of Gobi sand dunes , near lakes that then existed . Next March Dr. Andrews goes back to their neighbourhood , to try to learn more about their existence , and dispersion over Asia , Europe and probably the Americas .
