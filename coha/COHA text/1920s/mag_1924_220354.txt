The new style . . . has created a new demand for a particular kind of service . This demand is as real as is the demand for dressmakers or milliners . Thousands of young ladies are taking courses throughout the country to train themselves as beauty specialists , particularly in hairdressing and manicuring . . . The environment is not of the best . It is a profession . There is no reason why the schools should not teach the profession to these girls and young women . . . . It is just as important as work and manual training . " <P> Mr. Webster was urging the establishment in his school of a beauty specialists ' course . More than SO would-be bobbers and manicurists having registered , there was every indication that the Board of Education would bear him out , even at an estimated expenditure of $10,000 . The course 's Chief opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said he : " It is criminal to spend the taxpayers ' money to teach girls to bob hair and clean fingernails . " <P> Said a minister : " It is the function of the schools to train young folks to earn a livelihood . "
