The following estimates of books most in the public eye were made after careful consideration of the trend of critical opinion : <P> IMPROMPTU-Elliot H. Paul -- Knopf ( $2.00 ) . The author of that promising first novel Indelible , now living in Boston , here writes a novel of disillusionment and revolt , but without sensationalism or coarseness . The figure of the hero is weak and unsympathetic , but Mr. Paul manages the unpleasantness of his plot with reserve and pity . The story tells the history of a tormented and afraid young man who runs away to war , and returns , the victim of his weakness , to find his former sweetheart . For a time the girl supports him , but after much unhappiness he runs away again to join the colors . Mr. Paul has chosen a theme to repel most readers , but admitting the character of his plot , he has infused it with dignity and pathos , without any descent into melodrama . <P> FIERY PARTICLES-C . E. Montague - Doubleday ( $1.75 ) . The English author of Disenchantment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here turns his hand to fiction . He shows a vivid and versatile talent in writing two Irish sketches , three stories of the war , a newspaper tale , a literary burlesque , a story of mountain climbing and a shuddery horror tale . Mr. Montague shows humor , irony , sympathy . He understands the soldier as well as Kipling , though his sympathies do not run to war . He is never impersonal : he intrudes in the story with ironic or humorous remarks . The book is not so important as Disenchantment , but it introduces an entirely different short story teller . <P> VICTORIA-Knut Hamsun-Knopf ( $1.75 ) . In his most recently translated novel Hamsun turns away from the epic of the land , such as Growth of the Soil , to a love idyl of lingering beauty and sadness . Victoria is in the pensive manner of Wanderers and Dreamers rather than in the more intense mood of Pan . It concerns the love of Victoria , the daughter of a wealthy , aristocratic landowner , for Johannes , the miller 's son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , but rather a finespun mood of a sensitive girl whose injustice to her lover brings about tragedy . Hamsun rarely unwinds a yarn merely for the fun of the thing . He is chiefly interested in the representation of subtle soul-moods and situations motivated by the temperament rather than by violent action .
