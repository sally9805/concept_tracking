txt SAYING IT WITH WINES . To the Editor of The New York Times : Our chosen representatives will start soon to debate at Washington . Many have learned much about Europe during their Summer travels on fast ships and on fast trains and motor cars . Some may " urge " that the European allies , particularly France , must be made to begin payment at once . La France might say : ? ? I have millions of bottles of champagne , including the very excellent 1911 vintage , put away particularly for your connoisseurs . I have Burgundies and Bordeaux of almost priceless quality . I have many kinds of finished goods , on which the most skilled labor has been expended . What will you take , mon cher oncle ? You want more paper , eh ?
