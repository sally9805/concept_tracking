Her Unborn Child came to Manhattan last week after 15 years on the road . Thus , in one respect , it is a grandmother to Abie 's Irish Rose . Critics were not allowed to see it until after a special performance for the Eastern Star society and a matinee for ladies only . It depicts a wholesome Irish family , whose oldest child , Doris , has been seduced by aristocratic Jack Conover . Jack 's aunt , an advocate of birth control and kindred arts , persuades Doris to consult a physician . Doris insists on seeing her good family physician , who eloquently refuses to perform an abortion , rebukes Aunt Conover , suggests that Doris and Jack get married . It is meanwhile discovered that Jack is really the son of Aunt Conover by an Irish father . So , after inordinate weeping , there is a jolly Irish ending with marriage in the offing and with the moral that , after all . " motherhood is God 's greatest gift to humanity . " Her Unborn Child may run another ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to leave the theatre with wet handkerchiefs . Elisha Cooke Jr. , in the comedy role , was better than his lines . <P> The Furies . Murder , for playwrights ' profit , is usually a sordid affair , committed in the first act and for no better reason than to provide a culprit for the conjuring author to produce in the last . Not so for Zoe Akins , who wrote The Furies . The news arrives , it is true , in the first act , that somebody has shot John Sands . The second act is given over almost entirely to heartless catechism conducted by a district attorney . The third finds Fifi Sands imprisoned in a skyscraper apartment with the lunatic who , because he had loved Fift and was afraid to let her divorce his friend and marry another man , had killed her husband . But the thread of evidence is only one of the strands drawn through the astonishing tapestry of this play . It tries to reproduce the effect that such a murder might really have upon a small group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute soliloquy from Harvey Bell Smith who is annoyed because his dinner guests are late ; when Fifi Sands arrives , last of them all , she is hysterical with happiness because she will at last be able to divorce her rich husband and marry Owen Macdonald . When her son comes in to say that John Sands has been shot , the play breaks into a wild , inharmonious and exciting rhythm ; its draughty madness is terrifying , not by virtue of black paws or of guns offstage but because it conveys somehow the impression that God has gone away , that the world is being run now by the cheerful , sardonic , hideous Furies . <P> Less superlatively staged , the play might have seemed no more than sound and furies signifying nothing . But James Reynold 's elaborately perfect settings surrounded a practically flawless cast which in turn surrounded the magnificent performance of Laurette Taylor as Fifi Sands . Laurette Taylor was born on April Fools Day some time ago ; she is married to Playwright J. Hartley Manners , in whose most famed opus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 Manhattan audiences . That was 15 years ago . Now Laurette Taylor is a better actress than ever .
