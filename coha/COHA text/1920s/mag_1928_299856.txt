" It takes guts and it takes loyalty to build a cooperative organization . " Thus spake Aaron Sapiro , last week , to Star Reporter Peter Vischer of Exhibitors Herald &; Moving Picture World . Father of many a cooperative , bitter enemy of Henry Ford , Mr. Sapiro 's latest venture has been the Independent Motion Pictures Exhibitors Association , of which the purpose is to permit the owners of small cinemansions to wield a more potent influence upon the large and exclusive companies which make cinemas . <P> Mr. Sapiro 's function was somewhat difficult to define . Most of the owners of small cinemansions are Jews and they supposed that , if they banded themselves together , Mr. Sapiro would be able to champion their interests and thwart the all too often oppressive business tactics of the great **30;10222;TOOLONG companies , as Paramount-Famous-Lasky , Fox , Loew. - Unfortunately , looking at the membership of his new cooperative , last week , Aaron Sapiro found neither guts nor loyalty . Accordingly he said : " This is a beaten organization today . " He explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . bitter opposition of big producers . . . . Perhaps I have n't the qualities needed to lead this particular group of men . . . . <P> " . . . The vacillations of our own membership . I was promised complete support of the independent producers . They asked me to help them . They admired me as a man and as a Jew . They were proud of me because I had brought Henry Ford to his knees before them ( TIME , May 2 , 1927 , et ante ) . <P> " It is essential for exhibitors to coordinate their buying power . They are nearest the public . They are the outlet of the industry . And they have n't a word to say-not one word-as to how it shall be run . <P> " This cooperative idea is sound and I predict that exhibitors in all parts of the country will have to see its soundness or be swallowed up by the great motion picture machines .

The Federal Trade Commission investigated the system , found it pernicious , forbade it , denounced the burly distributors . But block booking continues .
