Cancer has been increasing since the War at so devastating a rate that now 100,000 persons die of it annually in the U. S. Yet it is to some extent preventable . <P> Last week the American Society for the Control of Cancer ( 370 Seventh Ave. , New York City ; Dr. Howard C. Taylor , president ; Dr. George A. Soper , managing director ) girded itself for renewed educational propaganda . Last year it spent about $60,000 on its work . A fortnight ago John D. Rockefeller Jr . gave it $135,000 . But it needs $1,000,000 as an endowment fund . This it will get . <P> Other societies working along the same lines include the American Association for the Prevention and Cure of Cancer ( 121 East 60th Street , New York City ; Dr. L. Duncan Bulkley , president ; Dr. Paul Luttinger , secretary-treasurer ) and the Cancer Research Fund ( Baltimore ; Mrs. E. H. Bloodgood , treasurer ) . <P> Europe is similarly active ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) . <P> Definition . Cancer is one of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cellular tissue which covers the body 's free-surfaces , and lines tubes and cavities . One of these three types grows in finger-like processes or ridges . It is called papilloma and is benign . Also benign is adenoma , which lines gland-like depressions or cavities in the tissue structure . Under certain conditions papilloma and adenoma may infiltrate into healthy tissues and sometimes displace them . Here they resemble in effect the third epithelial tumor type-carcinoma , or cancer . <P> Cause . There is positively no one cause for cancer definitely agreed upon by reputable medical men , a fact which Dr. James Ewing of the New York Cancer Hospital phrased neatly last week before the American Society for the Control of Cancer : " Cancer is not a single disease but a great collection of many very diverse diseases of very different causation . There is not one cause of cancer . We find that in a great majority of cases rather definite concrete factors bring about the development , and that is summed up in the words ' chronic irritation of a great variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give sympathetic study to theories sincerely presented . <P> Recent Theories . Virus . Virus , of many forms , appears in every cancer patient and vitiates his blood , upsets the biochemistry homologous to the normal for the species , so that the organism can not repair the damage done to the locale of infection or irritation . In consequence , cells ( which with normal , healthy blood food would take their normally diverse form peculiar to the local tissue ) stop their growth at a primitive , atavistic stage . Such primitive cells may lie dormant while the blood is able to counteract the virus . But eventually the virus predominates in the blood and the primitive cells effloresce into cancer . ( Propounded two years ago by Dr. Emilian O. Houda , Bohemian physician of Tacoma , Wash . Dr. Houda , in the current issue of Cancer indignantly asserts that Gye and Barnard of London , who have recently set forth a somewhat similar theory , have not given him due recognition for his prior work. )          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
