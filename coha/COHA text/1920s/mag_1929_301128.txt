When the Red Cross , in 1917 , hired the services of Organizers Charles Sumner Ward and Harvey J. Hill to raise $100,000,000 ( they raised $123,000,000 ) , it sounded the knell of unorganized charity . Other organizers got the idea . After the War they started companies whose sole business it was and is to raise money-for schools , colleges , hospitals , churches , worthy objects of all kinds . The three largest money-raising companies today are Ward , Wells &; Dreshman , Tamblyn &; Brown , John Price Jones , all of Manhattan . <P> Municipalities also got the idea . Instead of letting their citizens be solicited ten or a dozen times a year , why not start a community fund , budget out the money to approved charities , clean up contributions in one annual drive ? Hence the community chest , now operative in about 350 U. S. cities and towns . Of U. S. cities with more than 100,000 population ( census figures as of 1927 ) , only eleven now have no community chest : New York , Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Camden , Trenton ( N. J. ) , Wilmington ( Del ) , Cambridge ( Mass . ) , Yonkers ( N. Y. ) . This year , of 125 community chest campaigns already reported , in spite of the recent stock market break , gains appeared over last year of approximately $1,500,000 . <P> The organization of a community chest campaign is usually a fairly cut- &-dried; matter . The plan used in Scranton is typical : a general campaign chairman , under him four division chairmen , under each division chairman ten teams of twelve persons each ( the actual canvassers ) ; also a publicity division , a speakers division . Complete lists of " prospects , " usually divided into income classes , are parceled among the canvassing teams . Dinners , luncheons , rallies during the intensive period keep up public interest , whet team competition . <P> Many towns , having become expert in raising money , keep a permanent community chest executive and have dispensed with the help of commercial money-raising companies . Of the 350 U. S. community chests , only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these are run by American City Bureau , Manhattan , specialists in community chest and Chamber of Commerce membership drives . <P> Of the 1929 community chest campaigns already concluded , many a one exceeded its quota " in spite of the stockmarket . " Some cases : <P> Scranton , Pa. ( population 144,700 ) under the leadership of Worthington Scranton , raised $673,000 with a per capita subscription of $4 . <P> At Cleveland ( population : 1,010,300 ) , $4,650,000 was the quota , $4,654,357 was raised . Principal donors : Samuel Mather , U. S. Steel Director , $150,000 ; John L. Severance , $44,000 ; John Davison Rockefeller Jr. , $20,000 . <P> Boy Scouts nosed out prospects , Clarence Henry Howard ( Commonwealth Steel Co. ) gave $50,000 and St. Louis ( population : 848,100 ) exceeded its $2,000,000 goal for the first time by $17,617 . Last year the fund of $1,900,000 was undersubscribed $175,000 . <P> Seattle ( population : 383,200 ) , having never before had a successful drive , this year pledged $7,000 more than the $725,000 quota .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
