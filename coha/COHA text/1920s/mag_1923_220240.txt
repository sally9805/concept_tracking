The American Relief Administration has been at odds with the heads of the Soviet because they did not give proper co-operation to American efforts . It appeared that the Russian Government was deliberately trying to drive the Relief Adminis-tration from the country . After a long series of conferences , Leo Kamenev , acting head of the Soviet Government , finally gave Colonel William N. Haskell , chief of the American Relief , assurance that all annoyances would end . Declared Kamenev : " If ever the relief work is not wanted , Russia will frankly say so .
