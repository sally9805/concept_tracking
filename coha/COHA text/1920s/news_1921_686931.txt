txt The question of what the European allies are to do about the German-American Peace Treaty has begun to worry the minds of the officials in the Allied Foreign Offices . They are faced with what is an unprecedented diplomatic situation and they are going very carefully into every one of its aspects before they commit themselves . So far very little has been done . Some days ago the American Embassy here made what 1,7 called an informal inquiry at the Quai d'Orsay as to the attitude that France would be likely to take toward the separate treaty and how best the matter could be put on a regular judicial basis . . The inquiry was registered , but so far no official reply has been , given , for the Quai d'Orsay wants time to think the matter over and perhaps see what the British . Foreign Of- , flee is going to do : ' In an afternoon journal here the statement was published . today that a formal and official note on the subject had been sent by the United States to France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the recognition by France of the separate peace which has been signed . This information - is , however , categorically denied , both by the Foreign Ministry and the American Embassy . No notes on , the subject have yet passed , negotiations ' being ? confined to the informal inquiry already mentioned . The difficulties in the matter , from the standpoint of diplomatic usage , are not ? unreal nor unimportant . From the French point of view the situation is , indeed , to some extent fraught with considerable potential danger . The German-American treaty is unlike any other in that it has incorporated much of the Treaty of Versailles . Now , if the French Foreign Office recognizes what is , from their point of view , a truncated version of their treaty , they may easily give to Germany the means with which to block the observance of those other parts of the treaty in which America is not concerned , but which in *y be vital to France . For instance , to take an extreme case , the German-American treaty does not recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic , and yet France iS asked to recognize a treaty admitting to Germany and to the world that it is a matter of no importance ? that America does not recognize that these provinces have become French . It may be argued that in reality it does not matter , but the French mind does not easily take that line . They like things in black and Write , sealed and in order , and there will need to be considerable ingenuity , before they can succeed in geting this complicated matter into anything like order . Everything will be done in the friendliest spirit and a latitude is likely to be allowed tnat will cover a multitude of difficultiee . But no Frenchman , and certainly no Frenchman with a regard for diplomatic niceties , can be expected to agree willingly to such a proceeding as must be asked by America before her part as part-time participator in the Treaty of Versailles can become effective . At the Quai d'Orsay this afternoon it - was stated that no decision had yet been taken as to the policy which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied . The next move , apparently , is considered to lie with the American State Department , which has not yet otficialiy communicated the text of the treaty to the Allies .
