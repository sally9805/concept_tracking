NARCISSUS , AN ANATOMY OF CLOTHES-Gerald Heard-Dutton ( $1 ) . Evolution raised man from the red earth naked . He looked at himself and knew shame ; he felt the wind , was cold . Therefore he stole from the beasts their striped or tawny elegance , he scooped the rock and lived within it . Clothing and architecture developed together like concentric cortices of a springing rod . Architecture is the outer whorl ; its fashions make their impress on clothes , the inner . Tailors snip and snip , masons slap on their lime ; steeples and toppers affront the sky , eaves overhang , tails droop decorously down . Ingeniously , out of a wide scholarship , Author Heard traces the homologous development of caps and cathedrals , mitres and mosques-15,000 years in a book of 150 pages that scholars will find an interesting tour-de-force , men of letters a most scholarly little tract . And the end ? Clothes , like the appendix , are a useless relic of evolution . For modesty , for protection , for display , we dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked as Heaven 's cherubim ; he will build towers to which the Spire of Salisbury were but a wand !
