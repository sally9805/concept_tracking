txt // Substituting now the values of a , /3 , - - - - etc. , in terms of a " , /3 " , - -  --  etc. , the typical product takes the form It is at once obvious that there are n-1 independent products of this form , since there are n quantities al , b1 , - - - - etc. , and these are subject to only one restriction . The arbitrary function has , therefore , n-I independent arguments . Consider now the dimensions of the product in the fundamental unit in , . Since the dimensions of a in ml are al , the n , b dimensions of a. , in rn , are a , . Similarly the dimensions of /3 K mm , areb , . But the exponents satisfy the condition a , + b , +  --   --  = 0 , so that we see at once that the products which are the arguments of the arbitrary function must all be dimensionless in ml . The second of the equations A , by precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arbitrary function be product , of the arguments which are dimensionless in m2 . In imposiug this additional restriction , the number of independent arguments of the arbitrary function is diminished from n ? 1 to n ? 2 . In the same way the remaining equations of A demand that the products shall be dimensionless in m3 , m47 etc. , until finally we find that the products must be dimensionless in all the fundamental units . At the same time , the number of independent products , which serve as the arguments of the unknown function , are cut down in number to n ? m . Hence we have the final result . If the equation 4 ( a , /3 , y , - - - - ) = 0 is to be a complete equation , the solution has the form where the II 's are the n ? m independent products of the arguments a , /3 ,  --   --  etc. , which are dimensionless in the fundamental units . The result stated in this form is known as the II theorem , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' although an equivalent result had been used by Jeans , 3 without so explicit a statement . // The solution in the form above may be solved explicitly for any one of the products , giving the equivalent form of result a = /3xiyx2  --   --  ( n2 , n3 ,  --   --  ) where the x 's are such that a 3 ' 1 7 ? 22 - - - - is dimensionless . The result in this form embodies the mathematical statement of the principle of dimensional homogeneity . For the arbitrary function on the right-hand side is a function of arguments each of which is of zero dimensions , so that every term of the resulting function must itself be dimensionless . Every term of this function is to be multiplied by a term of the same dimensions as the left-hand side of the equation , with the result that every term on the right-hand side has the same dimensions as the left-hand side . The terms may now be rearranged in any way that we please , but whatever the rearrangement , the dimensions of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of dimensional homogeneity . The attempt is often made to give an off-hand proof of the principle of dimensional homogeneity from the point of view which regards a dimensional formula as an expression of the " essential physical nature " of a quantity . Thus it is said that an equation which is an adequate expression of the physical facts must remain true no matter how the fundamental units are changed in size , for a physical relationship can not be dependent on an arbitrary choice of units , and if the equation is to remain true for all choices of units the dimensions of each term must be the same , for otherwise we would have quantities of different physical natures put equal to each other . For instance , we could not according to this view have a quantity of the dimensions of a length on the one side of an equation equal to a quantity of the dimensions of an area on the other side , for it is absurd that an area should be equal to a length.2 The criticism of this point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation merely being an equation between numbers which are the numerical measures of certain physical quantities . I t is to be most carefully noticed that the work above was subject to a most important tacit restriction at the very outset . In putting $ ( a , /3 , - - - - ) = 0 it was tacitly assumed that this is the only relation between a , , B ,  --   --  etc. , and that the partial derivatives may he computed in the regular way on this assumption . If a , , 13 , y , etc. , are connected by other relations than ( a , , ( 3 ,  --   --  ) = 0 , then the // analysis above does not hold , and the results are no longer true . For it is not true in general that an equation which is a complete equation , that is , an equation which remains true when the size of the fundamental units is changed , is dimensionally homogeneous . Such an equation is dimensionally homogeneous of necessity only when there is no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation itself . Consider as an example a falling body . Let v be its velocity , s the distance of fall , t the time of fall , and g the acceleration of gravity . Now these quantities are related , and there is more than one equation of connection , because both v and s are fixed when t and g are given . The relations connecting these quantities are v = gt , and s = 1/2gt2 . In the light of the above we would expect that a complete equation connecting v , s , g , and t need not be dimensionally homogeneous . An example can be given immediately , naively , This is obviously a complete equation in that it is true and remains true no matter how the fundamental units of length and time are changed in size . We may , if we please , write from these elements an equation which is very much more unusual and offensive in appearance , such as This again is a complete equation ; it is not dimensionally homogeneous , and also offends our preconceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions . The possibility of equations like those just considered is in itself a refutation of the intuitional method of proof of the principle of dimensional homogeneity sometimes given . The equation v + s = gt + 1/2gt2 reminds one of the procedure used in vector analysis , in which three scalar equations may be replaced by a single vector equation . Obviously we may add together any number of complete equations and obtain a result which remains true . And provided that the dimensions of the original equations were all different , the resulting compound equation ( complete but not dimensionally homogeneous ) may be decomposed , like the vector equation , into a number of simpler equations , by picking out the parts with the same dimensions . I do not know whether this method // of throwing the results into a compact form can ever be made to yield any practical advantages or not . Let us now return to the first form in which we put the result above , namely , Consider the H 's and how they are formed from the variables . Write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , c , etc. , are to be so chosen that this is dimensionless . Substituting now the dimensional symbols of a , /3 , - - - - etc. , gives as many equations of condition between a , b , c , etc. , as there are kinds of fundamental unit . The equations are There are m equations , each with n terms . Now the theory of the solutions of such sets of equations may be found in any standard work on algebra . In general , n will be greater than m . Under these conditions there will in general be n ? m independent sets of solutions . That is , there will in general be n ? m independent dimensionless products , and the arbitrary function F will be a function of n ? m variables . In certain special cases this conclusion will have to be modified . If , for instance , n = m , there will in general be no solution , but there may be in the special case that the determinant of the ex-ponents an , fl vanishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m independent solutions if it should happen that all the m-rowed determinants of the exponents vanish . This , of course , will not very often occur , but we shall meet . at least one example later . // In the general case , where there are n ? m independent solutions , it is generally possible to select n ? m of the quantities a , b , c , etc. , in any convenient way , assign to them n ? m sets of independentvalues , and solve for the remaining quantities , thus obtaining n ? m sets of values which determine n ? m dimensionless products . Sometimes this is not possible , and the particular set of the quantities a , b , c , etc. , to which arbitrary values can be assigned can not be chosen with complete freedom . This occurs when certain determinants chosen from the array of the exponents vanish . We will not stop here to develop a general theory , but let the exceptions take care of themselves , as it is always easy to do in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II theorem does not contain anything essentially new , and does not enable us to treat any problems which we could not , already have handled by the methods of the introduction . The advantage of ' the theorem is one of convenience ; it places the result in a form in which it can be used with little mental effort , and in a form of ' a good deal of flexibility , so that the results of the dimensional analysis may be exhibited in a variety of forms , depending on the va , rialrles in which we are particularly interested . In this way it has very important , advantages . The result of this dimensional analysis places no restrictions whatever on the form of the functions by which the results of experiments may be expressed , but the restriction is on the form of the arguments only . However complicated the function , if it is one which satisfies the fundamental requirements of the theory as developed above , it must be possible to rearrange the terms in such a way that it appears as a function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are nearly always interested in expressing one of the quantities as a function of the others . This is done by solving the function for the particular dimensionless product in which the variable in question is located , and then multiplying that dimensionless product ( and of course the other side of the equation as well ) by the reciprocal of the other quantities which are associated with it in the dimensionless product . The result is that on the one side of the equation the variable stands alone , while on the other side is a product of certain powers of some of the other variables multiplied into an arbitrary function of the other dimensionless products . This arbitrary function may be transcendental to the worst degree ; there is absolutely no restriction on it , but its arguments are dimensionless . This agrees with the result // of common experience in regard to the nature of the possible functional relations . We have come to expect that any argument which appears under the sign of a transcendental function must be a dimensionless argument . This is usually expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperbolic sine , for example , of a time , but the only thing of which we can take the sinh is a number . ' Now although the observation is correct which remarks that the arguments of the sinh functions which appear in our analysis are usually dimensionless , the reason assigned for it is not correct . There is no reason why we should not take the sinh of the number which measures a certain interval of time in hours , any more than we should not take the number which counts the number of apples in a peck . Both operations are equally intelligible , but the restrictions imposed by the II theorem are such that we seldom see written the sinh of a dimensional quantity , and even if we should , it would be possible by a rearrangement of terms , as already explained , to get rid of the transcendental function of the dimensional argument by coalescing two or more such functions into a sinh of a single dimensionless argument . Thus it is perfectly correct to write the equation of a falling body in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would do it , because this form is more complicated than that obtained by taking the sinh ? 1 of both sides . The equation above might be rewritten sinh v cosh gt ? cosh v sinh gt ? 0 , in which form the rearrangement to get rid of the transcendental function of a dimensional argument is not so immediate , particularly if one is rusty on his trigonometric formulas . But the last form is perfectly adapted for numerical computation , in the sense that it will always give the correct result , and still holds when the size of the fundamental units is changed . There is a corollary to these remarks about transcendental functions with respect to the exponents of powers . It is obvious that in general we can not have an exponent which has dimensions . If such appears , it is possible to combine it with others in such a way that the dimensionality is lost . But there is absolutely no restriction whatever imposed as to numerical exponents ; these may be integral , or frnct ional , or incommensurable . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quantity should not involve the fundamental quantities to fractional powers . ' This is a part of the view that regards a dimensional formula as an expression of operations on concrete physical things , and this point of view finds it hard to assign a meaning to the two-thirds power of a time , for example . But it seems to me just as hard to assign a physical meaning to a minus second power of a time , and the possibility of such exponents is admitted by everyone . Then . theorem as given contains all the elements of the situation . But in use there is a great deal of flexibility in the choice of the arguments of the function , as is suggested by the fact that it is possible to choose the independent solutions of a set of algebraic equations in a great number of ways . The way in which the independent solutions are chosen determines the form of the dimensionless products , and the best form for these will depend on the particular problem . We shall in chapter VI treat a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be chosen in special cases . CHAPTER V DIMENSIONAL CONSTANTS AND THE NUMBER OF FUNDAMENTAL UNITS Tun essential result which we have obtained in the II theorem is in the restriction which it places on the number of arguments of the arbitrary function . The fewer the arguments , the more restricted the function , and the greater our information about the answer . Thus if the problem is such that there are four variables , and three fundamental kinds of unit , our analysis shows that there is only one dimensionless product , which we can determine , and that some function of this prodnet is zero . This is equivalent to saying , in this special case , that the product itself is some constant , and we have complete information as to the nature of the solution , except for the numerical value of the constant . This was the nature of the solution which we found for the pendulum problem . If it had not been for the dimensional analysis , any conceivable relation between the four arguments might have been possible , and we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there are two more variables than fundamental kind of quantity , there will be two dimensionless products . The solution is an arbitrary function of these two products put equal to zero , which may be solved for one of the products as a function of the other . This was the case with the heat transfer problem already treated . It certainly gives more information to know that the solution is of this form than merely to know that there is some function of the five variables which vanishes , which was all that we could say before we applied our analysis . It is to our advantage , evidently , that the number of arguments which are to be connected by the functional relation should be as small as possible . Now the - variables which enter the functional relation to which our analysis has been applied comprise all the variables which can change in numerical magnitude under the conditions of the problem . These variables are of two kinds . First are the // physical variables , which are the measures of certain physical quantities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our result is to apply . The numbers measuring these physical quantities may also change when the size of the fundamental units changes . In the second place , there may be other arguments of the nature of coefficients in the equation which do not change in numerical magnitude when the physical system alone changes , but which change in magnitude when the size of the fundamental measuring units changes . It is these which we have called dimensional constants . Now in any actual case we are interested only in the physical problem , and are interested in finding a relation between the physically variable quantities . The dimensional constants are to be regarded as an evil , to be tolerated only if they make possible more information about the physical variables . We thus see that the II theorem applies to the aggregate of physical variables and dimensional constants , whereas we are interested primarily in the physical variables alone . If the number of dimensional constants is so great that the number of arguments of the arbitrary function allowed by the II theorem is equal to or greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no better off after applying our II theorem than before . Now we have already seen that in the worst possible case the number of dimensional constants can not exceed the number of physical variables , for any empirical equation can be made complete by the introduction of a dimensional constant with each physical variable . Furthermore , it is almost always true that the number of physical variables is equal to or greater than the number of fundamental units . Hence , if the number of dimensional constants is equal the number of physical variables , the number of dimensionless products is greater than or at most equal to the number of physical variables . In the general case , therefore , the II theorem gives no new information . Hence it is of the utmost importance to keep down to the minimum the number of dimensional constants used in the equation . When , therefore , shall we expect dimensional constants , and in any particular problem how shall we find what they are , and what are their dimensional formulas ? The answer to this question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall choose the list of physical quantities between which we are to search for a relation . We have seen that it does not do to merely ask ourselves " Does the result depend on this or that physical quantity ? " for we r // have seen in one problem that although the result certainly does " depend " on the action of the atomic forces , yet we do not have to consider the atomic forces in our analysis , and they do not enter the functional relation . To answer the question of what variables to include demands a background of a great deal of physical experience . If we are to treat a certain problem by the methods of mechanics we must have enough background to be assured that the problem is a problem in mechanics , and involves essentially no elements that are not treatable by the ordinary equations of mechanics . We must know that certain aspects of the problem can be neglected , and that certain others alone are essential as far as certain features of behavior go . No one would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not essential , but our experience shows that they combine into certain complexes , which may be sufficiently characterized by an analysis which does not go down to the ultimate component parts , and that the results of our analysis , which disregards many even essential aspects of the situation , have validity under certain conditions whose restrictions are not irksome . The experience involved in judgments of this sort reaches so far back that we know almost by instinct whether a problem is suitable for mechanical treatment or not . And if the problem is capable of mechanical treatment , we know , by the very definition of what we mean by a mechanical system , what the equations are which the motion of the component parts of the system conform to , and what the form of the equations is . In the same way , we know by instinct whether a system is a thermodynamic system , or an electrical system , or a chemical system , and in each case , because we know what we mean when we say that a phenomenon is of such or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which govern the variations of the system , and the elements which must be considered in formulating the relations between the parts . But a very wide background of experience , extending over many generations , was necessary before we could say that this particular group of phenomena is mechanical or electrical , or , in general , that the phenomenon is physical . Now my point of view is essentially that precisely the same experience which is demanded to enable us to say whether a system is mechanical or electrical is the experience which is demanded in order to enable us to make a dimensional analysis . This experience will in the first place inform us what physical variables to include // in our list , and will in the second place tell us what dimensional constants are demanded in any particular problem . Let us for the present forget what we know of dimensional analysis and imagine ourselves approaching a new problem . In the first place we decide in the light of the experience of all the ages what the nature of the problem is . Suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the motion of the system is governed by the laws of mechanics , and we know what these laws are . We write down certain equations of motion of the system . We are careful to include all the equations of motion , so that the system of equations by which we have described the relations between the parts of the system has a unique solution . Then we are convinced , because of our past experience , that we have essentially represented all the elements of the situation , that our equations correspond to the reality at least as far as certain aspects of the phenomenon go , and the solution of the equations will correctly represent the behavior of the system which we have thus analyzed . We are not disappointed . The fact that our predictions turn out to be verified means merely that we have become masters of a certain group of natural phenomena . Now the astute observer ( Fourierl was the first astute observer ) notices that the equations by which the relation of the component parts of the system is analyzed are expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the fundamental units is changed . For instance , the equation stating that the force acting on a particular part of our mechanical system is equal to the mass of that part times its acceleration remains true however the size of the fundamental units is changed , because in every system of units which we use for mechanical purposes , the unit of force is defined so that force has this relation to mass and acceleration . Every one of the fundamental equations of motion is in the same way a complete equation . The final solution is obtained from the equations of motion by a purely mathematical process , which has no relation to the size of the fundamental units . It follows , therefore , in general , that the final result will also be complete , in the sense that the equation expressing the final result is a complete equation . Dimensional analysis may , therefore , be applied to the results which we obtain by solving the equations of motion . ( We use equations of motion in a general sense , applying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the arguments of the function which we finally obtain by solving the equations of motion // can obviously be only those quantities which we put into the original equations of motion , for the mathematical operations can introduce no new arguments . In particular , the dimensional constants which enter the final relation are those , and those only , which we had to use in writing down the equations of motion . This is the entire essence of the question of dimensional constants . With regard to the dimensional formulas of dimensional constants , we may merely appeal to experience with the observation that all such constants are of the form of products of powers of the fundamental quantities . But it is evident on reflection , that any law of nature can be expressed in a form in which the dimensional formulas of the constants are of this type , by the device , already adopted , of introducing dimensional constants as factors with the measured quantities in such a way as to make the equation complete . We will hereafter assume that the equations of motion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena ) are thrown into such a form that the dimensional constants are of this type ; this is seen to involve no real restriction . It appears , therefore , that dimensional analysis is essentially of the nature of an analysis of an analysis . We must know enough about the situation to know what the general nature of the problem is , and what the elements are which would be introduced in writing down the equations determining the motion ( in the general sense ) of the system . Then , knowing the nature of the elements , we can obtain certain information about the necessary properties of any relations which can be deduced by mathematical manipulations with the elements . In so far as our knowledge of the underlying laws of nature is adequate we may have confidence in the result , but the result can have no validity not pertaining to the equations of motion , and is in no way different from all our other knowledge . The result is approximate , as the laws of motion are approximate , a restriction which is imposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensional analysis is not to ask himself " On what quantities does the result depend ? " for this question gets nowhere , and is not pertinent . Instead we are to imagine ourselves as writing out the equations of motion at least in sufficient detail to be able to enumerate the elements which enter them . It is not necessary to actually write down the equations , still less to solve them . // Dimensional analysis then gives certain information about the necessary character of the results . It is here of course that the advantage of the method lies , for the results are applicable to systems so complicated that it would not be possible to write the equations of motion in detail . It is to be especially noticed that the results of dimensional analysis can not be applied to any system whose fundamental laws have not yet been formulated in a form independent of the size of the fundamental units . For instance , dimensional analysis would certainly not apply to most of the results of biological measurements , although such results may perfectly well have entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that at present biological phenomena can be described in complete equations only with the aid of as many dimensional constants as there are physical variables . In this ease , we have seen , dimensional analysis has no information to give . In a certain sense , the mastery of a certain group of natural phenomena and their formulation into laws may be said to be coextensive with the discovery of a restricted group of dimensional constants adequate to coordinate all the phenomena . Let us apply this view of the nature of dimensional constants to the problem which we have already considered of the electromagnetic mass of a spherical distribution of electricity . This is evidently a problem in electrodynamics , and must be solved by the use of the field equations . These field equations consist of certain mathematical operators operating on certain combinations of the electric and magnetic forces and the velocity of light . In this particular problem we want to solve the equations in such a form as to get the electromagnetic mass ; this is the integral throughout space of a constant times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of the forces , which are determined by the distribution of the charge . Hence if there is a relation of the form which we suspect , the forces will eliminate from the final result . There is , however , no reason to think that the characteristic constant " c " of the equations will also eliminate from the result , and we must therefore seek for a relation between the total charge , the mass , the radius , and the constant of the field equations , which is the velocity of light . This relation we have already found , and checked against the results of a detailed solution of the field equations applied to This particulnr problem . // We have seen that dimensional constants are going to enter the final result only in so far as they enter the equations of motion . Now a dimensional constant in an equation of motion is an expression of a physical relation which is so universal as to be characteristic of all the phenomena embraced in the particular group which we are considering . Such a universal physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the dimensional constant in the equations as an explicit statement of the relation , as is done in the field equations of electrodynamics , or we may define our fundamental units with this relation in view , thus obtaining a system of units in which the dimensional constant has disappeared but in which the number of units which may be regarded as fundamental has been restricted in such a way that all units belonging to the system automatically bear the experimental relation to each other . The system of units so obtained is of value only in treating that group of phenomena to which the law in question applies . Thus it is a result of experience that the mass times the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force acting upon it . In this statement of the experimental facts there is no restriction whatever upon the units of mass , or length , or time , or force . The factor of proportionality will change in numerical magnitude whenever any one of the four fundamental units is changed in size . But now , instead of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may arbitrarily say that this factor shall be unity in all systems which we will consider , and we will bring this result about by defining the unit of force in our new system to be such that the force acting on a body is equal to the mass times the acceleration . We have in this way obtained a system of units adapted to dealing with all those physical systems in which the laws of motion involve a statement of the physical relation between force , mass , and acceleration , but if the physical system should be such that this relation is not involved in the motion of the system , then we would be unduly restricting ourselves by using the mechanical system of units . These considerations as to the possible systems of units answer the question previously raised , as in the fourth problem of the introduction , for example , as to the number of kinds of units which we shall take as fundamental . The answer depends entirely upon the particular problem , and will involve the physical relations which are necessary to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ordinary problem of dynamics , for example , the relation // between force and mass and acceleration is essentially involved in the equations of motion . This relation may be brought into the equations either by the use of four fundamental kinds of unit , force , mass , length , and time , with the corresponding dimensional constant of proportionality , or by using the ordinary mechanical units of mass , length , and time , in which force is defined so that the experimental relationship is always satisfied , and the dimensional constant has disappeared . In either case the results of the dimensional analysis are the same . For the difference between the number of fundamental units and the number of variables , which determines the number of arguments of the unknown function , is the same in either case , because when the number of units is augmented by one by including the force , the number of variables is also augmented by one by including the dimensional constant , and the difference remains constant . If , however , the problem were such that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not involved in the equations of motion of the system , then the ordinary mechanical units would be inappropriate , because we would obtain less information when using them . For we could in this case use four fundamental units without introducing a corresponding dimensional constant into the list of variables , so that the difference between the number of variables and the units would be less by one when using four than when using three fundamental units , and the arguments of the function would be fewer in number , which is desirable . We shall meet an example illustrating this point later . CHAPTER VI EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATIVE OF DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS LET us in the first place recapitulate the results of the preceding chapter . Before undertaking a dimensional analysis we are to imagine ourselves as making an analysis to the extent of deciding the nature of the problem , and enumerating the physical variables which would enter the equations of motion ( in the general sense ) and also the dimensional coefficients required in writing down the equations of motion . The dimensions of all these variables are then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These fundamental units are to be chosen for each particular problem in such a way that their number is as large as possible without involving the introduction of compensating dimensional constants into the equations of motion . The dimensionless products of the variables are then to be formed in accordance with the II theorem , choosing the products in such a way from the great variety possible that the variables in which we are particularly interested may stand conspicuously by themselves . Having formed the products , the II theorem gives immediately the functional relation . In the following illustrative examples we have particularly to consider the proper number of fundamental units , and the most convenient way of choosing the dimensionless products . The matter of dimensional constants we regard as clear . As the first example we will take the first treated by Lord Rayleigh in Nature . ' Consider a wave advancing on deep water under the action of gravity . This is evidently a problem in hydrodynamics , which is merely mechanics applied to liquids . The equations of mechanics will therefore apply . Now the liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity . This will involve the density of the liquid and the intensity of gravity . Evidently these quantities will enter the equations of motion . No other properties of the liquid , such as the compressibility , will enter , because we know from a discussion of the equations of hydrodynamics that such // properties are unimportant for phenomena of this scale of magnitude . Physically , of course , the compressibility affects the result to a certain extent , so that the result of our analysis will not be exact , but will be a valid approximation only to the extent that the equations of hydrodynamics are valid approximations . There are no dimensional constants entering the equations of hydrodynamics , provided that we use ordinary mechanical units , in which mass , length , and time are fundamental , for the laws of motion have entered this system of units through the definition of force . The equations , of course , are equations between the displacements and the other elements . Now it is conceivable that we might eliminate the various displacements from the equations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity of propagation , the density , and the intensity of gravity only , analogously to the pendulum problem . Let us try this . Write down the variables and their dimensional formulas , as before . We now apply the II theorem . We have three variables , and three fundamental kinds of unit . The difference between these numbers is zero , and therefore , according to the theorem , there are zero dimensionless products . That is , we have made some mistake , and no relation exists , unless this should be one of those exceptional cases in which a product may be formed of fewer than the normal number of factors . But an examination shows that this is no exception , and there is in fact no dimensionless product . This shows that the suggested elimination was not possible , but that some other elements or combination of elements must enter the final result . Of course the detailed analysis will give as the final result a detailed description of the motion of the water , from which we must pick out the wave motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the velocity in the final result there will be something characteristic of the particular wave . The velocity of all the waves need not be the same , hut may depend on the wave length , for example . Physically , of ( nurse , we knew 1 his in the beginning , and we were stupid only for // purposes of instruction . Our experience with problems of this nature would have led us to search for a relation between the variables which we put into the analysis , the velocity , and the wave length . Let us introduce , therefore , into our list of quantities the wave length . Wave length We have now four variables , and the dimensional formulas are expressed in terms of three fundamental kinds of unit , so that the II theorem leads us to expect the existence of one dimensionless product , and the result will be that the dimensionless product is equal to a constant . The proof or the II theorem also showed that one exponent in a dimensionless product can be assigned arbitrarily . Since we are particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity , and write the dimensionless product in the form v d g ? P A  --  Y. Putting this equal to a constant and solving for v , gives for the result The dimensions of the factors on the right-hand side must together be the same as that of the velocity , which stands alone on the left-hand side . We solve for the unknown exponents of the factors of the right-hand side . Substitute the dimensional formulas for the variables Now write down in succession the condition that the exponents of M , of L , and of T be the same on the two sides of the equation . This gives and the final result is of the form v = Const VA g. // The velocity of a gravity wave on deep water ( the reason the depth did not enter the final result was because we postulated that the water was to be deep ) is therefore proportional to the square root of the wave length and the intensity of gravity , or is proportional to the velocity acquired by a body falling freely under gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be noticed that the density of the liquid has disappeared from the final result . This might have been anticipated ; if the density is doubled the gravitational force is also doubled on every element , and the accelerations and therefore all the velocities are unaltered , because the doubled force is compensated by a doubled mass of every element . Since the density disappears from the final result we have here a dimensionless product of v , 1 , and g only . This is , therefore , a dimensionless product of three variables , expressed in three fundamental units . This is in general not possible , but demands some special relation between the dimensional formulas of the variables . We can see in a moment by writing out the product in terms of unknown exponents , and then writing the algebraic equations which the exponents must satisfy , that the condition that a dimensionless product exist in a number of terms just equal to the number of fundamental units is that the determinant of the exponents in the dimensional formulas of the factors vanish . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units , but applies to any number . Conversely the condition that a particular element shall enter as a factor into a dimensionless product with a number of other factors equal in number to the fundamental units , is that the determinant of the exponents of the other factors shall not be zero ; otherwise the other factors by themselves form a dimensionless product into which the factor in which we are interested does not enter . Consider now a second problem . An elastic pendulum is made by attaching to a weightless spring of elastic constant k a box of volume V which is filled with a liquid of density d . The mass of the liquid in the box is acted upon by gravity , and we are required to find an expression for the time of oscillation . As before we make a list of the quantities and their dimensions . // The problem is obviously one in ordinary mechanics , so that we are justified in using the mechanical system of units , and there will be no dimensional constant . The variables which we have listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those in terms of which the problem is rormulated . Here there are five quantities and three fundamental kinds of unit . There are therefore two dimensionless products . In the analysis of the last chapter we saw that in finding the dimensionless products we had to solve a system of algebraic equations . Certain or the solutions could be assigned at pleasure , and the others determined in terms of them . In this particular problem we are interested especially in t , and let us say k . Then let us choose the exponents or t and k in the dimensionless products as those which are to be assigned at pleasure and in terms of which the others are to be computed . Now the algebraic theorem showed that there were two linearly independent sets of exponents which we might assign to t and k , and that it is possible to choose these two sets in an infinite number of ways . We will try to select the two simplest . For the present purpose we will accomplish this by assigning the value 1 to the exponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set , and 0 to the exponent of t and 1 to the exponent of k for the other set . This is certainly a simple couple of pairs , and has the effect of making both t and k appear in only one dimensionless product : We therefore have to find the two dimensionless products We have now two sets of algebraic equations for the two sets of unknown exponents al , /3 , , yr and a2 , /32 , 72 . These equations are // The solutions are Hence the dimensionless products are where the function f is undetermined . Now the result so obtained is undoubtedly correct as far as it goes , but an examination will show that we can do better , and obtain a form in which there is no undetermined function . This improvement can be effected by increasing the number of fundamental units . We were correct in using the ordinary mechanical units , for the equations of motion involve the dynamical relation between force , mass , and acceleration . The change is to be made in a direction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the units written down . It is evident on reflection , however , that in the equations of motion governing the system no use is made of the fact that the numerical measure of the volume of the box is equal to the cube of the length of one of its linear dimensions . It is quite possible to measure volumes physically in terms of a particular volume chosen as unity by cutting up the larger volume into smaller volumes congruent with the unit , and counting the number of times that the unit is contained in the larger volume . It may then be proved that the number so obtained is proportional to the cube of the number measuring one of the linear dimensions . In fact , this is the method of proof originally adopted by Euclid in dealing with both areas and volumes . After the geometrical fact has been proved , it becomes natural to define the unit volume as that volume which is equal to a cube whose sides are unity , but this definition and restriction are of value only in those problems in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . Such is not , the case here , because the volume of the box is of importance only as determining , in conjunction with the density of the liquid , the mass tilling the box . We might perfectly well measure length // for this problem in inches , and the volume in quarts , provided , of course , that we measure density as mass per quart . Let us then attempt the problem again , now taking volume as an independent unit of its own kind . Then we shall have : We have now five variables , but four fundamental kinds of quantity , so that there is only one dimensionless product . We are particularly interested in t , so we choose the exponent of t equal to unity , and are required to find the other exponents so that is dimensionless . This problem is so simple that we can solve for the unknowns by inspection , or if we prefer , write out the equations , which are : The solution of this set of equations is dimensionless product is The information embodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more noncommittal one obtained with three units . It is seen from the new solution , for example , that the time of oscillation does not depend on the intensity of gravity . Physically , of course , this means that gravity is effective only in changing the mean position of equilibrium ; as gravity increases the weight is pulled down and oscillates about a position nearer the center of // attraction , but the period of oscillation is not changed thereby . It was not at all obvious or necessary from the first form of the solution that the time would be independent of gravity , but that the previous solution is not inconsistent with this one is seen by putting the f of the previous solution equal to a constant times the inverse square root of the argument , when the two solutions become identical . Instead of increasing the number of fundamental units from three to four , we might have obtained the same result by observing that the equations of motion are concerned only with the total mass on the end of the string , and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so far as they enter through their product , the mass . According to this method of treatment we would have put v and d together as one quantity , so that we would have been concerned with only four quantities and three fundamental kinds of unit . The result would have been the same as by the method which we adopted . In fact , it will often be found possible by using special knowledge of the problem to obtain in this way more detailed information than would have been possible by the general analysis . If we use the mass as one of the variables , the result assumes the form t = Const ' / ' , ? , and again we have a dimensionless product of fewer than the normal number of terms . Now let us consider a problem illustrating how it is that the result is unaffected by increasing the number of units if at the same time the number of dimensional constants is increased . We take the same problem as above , except that we now give only the mass on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyze the mass into volume times density . The variables will be mass ( m ) , time of oscillation ( t ) , and stiffness of spring ( k ) . We can omit the intensity of gravity , because we have already seen it to be without effect . In discussing this problem we propose to use five fundamental kinds of unit , which we will choose as mass , length , time , as usual , and in addition force , and velocity . This problem is evidently one in mechanics involving in the statement of the relations between the parts the experimental fact that force is proportional to mass times acceleration . Hence in formulating the equations of motion we will have to introduce this proportionality factor , which will appear in the analysis as a new dimensional constant . This factor is to connect force , mass , and acceleration . But now acceleration must be rede64 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS fined if we are using velocity as a unit of its own kind . Acceleration will now be defined as time rate of change of velocity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation of motion thus written will express a relation between the force and the velocity and the time . But the force is connected with the displacement through the elastic constant , so that to solve the equations a relation is needed between displacement , velocity , and time . The experimental fact , of course , is that velocity is proportional to the quotient of distance by time . The factor of proportionality will appear in the final result as a dimensional constant . We now have our list of quantities complete . They compose three physical variables , and two dimensional constants . Here F is the dimensional symbol of force measured in units of force , and V the dimensional symbol of velocity . The dimensional formulas were obtained by the regular methods , noting only that the stiffness of the spring is defined as the force exerted by the spring per unit displacement of the end . We have now to find the dimensionless products involving these five variables . We note in the first place that there are five variables , and five fundamental kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensionless product . But it may be seen on writing it out that the determinant of the exponents in the dimensional formulas vanishes , so that in this special case there is a dimensionless product with fewer than the normal number of factors . Of course we knew that this must be the case from our previous discussion . Now , as before , we select t as the quantity in which we are particularly interested , write the dimensionless product in the form , and write down the condition that the product is dimensionless . This gives // The solution is The dimensionless product is and the final solution This is exactly the same as the solution already obtained , on putting the dimensional constants f and v equal to unity , which of course was their value in the ordinary mechanical system of units . Although this example gives no new results , it is instructive in showing that any system of fundamental units whatever is allowable , provided only that the dimensional constants required by the special problem are also introduced . We now consider a problem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit of its own kind . This is the problem of Stokes of a small sphere falling under gravity in a viscous liquid . The sphere is so small that the motion is everywhere slow , so that there is nowhere turbulence in the fluid . The elements with which we have to deal in this problem are the velocity of fall , the density of the sphere , the diameter of the sphere , the density of the liquid , the viscosity of the liquid , and the intensity of gravity . The problem is evidently one in mechanics , so that if we use the ordinary mechanical units there will be no dimensional constants to introduce . But we notice that the problem is of a very special kind for a mechanical problem . The motion is slow , and the velocity is steady , the forces acting on the sphere and the liquid being everywhere held in equilibrium by the forces called out by the viscosity of the liquid . That is , although this is a problem involving motion , it is a problem involving unaccelerated motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is essentially , therefore , one in statics , and in solving the problem we need to make no use of the fact that in those cases where there happens to be an acceleration the force is // proportional to mass times acceleration . In this problem , therefore , we treat force as its own kind of quantity , and do not have to introduce a compensating dimensional constant . Our analysis of the problem is now as follows : The dimensional formula of viscosity is obtained directly from its definition as force per unit area per unit velocity gradient . The intensity of gravity is taken with the dimensions shown , because obviously the equations of motion will not mention the accelerational aspect of gravitational action , but only the intensity of the force exerted by gravity upon unit mass . We now have six variables , and four fundamental kinds of unit . There are , therefore , two dimensionless products . One of them is evident on inspection , and is d2/d , . Now of the remaining quantities we are especially interested in v. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dimensionless product . We choose D , d , , ? , and g , and seek a dimensionless product of the form v W. The exponents are at once found to be Hence the dimensionless products are The function f is arbitrary , so that we can not tell how the result depends on the densities of the sphere and the liquid , but we do see that the velocity of fall varies as the square of the diameter of the // sphere , and the intensity of gravity , and inversely as the viscosity of the fluid . This problem has of course long been solved by the methods of hydrodynamics , and the solution is See , for example , Millikan , Phys . Rev. , 2 , 110 , 1913 . The exact solution is obtained from the more general one above by giving - ? a as the special value of the function . If we had solved this problem with the ordinary mechanical units , in which force is defined as mass times acceleration , we should have had three instead of two dimensionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form In this form we evidently can say nothing about the effect on the velocity of any of the elements taken by themselves , since they all occur under the arbitrary functional symbol . There are many problems in which some specific information about the nature of the physical system enables the information given by dimensional analysis to be supplemented so that a more restricted form of the solution can be obtained than would be possible by dimensional analysis alone . There is , of course , no law against combining dimensional analysis with any information at our command . Let us take as a simple example the discussion of the problem of the bending of a beam . This is a problem in elasticity . Let us endeavor to find how the stiffness of the beam depends on the dimensions of the beam , and any other quantities that may be involved . Now the equations of elasticity are equations of ordinary mechanics . The mechanical system of three fundamental units is indicated . The equations of elasticity from which the solution is to be obtained will involve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isotropic , there will be two elastic constants , which may be chosen as Young 's modulus , and the shear modulus . Our analysis may now run as follows : // There are six variables , and three fundamental kinds of unit . Hence according to the general rule there should be three dimensionless products . Three such products can obviously be written down by inspection , and are Now none of these dimensionless products contains the quantity S in which we are particularly interested , and it is evident that there is something peculiar about this problem . It will in fact be found , on going back to the system of algebraic equations on which the solution depends , and writing down the matrix of the coefficients obtained from the exponents in the dimensional formulas , that each of the three rowed determinants formed out of the matrix is zero . This is evident on inspection of the matrix . This means that in this particular case there are more dimensionless products than are given by the general rule . That such is the case should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dimensional formulas shows that M and T always enter in the combination MT ? 2 , so that this combination together might have been treated as a fundamental unit itself , so that there would have been only two fundamental units instead of three , and four instead of three dimensionless products . In the second place , this is a problem in statics , in which mass and time do not enter into the results . The dimensions of all the quantities could have been given in terms of force and length as the fundamental units . This remark is the physical equivalent of the analytical observation that M and T always occur in the combination MT ? 2 ( force is MT ' multiplied by L ) . // With the knowledge that there is still another dimensionless product , we can see by inspection that it is S/El , so that the final solution is This solution gives no information about the variation of stiffness with the dimensions of the beam . Now it is obvious from elementary considerations of elasticity , that for slender beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other things being equal , for the boundary conditions are such that the solution for a beam of twice the breadth may be obtained approximately by simply placing beside each other two of the original beams . Hence f must be of such a form that 1f reduces to and the value of f must obviously be bThe restricted solution is therefore The solution now shows that a beam of double the length can be kept of the same stiffness by doubling the depth . The detailed solution of elasticity shows that the ratio of d to 1 enters as the cube , as a factor of proportionality , so that the stiffness is proportional directly to the cube of the depth , inversely to the cube of the length , directly as the breadth , and to some unknown function of the elastic constants . This method of supplementing the results of dimensional analysis by other information will often be found of value . There are numerous examples in Lord Rayleigh 's treatments . Rayleigh does not always separate the analysis into a dimensional and another part , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it may require supplementing in some such way as above . A good example will be found in his treatment of the scattering of light by the sky . ' The result that the scattering varies inversely as the fourth power of the wave length of the incident light is obtained by using in addition to dimensional knowledge the fact that " From // what we know of the dynamics of the situation i ( ratio of amplitude of incident and scattered light ) varies directly as T ( volume of scattering particle ) and inversely as r ( distance of point of observation from scattering particle ) . " Thus far we have considered only problems in mechanics , but of course the method is not restricted to such problems , but can be applied to any system whose laws can be formulated in a form independent of the size of the fundamental units of measurement . Let us consider , for example , a problem from the kinetic theory of gases , and find the pressure exerted by a perfect gas . The atoms of the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clastic , and of negligible dimensions compared with their distance apart . The only constant with dimensions required in determining the behavior of each atom is therefore its mass . The behavior of the aggregate of atoms is also evidently characterized by the density of the gas or the number of atoms per unit volume . The problem is evidently one of mechanics , and the pressure exerted by the gas is to be found by computing the change of momentum per unit time and per unit area of the atoms striking the walls of the enclosure . The mechanical system of units is therefore indicated . But in addition to the ordinary mechanical features there is the element of temperature to be considered . Iiow does temperature enter in writing down the equations of motion of the system ? Obviously through the gas constant , which gives the average kinetic energy of each atom as a function of the temperature . Our analysis of the problem therefore runs as follows : We have here five variables , and four kinds of units . There is , therefore , one dimensionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested , we choose the exponent of this as unity . We have to find pm ' NP 9y km. // The work of solution is as before . The values of the exponents are The dimensionless product is and the final solution is That is , the pressure is proportional to the gas constant , to the density of the gas , and to the absolute temperature , and does not depend on the mass of the individual atoms . The formula for pressure is , of course , one of the first obtained in any discussion of kinetic theory , and differs from the above only in that the numerical value of the constant of proportionality is determined . In this problem , or in other problems of the same type , we could , if we preferred , eliminate temperature as an independent kind of variable and define it as equal to the energy of the atom . This amounts merely to changing the size of the degree , but does not change the ratio of any two temperatures , and is the sort of change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we define temperature in this way , the gas constant is of course to be put equal to unity . We would now have three fundamental units , and four variables . There is of course again only one dimensionless product , and the same result would be obtained as before . Let us go through the work ; it is instructive . We now have to find our dimensionless product in the form pm ? Nse ' " . The exponents are at once found to be and the solution of the problem is p = Const N B. // This solution is like the one obtained previously except for the presence of the gas constant , but since the gas constant in the new system of units is unity , the two solutions are identical , as they should be . This procedure can obviously be followed in any problem whose solution involves the gas constant . Temperature may be either chosen as an independent unit , in which case the gas constant appears explicitly as a variable , or temperature may be so defined that the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy . The same procedure is not incorrect in problems not involving the gas constant in the solution . But if in this class of problem temperature is defined as equal to the kinetic energy of an atom ( or more generally equal to the energy of a degree of freedom ) and the gas constant is made equal to unity , the fundamental units are restricted with no compensating advantage , so that although the results are correct as far as temperature is proportional to the energy of a degree of freedom , they will not give so much information as might have been obtained by leaving the units less restricted . It is obvious that these remarks apply immediately to the heat transfer problem of Rayleigh treated in the introductory chapter . Many persons feel an intuitive uncertainty with regard to the dimensions to be assigned to temperature . This is perhaps because of the feeling that a dimensional formula is a statement of the physical nature of the quantity as contained in the definition . Now the absolute temperature , as we have used it above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second law of thermodynamics . It is difficult to see how such a complex of physical operations as is involved in the use of the second law ( such as Kelvin first gave in his definition of absolute temperature ) can be reproduced in a simple dimensional formula . It is , however , evident that measurements of energy , for example , are involved in an application of the second law , so that perhaps in some way the ordinary mechanical units ought to be involved in the dimensional formula . But we have seen that the dimensional formula is concerned only with an exceedingly restricted aspect of the way in which the various physical operations enter the definition , namely with the way in which the numerical measure of a quantity changes when the fundamental units change in magnitude . Now a little reflection shows that any such procedure as that of Lord Kelvin // applied to the definition of absolute temperature through the use of the second law imposes on the number measuring a given concrete temperature no restriction whatever in terms of the units in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The size of a degree of thermodynamic temperature may be fixed entirely arbitrarily so that there are any number of degrees between the freezing and the boiling points of water , for example , absolutely without reference to the size of any other unit . We are concerned in the dimensional formula with the definition in terms of the second law only in so far as this definition satisfies the principle of the absolute significance of relative magnitude , that is , the principle that the ratio of the measures of two concrete examples shall be independent of the size of the units . Now it is evident that the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature does leave the ratio of any two concrete temperatures independent of the size of the units . The dimensional formula of temperature , therefore , need contain no other element , and temperature may be treated as having its own dimensions . There is no necessity in using the absolute thermodynamic temperature . We might , for instance , define the number of degrees in a given temperature interval as the number of units of length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain bottle of kerosene moves when the bottle is brought from one temperature to another . The temperature so defined evidently satisfies the principle of the absolute significance of relative magnitude , for if the size of the unit of length measured along the capillary is cut in half , the number of degrees in every temperature interval is doubled . The advantage of the thermodynamic scale is one of simplicity ; in the kerosene scale the behavior of a perfect gas could not be characterized in terms of a single constant , and the Fourier equations of heat conduction could not be written , except over a very narrow range , in terms of a single coefficient of thermal conductivity . Besides the question of the dimensions of temperature , there is one other question connected with the application of dimensional analysis to problems in thermodynamics which is apt to be puzzling ; this is the matter of the so-called logarithmic constants . In books on thermodynamics equations are very common which on first sight do not appear to be complete equations or to be dimensionally homogeneous . These equations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some factor when the size of the // fundamental units is changed , but must change by the addition of some term . An example will be found on page 6 of Nernst 's Yale lectures on the Applications of Thermodynamics to Chemistry . This equation is : In this equation C is a concentration of a given gaseous substance , A0 is a heat , a , b , and c are dimensional coefficients in the usual sense into which we need not inquire further , except that a/R is dimensionless , and i is a constant of integration . It is obvious that this formula as it stands does not allow the size of the fundamental units to be changed by making the usual sort of changes in the various quantities . But a rearrangement of terms is possible which throws the formula into the conventional form . If we group together the terms log C , a/R log T , and i into the single term where i ' is a new constant , we evidently have a complete equation in the usual sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. This sort of rearrangement of terms is always possible if the formula has had a theoretical derivation , as have all the formulas of these treatises , and the logarithmic constant appears only as a formal exception . The logarithmic constant is met with so often in thermodynamic formulas because in most thermodynamic expressions there is an undetermined constant of integration arising from the fact that energy , or work , or entropy , or thermodynamic potential has no absolute significance , but is only the difference between two values , and the coordinates of the initial point which fix the origin of entropy , for example , may be chosen at pleasure . The formulas of thermodynamics also often present a strange appearance in the way that concrete quantities ( that is , quantities with dimensions ) appear as the arguments of transcendental functions . Thus on page 5 of the same book of Nernst 's , we find the formula . // This comes from an application of Clapeyron 's equation to a substance whose vapor obeys the perfect gas law , and the volume of whose vapor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the appearance of a pressure under the logarithm sign , this equation is seen on examination to be a complete equation , and holds valid for all sizes of the fundamental units . This may at once- be seen on expanding which is equal to 1 , and is therefore d p d T of zero dimensions in p . Expressions of this sort in which the logarithm is taken of a quantity with dimensions are particularly common in thermodynamics , and often arise from the equations of the perfect gas . The occurrence of such logarithmic terms should , it seems to me , be difficult for those to interpret who like to regard a dimensional formula as expressing a concrete physical operation on a concrete physical thing . That the occurrence of such expressions is not contrary to the II theorem is seen from the expanded form , p d T P. The slope of the d curve , d T , would be one of the variables in which the dimensionless products are to be expressed , and there is evidently- no exception . Our theorem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dimensionless products ; we have no reason to think that the man who derived the formula was accommodating enough to write the formula so that this would appear without some rearrangement of the terms . Let us close this chapter of special examples with several electrical examples . As the first example consider an electric circuit possessing capacity and inductance . An oscillatory discharge is excited in it . How does the period of the discharge depend on the constants of the circuit ? The solution of this problem is to be obtained from the detailed equations of the electric circuit , written in the usual form , in electromagnetic units . None of the electrostatic effects of the current , or the interactions with a magnet , have to be considered in the equations , which are of the form // found that q/i also has the dimensions of a time , and his solution would have been of the form L c ) which is not incorrect , since it reduces to the form already found on putting f equal to a constant , but it gives less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem in electrostatics . The conception of the medium introduced by Faraday tells us that it is possible to regard the medium as the seat of the essential phenomena in the electrostatic field , and that the condition of the medium at any instant is uniquely determined by the electric vector at that point . Let us seek for the connection between the space density of energy in the electrostatic field and the intensity of the field . Since this is a problem in statics , the phenomena can be adequately described in terms of two fundamental units , those of force and length . Furthermore the field equations of electrostatics contain no dimensional constants , so that the velocity of light does not enter the results , as it did the problem of the mass of the spherical distribution of charge . In terms of the two fundamental units of force and length we may make our fundamental definitions as follows . Unit electrostatic charge is that charge which at distance of unity from an equal charge in empty space exerts on it a force of unity . The electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the force on the charge . The dielectric constant is the ratio of the force between two charges when in empty space , and when surrounded by the medium in question . The dimensions of dielectric constant are obviously zero . The dimensions of energy with this system of units are obviously force multiplied by distance . We now formulate the problem . We are to seek for a relation between E and u . Generally there would not be a relation between these quantities , because there are two fundamental quantities and two variables . But under the spe76 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS Hence in establishing the units fundamental to this equation it is evidently sufficient to consider only three fundamental kinds of quantity , namely , quantity of electricity , time , and energy . Then current is to be defined as quantity per unit time , coefficient of selfinduction is such a quantity that when multiplied by half the square of the current it gives an energy , and similarly the capacity is such a quantity that it gives an energy when divided into the square of a quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Now the time of oscillation might conceivably involve the constants of the circuit , and the initial charge of the condenser . That is , we are to look for a relation between q , L , c , and t . Since we are especially interested in t , we try to find a dimensionless product of the form The exponents are at once found to be giving as the solution of the problem This of course is the solution which would be found by actually solving the equations of the circuit , except for the value of the constant coefficient . It is to be noticed that the initial charge does not enter . This problem is evidently the electrical analogue of the mechanical problem of the simple pendulum . It is perhaps worth noticing again that some knowledge of the nature of the solution is necessary before dimensional analysis can be used to advantage . The Australian bushman , when attacking this problem for the first time , might be tempted to look for a relation of the dimensions of a time between the constants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantaneous charge in the condenser . If he had included i in his list of variables , he would have // found that q/i also has the dimensions of a time , and his solution would have been of the form which is not incorrect , since it reduces to the form already found on putting f equal to a constant , but it gives less information than the previous form . We now consider a problem in electrostatics . The conception of the medium introduced by Faraday tells us that it is possible to regard the medium as the seat of the essential phenomena in the electrostatic field , and that the condition of the medium at any instant is uniquely determined by the electric vector at that point . Let us seek for the connection between the space density of energy in the electrostatic field and the intensity of the field . Since this is a problem in statics , the phenomena can be adequately described in terms of two fundamental units , those of force and length . Furthermore the field equations of electrostatics contain no dimensional constants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results , as it did the problem of the mass of the spherical distribution of charge . In terms of the two fundamental units of force and length we may make our fundamental definitions as follows . Unit electrostatic charge is that charge which at distance of unity from an equal charge in empty space exerts on it a force of unity . The electric vector is that vector which when multiplied into the charge gives the force on the charge . The dielectric constant is the ratio of the force between two charges when in empty space , and when surrounded by the medium in question . The dimensions of dielectric constant are obviously zero . The dimensions of energy with this system of units are obviously force multiplied by distance . We now formulate the problem . We are to seek for a relation between E and u . Generally there would not be a relation between these quantities , because there are two fundamental quantities and two variables . But under the spe78 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS cial conditions of this problem a relation exists , and the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In treatises on electrostatics the constant is found to be % . If instead of the energy density in empty space we had tried to find the energy density inside a ponderable body with dielectric constant e , the above result would have been modified by the appearance of an arbitrary function of the dielectric constant as a factor . Dimensional analysis can give no information as to the form of the function . As a matter of fact , the function is equal to the dielectric constant itself . This problem is instructive in showing the variety of ways in which it is possible to choose the fundamental units . Since the problem is one which may be reduced to formulation in mechanical terms ( the definitions of electrical quantities are given immediately in terms of mechanical quantities ) we might have used the ordinary three units of mechanics as fundamental , and written the dimensional formulas in terms of mass , length , and time . We would have obtained the following formulation . Again we are to seek for a relation between the energy density and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three kinds of fundamental units , so that again the general rule would allow no dimensionless products , and no relation , but the relation between the exponents is such that the dimensionless product does exist , and in fact is found to be exactly the same as before . The new formulation in terms of different fundamental units does not change the result , as it should not . Many persons will object to the dimensional formulas given for these electrostatic quantities on the ground that we arbitrarily put the dielectric constant of empty space equal to unity , whereas we know nothing about its nature , and therefore have suppressed certain dimensions which are essential to a complete statement of the problem . This point of view will of course not be disturbing to the reader of this exposition , who has come to see that there is nothing // absolute about dimensions , but that they may be anything consistent with a set of definitions which agree with the experimental facts . However , let us by actual example carry through this problem , including the dielectric constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity which can not be expressed in terms of mass , length , and time . Call the dielectric constant of empty space k , and use the same letter to stand for the quantity itself , and its dimension . Then the unit of electrostatic charge is now defined by the relation , force = e2/k r2 . Field strength is to be defined as before as eE = Force . If we formulate the problem in terms of these fundamentals , the electrostatic field equations will now contain k explicitly , so that the dimensional constant k appears in the list of variables . The formulation of the problem is now as follows : We again look for a dimensionless product in which the terms are E , u , and k , and find the result to be u = Const k E2 . This reduces to that previously found on putting k equal to unity , which was the value of k in the previous formulation of the problem . The form above appears somewhat more general than the form previously obtained in virtue of the factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about nature , but merely shows how the formal expression of the result will change when we change the formulation of the definitions at the basis of our system of equations . The inclusion of the factor k in the result and in the definitions is therefore of no advantage to us , and never can be of advantage , if our considerations are correct . There has been much written on the " true " dimensions of k , and much speculation about the various physical pictures of the mechanical structure of the ether which follow from one or another assumption as to the " true " dimensions , but so far as I am aware , no result has been ever suggested by this method which has led to the discovery of new facts , although it can not be denied that a nnin80 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS ber of experiments have been suggested by these considerations , as for example those of Lodge on the mechanical properties of the ether . CHAPTER VII APPLICATIONS OF DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS TO MODEL EXPERIMENTS . OTHER ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS HITHERTO we have applied dimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore have been able to check our results . There are , however , in engineering practise a large number of problems so complicated that the exact solution is not obtainable . Under these conditions dimensional analysis enables us to obtain certain information about the form of the result which could be obtained in practise only by experiments with an impossibly wide variation of the arguments of the unknown function . In order to apply dimensional analysis we merely have to know what kind of a physical system it is that we are dealing with , and what the variables are which enter the equation ; we do not even have to write the equations down explicitly , much less solve them . In many cases of this sort , the partial information given by dimensional analysis may be combined with measurements on only a part of the totality of physical systems covered by the analysis , so that together all the information needed is obtained with much less trouble and expense than would otherwise be possible . This method is coming to be of more and more importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetus from the necessities of airplane design . The method has received wide use at the National Physical Laboratory in England , and at the Bureau of Standards in this country , and has been described in numerous papers . At the Bureau of Standards Dr. Edgar Buckingham has been largely instrumental in putting the results of dimensional analysis into such a form that they may be easily applied , and in making a number of important applications . The nature of the results obtainable by this method may be illustrated by a very simple example . Suppose that it is desired to construct a very large and expensive pendulum of accurately predetermined time of swing . Dimensional analysis shows that the 1 ime // of oscillation of the entire system of all pendulums is given by the formula t = Const /l/g . Hence to determine the time of any pendulum whatever , it is sufficient to determine by experiment only the value of the constant in the equation . The constant may evidently be found by a single experiment on a pendulum of any length whatever . The experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by measuring the time of swing of it , the time of swing of the projected large pendulum may be obtained . The case of the pendulum is especially simple in that no arbitrary function appeared in the result . Now let us consider the more general case which may be complicated by the appearance of an arbitrary function . Suppose that the variables of the problem are denoted by Q ? Q2 , etc. , and that the dimensionless products are found , and that the result is thrown into the form where the arguments of the function and the factor outside embrace all the dimensionless products , so that the result as shown is general . Now in passing from one physical system to another the arbitrary function will in general change in an unknown way , so that little if any useful information could be obtained by indiscriminate model experiments . But if the models are chosen in such a restricted way that all the arguments of the unknown function have the same value for the model as for the full scale example , then the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors outside the functional sign , and the manner of variation of these factors is known from the dimensional analysis . Two systems which are so related to each other that the arguments inside the unknown functional sign are equal numerically are said to be physically similar systems . It is evident that a model experiment can give valuable information if the model is constructed in such a way that it is physically similar to the full scale example . The condition of physical similarity involves in general not only conditions on the dimensions of the model but on all the other physical variables as well . As an example let us consider the resistance experienced by a body of some definable shape in moving through an infinite mass of fluid . Special cases of this problem are the resistance encountered by a projectile , by an airplane , by a submarine in deep water , or by a falling raindrop . The problem is evidently one of mechanics , and // involves the equations of hydrodynamics . The conditions are exceedingly complicated , and would be difficult to formulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it done by some sort of a super-being . The important thing to notice is that no dimensional constants appear in the equation of hydrodynamics if the ordinary mechanical units in terms of mass , length , and time are used , so that the result will involve only the measurable physical variables . The variables are the resistance to the motion , the velocity of motion , the shape of the body , which we may suppose specified by some absolute dimension and the ratio to it of certain other lengths ( as , for instance , the shape of an ellipsoid may be specified by the length of the longest axis and the ratio to this axis of the other axes ) and the constants of the fluid , which are its density , viscosity , and compressibility , the latter of which we may specify by giving the velocity of sound in the fluid . We suppose that gravity does not enter the results , that is , the body is in uniform motion at a constant level , so that no work is done by the gravitational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows . We have here six variables , not counting the shape factors , which may have any number depending on the geometrical complexity of the body , so that there are three dimensionless products exclusive of the shape factors , which are already dimensionless . One of these three dimensionless products is obvious on inspection , and is v ' /v . We have to find the other dimensionless products in the way best adapted to this particular problem . Since we are interested in the resistance to the motion , we choose this as the term with unit exponent in one of the products , so that we may write the result with R standing alone on the left-hand side of the equation . We find by the methods that we have used so many times that there are two // dimensionless products of the forms R v 21 ? 2 d ' and p.v ' 1 ? 1 d ' , so that the final solution takes the form R = v2 12 d f ( ? /v 1 d , v ' /v , r1 , r2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so broad as to cover a wide range of experimental conditions . If the velocity is low , the problem reduces to one of equilibrium in which the forces on the solid body immersed in the fluid are held in equilibrium by the forces due to the viscosity in the fluid . The resistance does not depend on the density of the fluid , nor on the velocity of sound in it . Evidently if the density is to disappear from the above result , the argument ? /vld must come outside the functional sign as a factor , and for slow motion the law of resistance takes the form The resistance at low velocities is therefore proportional to the viscosity , to the velocity , and to the linear dimensions , and besides this depends only on the geometrical shape of the body . We have already met a special case in the Stoke 's problem of the sphere , in the introductory chapter . For a domain of still higher velocities the density of the fluid plays an important part , since some of the force acting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the body by the fluid in the form of eddies ( and the momentum carried away obviously depends on the density of the fluid ) , but the velocity of sound has not yet begun to affect the result , which means that the fluid acts sensibly like an incompressible liquid . This is the realm of velocities of interest in airplane work . Under these conditions the argument v ' /v drops out of the function , therefore , and the result becomes Let us stop to inquire how the information given by this equation can be used in devising model experiments . What we desire to do is to make a measurement of the resistance encountered by the model under certain conditions , and to infer from this what would be the resistance encountered by the full size example . It is in the first , place obvious that the unknown function must have the same value for the model and the original . This means , since the function is entirely unknown , that all the arguments must have the same value // for the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must therefore be the same for both , or in other words , the model and the original must be geometrically of the same shape . Furthermore , ? /vld must have the same numerical value for both . If the model experiment is to be performed in air , as it usually is , au , and d are the same for the model and original , so that vl must be the same for model and original . That is , if the model is one-tenth the linear dimensions of the original , then its velocity must be ten times as great as that of the original . Under these conditions the formula shows that the resistance encountered by the model is exactly the same as that encountered by the original . Now this requirement imposes such difficult conditions to meet in practise , demanding velocities in the model of the order of thousands of miles per hour , that it would seem at first sight that we had proved the impossibility of model experiments of this sort . But in practise the function of ? /v 1 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information can nevertheless be obtained from the model experiment . If measurements are made on the resistance of the model at various speeds , and the corresponding values of the function calculated ( that is , if the measured resistances are divided by v212 d ) , it will be found that at high values of the velocity the function f approaches asymptotically a constant value . This means that at high velocities the resistance approaches proportionality to the square of the velocity . It is sufficient to carry the experiment on the model only to such velocities that the asymptotical value of the function may be found , in order to obtain all the information necessary about the behavior of the full scale example , for obviously we now know that the resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity , and the model experiment has given the factor of proportionality . The only doubtful point in this proposed procedure is the question as to whether it is possible to reach with the model speeds high enough to give the asymptotic value , and this question is answered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the velocities of actual airplane work the resistance has become proportional to the square of the velocity means , according to the analysis , that the viscosity no longer plays a dominant part . This means that skin friction has dropped out as an important part of the retarding force , and that all the work of driving the airplane is used in creating eddies in the air . Freedom from viscosity and complete turbulence of motion are seen by the // analysis to be the same thing . This view of the phenomena is abundantly verified by experiment . Let us consider the possibility of making model experiments in some other medium than air . If we choose water as the medium for the model we must so choose the dimensions and the velocity of the model that ? /v d 1 for the model is equal to ? /v d 1 for the original . Now for water p. is 10 ? 2 and d is 1 , whereas for air IA is 170 X 10 ? 3 and d is 1.29 X 10 ? 3 . Substituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one-thirteenth of the value for the original . As a factor one-thirteenth is itself about the reduction in size that would be convenient for the model ; this would mean that the model in water must travel at about the same rate as the original in air . Such high velocities in water are difficult , and there seems no advantage in using water over the actual procedure that is possible in air . Consider now still higher velocities , such as those of a projectile , which may be higher than the velocity of sound in the medium , so that the medium has difficulty in getting out of the way of the body , and we have a still different order of effects . At these velocities the viscosity has entirely disappeared from the result , which now takes the form R = v2 12 d f ( v ' /v , r1 , r2 ,  --   --  ) . If we are now to make model experiments , it is evident that the model projectile must be of the same shape as the original , and furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model and the original . If the model experiment is made in air , v ' for the model will be the same as for the original , so that v must be the same also . That is , the original and the model must travel at the same speed . Under these conditions the formula shows that the resistance varies as the area of cross section of the projectile . The requirement that the model must travel at the same speed as the original imposes such severe restrictions in practise that model experiments on projectiles are most difficult , and apparently have not yet been successfully made , but all the information has been derived from experience with actual projectiles . We may try to avoid the difficulty by making the experiment in another medium , such as water . But the velocity of sound in wat. r is of the order of five times that in air , so that the conditions would require that the velocity of the model projectile in water should he e // five times that of the actual projectile in air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the results of dimensional analysis may be applied in other branches of engineering . At the Bureau of Standards extensive applications have been made in discussing the performance of various kinds of technical instruments . A class of instruments for the same purpose have certain characteristics in common so that it is often possible to write down a detailed analysis applicable to all instruments of the particular type . Dimensional analysis gives certain information about what the result of such an analysis must be , so that it is possible to make inferences from the behavior of one instrument concerning the behavior of other instruments of somewhat different construction . This subject is treated at considerable length and a number of examples are given in Aeronautic Instruments Circular No. 30 of the Bureau of Standards , written by Mr. M. D. Hersey . CHAPTER VIII APPLICATIONS TO THEORETICAL PHYSICS THE methods of dimensional analysis are worthy of playing a much more important part as a tool in theoretical investigation than has hitherto been realized . No investigator should allow himself to proceed to the detailed solution of a problem until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution which will be obtained , and convinced himself by appeal to experiment that the points of view embodied in the underlying equations are sound . Probably one difficulty that has been particularly troublesome in theoretical applications has been the matter of dimensional constants ; it is in just such theoretical investigations that dimensional constants are most likely to appear , and with no clear conception of the nature of a dimensional constant or when to expect its appearance , hesitancy is natural in applying the method . But after the discussion of the preceding pages , the matter of dimensional constants should now be readily handled in any special problem . The indeterminateness of the numerical factors of proportionality is often also felt to be a disadvantage of the dimensional method , but in many theoretical investigations it is often possible to obtain approximate information about the numerical order of magnitude of the results . Our considerations with regard to dimensional analysis show that any numerical coefficients in the final result are the result of mathematical operations performed on the original equations of motion ( in the general sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general observation that such mathematical operations usually do not introduce any very large numerical factors , or any very small ones . Any very large or small numbers in our equations almost always are the result of the substitution of the numerical value of some physical quantity , such as the number of atoms in a cubic centimeter , or the electrostatic charge on the electron , or the velocity of light . Accordingly , if the analysis is carried through with all the physical quantities kept in literal form , we may expect that the numerical coefficients will not be large or small . This observation may be used conversely . Suppose that we suspect // a connection between certain quantities , but as yet do not know enough of the nature of the physical system to be able to write down the equations of connection , or even to be sure what would be the elements which would enter an equation of connection . We assume that there is a relation between certain quantities , and then by a dimensional analysis find what the form of the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerical values of the physic cal quantities , and thus get the numerical value of the unknown coefficient . If this coefficient is of the order of unity ( which may mean not of the order of 1010 according to our sanguinity ) the suspected relation appears as not intrinsically improbable , and we continue to think about the matter to discover what the precise relation between the elements may be . If , on the other hand , the coefficient turns out to be large or small , we discard the idea as improbable . An exposition of this method , and an interesting example were given by Einstein ' in the early days of the study of the specific heats of solids and their connection with quantum phenomena . The question was whether the same forces between the atoms which determine the ordinary elastic behavior of a solid might not also be the forces concerned in the infra red characteristic optical frequencies . This view evidently had important bearings on our whole conception of the nature of the forces in a solid , and the nature of optical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these terms we may regard the solid as an array of atoms regularly spaced at the corners of cubes . In our analysis we shall evidently want to know the mass of the atoms , and their distance apart ( or the number per cm3 ) . Furthermore , if our view of the nature of the forces is correct the nature of the forces between the atoms is sufficiently characterized by an elastic constant , which we will take as the compressibility . These elements should now be sufficient to determine the infra red characteristic frequency . We make our usual analysis of the problem . // There should be one dimensionless product in these quantities , and it is at once found to be k v2 N m . The final result is therefore We now take the numerical values pertaining to some actual substance and substitute in the equation to find the numerical value of the coefficient . For copper , k = 7 X 10-13 , v = 7.5 X 10 " , m = 1.06 X 10-22 , and N = 7.5 X 10 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is of the order of unity , and the point of view is thus far justified . It is of course now a matter of history that this point of view is the basis of Debye ' s analysis of the specific heat phenomena in a solid , and that it is brilliantly justified by experiment . Another example of this sort of argument concerning the magnitude of the constants is given by Jeans.2 The question was whether the earth has at any time in its past history passed through a stage of gravitational instability , and whether this instability has had any actual relation to the course of evolution . A preliminary examination by the method of dimensions showed Jeans what must be the form of the relation between the variables such as mean density , radius , elastic constants , etc. , at the moment of gravitational instability , and then a substitution of the numerical values for the earth gave a coefficient of the order of unity . This preliminary examination showed , therefore , that it was quite conceivable that gravitational instability might be a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , and a more detailed examination of the problem was accordingly undertaken . Consider another application of the same argument , this time with a negative result . Let us suppose that we are trying to construct an electrodynamic theory of gravitation , and that we regard the gravitational field as in some way , as yet undiscovered , connected with the properties of the electron , to be deduced by an application of the field equations of electrodynamics . Now in the field equations there occurs a dimensional constant c , the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units , which is known to be of the dimensions of a velocity , and numerically to be the same as the velocity of light . In searching for a relation of the sort suspected , we therefore consider as the variables the charge on the electron , the mass of the // electron ( for charge and mass together characterize the electron ) , the velocity of light , and the gravitational constant . We make the following analysis : We have four variables , and three fundamental units , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once found to be Gm2e-2 , the velocity- of light not entering the hypothetical relation , and the final result taking the significantly simple form G = Const ( e/m ) 2 . We now substitute numerical values to find the magnitude of the constant . G = 6.658 X 10-2 , and e/m = 5.3 X 1017 , so that Const = 2.35 X 10 ? 43 The constant is seen therefore to be impossibly small , and we give up the attempt to think how there might be a relation between these quantities , although the simplicity of the dimensional relation between G and e/m is arresting . Identity of dimensional formulas must not be thought , therefore , to indicate an a priori probability of any sort of physical relation . When there are so many kinds of different physical quantities expressed in terms of a few fundamental units , there can not help being all sorts of accidental relations between them , and without further examination we can not say whether a dimensional relation is real or accidental . Thus the mere fact that the dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify us in expecting that there is a mechanism to account for the quantum consisting of something or other in rotational motion . The converse of the theorem attempted above does hold , however . If there is a true physical connection between certain quantities , then there is also a dimensional relation . This result may be used to advantage as a tool of exploration . Consider now a problem showing that any true physical relation must also involve a dimensional relation . Suppose that we are try92 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS ing to build up a theory of thermal conduction , and are searching for a connection between the mechanism of thermal conduction and the mechanism responsible for the ordinary thermodynamic behavior of substances . The thermodynamic behavior may be considered as specified by the compressibility , thermal expansion , specific heat ( all taken per unit volume ) , and the absolute temperature . If only those aspects of the mechanism which are responsible for the thermodynamic behavior are also effective in determining the thermal conductivity , then it must be possible to find a dimensional relation between the thermodynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulation of the problem . We are to seek for a dimensionless product in these variables . There are five variables , and four fundamental kinds of quantity , so that we would expect one dimensionless product . Since ? is the quantity in which we are particularly interested , we choose it as the member of the product with unity for the exponent , write the product in the form and attempt to solve for the exponents in the usual way . We soon encounter difficulties , however , for it appears that the equations are inconsistent with each other . This we verify by writing down the determinant of the exponents in the dimensional formulas for k , A , C , and B. The determinant is found to vanish , which means that the dimensionless product does not exist . Hence the hypothetical relation between thermal conductivity and thermodynamic data does not exist , and the mechanism of the solid must have other properties than those sufficient to account for the thermodynamic data alone . We now give a simple discussion of the problem of radiation from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by ii // Jeans . ' The paper of Jeans is also interesting because he uses a system of electrical units in which the dielectric constant of empty space is introduced explicitly . It is easy to see on a little examination that he would have obtained the same result with a system of units in which the dielectric constant of empty space is defined as unity . Let us now consider a cavity with walls which have absolutely no specific properties of their own , but are perfect reflectors of any incident radiation . Inside the cavity is a rarefied gas composed of electrons . If the gas is rarefied enough we know from such considerations as those given by Richardson in considering thermionic emission that the electrons function like a perfect gas , the effect of the space distribution of electrostatic charge being negligible in comparison with the forces due to collisions as gas particles . The electron gas in the cavity is to be maintained at a temperature B. The electrons are acted on by two sets of forces ; the collisional forces with the other electrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms in ordinary kinetic theory , and the radiational field in the ether . Since the electrons are continually being accelerated , they are continually radiating , and they are also continually absorbing energy from the radiational field of the ether . The system must eventually come to equilibrium with a certain energy density in the ether , the electrons possessing at the same time the kinetic energy appropriate to gas atoms at the temperature of the enclosure . The detailed solution of the problem obviously involves a most complicated piece of statistical analysis , but a dimensional analysis gives much information about the form of the result . In solving this problem we shall have to use the field equations of electrodynamics , so that the velocity of light will be a dimensional constant in the result . The charge and the mass of the electron must be considered , the absolute temperature , and the gas constant , because this determines the kinetic energy of motion of the electrons as a function of temperature . The number of electrons per cm3 does not enter , because we know from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of their number . The second law of thermodynamics also shows that the energy density in the enclosure is a function of the temperature , and not of the density of the electron gas . Our formulation of the problem is now as follows : // The ordinary electrostatic system of units is used . There are here six variables and four fundamental kinds of unit , hence two dimensionless products , unless there should be some special relation between the exponents . Since we are especially interested in u we choose this as the member of one of the products with unit exponent . We find in the usual way that two products are The result therefore takes the form We as yet know nothing of the nature of the arbitrary function . The argument of the function , however , is seen to have a definite physical significance . kOm ' is half the square of the velocity of the electron ( k9 being its kinetic energy ) , so that the argument is onehalf the square of the ratio of the velocity of the electron to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the practical range of temperature , so that whatever the form of the function , we know that we have a function of a quantity which is always small . By an extension of the reasoning which we employed for the numerical value of any coefficients to be met with in dimensional analysis , we may say that the probability is that the numerical value of such a function is sensibly the same as its value for the value zero of the argument , that is , the function may be replaced by a constant for the range of values of the variable met with in practise . Hence with much plausibility we may expect the result to be of the form u 0 is the only physical variable on the right-hand side of this equation , so that as far as physical variables go the result may be written in the form u=a94. // This , of course , is the well-known Stefan 's law , which checks with experiment . The result therefore justifies to a certain extent the views which led , to the result . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to expect that the constant in the first form of the result could not be too large or too small . That is , if we put a = Const k4 e-6 , the result should have a certain simplicity of form , such as might seem to be a plausible result of a mathematical operation . Now Lewis and Adams4 have called attention to the fact that within the limits of experimental error the constant of Stefan 's law may be written in the form Although ( 4 7r ) 6 is not an especially small number in the sense of the original formulation by Einstein of the probability criterion for numerical coefficients , it is nevertheless to be regarded as small considering the size of the exponents of the quantities with which it is associated , and it is undeniable that the result is of such simplicity that it seems probable that the coefficient may be the result of a mathematical process , and is not merely due to a chance combination of elements in a dimensionally correct form . At any rate , whatever our opinions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the result sticks in our minds , and we reserve judgment until the final solution is forthcoming , in the same way that the periodic classification of the elements had to be carried along with suspended judgment until the final solution was forthcoming . It may be mentioned that Lorentz and his pupils have tried a detailed analysis on these terms , with unsuccessful results . The above analysis gives other opportunities for thought . It is significant that the quantum h does not enter the result , although it appears to be inseparably connected with the radiation processes , at least in ponderable matter . We know that h enters the formula for the spectral distribution of energy , and we also know from thermodynamics that the distribution of energy throughout the spectrum in a cavity such as the above is the same as the distribution in equilibrium with a black body composed of atoms . The spectral distribution in the cavity which we have been considering must therefore involve h . Does this mean that h can be determined in terms of the electronic constants , the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether , so that no mechanism with which we are not already familiar is needed to account for h ? Of course Lewis has used Planck 's formula for h in terms of a , etc. , in order to obtain a numerical value for h in terms of other quantities . As an additional example of the application of dimensional analysis in theoretical investigations let us examine the possibility of explaining the mechanical behavior of substances on the basis of a particular form of the law of force between atoms . We suppose that the law of force can be written in the form A is to be intrinsically negative , and represents an attractive force , and B is positive , and represents a force of repulsion which becomes very intense on close approach of the atoms . The atoms of different substances may differ in mass and in the numerical value of the coefficients A and B , but the exponent n is to be the same for all substances . We also suppose that the temperature is so high that the quantum h plays no important part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , but that the gas constant is sufficient in determining the distribution . The external variables which may be imposed on the system are the pressure and the temperature . When these are given the volume is also determined , and all the other properties . We have , therefore , the following list of quantities in terms of which any of the properties of the substance are to be determined . In addition to these we will have whatever particular property of the substance is under discussion . In the above list there are six quantities in terms of four fundamental units . Therefore from this list of permanent variables there are two dimensionless products . Let us find them . We will choose one involving p and not 0 , and the // other B and not p , since p and B are the physical variables under our control . The products are at once found to be The existence of these two products already gives us information about the behavior of the body in those cases in which pressure and temperature are not independently variable quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or on the melting curve , or on the curve of equilibrium between two allotropic modifications of the solid . Under these conditions we have and where f is the same function for all substances . A and B vary from substance to substance . Hence this analysis shows that in terms of a new variable p C1 for the pressure , and a new variable B C2 for temperature , the equations for the equilibrium curves of all substances are the same . These new pressure and temperature variables are obtained by multiplying the ordinary pressure and temperature by constant factors , and may be called the reduced pressure and temperature . Van der Waal 's equation is a particular case of such an equation , which becomes the same for all substances in terms of the reduced variables . Now consider any other physical property of the substance which is to be accounted for in terms of the variables of the analysis above . We have to form another dimensionless product in which it is involved . This dimensionless product may most conveniently be expressed in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since these are physically invariable for the particular substance . The expression of any physical quantity is always dimensionally possible in terms of these quantities , unless the determinant of the exponents of m , k , A , and B vanishes , and this is seen to vanish only in the case n = +2 , which is the trivial case of the force reducing to an attraction alone . Hence in the general case any physical property , which we may call Q , may be expressed in the form // where the Const may involve m , k , A , and B in any way , but does not involve p or B. Now if we define Q/Const as the " reduced " value of Q , then we have the important result that for all substances of this type the equation connecting the reduced value of a quantity Q with the reduced pressure and temperature is the same . This applies not only to thermodynamic properties , but to all properties which are to be explained in terms of the same structure , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of which the measured values of the physical variables are converted to " reduced " values will enable us to compute A , B , and m for the substance in question , if n can be otherwise determined . It is evident on consideration of the above work that the only assumption which we have made about n is that it is dimensionless , and that we have not used the assumption stated in the beginning that n is the same for all substances . We may therefore drop this assumption , and have the theorem that for all substances whose behavior can be determined in terms of atoms which are characterized by a mass and a law of force of the form Ar ? 2 + Br ? , with no restriction on A , B , or n , there is a law of corresponding states for all physical properties . Evidently it would be possible to carry through an analysis like the above in which the external variables p and 0 are replaced by any other two which might be convenient , such as certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been obtained , unless there should happen to be special relations between the dimensional exponents . Whether there are such special relations can be easily determined in any special case . Before anyone starts on a detailed development of such a theory of the structure of matter as this , he would make a preliminary examination to see whether the properties of substances do actually obey such a law of corresponding states , and govern his future actions accordingly . The value of the advance information obtained in this way is incontestable . The analysis above reminds one in some particulars of that of Meslin , 5 but is much more general , in that the analysis of Meslin applied only to the equation of state , and had to assume the existence of critical , or other peculiar points . As a final application of dimensional analysis to theoretical // physics we consider the determination of the so-called absolute systems of units . The units in ordinary use are ones whose absolute size is fixed in various arbitrary ways , although the relations between the differ . ent sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit of length , the centimeter , was originally defined as bearing a certain relation to a quadrant of the earth 's circumference , and the unit of mass is the mass of a quantity of water occupying the unit volume . There is something ntirely arbitrary in selecting the earth and water as the particular substances which are to fix the size of the units . We have also met in the course of our many examples dimensional constants . These constants usually are the expression of some proportionality factor which enters into the expression of a law of nature empirically discovered . Such dimensional constants are the constant of gravitation , the velocity of light , the quantum , the constant of Stefan 's law , etc . Now the numerical magnitude of the dimensional constants depends on the size of the fundamental units in a way fixed by the dimensional formulas . By varying the size of the fundamental units , we may vary in any way that we please the numerical magnitude of the dimensional constant . In particular , by assigning the proper magnitudes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensional constants equal to unity . Now the dimensional constants are usually the expression of some universal law of nature . If the fundamental units are so chosen in size that the dimensional constants have the value unity , then we have determined the size of the units by reference to universal phenomena instead of by reference to such restricted phenomena as the density of water at atmospheric pressure at some fixed temperature , for instance , and the units to that extent are more significant . There is no reason why one should be restricted to dimensional constants of universal occurrence in fixing the size of the units , but any phenomenon of universal occurrence may be used . Thus the units may be so chosen that the charge on the electron is unity . Any system of units fixed in this way by reference to phenomena or relationships of universal occurrence and significance may be called an absolute system of units . The first system of absolute units was given by Planck ' in his book on heat radiation . He connected the particular system which he gave with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment that before the discovery of the // quantum there were not enough dimensional constants of the proper character known to make possible a universal system of units , but such is not the case . Planck was the first to think of the possibility of absolute units , and used the quantum in determining them , but there is no necessary connection with the quantum , as may be seen in the following discussion . Let us now determine from the dimensional formulas the set of absolute units given by Planck . To fix this set of units we choose the constant of gravitation , the velocity of light , the quantum , and the gas constant . We require that the fundamental units be of such a size that each of these dimensional constants has the value unity in the new system . The discussion may be simplified for the present by omitting the gas constant , for this is the only one which involves the unit of temperature , and it is obvious that after the units of mass , length , and time have been fixed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the degree . In determining the size of the new units we find it advantageous to choose the form of notation used in the third chapter in changing units . Consider , for example , the constant of gravitation . We write this as Constant of gravitation = G 6.658 X 10 ? 8 gm ? 1 cm3 sec ? 2 . The value in the new system of units is to be found by substituting in the expression for G the value of the new units in terms of the old . Thus if the new unit of mass is such that it is equal to x gm , and the new unit of length is equal to y cm , and the new unit of time to z sec , we shall have as the equation to determine x , y , and z , since the numerical value of the gravitational constant is to be unity in the new s The other two dimensional constants give the two additional equations needed to determine x , y , and z . These other equations are immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerical values of the velocity of light and the quantum are known . The equations are This set of three equations may be readily solved , and gives x =
