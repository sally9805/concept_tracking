Famed among world department stores is Harrods , of London . Here shop Britain 's King and Britain 's Queen . Here come Her Majesty of Spain , Her Majesty of Belgium , many a Lord and many a Lady . Not quite so large as Selfridge 's , Harrods admits no superior in quality , in clientele . Head of Harrods is Sir Woodman Burbidge , Bart. , C.B.E. , member of Royal Automobile , Royal Thames Yacht , Ranelagh clubs , Commandeur de l'Ordre de Leopold II of Belgium . Solemn , dignified , impeccable , Harrods last week published in the New York Times and the London Times a series of testimonial advertisements so ingenious as to command the instant admiration of U.S. advertising men , to whom British advertising is often a source of amusement . The Harrods series was in fact posted on the bulletin board of the J. Walter Thompson Co. , potent Manhattan agency . <P> The distinguishing characteristic of the Harrods series was its success in making three excellent testimonials out of three refusals to give testimonials . Harrods had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " lend the influence of their pens to the cause of Business " by writing what might vulgarly be termed an advertisement for Harrods . All three refused . But all three also wrote long letters explaining their position . Mr. Wells and Mr. Bennett virtually watered their refusals with their tears , Mr. Shaw seemed somewhat less tempted and some what less grieved . <P> Wells . Said Mr. Wells : " I can imagine nothing more amusing and exciting than to study your marvelous organization but our only paymaster ought to be the reader . . . . The writer . . . classes himself . . . with the teachers and the priests and the prophets . . . . Apart from that your project is most attractive . " <P> Bennett . Said Mr. Bennett : " I am all in favour of the departmental store . I can not keep my eyes off its window-displays , its crowds of customers , its army of employees but public opinion in Britain is not yet ripe to approve the employment of responsible imaginative writers ... in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ from public opinion . . . but I will not flout it . " <P> Shaw . Said Mr. Shaw ( in the course of a 1000-word essay ) : " To propose such a transaction to Mr. H. G. Wells is like offering the Archbishop of Canterbury a handsome cheque for dropping a recommendation of somebody 's shoes or soap into his next sermon , or sounding the Astronomer Royal as to the possibility of keeping the clock back for half an hour during a big sale . ... Its acceptance would be the last depravity of corruption in literature . . . . For ... an author to accept payment from a commercial enterprise for using his influence to induce the public to buy its wares would be to sin against the Holy Ghost . ... By all means let our commercial houses engage skilled but nameless scribes to write their advertisements as such . But a writer who has been consecrated by Fame to the service of the public , and has thus become prophet as well as author , must take wages in no other service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
