In 1925 , Charles Brand , a recent addition to the House from Ohio , wrote to Secretary of Commerce Hoover and said that , although he thought his own name was being considered , he felt like asking President Coolidge to appoint Mr. Hoover as Secretary of Agriculture . " I do n't know any one who fits the place so well as you , " wrote Mr. Brand . <P> In 1928 , Mr. Brand attacked Secretary Hoover as " the supreme opponent of agricultural prosperity for the last ten years . " <P> Sere , august Representative Burton of Mr. Brand 's home State promptly called attention to Mr. Brand 's inconsistency ( TIME , March 26 ) . It seemed a flagrant case of bootlicking by Mr. Brand in 1925 and hamstringing in 1928 . Mr. Burton called it " vicious . " Mr. Brand left the floor of the House flabbergasted , humiliated , speechless . <P> Three weeks after the event , Mr. Brand issued an alibi ( see LETTERS ) . He had " gone over " his back files . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was advocating , as a means of agricultural relief , the production of sugar and wool in the United States that we were purchasing abroad . " Mr. Hoover said something to the same effect at that time so Mr. Brand thought Mr. Hoover would make the best Secretary of Agriculture possible . Later , he discovered that Mr. Hoover 's ideas did not coincide with his own . " So my hopes for Mr. Hoover were blasted , " said Mr. Brand . <P> Further researches revealed to Mr. Brand that Mr. Hoover " saw fit to manipulate the buying forces " during the War , preventing farmers from getting more than $2.20 per bushel for wheat when " otherwise the price would have been $5 to $10 per bushel . " <P> Coincident with the release of Mr. Brand 's alibi , Dr. Harry Augustus Garfield , president of Williams College and during the War , chairman of the Fair Price Committee , issued a statement : " Mr. Hoover had absolutely no part in this matter .
