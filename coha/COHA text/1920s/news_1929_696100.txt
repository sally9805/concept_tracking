txt The airplane has proved its value in the Antarctic . Flying has been done under most severe conditions , in cold far below zero . through snow squalls , over surfaces obscured by drift and surrounded by an indefinite horizon . Motors have shown no mechanical failures and landing gear has stood up on fields . so rough that at home no pilot would dream of taking off on them with load . The reliability of modern air-cooled motors and the strength of modern welded steel construction have been many times demonstrated . That the planes performed so well was because Antarctic conditions were anticipated . It had been found that methods for meeting a condition were sufficient . althoi.1411.in some cases protective measures have been extended . And many valuable lessons have been learned , - one of the most important being that every airplane for use in this country of violent winds should have folded wings . Airplanes can be flown here with safety on flights of reasonable length , can be secured in the open in a territory of strong winds , and stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is unquestionable . Byrd Tells of Obstacles Overcome , . " Aviation has definitely taken its place in exploration , " Commander Byrd said today . " The work done by the airplane and the dirigible in the North Polar regions is now being done successfully in the Antarctic . " It has been shown that a country accessible only by arduous and dangerous effort by the old methods may be quickly and more thoroughly explored by airplane . " And when to exploration is added an accurate aerial survey with a camera , the old method is so immeasurably surpassed that there seems to he little comparison except for detailed work , such as that of the geologist . " There are some who doubted the applicability of the airplane to Antarctic exploration before this expedition started . Their objections , however , were based on insufficient knowledge of aviation . " The sudden winds , snowstorms and bad visibility of Antarctica were deemed insurmountable obstacles to any extensive work . These difficulties were realized and anticipated by us . " But we have been able so far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly around the snowstorms and overcome bad visibility by instrument flying . " I should judge that 60 per cent of our flying has been by instruments , because it has been impossible to distinguish the surface or horizon at times during flights . Looks to Even Greater Future . " The results so far have exceeded our expectations , and I am more than ever convinced that in a region so inaccessible as Antarctica the airplane is the logical method for exploration except where local conditions make it prohibitive . " We have flown over thousands of square miles of territory never before seen , surveyed and mapped it , and we have landed on it for a closer geological examination and to fix its position . " True , we have lost one airplane , but we were pioneering and I believe , from the experience gained , that this can be avoided by future air explorers . " So I think the record of this preliminary work speaks well for the use of the airplane in exploration and points the way to an even greater record to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will come after us . " Our three flights have been successful because more than a year ago , while Floyd Bennett was alive , he began preparing for them . " Bennett had had the invaluable experience of flying in Greenland with Byrd and of the North Pole flight , both pioneer efforts in the Arctic , and he knew the difficulties to be met . Bennett would have been second in command of the Antarctic Expedition , and those of us who knew him well often think of him and miss him . Problem of Keeping Motor Warm . An airplane , to function successfully in the Antarctic , must , however , be specially prepared for the strains and temperatures to be encountered . Flying with loads off rough surfaces , where a plane bounces and smashes its way into the air , necessitates strengthening the landing gear and , in some cases , redesigning it . And to prevent a motor from becoming cold and stopping at a time when a forced landing would result in a crack-up requires most careful protection in the designs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motors warm . The cold . est temperature so far encountered ' in flight has been 38 degrees below zero , and next Snrittg here It is pxob. - able that flights will be made in much colder weather . The heating problem has been solved by cowling the motors so that 40 per cent of the cooling surface is covered , the cylinders in the cowling are used so that the motors may be flown in warmer temperatures as they were in Summer at home . A small shutter opening was left in the cowling around the crankshaft to cool the engine , but down here it is kept closed . All oil pumps and oil tanks are lagged with fourteen-inch abestos . The outside lagging , whenever possible , is wrapped in fabric , which is sewed and hemmed , making it airtight . Unusually large drains arc used on all tanks so that they may be drained quickly when a motor is stopped . Difficulties of Carburetion . Proper carburetion is obtained by an adjustable heating system from the exhaust , which heats the air both before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat is applied after the mixture leaves the carburetor and just enough heat is obtained in this way to get efficiency without increasing the size of the jets . The system is not yet perfected , as the gasoline consumption is about 10 per cent more than in normal temperatures . During a photographic flight at an altitude of 10,000 feet in a temperature of 38 below zero , the engine began backfiring and missing , due to lack of heat in the oil system . The oil temperature normally is from 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit , but on this occasion it fell to 100 . Lagging two more oil lines brought it up to 140 , and there has been no further trouble . It is believed that eventually it will be possible to enclose the entire aircooled engine in cowling so that the flow of air may be regulated and an even temperature may be maintained at all times . Such a complete cowling would be ideal for Antarctic flying . : Melting Out a Snow-Packed Engine . The method of starting engines in this climate has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked with ice and snow may be melted out and started in three-quarters of an hour . It is frequently found after a storm that fine snow has drifted in through the tiny openings in the canvas covering until every space between the cylinders , rods , and even the inside cowling is packed with hard snow . Moreover , the valve box covers are ' filled with a paste of snow and congealed oil and the entire engine is so stiff that a man can throw his weight on the propeller without budging it . This looks rather hopeless until a heater is put under the engine and it is melted out . Even if the engine could be turned over , carburetion in a cold engine at 30 below zero would be impossible . To overcome this condition ' the entire engine is covered with a fireproof canvas cover which encloses also the section containing the oil lines , oil tanks and carburetor . From the bottom of this covering a tube of the same material extends to the snow and a blow torch is placed under it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to heat a motor to the temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit in ? forty-five minutes . Hot oil is then poured in , the engine is primed thoroughly and the propellor is turned around while priming . The covering and blow torch are removed and the engine is started . The only failure since operations were begun was from improper priming , due to lack of familiarity with the method . Heating to Check the Values . Checking values is more arduous and difficult than at home . It is first necessary to heat the engine as if for flight . The value box covering is then removed and the valves are checked and set . Then the engine-is reheated and the valves are checked again . The heating was necessary because of the paste of snow and oil found in the valve boxes and the fact that everything was so frozen fast that it was impossible to determine clearances . A valve check is made every fifteen hours of flying and there is very little change after the second check . Incidentally , the clearances used are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no changes in the carburetor setting or in the fuel mixture since leaving the states . Two Types of Landing Gear . Landing gear and skis have been very satisfactory . They have withstood tremendous shocks . Two types have been used so far , one with the skis fitted on an ordinary landing gear in the place of wheels and the other having a special landing gear permitting only an up-and-down motion with no side movement . The latter type is believed to be the ideal type for hard use on such rough surfaces as ere encos  --  tered here , although there was no sign of failure in the other kind . But any one yaw has . gone bounding and crashing across the hummocks in a take-off realizes the necessity for reducing the chance of failure as much as possible . In the ordinary type of landing gear , with a movable strut hinged to a lower longeron , there is an outward movement of the Skis when landing or- bouncing on a take-off and if a ridge hits a side ski at such a time something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side . Experience has- shown that all motion in the joints near the fuselage should - be eliminated , ? that all ful-1 crum action should be at the point where stress is applied , in other words - near the skis . That is why . for work on snow , a landing gear permitting only up-and-down mo- J tion , with not more than an inch of side motion , is believed to be best . The landing gear should also be wider than for use with wheels . Value of - this was shown when Commander Byrd and Dean Smith took off on a very rough field the day they flew to the rescue of the mountain party . With narrower landing gear they would probably have cracked up . These same - conditions make constant inspection necessary . Need of Folding Wings Shown . The experience with the Fokker at the mountains has convinced Commander Byrd that- hereafter every plane to be used in the Antarctic , even tri-motored ships , should have folding wings . That plane might have been saved if the wings could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of the plane , its . high lift , was what wrecked it . Flying has been very much the same here as . at home , with the exception that 60 per cent has been by instruments and half the landings are power-stall landings , due to inability to tell whether the plane was one foot or fifty above ground . The instruments have worked well , although the air speed indicator has filled with drift snow while a plane was on the ground and has had to be cleaned out before leaving . There is also need for better visibility in planes and some of the pilots are inclined to believe that an open cockpit for the pilot would add to the safety . in landing under unusual light conditions . An adjustable pneumatic shock absorber , if it would work in this climate , which could be adjusted . for various loads , might help in getting i off the ground and in landing smoothly . But , on the whole , the planes have been unusually successful and much has been learned that will aid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
