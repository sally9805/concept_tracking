Democratic politicians of Boston stood in the rain before the portals of the aristocratic Union Club on Beacon Hill , one night last week , asking a liveried flunkey if it were really true that Alfred Emanuel Smith was a guest at a private dinner being given by 40 Brown Derby members of the Harvard faculty and corporation . <P> It was true . Mr. Smith was inside , sitting on the right of Professor Felix Frankfurter , famed Harvard Law School liberal and Sacco-Vanzetti defender . Close by sat Professor Francis B. Sayre , Woodrow Wilson 's son-in-law . Mr. Smith talked for two hours on Water Power , municipal v. private operation , from his long experience of it in New York . Utmost secrecy attended the dinner . Newsgatherers , as such , are never allowed in the Union Club . Nevertheless , when Mr. Smith found the Press was present , he said : " You 've got to give the boys the news . " <P> The boys were admitted . They begged for " extended remarks . " <P> Mr. Smith : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the remarks I had in my system . " <P> A Reporter : " Well , Massachusetts took them all right . " <P> Mr. Smith : " You bet it did . If some of the others took them as well , maybe it would n't have been possible for me to be here tonight . "
