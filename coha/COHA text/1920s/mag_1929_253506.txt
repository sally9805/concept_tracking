Dynamo . All the fallibility of Eugene O'Neill as a playwright is to be found in his latest play , the first of a trilogy in which , believe it or not , he evidently seeks to answer no less a question than : What is God ? It is the dramatization of that inexplicable bewilderment that has befogged men from the first grey light of a primeval dawn . To the farrago of groping speculation that has entangled the ages , O'Neill has brought the confusion of his own technique in the theatre . It could scarcely be expected that the result would be clarity . <P> The playwright has reduced the problem to unjustifiably simple terms . His querist springs from a clash between fundamentalism and atheism . He is the son of an unyielding minister and he is in love with the daughter of a belligerent unbeliever . Driven by the fear inspired by both these attitudes he sets out to find a god before whom he will not have to cower . <P> In electricity he finds a great life force . This he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that he is bowing before something that is unexplained . He sacrifices his earthly love to it but is unappeased . In the end he gives himself to this new deity , the dynamo , only to be thrown back lifeless , so far as this world is concerned . Or has he just begun to live ? O'Neill begs the question with his final curtain . <P> It is , of course , a challenging play , as are all that come from this pen . It is told with strange confusion . O'Neill again resorts to the " aside , " which he revived for Strange Interlude , and , at times , to the stark staccato of the new school . These make for cloudiness but the play frequently transcends its uncertainty with moments of eerie suspense . And the dia log is often shot through with a fine fire of poetry . It is played against elemental backgrounds designed by Lee Simonson which do much to soften its rough edges . <P> The playing is more intelligible than the play . Glenn Anders is splendidly desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temptress with a true earthiness but is , in addition , one of the most beautiful pictures in this season 's gallery . Dudley Digges gives to the atheist his usual excellent sense of values . <P> It is Miss Colbert 's dbut with the Theatre Guild , a happy event for both . She is a small brunette of perfect symmetry and French antecedents . New York first discovered her in A Kiss in a Taxi in 1925 . Since then she has played in The Barker ( in which she met Actor Norman Foster , whom she married ) , The Pearl of Great Price , The Mulberry Bush , The Ghost Train , Fast Life , and Tin Pan Alley . She has gifts which the Guild undoubtedly will magnify . <P> The Whispering Gallery . Those who frighten easily and enjoy it will probably find this mystery play more interesting than the recent average . It is frankly of the " **34;6393;TOOLONG **32;6429;TOOLONG " school , but it has its moments . The plot revolves around a house-party at a " haunted " country seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has comedy touches that might cover the holes in the construction if played with more subtlety . A. P. Kaye as a detective and Charles Warburton as the inevitable butler give thoroughgoing performances .
