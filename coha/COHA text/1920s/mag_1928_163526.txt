" I am dying . . . . Quick ! Bring the flag of Italy ! . . . Let me be wrapped within its glorious folds . " <P> Such were the heroic words gasped out by a desperately wounded Italian Colonel during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-12 . Death was , however , not quite ready to snatch away Armando Diaz , then 51 , and quite unknown outside the Army . By a miracle he recovered from his battle wounds and lived to die , last week , in bed , of bronchial pneumonia , at 66 . The 15 years of grace thus granted by Death had enabled Colonel Diaz to become Marshal Diaz , the nation 's military idol , the first commander to lead United Italy from national defeat to national victory . <P> The defeat was Caporetto ( 1917 ) . Never can the fact be lived down that on that field some 265,000 Italians were taken prisoner with more than 3,000 guns . Flushed with victory , the eagles of Habsburg and Hohenzollern screeched the impending doom of Italy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in desperate retreat , the Third Army was found to be masterfully holding its own . The successful Third Army General was Armando Diaz . Cadorna was brushed aside and Diaz became Commander-in-Chief on Nov. 9 , 1917 . Within 360 days he had not only retrieved the losses of Caporetto but shattered the Austro-Hungarian armies and forced the Dual Monarchy to sign an abject separate peace on Nov. 4 , 1918 . <P> The soldier who achieved these things was born in Naples , his father a commoner , his mother a baroness . Never rich , it was the fate of General Diaz to die possessed of almost nothing except a small house in Naples which was presented to him by popular subscription after the War . The house he left to his son , last week , bidding him not to sell it except in direst need . Such was the last request of one whom Italy created Duca della Victoria ( Duke of Victory ) and who chose for himself the motto : " Better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muster was displayed at Marshal Diaz 's state funeral , last week , but it paled before two simple scenes enacted while the dead hero yet lay in his own small room at Rome , with four tall candles at the corners of his iron bed . <P> The King enters , alone . He , Vittorio Emanuele III , is a little man , with sallow cheeks and greying temples . He kneels before the bed and tells his rosary , while great tears stream from his eyes . He prays softly to himself , and then , rising , steps down the stair and departs in a two-horse carriage . <P> Some few moments later a limousine with bullet-proof glass windows stops at the door . Up the stair stalks Il Duce . He enters the presence of the dead , alone . Like a soldier , like a ramrod , he stands at attention beside the bier . Minutes pass . No tears , no prayers , no rattling of beads . At last Signor Mussolini salutes the dead and strides away . <P> Later Il Duce informs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diaz 's whole life might be summed up in the one word ' duty .
