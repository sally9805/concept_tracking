How it happened was not known , but happen it did , apparently some time ago . Into Pecherskaya Monastery at Kiev went agents of the drab Cheka ( Russian euphemism for High Court of Justice ) ; right up into the belfry went they and discovered $400,000 worth of treasures . Then they came down , arrested 15 high ecclesiastics . <P> Last week , peasants passing along a certain road beheld 15 cassocked figures doing manual labor under an armed guard supplied by the thoughtful Cheka . The peasants were ashamed , went to their village , killed all the Bolsheviki they could lay hands upon .
