txt New Ford cars are coming off six assembly lines under their own power at an average rate of 800 a day . This was the statement made.today to a representative of the NEW YORK TIMES by officials of the Ford Motor Company . All the 8,800 Ford dealers in the United States have been supplied with sample cars , it was said , and deliveries to customers have begun . The deliveries have not gone very far yet , but from now on they are expected to increase rapidly day by day . As evidence of a definite start it was stated that , including dealers ' cars and those in the hands of customers , there are now 27,000 new Fords in service . If any dealers have not received their samples it is because they have been temporarily held up in branch distribution depots , from which they will be shipped in the next few days . The home office here knows of no such case , however . Its records show that enough sample cars to supply all the dealers have been shipped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars have been shipped abroad . Many Unfounded Rumors Spread . . There have been many rumors about ? Ford production recently . Most of them have spread reports of serious delays and disorganization in the plants . It has been said the new car had disappointed expectations , that the tools built for its construction had broken down under the strain of high speed operation , that the necessity for changing the , brake system had caused tedious and expensive alterations in equipment . The Ford officials take no cognizance of these rumors . But their answers to- questions and their voluntary statements are a denial of all such , . reports . They say there have been some delays- in production , that the rate of production today is ' not what was hoped for a month or . two ago , but they count the delays as just'so many days lost in a program of production expected to extend over many years . They are not upset or , worried ' As they - see it , they have merely . had problems to solve . These problems have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts - least , with Mr. Ford . The important - thing to him , . according to everybody in authority here , is that the problems be solved and solved right . It is officially stated that this is just what had been done , and Mr. Ford 's departure for Florida is taken as evidence that this - is a fact . He left on Thursday . for a two weeks ' vacation , and those who know him say he never would have gone away if there had been anything approaching serious difficulty here . Officials ' Statements Checked . In so far as was possible to an observer , the statements of the Ford officials were checked and corroborated by the representative of Mc NEW YonK Tuktrls , - who spent an entire day going through the Fordson plant in Detroit . This is the chief Fora plant . In addition to the completed cars it turns out , it makes engines , chassis and parts to be shipped to the assembly plants scattered throughout the country . Five of these assembly plants are now in operation . according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Louisville , Ky. : San Francisco , fergrignsi City and Chicago . It is the aggregate production of the assembly lines in these five plants , plus that of the Fordson plant , that is said to average 800 cars a day . As many as 900 cars have been turned out in a day , and sometimes the figure has fallen to 600 . When one of  --  the officials was asked the definite question , " How many cars were . produced yesterday ? " he replied , " Exactly 693 . " Soon after obtaining this information in the Ford offices THE TIMES representative was standing at the end of the assembly line in the Fordson plant . This line is operating at present in two shifts of eight hours each , one set of men relieving the other at 3:30 in the afternoon . It was then just 3:30 o'clock . The men at work went off and the second shift came on . ed the for themselves He has amplaresources , - it As : pointed of producing many thousand cars at a loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss on each car will become less and less until it is - turned into a profit . This is all in accordance with his carefully laid plans , every one at the plant agrees . Another question is whether the hundreds of thousands of people who have placed . deposit-bearing , orders for- new Fords wilCwait pried ' or cancel their : orders and buy other : , cars --  ; Tha , - Ford ? - :people. admit they ? expecta certe:in'humber ' Of - cancellations. ; There have : already . been some : .

According to the records in ' the Ford office , there are now standing orders for about 800,000 cars , with more coming in every day , although Ford dealers are not vigorously soliciting them because they can not guarantee deliveries . With , nearly 1,000,000 people wanting . Ford cars at once , it will take months to supply them , all , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -a day . It is because of this demand , " coupled with Mr. Ford 's determination not to speed up production at the sacrifice of quality in his car , it is said , that the time of deliveries will not be guaranteed . But cancellations- do not seem to **33;700;TOOLONG : - One of , : thena , , stated the , attitude , . : of , the company ' as follows -1 " If - we Were ' sew eral hundred thousand cars cancellations would worry : . us , but the new - Ford is-exPected to sell by the millions over a-long period of time , and any- loss on : - cancellations now will be inconsiderable compared with the gross returns on total sales later ..

Another dealer , whom Tan TIMES representative chanced to meet in a hotel here , said he had booked orders for 209 cars , with only eleven cancellations . The tour of the Fordson plant made by the THE Talcs representative showedwidespread and continuous activity- all day . Men were working ' at , all the machines , without interruption. : There was no evidence of a breakdown or . confusion Of , any kind . - So far as could be Observed , Ford cars " starting - as red hot ingots in he rolling mill , and coming out steadily as automobiles under their own power at the end ? of the assembly line . Production Chalked on a Board . While this change was taking place a - checker chalked on a blackboard the number of cars produced that day un to that hour . The number was 160 . This represented half a day 's work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at 3:30 did as well  --  and it was expected that they wouldthe result would be 320 cars from this one plant in a single day . If the assembly lines of the other five Plants in operation averaged 96 cars that day . it would bring the total up to the 800-car average . There are thirty-two Ford assembly plants in the United States . Six , including Fordson , are already in operation , and a definite schedule to put nine others in operation in the immediate future has been laid out . These nine plants are at Norfolk , Seattle , St. Louis , Chester ( near Philadelphia ) , Dallas , Twin Cities , Sommerville ( near Boston ) , Memphis and Buffalo . The plant at Norfolk will begin operations this week and Seattle will follow the week after . The others will be opened- In the order named , it is said , and by the end of March there will be fifteen plants in operation , with a combined - pro- . duction of 2,000 cars a day . The confident ? prediction for - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . Had to Re-educate Workmen . Whenever one of these assembly plants is put in operation it means that things have - been speeded up : at the Fordson plant here ; because this plant has to supply it , the engines , chassis and othr parts that keep it going , in addition to turning out completed cars itself . It is significant , therefore , that . five assembly plants have already been opened and nine more are preparing to open . On the day that 693 cars were assembled here , for instance , more than 1,000 engines were assembled . This massing of parts for other plants , it is said , has gone on steadily since Jan. 1 . Questioned concerning the rumor that tools required for work on the new car had broken down under the strain , the Ford officials denied that such was the case . ' One- of them - said : " The tools are standing up . They are meeting every expectation . It has been men , not machinery , that have delayed us . Work on the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with the old Model T. All our men have had to be re-educated . This has been a tremendous job , and where human beings are concerned calculations are likely to err . " That is one of the chief reasons why we have not een able to meet our production expectations so far , but ? we determined - in. the beginning that the men should be thoroughly re-educated before we went ahead . Mr. Ford would not permit work to be speeded up before the men were able to keep the pace competently . " New Brakes Made for Delay . Questioned concerning the rumor that the change in the brake system had involved the company . in serious difficulties , the officials said it had caused nothing more serious than delay . As originally put out , the foot brake and the hand brake On the new ' Ford were joined in. the same system . That , is , they applied the same pressure - to the - same drums . This was , and still is , regarded as efficient for a car equipped with four-wheel brakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed laws requiring the foot and hand brakes to operate on separate- systems . - This is also required in several countries abroad , - notably France and- Germany . A number of other , cars , costing much more than the Ford , have been using brakes joined in one system without interference from the authorities , it is said , but when the new Ford came out objections were made . Instead of fighting these objections , Mr. Ford immediately took steps to comply with the laws - and ordered two-system brakes to be installed in his car . This inevitably resulted in delay , but . has also . resulted , say the Ford men. : in an : improved - hand brake that more than meets every legal and - road requirement. : .. . .
