txt At the close of the market February 1G common stocks of twelve steel companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange had advanced an average of 14 points above their 1921. low prices . At 911/4 U. ' S. Steel common was 21 points above tts low of 70% and Bethlehem Steel Bat 64% was 22% above its low of 411:2 . Gulf States Steel common has had the largest adVance , showing 491/2 points above the low of 25 . Following table gives a comparison of the 1921 lows of the twelve stocks with the closing prices on February 16 and the advance in prices from the lows : NO PROFITS IN NEAR FUTURE Advance in the steel stocks generally is rather striking in view of the fact that while conditions have vastly improved from the low point of the depression in the summer of 1921 , the industry as a whole is still on a far from profitable basis . Reports of the various mergers have been a sustaining force behind the move although stocks showing the largest advances , U. S. Steel , Bethlehem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . mergers . In each of these cases , however , there have been special reasdns behind the advance . U. S. Steel has undoubtedly benefited from its huge asset value and from the recognized faCtgtlitit it is a much cheaper producer than the independents and that by means of the good will it has established in the steel trade it can get business where other companies - fail . Bethlehem was practically the only independent to make a good earnings showing in the past year although this was the result of its shipbuilding activities rather than of its steel business . Gulf States from its strategic position and low ' costs is expected to be on an earning basis much sooner ' than a number . of the other steel companies . In the steel trade generally , operations are greatly improved above the low of last summer and labor has been liquidated to a considerable degree although not as much as have prices of steel products . Balancing these improved conditions , iron and steel prices are lower now than they have ever been since pre-war days and railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have not been reduced except on some export shipments and in a few other isolated cases . Operations now are approximately twice that of last July , the ingot. output in January for about 85% of the trade being 1,593,482 tons compared with 803,376 tons in July . It is significant , however , that the output in November , 1921 , was 1,660,001 tons . While operations have increased in February , they do not in all probability exceed those of last November although they are better distributed . Common labor rates generally are now 25 cents to 30 cents an hour compared with immediate pre-war rates of 17 cents to 20 cents an hour . U. S. Steel and a number of the largo independents are paying 30 cents an hour compared with a 1015 rate of 20 cents so that labor rates can be said to be roughly 50% above the pre-war level . ICES A ND Fit ED : IIT it ATFts Prices are at the lowest point since before the war with some products , notably bars , shapes and plates selling below the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steel products is 50% below tIle high 1920 level and only 16% above the average for thirteen years , 1901 to 1913 inclusive . Freight rates are ' in most cases 75% to 100% above the pro-war rates . Moreover , wide discussion of expected cuts in freight rates has undoubtedly been holding off a large amount of steel buying and while it is now believed that steel prices have largely discounted freight rate cuts , the industry will not be on a sound basis until this question is settled . Beginning of 1921 has been somewhat disappointing to a number of steel men who expected a substantial increase in demand following . the turn of the year . Increase , now-ever , has been noticeable in most cases only in the last two weeks . One of the most encouraging features of the present demand is the greatly improved export business .
