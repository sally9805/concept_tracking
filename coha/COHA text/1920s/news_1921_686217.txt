Under diocesan rules the clergymen might ' be unanimous for one candidate , but this would not elect him without a . majority of the lay votes .

The final result showed that . the vote for Dr. Stires had been evenly split between the two remaining candidates . Edmund L. Baynes , one of the most prominent lay members of the Episcopal Church , who nominated Dr. Manning , attributed his large gain on the third ballot to the effect of the Hearst attack . " These attacks were distinctly helpful to Dr. Manning , " he said , after the election . " It was such an infamous attack that it reacted on the people who put it out and helped Dr. Manning . It was contemptible and beneath contempt . There was no man in the ball of so little intellect as to be influenced by it against Dr. Manning .

" Three news handlers appeared outside the Synod House during the recess for luncheon and began to give away sections of the paper containing this sheet . They were driven off the grounds ; but took their place on the sidewalk handing out the papers there . Delegates Get Papers . In a few minutes delegates came from the Synod House to obtain copies . Many of them laughed and appeared amused . Others expressed indigation . In a few fninutes copies had been distributed in Synod Hall and read by most of the delegates , ' When the doors were opened to the press in the afternoon most of them had copies . Next to the reaction caused by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Dr. Parks attacked the Roman Catholic Church as being likely to make this country " a Roman Catholic Irish Republic . " Dr. Parks in nominating Dr. Mires , made a strong plea for Protestantism , as against efforts at unity between the Episcopal and Roman Catholic Churches . This was taken to be a thrust at Dr. Manning , who had been praised as a strong advocate of church unity . " Catholicity like charity should begin at home , " said Dr. Parks , " and all those who talk of the desirability of entering into closer ' relations with and the Rev. Dr. Ralph J. Walker . Bishop Thomas was nominated by the Rev. John , . Haight of Christ Church , Pelham Manor . He advocated the election of the Wyoming Bishop because of the impression he had made here and because he was one of the foremost churchmen in dealing with the DR .

Vote for Dr. Grant . The greatest merriment of the convention followed the announcement that in the final ' ballot a single vote had been cast for Dr. Percy Stickney Grant , one of the strongest opponents of Dr. Manning . It was Dr. Grant who started the movement in favor of " an American-Born Bishop . " , The vote for Dr. Grant was taken to be a sly jest at his expense . The serious defense of Dr. Manning against the charge of being " a Britisher " was undertaken by the Rev. Dr. John P. Peters , a professor in the University of the South , and forznerly of this city . Dr. Peters began by reading one of tile telegrams sent out , with the editorial in The New York American . He was interrupted by laughter and ' the muttering of " tut-tut . " I read that , " he continued , " because it has a little half truth that makes it so contemptibly- mean . It Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born In England . Dr. Manning came to this country as a child . He is a graduate of the University of the South , Sewanee , Tenn. , in the most American part , perhaps , of the whole country . He was brought up in that strong American atmosphere . " Dr. Peters then traced step by step the career of Dr. Manning and took up his manner or dealing with the problem of the Trinity tenements , which had been used as a basis for attacks . " It was this , " he said , " which brought me ' Into contact with Dr. Manning . I found him a sincere , earnest man , and he is chiefly responsible for making conditions what they are today in Trinity . He has taken a step forward the like of which you wo n't find when you look back over seventy-five years . He has shown a progressive spirit in relation to the needs of the common people in recognition of the Church 's economic-religious obligations .

Brethren of the clergy and laity , " he said , " it would be impossible for me to say what I feel in the face of the responsibility which you have laid upon me . I can only say that with the help of God , I will do my best . I shall need yourprayers and your friendship . And now let us ask the blessing ' of God on the work of this diocese . Let us pray . " After the prayer , a reception followed and Dr. Manning received congratulations , He was the last to leave the hall , accompanied by his two daughters , Miss Elizabeth van Antwerp Manning and Miss Florence van Antwerp Manning . Mrs. Manning did not attend and learned by telephone of the honor which had been extended her husband . ? Debate About Press . The convention was thrown open to the press only after a long debate on the subject , in which many ministers and laymen took part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held behind closed doors . This was suspended by a two-thirds vote in the last convention when Bishop Burch was elected . But the motion to suspend the rule met with opposition yesterday , due in part to the controversy which had been waged by critics . and defenders of Dr. Manning . Dr. Karl Reiland , rector of St. George 's Church , complained that he had been misrepresented in an account quoting him as describing the office of Bishop as " an ornament , " and casting ridicule on ordination . He told the convention that what he had said jocularly had been printed as in earnest . Other clerymen and laymen criticised newspapers ' on the ground that they had a practice of picking out " high spots " of a proceeding and setting them forth without context or footnotes , in such manner as to change their legitimate meaning . One or two apologists for the press contended that Episcopal laymen and others interested in such an important occasion should be permitted to obtain all ' the information they could get through the press . The Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , in Garrison , N. Y. , was one of those active in favor of open sessions . The convention at the morning session voted down the motion to admit the press . But in the afternoon the members reconsidered . After a further debate , closed by the Rev. Dr. Melford L. Brown of the Church of the Ascension in Mount Vernon , who favored publicity , the motion was passed by a vote almost unanimous and the doors were thrown open . Dr. Manning Silent . war toward our Allies on the one ham and toward our enemies on the othe is a matter of open and public knowl edge . In The New York American o June 6 , ITS15 , he defended the sinking o the Lusitania on which American men women and children were brutally mur dered . In my judgment , the appoint ment of Mr. Hearst on the committee ti welcome our returning soldiers is . si manifestly improper that all loyal mei and women of our city should , join . ix earnest protest against it .
