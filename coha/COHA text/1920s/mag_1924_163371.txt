Printed in L'Echo de Paris : " Saturday , a lunatic wandered along the Boulevard de la Madeleine . She fired her revolver and voil , three people went to the hospital . <P> " Sunday a lunatic went to the window with his rifle and killed his neighbor . <P> ' ' My goodness , ' says the Good Parisien , ' I can not go out any more ; I find the boulevard dug up ; I risk being run over ; and I may be shot if I meet a madman or a persecuted drunkard . What are the people doing who are charged to look after my security ? What a Prfet de Police doing , his commissaries , his agents , and of what good are the mental prophylactic service and the lunatic asylum ? ' "
