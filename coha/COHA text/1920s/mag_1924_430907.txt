I 've been in the battery business now for a good many years . Without bragging , I think I can truthfully say that if all the batteries I 've seen the insides of were piled in a heap , they 'd reach higher than the Woolworth Building . Right now I 'm working for a man who is a square dealer , but in the past I 've worked for all kinds of birds , ranging from outright crooks to the fellows who had fits of honesty now and then . Old man Polakof ? which is n't his name , of course ? was about the worst . He counted the day lost if he did n't succeed in stinging at least one customer for a tenspot . Of course I 'm ashamed of the fact that I worked for him at all , but business was on the blink that year and I could n't afford to be out of work , what with the wife sick and one thing and another . There was n't a snide trick in the business that old Polakof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he could get away with it . Look at the case of a man named Williams . That shows just how far he would go when he had a real sucker ' ' to work on . The old man got Williams on his string by way of a telephone call . THE bell rang one morning , and from Polakof 's talk I could tell that the party at the other end of the wire wanted to buy a storage battery to run a radio set . Polakof assured him that we had the finest batteries in the world ? absolutely guaranteed ? and invited him around to pick one out . Polakof came back in the shop with a grin on his face a mile wide and rubbing his hands together . like he always did when he hooked a new sucker . He walked along beside the bench where I had a lot of old batteries on trickle charge and , pointing to one of the worst of the lot , he told me to polish up the terminals and give the box a coat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never used expensive acid-proof paint . Instead , , Polakof used to buy the cheapest plain black paint he could get and then thin it out with turpentine slit would dry quick . I got busy with some sandpaper and the paint brush and in a few minutes I had that battery looking like it just came out of the factory . Williams dropped into the store after lunch and the old man had the battery I had fixed up standing on the counter among some brand new batteries of a well-known make . " I phoned you about a bat tery this morning , " Williams began . " " For a radio set , was n't it ? " cut in Polakof . " Well , here you are ? finest batteries made ? all positively guaranteed . I can recommend this one spe cially , " he went on , patting the sides of the old wreck like it was a valuable piece of jewelry . SEE ! It 's fully charged ? , lots of pep . " And he pro ceeded to take a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show what a fine spark it would make . Then he deliberately short circuited the battery with the wire that he hold in a pair of pliers . " It will burn it up easy , " he said as the wire got red hot and finally melted away . Williams was much impressed and when Polakof stated that he would make a special price of $14 , he paid it without murmuring . Of course that wire test is pure bunk any one who is wise to storage batteries knows that . All it shows is that there is some juice left and the internal resist ance of even the most hopelessly rotten storage battery is always low enough to let enough current through to burn up a piece of wire . WE DID N'T hear from Williams for nearly two weeks , which surprised me ? I knew how rotten that battery was . Then he called up to say that something seemed to be wrong , because the tubes would n't light any more . Polakof sent me around with instructions to bring the bat- tery back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the old man called Williams on the phone and told him that the battery had been spoiled by charging it backward . He said that the charger must have been working wrong and he 'd better bring that in , too , so it could be adjusted . Williams swallowed the whole yarn and the next day he left the charger at the shop . Polakof charged him $6.50 for overhauling the battery and two dollars for adjusting the charger . What we actually did to the battery was nothing more than to put it on charge and leave it there until Williams called for it . My conscience hurt me so , I gave the poor old wreck an extra good polishing with the sandpaper . Not a blessed thing was done to the charger except to wipe the dust off it . And so it went for about two months . Every two weeks or so the battery would give up and quit work , and the old man would have some new excuse and Williams would have to pay out some more money . HE FINALLY got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real dealer . It is a good thing he had a peace ful disposition . He ought to have come in and beaten the old man into a pulp after the way he swindled him ; and , believe me , I 'd have cheered him on . The whole trouble is that the battery owner has no way of checking up on the " gyp " battery service station . You have to have special tools to take a battery apart , and without taking it apart you ca n't tell whether the dealer really over hauled it or not . Lots of batteries were brought in to old Polakof for an overhauling and ail he would let me do on most of them was to clean out the muck . Then he would charge the customer for all new positive plates and separators . Cleaning out the muck would make a battery work better for a while . There was another dealer I worked for whose conscience would not let him deliberately rob his customers the way old Polakof did . When we overhauled a battery we really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net results were almost as bad . THE trouble was that the owner of the business bought his stock of plates and separators from " gyp " manufacturers , The plates looked just like real good battery plates when they were delivered to us , but the material began to fall off almost with the first charge and in a few weeks or months all the active material would be piled up in the bottoms of the cells and the plates would look like the grillwork in front of a cashier 's cage . The separators cracked and split and then t loose active material settled between the plates and the battery was short circuited . There are lots of " gyp " storage battery manufacturers too . I 've worked for several of them . They sell their junk batteries mostly to the cut price dealers , but once in a while they rope in a respectable dealer who decides to go into the radio business and does n't know the difference between an honest battery and one of the other kind . Anybody can go in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no manufacturing secrets to amount to anything . It is just a matter of getting good material and putting it together properly . And it is still easier to turn out junk batteries that look like good ones , because the customer ca n't see what 's inside and would n't know thedifference if he could . Cedar wood makes the best separators , but you can bet that " gyp " makers use h cheaper wood . Some kind of a binder must be used in mixing the lead paste that is placed in the grid of the plates . The binder is cheaper than the lead and there is always a temptation to use too much , binder . The solution in the battery . which is made of sulphuric acid mixed with water , also can be cheapened by using a commercial grade of acid instead " of the chemically pure kind . CON SIDERIN G that " gyp " storage batteries are turned out in an awful rush from low grade materials , by cheap workmen , is it any wonder that a " gyp " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery if you figure it out on a basis of service at so much a month for the life of the battery Storage batteries are not the only place where the " gyp " gets in his fine work . All kinds of gyp dry cell A and B batteries are offered to the radio fan . If you cut them open , they look just like real good batteries . The difference is in the quality of the ma -- terials used . And a good many radio fans have n't any idea of what a good dry cell battery should do . Take this case for instance : The boss sells drv cell B batteries of a good , reliable make . Well , about a year ago , he sold a pair of them to a radio fan and did n't hear from him again until a few days ago . Then he came busting into the store as mad as a hatter , planked down a parcel on the counter and began yelling for the boss . He was out , so I asked him what was wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parcel . " This is the rotten battery I bought from you . It went dead and I cut it open and X there is nothing inside but a lot of white powder where the zinc ought to be . Hereafter , I am going to buy batteries from some place where they sell batteries with ) real zinc in ' em ! And he stamped out of the store before I had a chance for a come back ' HAT sure was the limit ! 1 I wonder where he thought the white powder cane from ? There was a battery that gave him nearly a year 's service on a five-tube set . It stayed on the job until every last bit of zinc jacket was eaten up to supply current to his set . Why , that was an ideal battery ! Such perfect service does n't happen once in a dog 's life . And now he 'll go down the street and buy a gyp battery that will run his set for maybe a month or two and then go dead completely . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The solution in the cell eats up the zinc jacket . The black stuff in the cell around the carn rod in the center is put there for a purpose too . It keeps the cell from getting polarized and the quality of the " mix , " as it is called , has a lot to do with the life of the  | battery . It is manganese dioxide ground up with powdered carbon . You have to use the best grade of material and grind . it just right to get good results . There is another funny thing about dry cell batteries . For years people have been insisting on testing dry cells with an ampere meter . The dealer snaps the meter on the battery and when the hand goes around to 25 amperes or so , the customer admits that the cell is a good one . As a matter of fact , the amount of current that will flow out of a dry cell A battery on a short-circuit test of this kind does n't tell you anything about how long it is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyp batteries that will show a high ampere meter reading , but the trick is to make ' em so that they will keep on delivering current to your radio tubes as long as possible . How are you going to steer clear of " gyp " batteries ? That 's easy . Keep away from fellows who always advertise cut prices , and remember that the manufacturer 's name and the dealer 's reputation are reliable guides when buying batteries .  |
