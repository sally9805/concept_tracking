One Krumm Heller , a writer on international affairs , presented the world with some hitherto unpublished excerpts from the will of the great Lenin , founder of Bolshevik Russia . The excerpts , which may be authentic but are probably false , read : <P> " Kamenev is hesitating and unstable ; he is an uncertain man who should be observed and spied upon constantly . <P> " Zinoviev is a talentless individual , but he is an ambitious man who constitutes a great danger for our Party and should be closely watched in all his movements . <P> " Stalin is a silly sort of person . This man aims at being dictator of Russia-a thing which would be a catastrophe if it were to happen . My successor should never allow , in any case , that this man be appointed Secretary of the Communist Party . <P> " Bucharin is just as much of a booby as Stalin ; he does not possess the slightest notion of dialectics , but he delights in writing , although he does it so badly . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing ; he is the only one who is destined to become leader of the Communist Party , because he knows how to make himself respected and to maintain discipline .
