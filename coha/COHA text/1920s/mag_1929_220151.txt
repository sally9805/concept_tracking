Huddled close together for warmth in the pews of the village church at Buchau , pious farmer folk heard their beloved pastor explain from the pulpit , last week , why Europe has been visited with the coldest winter of the century . <P> " God is angry at the shameless city women ! " thundered the pastor . " His eye is offended by their short skirts , from beneath which peeps the wanton whiteness of their limbs . God is not mocked with impunity ! He has sent this piercing cold to make the city women feel His wrath and lengthen their skirts . That is why your vines are blighted my friends ! . . . Let us now join in prayer . God 's will be done . " <P> As the peasants emerged from church , they espied four young women , all short-skirted , hiking through the village . Soon these hussies were set upon , pinioned , subjected to fierce applications of snow , and finally chased out of Buchau . <P> When correspondents from nearby Karlovy Vary ( Karlsbad ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " A blessed angel in robes of flowing white that swept the ground appeared to me and said why God has done what He has done .
