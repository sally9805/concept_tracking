Getting the troops out of the trenches was statesmanship 's task in the last decade . Getting the U. S. out of businesses into which the War forced it has been a task which President Coolidge has set himself . Congress changed the latter , last spring , to facilitate getting the U. S. out of the shipping business , and President Coolidge appointed new men to the Shipping Board-men not enamored of government operation . Since these changes , the Shipping Board has met to consider its duty . Last week it voted to sell the three large merchant fleets remaining under U. S. ownership : <P> 1 ) The United States Lines , comprising the S. SS . Leviathan , George Washington , America , Republic , President Harding , President Roosevelt . <P> 2 ) The American Merchant Lines-the S. SS . American Merchant , American Banker , American Shipper , American Trader , American Farmer . <P> 3 ) The American Palmetto Line-ten ships . <P> <P> Also the troopships ( oldtime German liners ) Monticetto and Mount Vernon . <P> All the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. bidders need apply . Bids were invited for any of eight different combinations of the ships , one combination requiring the promise to construct two fast new mail ships . <P> When the vote to sell was made public last week , a Rotterdam bulletin published a report that " the Shipping Board will be dissolved . . . . Bids received . . . have Deen approved . . . . " <P> Vexed , Chairman Thomas V. O'Connor , of the Shipping Board , denounced this as Rotterdamaging " foreign ' propaganda " put forth ( he said ) for ulterior purposes in a foreign rate war . Even when the sales are effected-probably months hence-the Shipping Board will not at once dissolve . The Shipping Board 's ultimate purpose is to build up U. S. shipping . Bids of every form must carry certain guarantees of performance by the purchasers . Any one buying the Palmetto Line , for example , must guarantee 24 round voyages per annum between South Atlantic ports and Continental Europe for five years . The Shipping Board is the logical agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships in case of default .
