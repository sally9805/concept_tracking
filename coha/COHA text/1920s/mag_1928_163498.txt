From quarters close to Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City , than whom Alfred Emanuel Smith has few abler or more intimate lieutenants in his campaign for the Democratic nomination , came a report : <P> Just prior to the convention at Houston , Governor Smith will announce the Cabinet he would select if nominated and elected . <P> Should it happen , it would be a political thunderclap . Its boldness would be equalled only by the uncertainty of its effect , for it would be wholly unprecedented . Its folly would lie in staking much where nothing needs be staked ; in prematurely disappointing many an ambitious man whose attachment Candidate Smith would need until November . <P> Its wisdom would be in its sheer temerity ; in its novelty for a time that is used to novelty ; and in the directness with which it would strike to the heart of such issue as there is between the two parties this year . When Prohibition , Religion , Corruption and Party Feeling have been talked to nothing , there still remains Prosperity , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Offering to replace the present administration the Democrats will have to offer some one to replace not merely President Coolidge , but the Secretary of the Treasury . Should Governor Smith pre-announce a Cabinet , the man chosen to challenge for Andrew Mellon 's desk would instantly become a national cynosure . <P> The report from Jersey City was extremely premature and unreliable . Observers put not a jot of faith in it . But it quickened their notion that in the coming campaign as never before the Democrats will have to demonstrate that their ideals have hands and feet and that the G.O.P. , whatever other trusts it shelters , has no monopoly of the country 's brainpower . <P> Assuming Candidate Smith as the Cabinetmaker , what material is at hand in the Democratic party whereof he might construct the all-important centre panel , Secretary of the Treasury ? <P> An inventory : <P> Three Has-Beens still active on the Democratic scene are three men who have already been Secretary of the Treasury . The first of this trio , William Gibbs McAdoo , who would rather be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid aside , though a wise man has said : " If I were Smith , I would offer him something . " <P> Carter Glass , who succeeded Mr. McAdoo in the Wilson Cabinet , would loom in a proportion exactly inverse to his physical stature , which is today the smallest in the Senate . A proudly independent Virginian , he has commanded nationwide respect ever since the day in 1912 when , after 10 years in the House of Representatives , he unexpectedly became Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency . Financiers marked the way he shouldered the Federal Reserve Act through the House . Farmers learned that he knows their business , being himself engaged in it , and that though he talks little he talks their kind of language : homely , directly , and red-head-hot with expletives like " dadbumit ! " He is Southern . He is Dry . He could mightily help Candidate Smith .
