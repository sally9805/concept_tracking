CASANOVA-S . Guy Endore-John Day ( $5 ) . <P> On April 2 , 1725 , in Venice , was born Giacomo Giralamo Casanova , possibly a bastard , probably a most consummate liar , certainly a very exceptional rogue . His father , Gaetan , was ' ' amorous , but without means ; " his mother , Zanetta , an actress , no better than she should have been . Young Casanova 's propensities , thus honestly acquired , were opportunist , not to say immoral , and he followed his bent . When he was 72 , he wrote his famed Memoirs , The Story of My Life Until the Year 1797 . <P> The young Giacomo was clever , and when the opportunity of a priestly career fell in his way he seized it , extracted from it its advantages of education , social prestige , training in worldly affairs , then went his own picaresque way down the primrose path . At 18 he had already tasted jail because of a " dormitory scandal . " Sent on a mission to Constantinople , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Venice as a gentleman of leisure , enjoyed a nun as his mistress , ran foul of the authorities for selling books on sorcery and was imprisoned in the " Leads " ( il Piombi ) , famed Venetian jail so called because it was in the garret of the Ducal Palace , whose roof was covered with sheets of lead . Eventually he escaped , with the help of a fellow-prisoner , by cutting a hole in the roof , then clambering down and into a window of the palace . He wandered to Paris , London , Moscow , Warsaw , Berlin , Barcelona , always getting in trouble sooner or later over gambling , women , or trickery . In Vienna he was arrested by the Chastity Commissioners ; in Paris he ran a state lottery ; in Warsaw he fought a duel with Count Branicki ; in Rome he was decorated by the Pope ; in Switzerland he spent a week with Voltaire ; in Berlin he was offered a mastership in a boys ' school by Frederick the Great . When he was finally allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwindling , he became a spy for the Inquisition ; congenitally unable to toe the line , he got into hot water with his holy employers and had to leave Venice once more . Thence his decline was rapid : still a spy ( though now on a commission basis , no longer salaried ) , he fell even lower , and died an obscure literary hack , " prolific writer of forgotten novels , libellous pamphlets , histories , poems , biographies and mathematical works .
