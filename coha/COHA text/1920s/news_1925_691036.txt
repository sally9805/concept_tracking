txt Unless another war or some other great upheaval occurs , it is doubted by some bankers of the southwest whether the present generation will again see the combined reserve ratio of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City fall below 50% . This view is not general . or is it held by the older bankers alone . However , it is the view of some of the ablest bankers of the-southwest . Demand for money in the southwest has not yet improved to any important degree ; in fact , easiness is still the rule , with banks continuing to absorb government securities in an effort to give employment to their funds , which in many instances are the heaviest in the history of this territory . About SO% of the great 1924 wheat crop has been moved from farms , and there are indications that the peak of expansion in bank deposits from the 1924 harvests has been reached . But bankers do not yet see a turn in the demand for money sufficient to warrant even thought of going to the Federal Reserve Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change may come . But , as one banker puts it , this can be foreseen more accurately by psychologists rather than by bankers . In other words . the southwest has the " set-up " in ninny areas for a considerable expansion in loans and in business activity . But whether this will come is a much debated question . FARMERS ARE ECONOMIZING Many country bankers have record deposits . Some of the reserve city bankers with record country bank balances are having a hard time earning dividends  --  for want of employment for their funds . Thus far farmers have adhered religiously to their determination to pay off debts , to save , and to spend little . Merchants have enjoyed some increase in business , but are frankly disappointed because of the conservatism of farmers . The latter have not forgotten the worries of financial pressure of the last few years , and seem happier with generous bank accounts than with the things -- luxuries and even necessities  --  their money might buy . Nov , if some psychological development makes the farmers freer with their money and more willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To understand what 's going on in the southwest it respect to money . it is well to note the report made by James T. Bradley , vice president of the Commerce Trust , Co. of Kansas City , on returning from a recent meeting of Kansas bankers at Topeka . Mr. Bradley asked the bankers whom he met there , the leaders of the Kansas bank- , ing fraternity , why business was not better and money not in larger demand . He learned that when severe depression hit farmers in western Kansas  --  and some other parts of the southwest , many bought inordinately of goods on credit because they feared actual want and sought to protect themselves blindly . The great wheat crop of 1924 and the extraordinary prices made for hopefulness where hopelessness had prevailed , and not only are the debts being paid , but there is little spending . The wheat areas have money to spend and many needs . but prefer to enjoy the pleasure that comes from a fat hank balance . It 's the same in the cotton districts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too high for feeding and beef demand not as large as needed . The rapidity with which banks paid off Federal Reserve borrowings in the last year and the trials that their Federal Reserve borrowings caused in the List few years do not point to any willingness on the part of the great majority to reenter into rediscounting with the Federal Reserve system .. Early in June , for example ,  --  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had one member bank in the cotton area of Oklahoma that owed it about $100,000 and another member in western Kansas that had borrowed about $150,000 . Both members were then in a precarious condition . They wondered and the Federal Reserve Bank wondered if they could survive . At the end of July the Western Kansas Bank had not only paid off the $150,000 of discounts , but sent $50,000 more to the Federal Reserve Bank with the request that it be accommodated with a purchase of government securities . The Oklahoma bank also liquidated as rapidly as soon as Oklahoma 's great cotton crop began to move , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loans of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City today are only about $5,500,000 . At the opening , of 1924 the loans were around $50,000,000 . At the peak of the post-war period the total of loans was about $165 , - 000,000 . If the loans of the Federal Reserve Bank increased to $50,000,000 now , its reserve ratio would still be above 60% . But this does not seem to be in prospect ; at least , an increase of more than $50,000,000 is not expected by close observers . C. W. Worthington , deputy governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , doubts if the hank will again carry loans of members for years to a point beyond $23,000,000 or $50,000,000 at one time unless some upheaval occurs . " Duri : ' g the movement of our great wheat crop this season and of other crops , " Mr. Worthington pointed out . " our loans decreased because of the abundance of funds held by banks and the rapid sale of the early murketings . When some of the slack in money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal increases in demand for money , but doubt if the next few years . at least , result in an increase to as much as $50,000,000 in our total of rediscounts for members . " C. W. Allendoerfer , vice president of the First National Bank and the president of the Clearing House section of the American Bankers ' Association , says 1925 may bring some increase in the demand for money , but sees no prospect of any big change in discount operations with the Federal Reserve Bank here .
