Locked in the brain of an elderly gentleman who died of a heart attack while in swimming , the secret had to do with the dark , strange , warlike people , apparently neither Semitic nor Aryan , who , before Rome was founded , lived on the fertile land between the Tiber and the Alps .

They made strong bronze armour , neat wooden-soled shoes ; jewelry , pottery and precious plate of a delicacy which has excited the curious admiration of artisans ever since . They worshipped strange gods in weird cypress groves and spoke a tongue which no one , except perhaps the scholar who drowned last week , has ever satisfactorily deciphered . <P> The drowned man was Professor Alfredo Trombetti , 63 .
