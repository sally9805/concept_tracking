 | FEW of us are travelers. have forgotten the lost centuries when whole races migrated to another country and made it theirs . We have passed the time when men and women traversed Europe on sandaled feet with songs or prayers as sole scrip for their journey . The days when our forefathers dared a mighty ocean are behind us , as are those when our own grandfathers drove their teams across a trackless continent , to found a new America on another ocean toward the setting sun . Economic necessity chains us to our homes . Often . the more comfortable they are , the more securely we are chained . We do not even know America , and most of those who have broken away for short excursions into other lands know only the countries that gave them birth .  | But in us the old thrill of travel , of adventure , of thirst for new scenes , for strange stars in the sky and strange trees swaying in the summer sun , lives on as strongly as before . Necessity has trained us out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the open road whenever the call of adventure sounds ? but the intense curiosity for other lands is as vivid as when the earth was young . There are so many out-of-the-way corners of the earth , where primitive races live almost as they lived before the fall of Rome . The Gold Coast of Africa , with its Solomon 's mines of fabled riches , its fierce heat , its swift plagues that take mysterious vengeance on the white man within its gates . The Caucasus Mountains , birthplace of a strange race that surpassed all the peoples of the earth in beauty , being white . Tartary , with its mad horsemen dashing wildly across the barren steppes . The Far North , where those fur-clad hunters fight their lifelong struggle with the deathly cold and the dreadful night . People who are living as they lived when the earth was new-made , when geological cataclysms were making and remaking continents , and , perhaps Atlantis still rose in pride above the open sea ! Those are the places that fire our imagination and roused men to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see these countries , most of us ? even those of us who know the rainbow ' tulip fields of Holland or the vineyard slopes of sunny France . They are more inaccessible than Rome with her broken columns , more isolated than Russia , with her barbaric folksongs of a thousand years . They are hard to reach ; they are dangerous . For thew we have to have someone  | do our traveling for us ? for those of us who are too poor in pocket or in spirit to do it for ourselves . There are many of them , the travelers who give their lives to bringing hack the wide world to us that we may read it by our cozy fireplaces . They dare a thousand dangers by land and sea , for us to pore over on our vineclad verandas on shady streets in peaceful little towns. - Most of them are men , for it is usually men who take most of the risks ? outside the home . But one of them is a woman ? Mrs. Charlotte Cameron , O. B. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world , who has traveled more miles than any other woman in the world , who has visited every remote country of the globe , who has used every known means of transportation , including the broad backs of African savages , who has dared follow the far-flung thread of her fancy wherever it might lead . And she has brought back to us who look for our adventures at the publisher 's , eleven books crowded close with a thousand pictures of the wide , wide world . She knows the sea ; she knows the mountains . Half-forgotten islands half-way across the arth are casual stopping places for this raveler . She has seen the strange , molten un rise from the tip of Africa ; she has watched he weird sun of the north that never sets . she has climbed and fought and struggled to follow that thread of her fancy on and on : Efeat and cold , hardships , hunger , and the fear of death have never dulled the glory of that thread . She will follow it until she dies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its wanderings . One of the very nicest things about this woman who has traveled 2,000 miles in and around Africa -- -20,000 in South America , 6,000 in Egypt , somewhere between two and three hundred thousand miles altogether ? is that she does not look it . Most travelers seem always to be crossing a desert or sledging in the arctic . Mrs. Cameron wears diamonds and silver fox while in New York , and her clothes show that she knows the Rue de la I'aix quite as thoroughly as the interior of China . Such a breadth of experience is unusual . She is dark of hair and eyes , with the most infectious smile and the pleasantest laugh in the world , with a rosy English complexion that has remained untouched by torrid sums or biting frosts . In her , enthusiasm burns like a flame . She has been hat would pass for " everywhere " to the initiated , yet she is now bound for the uth Sea Islands to do some original research about the aborigines with a fierce craving that will not be denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a book embossed in colors never seen before . They pass before you in her words ? stories , pictures , romance , adventure , tears , laughter , all in a many-colored patchwork lit by the flame of a zest that can never die . Some of the stories are in the hooks we read as we toast our toes on a cold winter 's night . Others exist only in her store of memories , and she brings them out with her treasures , and shows them to you one by one . Treasures as remarkable as the places that produced them ? treasures that bring up before you savage jungles , wastes of snow , burning sands . A bag of bracelets , first . Rich embroidery , you think ? Jewels ? You are wrong . Something very different from the trophy of the conventional tourist . This is a bag of lion skin , a crude , savage bag made of the short tawny skin from a lion 's breast , with a cord and short tassels fashioned from the tanned skin . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellowed and smoothed by years of sear on the black arms of jungle women . Two are of strange , black , shining , w ightless strands , quaintly braided and twisted and ished in a knot . Hairs of an elephant 's tail 1 ,  | perhaps of that same fierce tucker who terrorized a jungle , only to end in slender bracelets for a black woman 's arm . What atmosphere those must call up to a woman who knows the scent of the night-time jungle , who has passed through the Gold Coast country when the tsetse fly and the blackwater fever were burying men in a day : With one of those bracelets on your arm , could you not see the chase ? the pigmy men with their tiny javelins ? the great beast ? the cutting the march home in triumph the feast ? the dance with the tom-toms thumping , thumping . through the savage night . as they thumped in the jungle a thousand years ago ' Her hands are full of treasures as you talk with her ? a double handful now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so few of us have ever seen . n Eskimo bracelet made from a walrus tusk ? a handful of nuggets gleaming with the dull fire of purest gold ? a buckskin sack to carry gold-dust down from the far-off mines to Nome . They spent it in a day , those rude miners , the hoard they had suffered through a winter for . And the innkeepers helped them when they could . Drugging a man 's drink , stealing his gold-dust , and then surrounding him with empty champagne bottles to indicate where his wealth had gone . when he ii oke in the morning to find himself despoiled ? that was one of the jokes of a land where life was cheap and gold was dear . BUT here , " she says . " is one of the most precious things I own . " She holds it out , a tiny thing of buckskin ? a button ? a rosette . " That is the Eskimo Order of the Red Cross . " I held it in my hand ? a tiny circle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . cross it , two tiny . pinkish strips of skin dyed a pale rose color with laborious vegetable dyes . It was sewed with in. awkward stitches , set perhaps in an icy igloo , by the flare of an oil lamp , while the little foxes barked through the long. , dark arctic night . only once a year do the Eskimos touch civilization . when they come to the trading station to bring their furs . It was there that they learned of the Great War waged half across the world . and it was there that they heard of the Red Cross and learned of the work-it was organized to do " Phew took its message to their hearts. ; they saw the light of unselfishness , of devotion . of sacrifice for others , and they yearned to do their share . So they took their riches . the hoard every Eskimo keeps in his igloo and perhaps hands down even to his son ? the precious eiderdown . so hard to get , so precious to them when found ? they took all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . by Seattle . It came in packages ? hoards of it ? the softest stuff on earth ; and it went as they wished . straight to the front , to do its part . Perhaps your own boy 's wounded arm or leg rested on a cushion of eiderdown given by the Eskimos as the most precious offering they could make . They longed to wear the emblem of the society they had joined , so they made them for themselves , their rough fingers gentle for the dainty task . It was their lift to Mrs. Cameron when she came among them . and they saw her other decoration , the British Order of the Empire given her by the King for the service she did during the war . And I think that tiny emblem . sewn in loyalty and wistfulness and dumb reaching out to an ideal . is as near to her heart as the ribbon and the cross of highest honor . But Mrs. Cameron is not the only Englishwoman to wear the Eskimo Order of the Red Cross . Princess Nary has one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the girl princess far across the sea they begged to send her one of their cherished emblems that she might know they had done their part . The letter she wrote in answer to that gift of theirs is framed at the trading  | station today . When they come down with furs , they ask to see it , and run their fingers gently over the glass , and listen to its words again . I wonder how they visualize the little princess in a land far stranger to them than even their land could be to her . And then there is a photograph . Mrs. Cameron smiles down at it , the picture of a little log church with a bell and a cross , high up on the edge of the Arctic circle , looking out on the swift flowing river Tanana . " It is the smallest church in the world , " she said , " and it has the most beautiful altarcloth . " There is a mist in her eyes as she peaks of it , for that tiny church with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church in the world as well . They have so little there to offer up before their God . There is nothing ? nothing but the poor food and furs that save them from the freezing winter . There is so little to beautify their temple ? and they wanted so much to make it beautiful for God . They had only beads , and of beads they made the altar-cloth . First , the finest buckskin , pure white , and soft as the richest velvet , beaded in pure white beads a solid background , with the cross and the H. S. in purple , shining opalescent in the gloom of that bare sanctuary . There , in bleak desolation , lives the testimonial of a hearted devotion to God that many a church might envy . Mrs. Cameron turned aside and came again with a single object in her hand ? a curious flat envelop , crudely made , and furred with long black hair . " I 'm not quite sure why I carry this . " she said . " It is a pouch of monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I knew why she carried it , why she will always carry it to remind her of a certain day . It was in South Africa , and Mrs. Cameron ? absolutely alone ? was on her way to the great Victoria Falls , the falls that Livingston discovered , unseen again for many years . The last outpost before the Falls was a little shack . and there was a white man with a Kafir servant or two . When Mrs. Cameron reached him , he smiled at her request for a guide to the Falls . " It 's perfectly simple , " he said . " You ca n't miss it . Just follow this road about two miles . then go on down the hill till you come to a bridge . " And he returned to his business of doing nothing . It was hot ? African hot , not United States hot ? but Mrs. Cameron had come to see the falls . She kept on . The two miles were not so bad , but it was hot . The hill turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a narrow trail ? only a faint trace ? wavering in precipitous zigzags down and down . But Mrs. Cameron had come to see the falls . It was a terrible climb , slipping , scrambling . The bridge loomed up at the side . but she could not stop to see . She came to the bottom where the faint track seemed to end in a straight drop to the rapids boiling a hundred feet below . She stopped , exhausted , and tormented by a thirst such as most people never know . Suddenly something ? she never knew what ? a sound ? an instinct of primitive fear ? drew her eyes to the cliff at her back ? it was black with monkeys . There were hundreds of them , thousands of them . They clung to the rocks and loaded the palm trees . The cliff was alive ? hideously , grotesquely , insanely alive . There was no way to go on . She looked back up that terrible path . It was lined with them ? and besides how could she climb it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapids below were clean and cool . For one moment she thought she might jump . The thought of going down under a cloud of those monkey forms was too horrible . Then the courage of her daily life swept back . She wouId go hack if she could . If she failed , the resonsibility was not hers , but God 's . She would go back . @#  | A dutch at her head interrupted her . She looked up . A great monkey , swinging from a limb above her had caught her turban with its long veil and was pulling ? pulling . She had no weapon of any kind ? only a little greenlined sunshade such as travelers carry against the sun . But she beat him off with it , until he tied farther up the tree , chattering horribly at her . She began the ascent , slowly , as she must . At each step the monkeys might be upon her . If she fell , they would cover her in a moment . She Labored on . Her body seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , and a swollen tongue that filled her mouth and suffocated her . She scrambled on . Then like a flash , one of the loathsome beasts dropped from a tree to her shoulders and clung there , biting , clawing at her throat . With an incredible effort she dragged him down , beat him off , fought her way on . Suddenly ? there were no more monkeys . They stopped short , as if there were a deadline which they might not pass . Not one monkey ventured over the top of the cliff , though she was almost crawling by this time , and would have been an easy victim . The relief was delirious . She could rest now ? and give her overworked heart a chance to recover from the strain . Leisurely she retraced her steps , secure in the knowledge that nothing threatened her any more . It was only when she reached civilization ? or what , in the jungle , passes for civilization ? that she learned why not a monkey ventured over the top of the cliff . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lion country , so thickly infested with lions that no monkey was safe in it . Perhaps it is to remind herself of this day that Mrs. Cameron carried with her the little pouch of monkey skin with long , black hair . I think it must have been the only time she ever was afraid . BUT she likes the thrill of taking risks loves the fight to get through ? and the winning . That is what leads her over all the miles . And then there is something else . " I have friends everywhere , " she says . " Everywhere I go I find friends . " It is worth the trip to know as Mrs. Cameron knows , that hearts are the same the world over ? and most of them good . It is good to know that around the World , wherever you go , you will find friends . It gives one ideas about the brotherhood of man , when you have made the test so many times and found it true . Those are the big compensations . Those are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring , and her trail around the globe . But people add their mite . On her dresser are framed letters from Queen Alexandra , Queen Mary , Princess Mary , expressing their pleasure in her books . On her breast is the little purple ribbon by which those who know may recognize her as a member of the British Order of the Empire , a distinction conferred upon her by her sovereign for distinguished conduct. , After her name she may write F. R. G. S. and know that there are only five women in the world who are members of the Royal Geographical Society , and that not one of them can equal the mileage that rolls away behind her year on year . And then she has something else , too , a compensation that is the greatest of all . We who read books of travel and adventure taste our thrill second-hand , but it is a thrill that sells hooks by the thousand everywhere . What must be the thrill of the person who wrote the book we can do no more than read ? who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free beyond the power of most , free to follow that gypsy thread of fancy to the ends of the earth and beyond . Mrs. Cameron could tell stories to Marco Polo , and assure Columbus that he was quite right about the earth ? it is round ; she is on her way to prove it for the third time .
