txt The way in which the Americans are working in preparing Commander Byrd 's planes bids fair to be an epic of the North . Men never labored harder . With their fingers frostbitten , their feet chilled , their faces chapped and their eyes running , in nearly zero cold . they were working until 4 o'clock this morning , and twenty-four hours after the planes were hauled up the snow motors were installed , the controls were rigged and the propellers were on . The engines were turned over late this afternoon . This speed has aroused the admiration of all Kings Bay . Captain Amundsen and Lincoln Ellsworth paid tribute to the enthusiasm prevailing over all obstacles . Their happy , daughing disdain of cold , hunger and weariness has won many friends for the little band of men tolling at the edge of the bay . Turn Wilderness Into Workshop . They turned a wilderness of snow into a workshop in a few hours . As Kise , the mechanical superintendent of the coal mine here , said , . " They did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shows organization and forethought  --  they are white men , " which is the North 's highest praise . Watching the crowd of unshaven , idrty , laughing laborers , many -f them former army and navy officers and business men , yanking barrels , crates and other heavy objects through the snow was a treat . If they did not smile they would be the toughest looking crowd that ever walked ashore , for they have n't done a thing but work since their arrival , snatching three or four hours ' sleep when they could . Bennett , the pilot , refused to - sleep until he nearly dropped from exhaustion . He left a call for four hours later , but his mates refused to disturb him , as all his skill and strength will be needed when the flight begins . Motors , gasoline drums , wings for the Oriole and other equipment were brought ashore from the Chantier . The rudder , ailerons and other controls for the Foltkei ? were loaded into a small boat towed behind the motor launch , I In which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrd will use in navigation . The little flotilla of three boats , tied together , rushed shoreward through the ice and their speed nearly caused a mishap . Half way in , the second boat , not being steered , swerved , and the side hit an ice cake , bounced off and rammed a young iceberg . It came to a sudden halt and the Fokker 's rudder slipped partly into the water , only a quick grab from the halt capsizing boat saving it . The question , what is a " young iceberg " is agitating the crew of the Chantier , as they hustle back and forth through the ice . Is it a yearling or do two or three years graduate a berg into 133ature growth ? Anyway , they aia sullen , threatening things when alongside . Shore Covered With Equipment . Behind the small boats came the big pontoon , feeling its way through the ice again in the later afternoon . As soon as it hit the bank a rope would be slung round a cake which with a " heave ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody nearby , grabbed the sides of the crate containing the Oriole 's wings and carried it up the bank by sheer strength , slipping and falling , but moving steadily . Ropes were slung round the gasoline drums and , with a shout , they were yanked alongside the planes . For two hours the whole shore was covered with equipment , amid which figures ran and jumped to keep warm , sometimes falling and going to the waist into snow under the pressure of a heavy case on their shoulders , but always laughing . In a small house of insulating board in which skits are greased a special preparation used in Arctic stoves ' heated coffee and warmed food . Nobody thought of going aboard the Chantier for dinner but munched sand-1 wiches and beans from wooden plates , ) using- hands as black as coal dust . Commander Byrd has experimented with his compasses to learn the deviation caused by cans of gasoline and has found great variation , so he must place the instruments far from the tanks . Tries Out Alaskan Sleds . Re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in Alaska , but has found them unsuitable in the snow here . Accordingly he is trying to have a special sled made by an Arctic expert . The Commander tied a rope around his waist and attempted to pull 300 pounds , but decided it was impossible with such narrow runners . He borrowed the skis of a Norwegian watching the operations and tried walking , liking it so much that he sent to the village store for a pair for himself . The crew has not stopped work . It got a little sleep after filling the banks with gasoline , but was back again early putting the wings on the small plane and raising the Fokker rigging landing gear and shock absorbers . It was a perfect day for their labors , despite the cold , the sun shining brightly and making Kings Bay , with its encircling mountains , a perfect setting for such a task . Commander Byrd wants to take every possible advantage of good weather , as changes come quickly , and prepare his planes so as to be ready when the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
