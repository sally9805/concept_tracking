txt Robert S. Binkerd , assistant to chairman of Association of Railway Executives , delivered an address last night at the annual dinner of the Railway Development Association at-the Hotel Pennsylvania . Mr. Binkerd said , in part : " We art now to that part of our war chapter which should be entitled ' Paying the Piper . ' It is ft time which demands in the largest degree patience , good temper . courage and clear sight . It is a time for good relations between the pUblic and the railroads . " It is very important that we should not be downhearted . We will get through all this on to solid , firm ground again . The war has got to be paid for . Every country which has been engaged in it has written a gi ? eat big blank check against its future . Our own blank check amounts to about twenty billions worth of Liberty Bonds . " So far as our domestic requirements arc concerned , the farmer has been compelled to take the largest and most rapid liquidation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban labor and the manufacturing industries generally . As a result the farmer 's purchasing power is greatly decreased . It can not be restored except by an increase in the prices of his products , which seems unlikely , or by a liquidation in other fields of industry substantially equal to the liquidation which he has already taken . " The slump in traffic is world-wide ; freight rates are not the cause of the decline in traffic which the railroads have suffered ; and even today , with all the declines which have taken place in commodity prices , freight rates represent only about the same percentage of commodity values that the pre-war rates represented of pre-war commodity values . " What the public has a right to expect from the railroads at this juncture is wise , courageous leadership in the movement to get the cost of transportation back to a more normal basis . I hardly need to-say to you that the railway managements , individually and collectively , have been exerting their strongest endeavors these many months past in the fulfillment of this public obligation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
