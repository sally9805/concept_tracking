Happy augury . . . . We can thank Ambassador Morrow . . . . " <P> Opportunist . The dark and tousled head of **27;11161;TOOLONG General Jos Gonzalo Escobar , who arranged for the killing of 4,000 Mexicans by each other last spring , lay several nights last week on a spotless pillowcase at No. 7750 Colfax Ave. , Chicago , home of Vice President Merwin Crawford of Crawford &; Associates ( printers ) . <P> " I met the General at a banquet in Texas ten years ago , " said Printer Crawford , " and for the next three or four years I spent a few days every year with him at Juarez where he was a corps commander .

" <P> ' ' We bought an old what-you-call flivver last fall , " reminisces Guillermo . ' ' For weeks we rode around making much fun . But one day the flivver broke down six miles from Gettysburg and we left it there for a good joke . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
