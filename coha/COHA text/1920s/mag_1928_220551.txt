Practical scientists who were able to attend the winter meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers at Manhattan last week edged forward on their seats when rumpled-haired Dr. William David Coolidge began to explain his further experiments with cathode rays . Dr. Coolidge , assistant director of the General Electric Co. ' s research laboratories , had just received the Institute 's Edison Medal for his " contributions to the incandescent electric lighting and x-ray arts " by his development of ductile tungsten for bulb filaments and x-ray targets . At the same ceremony John Joseph Carty of the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. had received the John Fritz Medal for his " development of research in the telephone art . " <P> Dr. Coolidge 's latest experiments have been with the fundamentals of matter . He makes electricity behave like radium . He knocks molecules into atoms , atoms into electrons . He changes the nature of things - with electricity . <P> Cathode Rays . Little more than a generation ago the British physicist Sir William Crookes sealed the ends of two wines in a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shunted a current of electricity into the wires . The current sent a stream of electrons speeding from one of the wires , the cathode . They were cathode rays and they behaved in some ways like radium , soon after to be discovered by the Curies . They made the vacuum tube glow with-brilliant fluorescence . If a piece of metal were sealed in the tube , in the path of the rays , the metal became very hot . It also cast a sharp shadow on the wall of the tube . The Crookes tube , refined in mechanism , is the common x-ray tube of today , useful to physicists , metallurgists , biologists , doctors , dentists . ( In 1895 the German physicist Wilhelm Konrad Rontgen discovered the penetrating powers of the rays . ) <P> Coolidge Tube . In x-ray tubes the electrons popping from the cathode are imprisoned within the tubes . How to get them outside became a problem for scientists . Philip Lenard , Nobel prizewinner for 1905 and now professor at the University of Heidelberg , solved it by placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch in diameter , at one end of a tube . Electrons passed through it , but feebly . He used only 30,000 volts of electricity . <P> Dr. Coolidge , working with able assistants at the Schenectady research laboratories of General Electric , two years ago succeeded more magnificently . For his window he used a sheet of nickel 1/2000 of an inch thin . ( Human hair varies between 6/1000 and 126/10,000 of an inch in diameter . ) And he used 350,000 volts of current . Electrons hurtled through the nickel foil , speeding about 150,000 miles a second ( four-fifths the speed of light ) . As beta and gamma rays , similar to the offshoots from radium , they turned acetylene gas into a yellow powder such as scientists never before had seen . They made minerals fluoresce , killed bacteria and insects , burned a rabbit 's ears ( TIME , Nov. 1 , 1926 ) .
