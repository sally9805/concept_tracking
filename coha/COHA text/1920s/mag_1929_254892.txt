On the first day of every Japanese year , while the sun is rising , ten poems are read as pompously as possible to the Son of Heaven , His Imperial Majesty the Emperor Hirohito , 124th lineal descendant of the Sun Goddess . <P> To write a poem and have it read among the supreme ten-what exquisite happiness ! Every year at least 30,000 Japanese write and enter poems in the contest . If they live abroad they frequently cable them to the Imperial Household Ministry . Last week the Ministry announced , amid general rejoicing , that the set theme for Imperial Poems this year will be " KAIHEN NO IWAWO " or " ROCKS AT THE OCEAN 'S FRINGE . " <P> This is considered an easy theme , much easier than that of two years ago- " THE COLORING OF THE MOUNTAIN BECOMES MORE BRILLIANT " -a stumper which proved difficult to get into the requisite tanka form of 31 syllables , in lines of five , seven , five , seven and seven syllables ( TIME , Feb. 6 , 1928 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tanka , but his will not be entered in the competition . Poems must be in by Dec. 16 , will be judged at lightning speed by a competent corps of metrical experts , and the winning ten read at break of the New Year ( Jan. 1 ) . <P> Greatest , perhaps , of tanka turners was Kamo Mabuchi ( 1697-1769 ) , who claimed to be descended from the divine Three-Legged Crow which guided the first Japanese emperor , Jimmu , in all his conquests . Crow Scion Mabuchi credited whatever evils befell Japan to her contact with " debased Chinese learning . " His greatest pupil , Motoori Norinaga ( 1730-1801 ) wrote perhaps the most popular and typical of tankas : <P> If one should ask you What is the heart Of Island Yamato- It is the mountain cherry-blossom Which exhales its perfume in the morning sun . <P> Every year the Imperial tanka theme is moulded and painted by leading sculptors and artists as well as poetized- therefore it must always be visual .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
