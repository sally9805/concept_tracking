txt President Coolidge has been told by Cabinet members that American industry is on a solid foundation , that the business situation is apparently improving , and the outlook for the future has none except encouraging aspects . it was said at the White House today . Following the Cabinet meeting , at which taxation and business conditions were the chief topics discussed , President Coolidge analyzed the trade situation in some detail , basing his views upon reports made by the Secretaries of the Treasury , Commerce and of Labor . The President declined to make any prophecy as to conditions , confining his survey largely to the present . No i recession is looming immediately ahead , according to his advices , and all signs favor a picking up of busi-ness , Building Shows Slight Let-Up . . There has been some let-up in building activities , according to reports submitted to the President . These showed that although the construction program seems to be going on quite satisfactorily , there has been a decrease of one-fourth of 1 per cent . In construction up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reports showed a falling off in the net receipts of railroads , but not in tonnage . There has been a decrease in passenger business in the last year . This has been going on for some years , with the result that railroads have decreased their passenger service at local points . The decrease in passenger service has resulted from a greater use of the automobile . That does not work against prosperity , the President felt , but indicated a better economic condition and a more widely diffused prosperity . Coal transportation has not been so heavy up to this time as last year . which was rec , arded.as a result of the strike which was pending last year , when the consumers were eager to get coal . Hears Unemploym'ont Decreases . In the industrial field there were fewer strikes this year than last , according to the President 's information . Fifty strikes were pending last year , with only twenty-seven reported at present , and none which cause much unemployment . The soft coal strike has been settled in Illinois and in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Pennsylvania and on the Ohio border . Even in these regions , the President heard , mines were being operated . There is some unemployment , but re'ports to the Labor Department show this to be decreasing . Bad spots still exist in the textile and shoe industries , according to the President . But improvement is reported , with the situation more sta- bilized beca'use those industries are accommodating themselves to changed economic conditions . In the opinion of the President , the crops this year , with the exception of cotton , are fully as good as last year . The corn crop is better than had been expected early in the season , due to the late Fall and the warm weather . The price of corn is not so high as last year , but if corn is used in the feeding of live stock . the farmer will get good returns . The price of cattle is high , with the market for sheep and hogs in a better condition than last year . The price of cotton is improved over last year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the President felt , even with a. reduced crop . The boll weevil did much damage to cotton . The growers did not expect such ravages this year , the President understood , and did not take extended precautions against the visitation of the pest . Mail Sales Show Prosperity . An index of general prosperity is seen , according to the President , in the increased sales of mail order houses this year over last . This indicated , he felt , a larger buying power among the people generally , and the farmers especially . Improved conditions among the farmers this year are expected , the President indicated , to increase their buying power , and to give a greater impetus to Fall business . Exports and imports are keeping up quite as well as last year , according to reports given to the President by the Secretary of Commerce. - Exports were larger for the nine-month period just closed . Imports are not so large in dollars , due to the fact that the American producer is not paying so much for imported rubber as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not buying so much equipment as in previous years , the President was told . Equipment buying is expected , however , to increase soon . The Pennsylvania Railroad , the President reported , had just placed an order for 300,000 tons of steel rails and other roads would be coming into the market for equipment and replenishment needs . The President concluded that these reports put together indicated that the country is in a fairly satisfactory economic position . Coolidge 's Optimism Aids Market . President Coolidge 's optimistic comments on the condition of business in the United States had the ef ' feet of converting an aimless , colorless stock market into a lively and buoyant affair . Brief dispatches giving the President 's views were printed on the financial news tickers soon after noon . Up to that time the market had been subjected to aggressive attacks by speculative interests bent upon continuing Monday 's decline . Many of the active issues were moving heavily . Sentiment in the stock market community was distinctly bearish . The response to the President 's utterances was immediate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way . causing a brisk rally in the main body of stocks that continued without . interruption until the close at 3 o'clock .

United States Cast Iron ' Pipe from 20311 to 211. and Wabash from 6914 to 72 : Most of the gains were held until the close . The President 's statements had a tonic effect on the financial community ; dispelling much of the pessimism that the recent reports of reduced industrial and commercial activity had created .
