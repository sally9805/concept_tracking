A bright eyed , tousled girl-child was seen to clamber up an iron lamp post in the Square of Julius Caesar at Milan last week . The King , her king was coming , and she wanted to see . Round about and beneath her surged merry , excited Milanese . They filled the whole square except for a lane guarded by picked , stalwart troops of the Alpine mountaineering service . In a moment His Majesty , beloved King Vittorio Emanuele III , would ride down the human lane and on to open Milan 's great , annual Sample Fair . Why did n't the King come ? He was already overdue . The child on the lamp post tossed her head impatiently and made a face at some other children who were lamp posting nearby . . . . <P> Suddenly came a boom , a roar , and the Square of Julius Caesar trembled as if a giant had stamped . Clouds of dust surged up over the crowd and cloaked for an instant the awful tragedy which had occurred . A bomb , planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merciless because inanimate it had blown the laughing girl-child so utterly to atoms that afterwards only her left hand could be found , and identified by a thin , cheap ring . <P> Of those who had stood near the lamp post 18 were killed . One was a woman who had stepped to her window nearby a bare instant before the explosion . At her a flying bit of iron lamp post hurtled , inflicting a mortal wound . <P> Seemingly the bomb was fitted with a clock work mechanism timed to explode at the instant when His Majesty was scheduled to pass . Kings , however , are too experienced to risk their lives by keeping to a time table known to every assassin . Therefore His Majesty was a good ten minutes motor ride distant when the bomb exploded . Though prudent , he is no coward . " Drive on , " he said with compressed lips when told of the explosion , " Keep to the original route , through the Piazza Giulio Cesare . " <P> A few moments later the royal motor passed slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb . A pandemonium of cheering rose about His Majesty : " Viva il Re ! . . . Glory to Savoy ! the Royal House . . . Live ! Long live the King ! " <P> Resolutely His Majesty rode on and performed his royal duty : the opening of the Sample Fair . That done-and done quickly-he motored in haste to the hospital where victims of the explosion were receiving treatment . There , as a kindly King and Father , he spoke quietly and as consolingly as might be the suffering . <P> Meanwhile thousands of Milanese , touched by His Majesty 's bravery and tenderness , had gathered in a packed and wildly cheering throng before the Royal Palace . When King Vittorio Emanuele finally slipped out upon a balcony and saluted , the ovation rose like the roar of sea surf , wave on wave . Again and again His Majesty saluted , but more than half an hour passed before the cheers died down sufficiently for him to retire within . <P> Though Il Duce and Il Re are known to be not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office carefully informed the press that when news of the explosion reached Signor Mussolini " he bounded from his chair with a mixture of sadness and indignation upon his face . " Later the Prime Minister &; Head of the State telegraphed His Majesty as follows :
