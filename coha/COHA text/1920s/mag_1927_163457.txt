Mexico continued her orgy of rebel executions . Some faced the firing squad bravely , some even joked . General Fernando Reyes himself commanded his executioners , personally issuing the order that brought forth the stream of bullets that killed . <P> General Adalberto Palacios joined laughingly in a joke that was causing some merriment to the spectators of his approaching death . Then , he rebuked them , saying : " This is no laughing matter . " <P> And , as he was lined up against a wall with Martinez Pulido , the latter asked him for a loan of a few pesos , which he placed on his sombrero , promising them to the soldiers on condition that they shot him through the heart . " Be sure and pay them back , " said General Palacios , laughingly , as he made the loan . <P> In Mexico City the emaciated corpse of General Arnulfo Gomez , executed last fortnight ( TIME , Nov. 14 ) , was laid , amid great weeping and hysteria , in its last resting place . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of his capture and death was circulated . Surrounded by the troops of General Jose Gonzales Escobar , General Gomez , making a futile effort to draw his gun , fell on the slippery ground . Seeing that his game was up , he surrendered , and , fearing that he was about to be summarily shot , begged for his life , offering to take any punishment other than death . <P> Holding on to the sleeve of General Escobar , Senor Gomez was taken to the village of Tepcelo , where at 1 o'clock in the morning a court martial was held and his death sentence pronounced . <P> Just before the first rays of the sun appeared in the east he was divested of his U. S. bullet-proof waistcoat and led out to meet his death . He presented a strange appearance - this onetime truculent " El Hombre Sin Vicios " ( " The Man Without Vices " ) . Gone were his Kaiser-like mustachios-he had shaved them off to prevent recognition . His cheeks were sunken and his clothes literally hung on his torso ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered the privations of cold and hunger . <P> According to eyewitnesses , as he was placed with his back against the customary wall he showed considerable signs of fear . He first asked that his eyes be bandaged , for it was bad enough to be shot-let alone see the leveled rifles pointing at his heart . His request was promptly complied with . Then , leaning against the wall for support , he asked that the command to fire be silent . <P> Ever ready to heed the wishes of a man condemned to die , the commander signaled to the soldiers to fire by dropping his hat . The staccato cracks of firing rifles cut the still air of a calm morning and General Arnulfo Gomez sank to the ground-his career and presidential aspirations ended .
