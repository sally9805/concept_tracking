The black Republic of Haiti last week cast a shadow of concern over the White House . Prompted by bloody disorders there , President Hoover sent out of his office two despatches : 1 ) an order to the Navy to reinforce U. S. troops already on duty in Haiti ; 2 ) a special message to Congress . In this message the President said : <P> " We are confronted with a difficult problem , the solution of which is obscure . . . . If Congress approves , I shall despatch a commission to Haiti to review and study the matter . . . . I request Congress to authorize such a commission and appropriate $50,000 . " <P> Also to the House of Representatives the President sent his budget message , asking for $3,830,445,231 to run the government next year . A separate request : $200,000 to pay the expenses of the U. S. delegation to next month 's London Naval Conference . <P> President Hoover last week knocked the first word from Patrick Jay Hurley 's title of Assistant Secretary of War . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Fort Russell at Cheyenne , Wyo. , to Fort Warren as a ' ' fine tribute " to the late Senator Francis Emroy Warren of Wyoming . <P> As part of his policy to strengthen U. S. diplomacy in Central and South America , President Hoover made a seven-way shuffle of ministerial posts last week . Three " career " ministers were promoted to better posts : Evan E. Young from the Dominican Republic to Bolivia , Roy Tasco Davis from Costa Rica to Panama , Hans Frederick Arthur Schoenfeld from Bulgaria to Costa Rica . Four career secretaries were advanced to their first full envoyships when Julius Garecke Lay was named Minister to Honduras , Matthew Elting Hanna to Nicaragua , Post Wheeler to Paraguay , Charles Boyd Curtis to Santo Domingo . Known as " bright young men " about the State Department , all seven are glib in Spanish .
