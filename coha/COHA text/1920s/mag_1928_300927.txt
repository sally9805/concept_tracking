Queried an eager correspondent of Henry Ford over the telephone : " Do you know , sir , that the Chinese are sending you an invitation ? They want you to become Honorary Economic Advisor to their new National Government ! " <P> <P> Six months ago Henry Ford , through his Shanghai representative Thomas Lowry , put substantially this proposition to the Nationalists : " If I pay you in advance the customs dues on Ford cars to be shipped to China during the next five years , will you spend the money to build a modern motor highway between Shanghai and your new capital , Nanking ? " ( 125 miles ) . <P> Naturally such an offer was not sneezed at by the heads of a State both young and poor . With wily tact the Motor Man then and there employed several hundred Chinese at his Detroit works . By the time they are fully trained a new Ford assembling plant will be ready to receive them at Shanghai . <P> <P> Naturally it was Henry Ford whom Nationalist China called upon , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , all invited to become Honorary Economic Advisors : General Electric 's Owen D. Young , famed Political Economist Jeremiah Whipple Jenks , Columbia University 's Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman , and potent Washington Banker Robert N. Harper .
