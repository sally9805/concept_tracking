Rumanian Sculptor Constantin Brancusi had to pay $4,000 to bring his Bird in Flight into the U. S. ( TIME , March 7 , 1927 ) . Works of art are duty free . But Sculptor Brancusi 's bird had neither head , feet nor feathers . It was four and a half feet of bronze which swooped up from its base like a slender jet of flame . Customs Inspector Kracke said it was not art ; merely " a manufacture of metal . . . held dutiable at 40% ad valorem . " The press bantered , jibed . Indignant modernists wrote abstruse , defensive paragraphs . Sculptor Brancusi complained to the Customs Court . <P> Last week Sculptor Brancusi won his case . In its decision the Customs Court dogmatically defined art : " It is a work of art by reason of its symmetrical shape , artistic outlines and beauty of finish . " Even the most wretched of logicians knows enough not to repeat the same term in both subject and definition ( " art " - " artistic outline " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
