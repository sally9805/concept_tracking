When a man dies , his deeds come to life again for a moment . Major General William J. Behan , aged 87 , died last week of heart disease in New Orleans and the South remembered him as a hero , not only of the Confederate Army , but of the White League , which battled the Carpet Baggers on the streets of New Orleans in 1874 . His famed Canal Street victory , commemorated now by a marble shaft , put an end to the evils of Reconstruction in New Orleans , driving out the northern Republicans and their Negro tools . Major General Behan was elected Mayor of New Orleans in 1882 and , having rid his city of the Carpet-Bag type of Negro officeholder , continued to be a doughty Democrat until 1893 . <P> Then , as a protest against removing the protective tariff on sugar , he bolted his party and turned Republican . His political ideas had changed with the times , with Louisiana 's necessities . <P> Southerners took what counsel and comfort they could from Major General Behan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North over which they had much concern but no control . For the first time in 27 years , a Negro was going to Congress . In Chicago , Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill " ) Thompson directed the selection of one of his Negro ward bosses , a large , greying " race man " of somewhat Thompsonian demeanor , to succeed the late Martin Barnaby Madden as the Republican nominee for U. S. Representative from Chicago 's largely Negroid First District. * <P> The new nominee , named Oscar De Priest , was by no means the unanimous choice of his fellow blackamoors . William L. Dawson , a Negro who had run against Representative Madden in the April primary and lost by less than 12,000 votes , promised to contest Mr. De Priest 's nomination in court . Up-and-coming younger Negroes said that Oscar De Priest was the oldtime Uncle Tom type , not well suited to represent the modern negro in Congress . There was , moreover , a vice-graft shadow on the De Priest record as a member of the Thompson machine , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a Cook County commissioner . <P> But these obstacles looked small last week and Chicagoans as well as Southerners counted on seeing Oscar De Priest 's large , dusky figure in the House chamber next session . The last Negro Congressman was Representative George Henry White who served in the 55th and 56th Congresses from Tarboro , N. C. Before him there were 19 Negro Representatives and two Negro Senators . A majority of them were members of Reconstruction Congresses and men of small education . Ten , however , went to college ; five were lawyers ; others were preachers , teachers , planters . Seven were born slaves . Both the Senators were elected in Mississippi . Senator Hiram R. Revels filled an unexpired term in 1870-71 . Senator Blanche K. Bruce served the full term of 1875-81 . When last a Negro 's voice was heard in Congress it was pleading chiefly to make lynching a Federal offence . Should Chicago 's De Priest reach the House , doubtless he will take up this plea where North Carolina 's White left off , although the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a 39-year record had been broken-no lynchings reported anywhere in the U. S. for four months . <P>
