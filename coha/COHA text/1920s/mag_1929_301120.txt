Not in the least annoyed at being called " L'Americain " is Prime Minister Andr Tardieu of France . He glories in his crisp nickname , exploits it cleverly . Last week there were rumblings against his Cabinet in the Chamber of Deputies , irate complaints about his brusque methods . Instead of retreating , M. Tardieu charged . <P> " Tiens , Messieurs ! " he cried with an engaging smile , " ne tirez pas au pianiste ! Do n't shoot the piano player ! Il fait de son mieux . He 's doing the best he can . That , gentlemen , " he added confidentially to his somewhat mystified hearers , " is an American argument . That is what they used to say in American frontier towns . Voyons , Messieurs ! With what do you reproach me ? The only two laws which have been passed since my Government came into office TIME , Nov. 11 had the support of five-sixths of the Chamber . Shall I make another argument ? ' Do n't you dare disown me when I bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacified and intrigued by such unanswerable " American arguments , " the Deputies next day gave the Tardieu Government a vote of confidence , 331 to 167 . Paradoxically , Tardieu the pseudo-American proclaimed later in the week a policy in regard to the Hoover-MacDonald Five Power Naval Conference which might prove obnoxious to many U. S. patriots . Quizzed at a joint session of the Chamber 's Naval and Foreign Affairs Committees , the squarejawed , pugnacious Prime Minister rapped : " No final decision will be taken at the London Conference . It is merely preliminary to the Disarmament Conference of the League of Nations at Geneva , where a definite agreement will be sought . " <P> As was expected , U. S. Secretary of State Stimson was quick to quash this League talk . " American participation in the Five Power Disarmament Conference , " he wrote , " will be separate , distinct , and apart from the League of Nations . " * <P> Tardieu will himself head the French Delegation at London , with his great and famed Foreign Minister Aristide Briand in second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskers seem as wide as the seas themselves , in third . Though M. Briand is nothing if not conciliatory , he shares with M. Tardieu and most Frenchmen a shrewd wish to link the U. S. in disarmament with the League . <P> " France has always supported the thesis that limitation of armaments can only be effectively secured within the terms of Article VIII of the League Covenant , " said B'rer Briand last week . <P> * The U. S. note accepting Britain 's invitation to the Conference described the latter as " a discussion which will anticipate the problem raised under Article 21 of that the Washington , 1922 treaty , as well as broaden its whole scope .
