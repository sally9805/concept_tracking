T is the boast of Iowans that one can not cross the 1 State 's boundaries at any point without realizing that here is a land of plenty as different from its neighbors as the plains of Canaan differed from the fields of Gomorrah . Everywhere within these borders is fecundity , wealth , and solidity . The stranger is at first amazed and eventually bored by the unrelieved regularity of bumper crops , trim wire fences , pure-bred and well-fed live stock , huge barns and silos , smug and freshly painted homes . And if he is surprised at the country , he must indeed marvel at cities and towns which have no slums , no ramshackle outbuildings , and no decaying genteel quarters . Virtually the only signs of the poverty that one habitually associates with urban life are the red , superannuated freight cars which house the Mexican road-builders . Farm and factory , church and dwelling , school and library partake of the heavy , formidable air of prosperity which is Iowa . Statistics  --  and Iowa " boosters " revel in statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the latest United States census report Iowa leads the nation in the value of her horses and hogs , of pure-bred live stock , of farm machinery and farm property per farm ; she has the greatest number of poultry , of pure-bred hogs and cattle , of autos per capita  --  one to 5.5 persons  --  and of telephones on farms ; she excels in the production of eggs , corn , and oats . Her road system , railroad facilities , her dairy products and packing industry are among the first in the country . She has coal , water-power , and lead rr ines , foundries and lumber mills ; she produces enormous quantities of cereals and canned goods , cement and bricks . In short , Iowa is self-sufficient in most of the necessaries of life and is creditor of all other States in many of them . Still , today the farmer groans . When he is articulate , he reviles the railroads , the bankers , the commission merchants , and all the other agents that stand between him and the consumer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by statistics . In his nightmares the corpulent cow which is Iowa to the passengers of the through train looks as lean as the kine of Pharaoh . And at the end of each year he experiences a mirage : his fields , his farm , his crops , and his cattle fade to a blank page on the credit side of the ledger . His computations lead him into blind alleys and his remedial legislation does not remedy . Then he curses again his pet enemies and also the land which is a deception to the eye , even as the fair body that hides a cancer . But this contradiction is a recent experience . Twenty years ago it was unknown and before that inconceivable . The first settlers found a land which waited but the turn ?

Gruening on New York I The City , November 29of a plow to uncover its golden riches . Their reports of the " strike " sped eastward , and soon the farmers who had used up the shallow soil of New England , the pioneers of the Middle Atlantic States who had found the cheap lands of the Northwest Territory equally unproductive , and the poor whites who had been forced out of the South by slave labor fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a playful ocean and just as inexhaustible . Thus for thirty years after the first permanent settlement all roads west seemed to lead to Iowa . From the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee , from the forests of Michigan , from the clay of Virginia and the sands of Ohio , from the mines of Pennsylvania , the orchards of New York , and the coast of New England came the seekers of a farmer 's Eldorado . At the end of this period , 1870 , Iowa 's 1,194,752 inhabitants exceeded the population of Michigan which had been settled 150 years before . The numbers of burrowers in black loam had doubled , trebled , or quadrupled within each decade . There are certain features of this million which can not be overlooked by those who would know contemporary Iowa . Chief of these is the fact that no Northern State has ever had so great a proportion of original settlers from the South . Though there is a general impression that New Englanders settled Iowa , the earliest census shows that there were as many immigrants from Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Virginia than from Tennessee , and more Kentuckians than Virginians . Even as late as 1850 the Iowans from Southern States outnumbered the immigrants from New England almost six to one . By 1860 the influx of Yankees had changed this proportion to a little more than two to one in favor of the South but the Southerners still held most of the political offices , dominated State and local legislation , threw the State 's sympathy to pro-slavery views , and generally fought all " Yankee notions and for'ard movements . " And during the Civil War they were strong enough to attack companies of Northern soldiers training in the State . How much they contributed to the making of Iowa is a mooted question of doubtful importance . Both important and certain , however , is the fact that the Iowan of today is in the fullest sense an American ; in his veins is mingled the blood of practically every Colonial . On the other hand , there is probably less foreign blood in the Iowan than in any other native of the Middle West . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of foreign-born . For so uniformly rich was the soil that nothing remained here for the land-starved European who in other Middle-Western States was permitted to take the leavings of the natives . And finally , it is vital to record that the settlers were of a definite and uniform character . Though the three streams of our westward movement conjoined in this State , the ambitious , the adventurous , and the lawless elements passed on . By virtue of her protected frontiers and peaceful Indian settlement , her monotonous and heavy tasks , her stable and rising wealth , Iowa appealed more than any other State to the cautious , prosaic , industrious , and mediocre . Here , at last , is the synthesis of an American agrarian type like the yeomanry of England and the peasantry of Russia . Here , too , is the answer to that rebellious song , When Adam delved and Eve span , Who was then the gentleman ? For cultural tradition and leisure are necessary to the making of gentlemen . The first Iowans do not possess ; neither can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all their standards of right living . He who has met the pathetic , puttering creatures known as retired Iowa farmers , or retired Iowa anything , with their tool sheds and truck gardens , their bees and their Fords , their incompleted real-estate deals and their worthless auction bargains , will thereafter find cosmic disturbance in the flutter of a leaf and universal significance in the movements of an ant . Yet this is all the leisure they know in " Ioway , " and even this is reserved by public opinion for those who are on the grayer side of sixty . The result has been justly called a dull , gray monotone . With the exceptions of a thinly disguised immorality and a spiritless church affiliation , rural Iowa  --  more than a million souls  --  has no interests beyond bread and butter . The movie and the pool room , the church social and the high-school entertainment are the amusements of town life . And the sophisticated city has its stock-company comedies , its lodges , its card parties , and its dances . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lowly nor common enterprises by the elite . And no one has been able to rouse this people to a participation in any creative expression of the commonwealth . " But , " cries the indignant Iowan , " look at some statistics . Man alive , just examine a few unbiased census reports ! We have ' the highest percentage of literacy , 98.9 , of any State in the Union or of any equal area in the world . ' We have more schools , urban , rural , and consolidated , and a better school attendance than most anybody . We have libraries and museums that can accommodate thousands more people than use them . There are women 's clubs that study lite'ture , poetry , music , and furniture , and all that sort of stuff . We get lectures and concerts and readings galore . We 're among the first in city planning , in State music contests , and in community dramatics . And there 's no State west of the Mississippi that can show more culture than we 've got  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . And so , out of their own mouths are they confounded . They confuse literacy with education  --  witness their extensive primary-school system and their privately endowed , undernourished , and mendicant academies styled colleges . They mistake the social activities of a few liberated housewives for the cultural expression of a people  --  thus they visualize art as a half-dozen much-mispronounced , expensive , and authenticated masters ; they understand poetry in terms of syndicated " people 's bards " and leather-bound sets of undying and uncomprehended " classics " ; they make the acquaintance of music in an annual enthusiastic meeting with an operatic banality . Their best theater is a child of the drama league of Chicago ; their folk-songs are creations of Broadway ; their epic theme is a misguided cyclone . Descendants of New England stock , proudly conscious of what is expected from their heritage , are frankly perturbed about this condition . They plead the State 's youth and theyblame the South . " What can be expected of a State that has barely outlived her first hodge-podge and irrelevant laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ? " they ask . Again they say : " The preponderance of Southerners in our early days formed the deadweight which still holds Iowa 's eagle close to the ground . " The South  --  autocratic county management which supplanted the intimate , democratic township system of New England ; implacable opposition to the growth of governmental power through the fear of taxation and of encroachments on personal liberty ; vigorous resistance to education at public expense , which is still reflected in the dearth of significant institutions of collegiate rank ; and , above all , impenetrable indifference toward civic and social questions , which has been a most effective barrier to progressive legislation  --  the South , then , and all the backwardness that the word connotes is held responsible for the Iowaness of Iowa . And undoubtedly a good deal of energy has been wasted in combating Southern lethargy which might have been used in furthering New England ideals . But we need not look farther than Kansas to see what Iowa might have been with less dominant Southern influences  --  instead of the mulct law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanity , a militant puritanism . Despite their comfort in flattering figures the Iowans manifest an unmistakable inferiority complex . Their jealous watch on the " Who 's Who " for a proper representation of State celebrities , their far-fetched and persistent claims on the nation 's great ones in the fields of art and literature , politics and finance , their furtive emulation of other States in publicity-giving enterprises , good , bad , or indifferent , are obvious signs . During the war it was this sense of inferiority rather than praiseworthy zeal which was responsible for an unabashed and militant system of extortion in liberty-loan drives . At the head of this violent effort for glory was , appropriately enough , the father of Hanford MacNider , the American Legion commander who has so violently demanded a bonus . * * * * * It is a curious coincidence that the fleeting observation-car impressions of the traveler and an equally superficial perusal of statistics should lead to the same conclusions . And thus Iowa 's well-being is in danger of becoming a truism . Not one in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart or suspects that Iowa 's troubles are caused by something other than periods of national depression . As elsewhere , there is constant talk of a greater prosperity toward which Iowa is supposed to be moving as inevitably as the Mississippi flows to the Gulf . In their slight knowledge of both , the orators of popular causes are fond of comparing the river and the State . They seem equally placid , equally slow-moving , equally intent on one direction . There is an analogy , to be sure , but a totally different one . For he who has plunged beneath the surface of the river knows there are countless currents , springs , and whirlpools that pull up-stream and to either side in obedience to hidden forces which can stem even the downward flow of waters . So it is with Iowa . There is the old , broad current pulling to the West , depositing its rich burden of superannuated farmers at " Loss Anjelees . " There is the phenomenon of former feeders now either dry or drawing sustenance from the main stream  --  pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite directions . There is a boisterous rapid in the Iowa Homestead , an agricultural weekly which is the source of liberal power in the State . There is a cool , clear spring , the Des Moines Register , one of the most honest , thoughtful , and fearless dailies in the country . There is a Pierian spring at Grinnell whither flock the thirsty after knowledge . There is the vicious , seething whirlpool of a Greater Iowa Association that every so often sucks down some weak or foolish victim . And there are fine , deep , quiet backwaters  --  these peaceful colonies of Quakers at Oskaloosa , of Hollanders at Pella , and of religious communists at Amana . All this is to be seen in the stream of Iowa life . And close observation discloses more  --  discloses that the seven times seven years of plenty are past , and that the lean years have come upon the land . We see that one of the purest landholding communities in the world has been transformed during the past thirty years into as bad a tenant-farmer State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the statistics that are so dear to the Iowan heart support this view , though one must glance beneath the surface of census columns . The first signs of this momentous change are evident in a study of population . In the decade of the sixties Iowa 's numbers increased 96 9 per cent while the whole of the United States showed a growth of 26 6 per cent . During the following decade the State 's population rose 36 per cent as against 26 gained by the nation . By 1880 , however , the peak of Iowa 's growth had been reached . Her most desirable land was taken up . She no longer showered welcomes on the immigrant . In the next ten years her numbers mounted 17 per cent ; the country at large increased 25.5 per cent . And thereafter Iowa falls farther and farther behind the national expansion , until , in 1910 , a period of unparalleled prosperity in the State , there is an absolute as well as a relative decline in population , a loss of 0.3 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still 6.8 per cent below the national average . Again , as early as 1890 , began the exodus of enriched farmers to southern California . ( Few have realized the extent of this migration ; some idea may be obtained from the fact that at the annual picnic in 1920 more than 40,000 Iowans gathered at Los Angeles . ) In the main , these farmers sold their land before leaving , but on terms which eventually proved worse for the buyer than any form of rental . It is then that Iowa achieved the distinction of having the most valuable farm land in the country  --  a reputation which did much to bring about a greater increase in land values than that of any other State . Speculation , with its consequent overvaluation , was inevitable , and the ridiculous prices of three , four , and five hundred dollars per acre were paid in the feverish anxiety to plant a stake in this Eldorado . The pioneers or their descendants , on the other hand , could not resist the temptation of selling . They found a hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth any price they chose to set on it and who were incapable of realizing at the moment that even the richest soil has a definite limit of production . The land was sold . Then came the reckoning . Now this land-boom phenomenon has been recurrent . The last , started by the war and ended by the recent industrial depression , was the most intense , the most vivid , and the farthest-reaching in its results . The reckoning came quicker and is therefore more apparent . When the process of deflation set in , it was found that a majority of the transactons were " paper sales , " bought with a minimum of cash payment and a maximum of mortgage , the interest on which ? much less the principal  --  could never be gleaned from the land . By and large , the sellers were content , for this interest was greater than any income obtainable from rentals ; but the purchasers quickly came to realize that they had become debtors in perpetuity . What wonder that they grin sardonically today when the Iowa Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm owners on the two hundred thousand odd farms in the State ! The figures are meaningless ; true to the records , yet false to the actual conditions . But these very figures , taken in sufficient detail , further reveal the situation . They show that the two counties which have the highest percentage of farm owners stand fifth and sixth from the bottom in a table of land values , whereas O'Brien and Lyon which have the greatest percentage of tenants rank twelfth and thirteenth among the ninety-six counties in the value of their farm lands . This corroborates the suspicion that only the poorer soil is still tilled by the so-called owners ; the more expensive farms are rapidly reverting to the original possessors and are being worked by tenant labor . Thus mortgaged owner and broken tenant sweat to pay the increased bills of Iowans in southern California . Important as this is in the life of Iowa , it gains still greater significance as a presage of national development . With the exploitation of our virgin resources goes the loss of individual independence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripping of forests , impoverishing the soil , exhausting the mines , and draining of oil wells . In Iowa it is summed up in the one word , mortgage . Her resources are almost intact but the fruit of that land and the labor of her people are eaten by strangers . " Go West , young man , go West , " said Horace Greeley to a poor theological student . And the young man settled in Iowa , founded a town , helped build a college , and accumulated a modest fortune . Today if he made his way there , he could not supply the pettiest pulpit at starvation wages . Today it is more likely that the Iowa farmer 's son will seek a church or shop or field in the East or farther West in an effort to pay off the mortgage , to stave off the day when another " owner " must turn tenant . Perhaps a dramatist will one day portray the tragedy of this act , the poignant sorrow of those who relinquish this yellow slip of paper , empty symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . This tragedy is being enacted everywhere in the State . The attempts to forestall it are now political history  --  a history of transformation . Standpatter Senator Kenyon turned leader of the agricultural bloc and passed measures of relief that shocked the " interests . " The boss-ridden Republican Party of the State turned out its regular candidates and elected in Kenyon 's place Colonel Smith W. Brookhart , friend of the Iowa Homestead and avowed liberal , who is characteristically described by the small-town press  --  and not a few of the " college " presidents  --  as a " socialistic and anarchistic Bolshevik . " The people turned a deaf ear to the radical-baiting of the Greater Iowa Association , and flocked to the meetings of the Nonpartisan League which a few years ago was unable to gain a foothold in the State . Local measures passed recently are in harmony with the new spirit , and students in college economics classes no longer vote unanimously to have Marx 's " Communist Manifesto " barred from the shelves of the public libraries . Everyone demands reforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interstate Commerce Commission which its Senators brought into being during an earlier crisis . Lest those who think that radicalism and idealism go hand in hand should grow unduly optimistic about the " soul of Iowa , " let me state at once that there is no spiritual background , no generous purpose in this reform movement . The appeal to black , or rather , red magic for relief is hardly an omen of better days . Never was Ellis Parker Butler 's motto for his State , Three millions yearly for manure , But not one cent for literature , more pat . Seldom has a people been less interested in spiritual self-expression and more concerned with hog nutrition . Nevertheless , neither the increased materialism , nor the astonishing new-found radicalism , nor the bounty of nature can avail much in the present situation . The luxuriant Iowa scene will remain as little changed , as deceptive as ever , but the aspect of the future is bleak indeed . What might have been a landed gentry must now become a burdened peasantry . Another land flowing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another set of prophets must sound lamentations . Perhaps a new spiritual life lies in this bleakness ; perhaps the Mississippi will find its folk-songs more kin to the minors of the Volga than to the empty clangor of Broadway . Perhaps the farmer of Iowa will be first to follow the peasant of Russia in freeing his land from the yoke . Is not his sententious motto : " Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain " ? The next article in the series These United States , to appear in The Nation of December 27 , will be Massachusetts : A Roman Conquest , by John Macy . Pierce Butler : Friend of Intolerance By M. H. HEDGES Minneapolis , December 4 N EWS of Pierce Butler 's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States caught him in a characteristic posture . With a number of associates he had just filed a brief before the State Supreme Court asking dismissal of a contempt case brought by the city of Minneapolis against officers and directors of the Minneapolis Street Railway Company . The aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its favor , was to get certain records to show what the officers had done with a mysterious $227,000 spent for alleged political purposes . Dispatches from Washington said that Butler had been chosen by the President because he was a " Democrat and a man of liberal views . " Be it said at the outset that Butler has never been put in a class with Attorney General Daugherty , another unpopular appointment of President Harding , even by his most outspoken critics . He has never been a lobbyist for corporations , and though he has been known as the attorney for the Great Northern Railway for years , he has never beenon a salary . He is admitted even by his enemies to be the foremost corporation lawyer of the Northwest . What is it , then , that has drawn the fire of all kinds of people against him ? It is a quality that endears him to his friends and makes him not so much hated by , as hateful to , his victims  --  a kind of intellectual brutality . Pierce Butler is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carries this quality into all human relations . He has not done the work of corporations any more thoroughly than other men but he has done it with more consuming zeal . As a regent of the University of Minnesota he has not used the whip and gag with more rigor than others of his colleagues , but here again he has applied them with an inquisitorial intolerance that has made men unforgetting when they were the recipients of his attentions . And it is this peculiar attribute that men consider unbecoming the judicial mind . A professor at the university , in a letter to Senator Ladd , protesting against his confirmation by the Senate , declared : " Everything seems to indicate that we have here a personality of intense and unmitigated prejudices , accustomed to permitting these prejudices a free and unchecked expression in word and deed , even to the point of offensiveness in manner and attitude . " The " American Bar , " the Who 's Who of the legal profession , lists the firm of Butler , Mitchell , and Doherty , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Gas Light Company ; Capital National Bank ; St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company ; Providence Life and Trust Company ; Canadian Northern ; New York Central Lines . " In all his long career it is not recorded that Butler ever championed an unpaying or vicarious cause . His usual fee is reputed to be $1,000 a day . He has the distinction of exacting through court procedure the largest bill for damages from the street-car company ever recorded , about 10 years ago  --  that is all . His other achievements as a lawyer overshadow this . He represented the Great Northern Railroad and other Hill lines before the Interstate Commerce Commission , which hearing resulted in the present enormous valuation of nineteen billion dollars for the railroads of the nation . He represented Northwestern railroads in 1907 , in the famous Minnesota rate cases , involving the State 's right to regulate intra-State traffic . He represented the Minneapolis Gas Light Company in 1920 when that company went into technical receivership on plea of a subsidiary of the United Gas Company of Philadelphia of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out a contract favorable to the city and boosted rates from 80 cents to $1.31 per unit . When the Minneapolis Steel and Machinery Company , during the war , refused to abide by the decision of the War Labor Board and grant a wage adjustment to its workers , Butler defended the corporation . And finally when John Meintz , an old farmer of Luverne , Minnesota , a stockholder in a Nonpartisan League weekly newspaper , was seized by thirty business men and delivered across the State 's border to a mob , where he was tarred and feathered , it was Butler who defended the thirty respectable citizens with the plea that they were seeking to protect the old farmer . This legal record throws into eclipse the work he has done for the Canadian Government in evaluating the Grand Trunk lines , or the shadowy service he performed for Taft in prosecuting the packers . The man in the street says today : " Yes , Butler is a trust-buster just as Kellogg is a trust-buster. "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
