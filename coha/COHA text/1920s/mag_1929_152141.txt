Tariff revision was perceptibly braked last week in the Senate Finance Committee . Republican revisionists on the committee seemed suddenly to have lost their ardor for " embargo duties . " President Hoover was given " assurances " that the Senate 's tariff bill would be held within the bounds of his desires . For this change in tariff tempo were four explanations : <P> 1 ) Public opinion . Senator Reed Smoot , high-tariff chairman for the Senate Finance Committee admitted : " I have found very little demand for changes in the tariff . . . . Many of the heavy duties proposed by the House can be reduced without injury to industry . " <P> 2 ) Threats of tariff reprisals , in formal protests filed by 21 nations with the U. S. State Department against contemplated U. S. increases . <P> 3 ) The so-called Borah Bloc of insurgent Republicans and sharpshooting Democrats , whose united front promised the Republican Senators a real battle on the Senate floor ( TIME , July 1 ) . <P> 4 ) The strong though invisible influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Smoot was obviously upset at the abuse to which tariff revision had been subjected . To the complaint that Industry was benefiting over Husbandry , he retorted : " The House Ways &; Means Committee and , so far , the Finance Committee , by gestures , have given farmers and producers by far the best of it . . . . The Democrats are so anxious to make political capital out of the situation that they are imagining all sorts of rates and unjust schedules . " <P> Significant tariff developments last week : <P> Sugar . Senator Smoot accepted a sliding scale tariff for this most controversial item in the bill . Because his State , Utah , is a great producer of beet sugar ; because the Mormon church , his church , is vitally interested in beet sugar , the sugar schedule was to have been Senator Smoot 's well-protected pet . That he favored a sliding scale which he admitted would produce rates lower than those proposed in the House bill ( 3 per lb. ) , made even his Democratic opponents gasp in astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receding high-tariff tide . When pressed for details , Senator Smoot promised to give them out in a week . Crossly he added : " Then the papers can print as many lies about them as they want to . " <P> The week prior , a subcommittee of the Finance Committee had held sugar hearings to which flocked white men and brown men , businessmen and lawyermen , bearing bulging brief cases and in anything but a sweet humor . William Marion Jardine , Coolidge Secretary of Agriculture , now a lobbyist for the U. S. Beet Sugar Association , opened the argument : " The trouble about Sugar is there is too damned much of it being produced . . . . Give us a duty that will bring six-cent sugar . . . and we 'll show you how to produce more sugar in the U. S. "
