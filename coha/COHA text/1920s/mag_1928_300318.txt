Sad indeed is the state of musical affairs when so feeble a composition as Kurt Atterberg 's wins the $10,000 Symphonic prize of the Schubert Centennial Contest ( TIME , Dec. 3 ) . So did critics mourn in Manhattan last week and in many a major city in Europe-all save Ernest Newman of the London Sunday Times who refused even to take it seriously , marked great slices in it as belonging to Dvorak , Berlioz , Stravinsky , to Schubert himself , and laughed . <P> In Sweden , Composer Atterberg is also a musical critic . There , reading the estimates of his symphony , he chose to laugh with Ernest Newman 's review headed " Attaboy . " Critic Newman had called the $10,000 " a fair price for a fair symphony which is what Atterberg has delivered f. o. b. as per esteemed order of yesterday 's date , and hoping for continuation of valued custom . " ; , Composer Atterberg took the same tack , let his laughter reverberate through the press : that all along he had meant it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only one critic had guessed . The $10,000 was his , he said , and the laugh on them . But to many it seemed singularly empty laughter . The Columbia Phonograph Co .. donors of the prize money , could not believe that anyone would make a joke for the centennial of Schubert 's death , cabled Composer Atterberg and chose to accept a rather dubious denial . Others , less interested , reflected that a really good comedian rarely laughs at his own jokes ; that neither the joke nor the laughter had in any way enhanced Composer-critic Atterberg 's prestige .
