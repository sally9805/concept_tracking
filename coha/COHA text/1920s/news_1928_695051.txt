txt The full bench of the United States Supreme Court listened for an hour and a half late today to New York City 's application for a stay of the Federal statutory court 's order for a seven-cent fare on the Interborough lines and took the question under advisement . The Court g7ve no indication when it might decide whether or not to allow the five-cent fare to continue pending the city 's appeal from the lower court . It was thought , however , a decision would be handed down either a week from today or on May 28. the . day on which the order would otherwise take effect . Mayor Walker sat in the Supreme Court room from noon until after 5 o'clock . The city 's application was the last heard . Both Samuel Unterznyer , counsel for the Transit Commission , and Charles L. Craig , the city 's special counsel , spoke for the city , and William L. Ransom , special counsel for the Interborough , represented the company . Upon the Court 's decision depends whether Interborough passengers pay five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight months while the Interborough 's suit for an increased fare is being considered by the Supreme Court . The Mayor arrived here unattended by any of his staff early this morning . He went to the Carlton Hotel and conferred with Mr. Craig and Mr. Untermyer , who had arrived last night . After sitting through the entire court session he went back to his hotel and tonight was the dinner guest of Edward B. , Washington publisher . He left for New York on the midnight train , Mayor Walker left Washington far from optimistic , despite the fact that the Court 's questions to Mr. Ransom at one time caused the Interborough counsel considerable embarrassment . Old Contention Was Gone Over . In a broad way all of the contentions raised before the lower court were gone over by the attorneys . Chief Justice Taft fixed a time limit on the arguments , but each of the attorneys was permitted to exceed his time allotment . When the Chief Justice suspended the session , PH three of the lawyers were trying to be heard still further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New York fare situation , and . by their questions sought to bring out as many of the facts as the time allowed , the most significant remark came near the close when Justice said : " After all , we ca n't try the case here . " Mr. Untermyer spoke first for the city . He told the Court that the Federal statutory court 's order affected 5,000,000 people who ride on the Interborough subway and elevated lines to the number of 3,500,000 a day . The order not only sought to raise the fare , he said , but ' practically tied up and paralyzed the supervision of the Transit Commission . " Justice interrupted him to ask what State statute was involved in the case , Federal Court jurisdiction being obtained ordinarily only by appeal from the operation of a State law . " That is one of the questions which we present here . " Mr. Untermyer replied . " You challenge the jurisdiction of the Federal Court ? " the Justics asked . " Yes , " said ' the Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question here at all . " Mr. Untermyer then explained that while the Interborough contended the five-cent fare on ' the elevated lines was fixed by Chapter 743 of the Laws of 1894 , actually the rate was determined by the extension certificates in the 1913 subway contract . " The reference to Chapter 743 was a mere subterfuge to get into the Federal courts , " said Mr. Untermyer . Reviews Bond Provision . He then reviewed the decision of the Statutory Court , which provided that the Interborough must post a bond of $5,000,000 to guarantee the refund of the extra fare to the riders should the decision be later reversed and required the city to give a bond in like amount as a condition to continuing the five-cent fare pending the appeal . qwq " I say the Interborough Rapid Transit Company can not he injured if a stay is granted without security , " he declared . The statutory court , he continued , " threw all our figures aside , " and decided the temporary increase solely on the Interborough 's valuations , taking them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of the effect of the Public Service Commission law as being impressed on the subway contracts and subjecting the contracts to revision as to the rate of fare either upward or downward as conditions might warrant . " What was the date of that law ? " Justice Brandeis inquired . The statute was passed in 1907 , Mr. Untermyer told him . " What was the date of the last contract ? " the Justice asked . " That was 1913 , Contract No. 3 , " the attorney replied . " That contract , though . was a mere extension of Contracts 1 and 2 . " Referring to the Interborough 's claim that it is subject to confiscation on a five-cent fare , Justice Brandeis asked : " What date did this condition begin ? " Mr. Untermyer replied that the Interborough 's financial condition was most acute in 1919 . He reviewed the company 's two previous applications for an increase in 1920 and 1922 , both of which were abandoned and told the court that in 1925 the company memorialized the Legislature stating it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , Mr. Untermyer said , had entirely ignored the history of the fare situation in its decision . He referred to the act of the Legislature giving the Transit Commission the right to increase the fare , in 1921 , and the repeal of that act in 1922 . The - court overlooked the Legislature 's clear intent that the Transit Commission should not have power to change the rates in the contract , he said . Calls Case Complicated . Mr. Craig then began his argument . Justice remarked as he got up that the case was a " very complicated matter , " suggesting that the Court would have to protect the company against loss were it to supersede the lower Court 's order . " In answer Mr. Craig said that " no case like this ever came before this Court " and then proceeded to explain the partnership relation between the city and the company . He gave the history of the subway contracts and pointed out that the Interborough in 1913 held out for a guarantee as to its earnings in consideration for taking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given and amounts to $6,335,000 a year , he said . The company at that time was unwilling to have the fare regulated by the commission , he said . He explained that only part of the lines were turned over to the Interborough , the rest going to another company , which was not seeking an increase . " What 's the name of that company ? " asked . Chief Justice Taft . " That 's the Brooklyn-Manhattan T.ansit Corporation , formerly the B. R. T. , " Mr. Craig replied . " What is the Interborough getting on its investment now ? " asked Justice . Mr. Craig replied that the company was getting everything it was entitled to get on its investment under the contract . Interest was being paid on the company 's bonds , he said , and the company was getting its $6.335,000 preferential in addition . Under its lease of the Manhattan elevated properties . on which it paid 7 per cent . formerly and now 5 per cent. , however , $4,000,000 a year of the subway earnings went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they any complaint , then ? " Justice asked . " They say they are being confiscated . " Craig 's Time Extended . Mr. Craig started to explain the theory on which the Interborough , by putting all the properties together , contended it should have an in creased fare when Justice Taft reminded him his time was up . He asked for a couple of minutes more , and the Chief Justice , referring to the fact that he had used part of his time in side remarks , said : " Oh , yes , you may have two minutes , but you must remember you do n't have to make these diversions . " " Are you willing to give a bond to protect the Interborough ? " asked Justice . " The difficulty with ue is that the Court below has imposed a condition which we have no legal right to perform , " said the City Attorney . The city charter gave the , municipality no right to secure the company against loss , he added . Summing up the city 's contentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law gave the Transit Commission power to change the rate provided by the contract until the " ingenious legal minds " of the Interborough lawyers invited the idea . He said he was sure the Court would find that the contracts were binding " and that the Interborough should either observe them or surrender them to the city . " Holds City Bond Possible . Mr. Ransom said the question before the court was really only as to the conditions under which a stay might be granted . The Statutory Court , he said , had granted a stay but had required the city to post a bond . " But counsel on the other side say that 's an impossibility , " observed Justice . " There 's no ground for such a statement , " replied Mr. Ransom . " I am unable to agree with that contention . The city is assessing its taxpayers millions annually to make up the deficits from subway operation at a 5-cent fare . " He said the city has submitted to the Statutory Court a " fanciful and nebulous accounting plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the city would be used to indemnify the company against possible loss under a stay . " Have you referred in your brief to the statute or statutes under which mately the net income . Justice Brandeis did a bit of figuring himself . He found that the gross must be about $65,000,000 a year on a five-cent fare if the increase of two cents would produce $26,000.000 additional . Mr. Ransom agreed with him and corrected his statement . " What do you do with that 824,000 , - 000 ? " Justice Brandeis asked . The attorney said it was used to ' pay the interest on the bonds , for wages , &c.; Justice Vandevanter commented that if the figure was the net revenue it could not be used for payment of wages . Mr. Ransom again corrected himself and , producing a brief , said that $2,600,000 went to the city as rental on the old subway . " Where does the other twenty millions or so go ? " asked Justice Brandeis . Mr. Ransom said some of it paid interest on the bonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your own ? " Mr. Ransom replied affirmatively . " What you pay on your own bonds is your own , " remarked Justice Brandeis . " You 're not anything out of pocket at the present time , are you ? " Justice inquired . " That 's right , " said Mr. Ransom . " But you claim that you are entitled to additional return on the value of the property ? " " Yes . " The Justices asked as to the reason for the wide discrepancy between the city 's contentions as to the company 's earnings and the company 's claims . Mr. Ransom said it was because the city 's figures left out of consideration the elevated properties . Craig Challenges Figures . Mr. Craig arose as Mr. Ransom sat down and said that every figure which the Interborough had quoted was challenged in the lower court and would be contested in the trial of the suit . " But the lower court decided against you . " suggested Justice . It was then that he remarked that the Supreme Court itself could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to agree with this view . Following the hearing Mayor Walker chatted in the Capitol corridors with New York City Representatives interested in amending the Federal judicial code to prevent Federal courts from taking jurisdiction in cases like the one now before the court . Representative Loring M. Black Jr . of Brooklyn spent most of the day with Mayor Walker and the others of the party . The Mayor referred to him as his " associate counsel . " Transit Commissioner Charles C. Lockwood also attended the hearing . Represenatives F. H. LaGuardia and John J. O'Connor discussed their bills with the Mayor , and it was tentatively agreed that the Mayor would appear before the House Judiciary Committee at some future time to give his views on the need for the legislation . During the argument Mayor Walker sat with his head tilted to one side , hanging on every word . He became impatient when the city 's representatives were drawn into discussion of points which he considered should be left to the appeal argument later . The Mayor would have taken part himself , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Supreme Court . He discovered after reaching Washington that a certificate from the New York courts would be necessary for his admission by motion today .
