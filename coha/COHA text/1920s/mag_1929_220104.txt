One C. D. Collins , 2OI Ibs. , British , clumsy , looked down at one of his large feet last week and perceived that he had stove it right through the racing shell in which he and seven other Cambridge undergraduates were preparing to row , next week , against Oxford .

Sticking your foot through the shell at rowing is equivalent to trampling a hound in a hunt or blowing off your neighbor 's hat at a grouse shoot . Fortunately for Cambridge , a new shell had already been ordered . When a shell was damaged in 1906 just before Cambridge 's race with ( and victory over ) Harvard , a new shell had to be built in four days .
