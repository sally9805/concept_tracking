The 51st Convention of the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union assembled in Detroit with great enthusiasm . Miss Anna Gordon , * who for ten years has presided over its destinies , but wishes now to retire to her work as W. C. T. U. World President , opened the meeting : <P> " Let us ever gratefully bear in mind the encouraging truth that our work for world sobriety is a major contribution to the program for international and interracial friendliness and a warless world . <P> " The Occident today must better exemplify to the Orient the Christianity it professes . It must deal justly , love mercy , and walk humbly with God ; it must produce a cleaner journalism , less concerned with details of crime and more with the essence of the Christ-spirit so evident in our philanthropies and in the growth of our service and social conscience in community , state and Nation . <P> " On every hand law violation obtrudes its hideous head and blatant voice . A wet press and unfriendly magazine writers wrongly charge to prohibition scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prohibition law can be greatly minimized if local sentiment expresses itself in prompt , constructive community action against them , rather than dissipating its energies in passive bewailing and garbled gossip . " <P> Another high spot of the meeting was the declaration by Mrs. Nelle G. Burges , President of the Missouri branch of the Union : <P> " We are told that 65% of the crime of today is committed by youth between the ages of 16 and 21 . Our jails and schools of correction are rapidly filling with these youthful criminals . <P> " What is the antidote ? The Bible in the public schools which will reach 27,000,000 children who receive no moral training in any other place . With 620,580 teachers in the United States , each one devoting ten minutes a day to the reading of the Bible and moral instruction , a wave of morality and good citizenship would be started which would reach every part of our Nation !
