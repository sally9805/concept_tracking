txt Building and loan associations , conducted under the supervision of state superintendents of banks , carry on a work in the cultivation of thrift among people of all classes which is not yet fully appreciated in the financial field . Some associations publish monthly bulletins which are sent to their own clients and periodically to possible borrowers or investors in neighboring communities . Other associa. tions have campaigns once or twice a year to increase the number of their shareholders in which teams of director : : compete against each other to see which can get tlh : largest number of shareholders . Where there is more than one association in a community contests are often staged during a set week to see which can sell the greater numb ' 1 ' of additional shares . Frequently , individual directors bear the expense of display advertisements in the local papers during such campaigns , while regular advertisers  --  local merchants , banks , etc.  - -  will use a portion of their regular space to urge thrift through owning shares in the build . ing and loan organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slogans urging saving , such as " it 's a satisfaction to know that an institution like ours owes you money , " " prudence today means prosperity tomorrow , " " spend wisely , save something each and every month and put it in a safe place , " and brief homilies on the sin of idle dollars . A typical appeal follows under the caption " Save for it " : " Our institution is a means whereby you can reach your goal . Save money . Invest it with us ? for a home , for an education , for an automobile , for a vacation , for a Christmas fund , for the creation of a living trust fund , for any worthy purpose that appeals to a normal , healthy , human being . " All the appeal is not for saving for a rainy day . By putting in a word for an automobile or vacation they may touch a responsive chord in persons otherwise immune to the savings plea with the thought in mind that once the individual gets started on the monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his savings rather than otherwise and thus a permanent convert will he made to the thrift idea . Many a Wall Street man has bought his home through the building and loan organization and has continued as a shareowner therein for the education of his family , realizing that thereby he makes work for hint some of the dollars which otherwise might burn holes to his pockets . One Wall Street man , for instance , since taking on+ shares in a building and loan association figured out that through it he could set aside monthly sufficient to educate his children . As his shares mature he puts the money into bonds and thus becomes a customer for the investment houses . Since adopting - his latter idea he has increased his building and loan payments yearly and will shortly have shares maturing twice a year so that when his children are ready for college the funds are ready to meet their expenses . Or if his earning power continues unimpaired he can pay collage expenses out of his income and keep the bonds bought with his building and loan money as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is long .
