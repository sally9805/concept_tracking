Every night last week groups of workingmen , mostly Italians , stood at the corner of 109th street and Second avenue , Manhattan , gazing across the street at the windows of the City Trust Co . They wondered what , if anything , their bankbooks might be worth . On the windows were posted notices that the state banking department had taken possession of the bank . Back of the closed doors bank examiners checked books and investments and balances . Perhaps the bank was " broke . " <P> Some of the laborers pointed to gold-lettered window announcements which proclaimed that City Trust Co. was a depository of the U. S. government , of the state and city of New York . Some of the laborers thought that therefore the U. S. , the state , and the city were guaranteeing deposits . Others , less nave , were selling their bankbooks at 50 cents on the dollar . <P> The bank examiners issued no premature estimate of possible losses . City Trust Co. , with its main offices and four branches , had deposits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died Feb. 2 . There followed rumors of bad investments , of unsound conditions . It will be months before definite announcement of settlement will be made . Meanwhile depositors have only the comfort of knowing that their demands will be satisfied before those of stockholders . <P> General interest in the City Trust closure resulted from the fact that Dr. Attilio H. Giannini had succeeded Mr. Ferrari as the bank 's president . Dr. Attilio H. Giannini is a brother of Amadeo Peter Giannini , famed Bancitaly Corp . man . Dr. Giannini is also board chairman of the Bank of America , National Association , which Bancitaly Corp . dominates . But there was no suggestion that the City Trust 's disgrace was a Giannini disgrace , because Dr. Giannini had been connected with the bank for only a few weeks , and because he could show that he accepted the office only on the urgent request of the City Trust 's directors . The latter had wished to assuage popular suspicion concerning their bank 's solvency by securing a Giannini as chief officer . Finally , Dr. Giannini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank 's stock , refused to exercise the option when he saw the actual condition of the bank . Perhaps Dr. Giannini erred in allowing himself to become in any way associated with a sinking ship , but he was not the man who ran the vessel on the rocks .
