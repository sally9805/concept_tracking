The King is dead ! <P> Throughout the week all England grew more and more tense and sad with the premonition of this thought . As though some primeval giant or very god lay dying , even Nature grew disturbed , then violent . Great storms lashed the continent of Europe from the Mediterranean to the Baltic . Gales and floods brought death to 149 men and women , most of whom went down on foundered merchant ships or perished in the many flooded areas of the Rhineland , Holland , Belgium , Ireland , Wales and England . Seldom has Death come more awesomely . The storm was worthy even of George V , King and Emperor , defender of the faith , who lay all week in his great bed at Buckingham Palace , silently and bravely fighting the bacilli of influenza and pleurisy . <P> Impressive and memorable was the tribute paid by His Majesty 's devoted subjects . They came in spontaneous crowds to stand , day after day and far into each night , outside the tall iron fence of Buckingham Palace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alike upon the silent crowd and on the many twinkling limousines which hurried , one after another , up to the palace door . From these descended such personages as Her Majesty Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain , Field Marshall Viscount Allenby , Her Grace the Duchess of Argyle , the Earl and Countess of Athlone , * Right Honorable Cabinet Ministers , and their excellencies , the ambassadors and ministers accredited to the Court St. James 's . Never did Fate mock at a more distinguished company in their impotency to stay with sympathy the progress of disease . <P> Where were the King 's sons ? The youngest , Prince John , died in 1919 at the age of 14 . The youngest who still lives , Prince George , a lieutenant on H. M. S. Durban , was reported from Bermuda to have received orders to dash for London , transferring in mid-ocean from the frail destroyer Durban to a swift and sturdier liner . Only the Duke of York , second son of His Majesty , was at the Royal bedside . The Duke of Gloucester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good will tour " ( TIME . Sept. 17 ) of British Africa . Probably because of the vast distance between them and London ( 7,000 miles by boat and train ) , they were not recalled even when His Majesty 's temperature began to rise . <P> Several times each day the struggle between Death and Life was bulletined . Perhaps the world will not soon see again two doctors of such courtly and Victorian distinction as those who signed each bulletin thus : <P> Dawson of Penn <P> Physician in Ordinary <P> Stanley Hewett <P> Surgeon Apothecary <P> All England knew that Queen Victoria lived to the age of 80 in Sir Stanley Hewett 's care . The great Queen 's Grandson , George V , was but 63 last week . His death , thought Britons , would be a sad commentary on the wages of virtue and an upright life . Those Royal libertines , George I , George II and George IV , all died at the age of 67 . That Royal part-time madman , George III ( reigned 1760-1820 ; mad 1788-89 and 1811-20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Victoria herself . Surely the great Queen would have approved the language in which last week , the Victorian physicians of George V bulletined the approach to crisis thus : There is a slight extension of the mischief in the lung .
