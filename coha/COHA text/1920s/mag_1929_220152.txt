" Come to South Africa ! " the Canadian Pacific Line urges . " See Cape Town , the diamond mines at Johannesburg , Kaffir villages , wild animals in their haunts- " <P> A party of 30 Britons and U.S. citizens came to South Africa last week on the new and luxurious Canadian Pacific liner Duchess of Atholl . They saw Cape Town , traveled inland to the diamond mines , and leaving the railroad , embarked in motor busses for the Kruger National Park game preserve to see the wild animals . <P> Came a sudden cloudburst . Roads were washed out . Impossible to move . Black night descended . Fitfully in their busses the travelers dozed . Came , out of South Africa , a noise like distant thunder , then the full-chested , long-drawn reverberant roar of lions in the bush , a sound no lion makes in captivity . . . . <P> Rescue parties found the 30 travelers next morning in the upper branches of several thorn trees , unscratched by lions , safe , inclined to boast of their adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
