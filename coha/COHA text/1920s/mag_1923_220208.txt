Diametrically opposed measures relating to women 's rights are the subject of bitter controversy in the New York Legislature . The National Woman 's Party has endorsed 25 so-called " equality " bills now undergoing a hearing before the Senate Committee on Codes . Some of these bills , embodying the National Woman 's Party principle that women should be treated on terms of literal equality with men , would abrogate nearly all the rights and immunities that women have won in industry , in domestic relations , and as child-bearers , after a continuous struggle of half a century . Women leaders opposed to the extremist tactics of the National Women 's Party assert that because of the fundamental and inescapable differences between men and women in physique , endurance , and social function , the relinquishment of women 's privileges would plunge them back into chattel slavery-a slavery dictated not by the superior authority of men , as formerly , but by the logic of economic necessity . <P> Among the bills bearing Governor Smith 's written approval is a minimum wage act and an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills , in their present form , are being opposed by the National Woman 's Party . <P> Women who have achieved success in callings in which men have hitherto been undisputed leaders will assemble in New York in May , 1924 , at a great congress under the auspices of the American Women 's Association .
