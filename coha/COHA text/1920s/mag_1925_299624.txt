There is a term that little fellows on losing teams may possibly in the future apply to the athletes of the Massee Country School ( Shippan Point , Conn . ) . One of the latter may knock out run after run on a spring afternoon or , when November has turned the leaves wan , may carry a begrimed ball for endless gains ; even so , he shall not come to honor . For the little fellows and their supporters will murmur among themselves . " That guy , how does he get in ? " they will demand of the spring sky , of the autumn clouds . The Massee School 's headmaster , should he hear them , would doubtless reply : " Why , that boy is a special student . " " Student , yeah , " the little ones will savagely rejoin . " A ringer , that 's what he is ! A ringer ! " <P> Mr. W. R. Slack is headmaster of the Massee Country School . A fortnight ago he caused the following advertisement to be inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AVAILABLE , BOYS ' PREP SCHOOL , TO ATHLETES AND MUSICIANS . BOX 926 , STAMFORD , CONN . <P> It was not a conspicuous advertisement . Many people passed it over without serious attention . Not so a certain old man who sits all day under a green celluloid visor , peering at papers in the editorial rooms of a certain metropolitan daily . His clothes are shabby ; he is unable to play any musical instrument ; if in a ball game , the pitcher should " walk " him , it would take long for him to get to first base ; but he is paid money , this dilapidated curmudgeon , for one distinguishing asset-the length of his nose . He smells news as a hound smells an opossum . He drew a circle in red crayon around the advertisement of Mr. Slack , threw it in a basket , sent it to the City Editor , who handed it to a Bright Young Reporter . To Stamford , Conn. , hastened the B. Y. R. His nostrils quivered also . Headmaster Slack was the opossum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-page headline : " PREP SCHOOL CUTS RATE FOR STAR ATHLETES . " Headmaster Slack was out on a limb . <P> In the interview which accompanied the article , Headmaster Slack defended himself , making to the B. Y. R. the distinction he might have had to make to the little boys on the losing teams-that between a special student and a ringer . He asserted , in effect , that since the Battle of Waterloo had been lost many times on the playing fields of Massee , he had been advised to strengthen the school 's prowess in sport by judicious advertising . His advertisement had been printed " for some time , " and rallied to Mr. Slack 's service , he declared , " eight fine fellows " ( among them the captains of the Massee football and basketball teams ) . For these he cut the tuition rates from $1,000 to $500 . In secondary schools , the practice of cutting rates for athletes was a general one , said Headmaster Slack . <P> Other educators , athletic arbiters , sportsmen who gave to the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .
