Scene : A very small room in a tarpapered shanty , reeking poverty . The entrance is center-back ,  --  a few boards nailed together for a door . A similar door , opening into the bedroom of the shack , upstage right . Downstage left , a broken window . Left center , a rusty cooking stove . Above it , a series of shelves holding a few dishes and cooking utensils . Rough board table in the center of the room . A kitchen chair at the right of the table . A large wooden rocker near the stove ; rope and wire hold it together . An arm-chair , below the bedroom door is full of newspapers . Several heterogeneous colored prints culled from out-of-date newspapers and calendars are tacked on the rain-stained walls . When the entrance door is open we see a cleared , sandy spot with a background of scrub oaks and jack pines.The curtain rises on the late afternoon of a spring day.A man of forty enters , leaving the bedroom door open behind him . His small head and childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect body , resemble those of a species of putty-like rubber doll whose head may be reshaped by the hand . He wears a winter cap , blue flannel shirt , well-worn trousers with suspenders , and sneakers that were once white . Outside shirt sleeves are rolled to the elbow ; undershirt sleeves are not . His shoes make no noise ; nevertheless , he comes on tiptoe , his eyes fixed on the shelves . For a moment he stops and glances into the room he has just quitted . Satisfied , he squats before the shelves . He hesitates , then quickly lifts from a lower shelf an inverted cooking vessel , and grasps a small tin box which was hidden under it . He inspects the box , trying to decide whether he can pry open its lock . The voice of an old , infirm man in the adjoining room : Seth ? SETH alarmed ; starts to return the box to the shelf . Yes , Pa ? His voice is pitched high. p. 3 PA querulously . What yuh doin ' ? SETH Jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin box ' til I 'm dead . Seth makes no answer . PA D'yuh hear ? SETH I hear . PA I wo n't heve no one know nothin ' ' bout my last will an ' testament ' til I 'm dead . There is a pause . Seth is regarding the box intently . PA Seth ? SETH peevishly . What d'yuh want ? PA Bring me a drink . SETH There ai n't no more water in the pail . PA There 's lots in the well this spring . A pause . Seth continues his scrutiny of the lock . PA My throat 's burnin ' up . SETH Well , maybe I kin find a drop . Puts the box on the shelf and re-covers it ; in doing so makes a slight noise . PA What 's that noise ? SETH I 'm gettin ' yuh a drink ! Seth strolls to the stove , lifts the top from the kettle , and looks inside . He finds a tin cup and fills it with water . Looking into the kettle again , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to the pump necessary ? Back into the kettle goes some of the water . Cup in hand , he moves toward the bedroom . He reaches the door when a sagging bellied man enters from the yard . It is Lon , the elder , shorter brother . His face has become molded into an expressionless stare , and his every movement seems to be made with an effort . An abused man , Lon , the most ill-treated fellow in the world . At least , so he is ever at pains to have all understand . He wears an old felt hat , cotton shirt , badly patched trousers , suspenders attached to the buttons of his trousers with string , and shoes that are almost soleless . His shirt , stained with sweat , is opened at the throat , revealing red flannel underwear . When Seth sees Lon he immediately closes the bedroom door , silently turns the key in the lock , and puts the key in his pocket . For a moment the men stand looking at each other , reminding one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pours the water into the kettle , and planks himself down in the rocker . Lon glances once or twice at the bedroom door , but moves not to it . He watches Seth suspiciously . Finally he speaks p. 4 LON in an expressionless drawl . I hear Pa 's dyin ' . SETH Yuh hear right . LON With a motion of his head toward the bedroom . Is he in there ? SETH Yes . Lon hesitates , then moves slowly toward Pa 's room . An idea strikes Seth suddenly and he interrupts Lon 's progress . SETH He 's asleep . Lon stops . Seth fills his pipe and lights it . Lon takes his corncob from his pocket and coughs meaningly . Seth looks at Lon , sees what he wants , but does not offer him tobacco . Lon puts his pipe back in his pocket , moves to the table , sits , and sighs . He crosses his right foot so Seth sees what was once the sole of his shoe . SETH What did yuh come here fur ? LON ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was about . LON Wall , no one ever seed yuh a settin ' here much . SETH fleeringly . Suppose yuh want t ' know what he 's left yuh . LON Wall , it war n't comfortable comin ' three miles an ' a quarter on a day like this un . p. 5 SETH cackles . Sand 's hot on yer bare naked feet , ai n't it ? LON moves his feet . Yuh kin talk about my holey boots . If I did n't heve no mouths but my own t ' feed I guess I could buy new ones too . So there , Seth Polland ! SETH Jacobs offered yuh a job at the fisheries same as me . LON It 's too fur t ' hoof it twict a day . SETH Yuh could sleep at the fisheries . LON I got t ' look after my kids . SETH grins . ' Tai n't my fault yuh 've kids . LON threateningly . Do n't yuh talk ' bout that ! Pause . Yer woman had t ' leave yuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' eat . SETH indifferently . She war n't no good . LON She had t ' leave yuh same as Ma left Pa twenty years ago . Pa 's dyin ' fur sure ? SETH Who told yuh ? LON Ma . SETH greatly surprised . Ma ? suspiciouslyWhat you got t ' do with her ? p. 6 LON I was passin ' her place this mornin ' . Furst time I spoke t ' her in a year . SETH I ai n't in two . LON in despair . Seth , she 's cut twenty cords o ' wood t ' sell . SETH Shaking his head . An ' me without a roof o ' my own . LON Me an ' the kids wonder sometimes where our next meal 's comin ' from . SETH as though there were something better in store for him . Oh , wall . LON pricks up his ears ; coughs . If I had this house I could work at the fisheries . SETH But yuh ai n't a goin ' t ' git it . LON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' yuh ? SETH Pa deeded this t ' Doc last winter . LON amazed and angered . He did ? SETH Doc said he could live here ' till he died . But it 's Doc 's . LON It war n't right . SETH Wall , he had t ' pay fur his physics some way . He told me yuh would n't help him out . p. 7 LON And Pa told me yuh would n't . An ' yuh ai n't got two kids t ' feed . Pause . There 's Pa 's old shanty down the road . If I had that I could work at the fisheries . Seth 's smile is his only response . Pa still owns it , do n't he ? SETH There war n't no call fur him t ' make his last will an ' testament if he do n't . LON brightens . He 's left his last will an ' testament ? SETH Yes . I 'm figgerin ' on sellin ' the place t ' Doc . LON emphatically . Pa ai n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . LON forcefully . Where 's the will an ' testament ? SETH With a gesture . In the tin box under that there kittle . Lon hurries to the shelves , picks up the dish , and grasps the box . LON disappointed . It 's locked . SETH An ' the key 's round Pa 's neck . LON Let 's git it . SETH Pa wo n't give it t ' us. p. 8 LON Yuh said he was sleepin ' . SETH I mean  --  he might wake up . Lon inspects the box further . LON I think I could open it . SETH Pa might ask t ' see it . LON Hell . Puts the box back on the shelf . SETH Doc 'll want the place seein ' as how it 's right next t ' this un . Lon is very nervous . Yuh might jest as wall go home . LON No , yuh do n't ! Yuh ca n't make me believe Pa 's left it t ' yuh . Takes off his hat and mops his brow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald . SETH Then what yuh gettin ' so excited ' bout ? LON I ai n't excited . Puts his hat on . It jest makes me mad ' cause yuh say Pa 's left it t ' yuh , an ' I know he ai n't . See ? There war n't no call fur him t ' heve willed an ' testamented it t ' yuh . Yuh 've only yerself t ' look after an ' I 've two motherless kids . SETH Every one knows how much Pa thought o ' them . LON It war n't my fault if they thumbed their noses at him . p. 9 SETH Yuh could o ' basted ' em . LON They 's like their Ma . Bastin ' never done her no good , God rest her soul . All the same , Pa knowd how hard it is fur me t ' keep their bellies full . Why , when we heve bread Alexander never wants less than half the loaf ! An ' all the work I gits t ' do is what the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me . SETH Huh ! Jest as though I did n't know ' bout yuh . Mr. Breckenridge told me yuh would n't even contract t ' chop his wood fur him . An ' there yuh sits all winter long in that God-fursaken shanty o ' yourn , with trees all round yuh , an ' yuh wo n't put an ax t ' one ' til yer own fires dies out . LON My back ai n't never been strong . Choppin ' puts the kinks in it . Yuh kin talk , yuh kin , Seth Polland , with a soft job at the fisheries an ' three squares a day which yuh do n't heve t ' cook yourself . Northin ' t ' do all winter but walk round them cottages an ' see that no one broke in . An ' I 'm the one who knows how often yuh walk round them cottages . I wish I hed yer snap . Sits . But I ai n't never had no luck . SETH defending himself . I walk round them cottages jest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LON Huh ! I could tell a tale . Who was it set with his feet in the oven last winter , an'let Jack Tompkins break into them cottages  --  with keys ? Seth does not answer . I could tell , I could . But I ai n't a goin ' t ' ' til they put me on the witness-stand . Pause . But the furst initials o ' his name is Seth Polland. p. 10 SETH rising instantly . Lon Polland , yuh ever tell an ' I 'll skin yuh alive . LON Huh ! SETH Skin yuh like a pole-cat . LON Huh ! Seth turns , knocks the ashes from his pipe into the stove . Lon rises ; takes Seth 's chair and rocks vigorously . SETH Yuh know what I got on yuh . Lon 's bravado is short-lived . He rocks less strenuously SETH Yuh thought I did n't see yuh , but I was right on the spot when yuh set fire t ' Mr. Rogers ' bath-house . Lon stops rocking . SETH Right behind a jack pine I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh done it ' cause Mr. Rogers leaved Jessup paint the house when yuh thought yuh ought t ' had the job . LON rises . I got t ' be a gottin ' home a fore dark an ' tend t ' my stock . SETH Stock ? Cackles . Pulls out his tobacco-pouch and fills his pipe . Lon shows his pipe again . A blind mare an ' a rooster . Drops pouch on the table as he lights his pipe . LON Rooster 's dead . Moves stealthily toward the table. p. 11 SETH What of ? LON Pip . SETH Starvation . LON I would a killed him this long time , but Victoria howled so when I threatened . The fowl used t ' wake me in winter same as summer with his crowin ' . As Lon finishes his speech he reaches for the pouch . But Seth 's hand is quicker . Seth moves to the rocker and sits , dangling the pouch temptingly by one finger . Lon puts his pipe in his pocket . SETH Should think yuh 'd want t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yer so sure he 's left yuh his property . LON He oughter a left it t ' me . SETH Well , I 'm a tellin ' yuh it 's mine . LON Yuh ai n't got no right t ' it . Mops his head again . Pa begged yuh t ' come an ' live with him , offered yuh this fine roof over yer head , an ' yuh was too cussed even t ' do that fur him . An ' now yuh expect he 's made yuh his heir . SETH I 've treated him righter ' an yuh . LON Yuh ai n't . Suddenly something seems to snap in Seth 's brain . He looks as though he were in intense pain . SETH gasping . Maybe he 's left it t ' the two o ' us ! p. 12 LON What ? SETH Maybe he 's divided the place a ' tween us . LON shakes his head . Oh , he would n't be so unhuman as that . SETH He would . He was always settin ' one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tell me I had t ' figger how t ' git the best o ' yuh or he 'd baste me . SETH He was all the time whettin ' us on when we was kids . LON It was him showed me how t ' shake my old clock so it 'd run fur five minutes , an ' then you 'd swop that pail yuh found fur it . SETH Huh ! He give me his gum t ' stop up the hole in that pail . Yuh would n't know it leaked an ' we could laugh at yuh when you had t ' carry water in it . LON pathetically . There war n't never more ' an a pint left when I got t ' the house . An ' Pa always hed such a thirst . SETH He 'd like t ' laugh at us in his grave . LON It jest tickled him t ' raise hell a ' tween us . SETH rises . I 'll take my oath he 's divided the old shanty an ' the two acres a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . An ' I figgered I 'd be sellin ' them t ' Doc t'morrow. p. 13 LON Me an ' the kids was a goin ' t ' heve a garden on the cleared spot . SETH A garden in that sand ? LON Radishes an ' rutabagas . SETH persuasively ; his manner becomes kind . Lon , what yuh need is the shanty . LON droning . The shanty ai n't no good t ' me without I he s the ground fur it t ' set on . SETH Yuh can tear it down an ' use the lumber t ' mend yer old leaky one . LON I want the shanty t ' live in so I kin git a soft job at the fisheries . Sympathetically . You ought t ' have a shanty , Seth . Supposin ' yuh was t ' take sick . They would n't keep yuh at the fisheries then . Yuh take my place an ' give me Pa 's . SETH flashing into anger . I want the two acres t ' sell Doc . Yer old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been too disparaging : But yuh could make it real comfortable with the lumber in  --  LON cutting in . I 'll make a bargain . I 'll leave yuh a bed-stead an ' a table if yuh 'll take my place . SETH I do n't want it ! I want Pa 's old place . p. 14 LON An ' I want it . I 'm older ' an yuh . SETH I got the best claim t ' it . LON Yuh ai n't . We with three mouths t ' feed . Yer a swindler , yuh are . Yuh always tried t ' cheat me . SETH No one kin say that t ' me . I 'm an honest man . But I 'm a goin ' ' t heve the two acres if I heve t ' go t ' law . LON Wall , yuh ai n't a goin ' t ' wreck me . SETH calmly ; philosophically again . Maybe yer right , Lon , when yuh say I ought t ' have a roof . I 'll tell yuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother . Yuh give me the ground an ' the house on it , an ' I 'll make yuh a present o ' twenty-five dollars . LON That 's a lie ! Yuh ai n't got twenty-five dollars t ' yer name . SETH Yuh think so . LON Every one in these parts knows yuh owes Hawkins forty-three dollars an twenty-nine cents he ki n't collect . Give me the house an ' ground , an ' I 'll give yuh my own house an ' my note fur twenty-five dollars . SETH Yer note ! I 'm a goin ' t ' heve Pa 's old place . LON An ' I say that yuh or no swindler like yuh is a goin ' t ' cheat me out o ' it . p. 15 SETH I ai n't a swindler , yuh wall-eyed son  --  LON advancing . Take it back . Do n't yuh call me dissipated names . SETH I 'll never take it back ! Lon doubles his fists and strikes ; but the blow lands in the air as Seth grabs Lon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no ethics to the struggle . The rickety furniture trembles as they advance and retreat . Seth is quicker and lighter and less easily winded ; but Lon 's bulk is not readily moved , and , despite his " weak back , " he can still wield his arms . It looks like a fight to the finish . Is n't their future at stake ? And they are giving vent to a hatred bred by their father . But suddenly Pa 's voice is heard , calling wildly to Seth . The men do not move : the voice seems to have paralyzed their muscles . For a moment they stand dazed . Then consciousness comes to them : they realize that the waiting is over . They tear to the bedroom . A silence follows . They must be fascinated by the ghost of the old man . SETH in the bedroom ; quietly . He 's gone , Lon . LON in the bedroom . Yer right , Seth . Then their voices rise in dispute . Do n't yuh take it ! p. 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SETH It ai n't ! LON Yuh ki n't  --  SETH Shut up ! They rush into the kitchen , Seth in advance , Lon close on his heels . The younger throws the cooking-dish to the floor , grabs the box , and hurries to the table . As though they were about to discover a world 's secret , they unlock the box , each as near to it as possible , his arms tense , fingers itching , ready to ward off a blow or seize the treasure . From the box , Seth takes an old tobacco-pouch , a jack-knife , a bit of heavy cord , a couple of letters . These are contemptuously thrown on the table . The will lies at the bottom of the box . Lon snatches it . Seth would take it from him . LON Hold off ! I 'm jest a goin ' t ' read it . Seth curbs his impatience . Lon opens the document and reads , slowly and haltingly . " I , Nathaniel Polland , o ' Sandy Point in the County o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' o ' sound mind an ' memory , do make , publish , an ' declare this t ' be my last Will an ' Testament in manner followin ' , viz  --  . " What does " viz " mean ? Unable to bear the suspense longer , Seth seizes the paper . He scans it until his eyes catch the all-important paragraph. p. 17 SETH "  --  Bequeath all my earthly possessions to my wife , Jennie Polland . " Their thunderbolt has descended . They stand like two men suddenly deprived of thought and motion . Medusa 's victims could not have been more pitiable . They have been hurled from their El Dorado , which , at the worst , was to have been their common property.Then Seth 's voice comes to him , and sufficient strength to drop into a chair . SETH The damned old critter . LON I 'll be swaned . SETH blazing out . That 's gratitude . LON After all we done fur him . SETH pathetically . An ' me a plannin ' these last five years on gettin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are packin ' our furniture this afternoon , gettin ' ready t ' move in . SETH with supreme disgust . Leavin ' it t ' Ma . LON Her who he ai n't hardly spoke t ' in twenty years . SETH Jest as though yuh an ' me was n't alive . LON We 'd a given him our last pipeful . p. 18 SETH His own flesh an ' blood . LON Why , he told me more ' an a thousand times he hated Ma . SETH She do n't need it . LON She 's ready fur the grave-yard . SETH She 's that stingy , cuttin ' an ' choppin ' wood , sellin it t ' the city folks . We might a knowd . LON An ' me a comin ' all the three miles an ' a quarter t ' see him a fore he died . SETH I been settin ' here two days a waitin ' . LON An ' then t ' treat us like that . Wipes his mouth . Why , the hull place ai n't worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' two acres yuh could n't grow weeds on . LON A pile o ' sand . SETH rising ; bursting into fire like an apparently dead rocket . She ai n't a goin ' t ' heve it ! LON What ? SETH I wo n't let Ma heve it ! LON But how yuh goin ' t ' stop her ? ' Two n't do no good t ' tear up the will an ' testament . It 's rec-ord-ed . SETH Do n't make no difference . She ai n't a goin ' t ' heve that place . p. 19 LON eagerly . But how yuh goin '  --  ? SETH I do n't know . But I 'm a goin ' t ' . LON It ai n't hers by rights . SETH Did n't she leave him twenty years ago ? LON Why , she ai n't even expectin ' it ! SETH She 'll never miss it if she do n't git it . LON shaking his head . Me an ' the kids packed up , ready t ' move in . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seth making his brain work as it has never worked before . And he is rewarded for his diligence . A suggestion of his sneering smile comes to his face . SETH Lon ? LON Yes ? SETH looks about , making sure that only his brother is listening . Yuh ' member what yuh done t ' Rogers when he did n't leave yuh paint his bath-house ? LON his eyes open wide . Burn it ? SETH Sh ! LON Oh , no ! SETH Yuh do n't want Ma t ' heve it , does yuh ? p. 20 LON When I burned that bath-house I did n't sleep good fur a couple o ' nights . I dreamed o ' the sheriff . SETH Nobody knows but me . An ' nobody 'll know yuh an ' me set fire t ' Pa 's old place . LON Yuh swear yuh wo n't never tell ? SETH raising his right hand . I swear . LON Yuh wo n't never try an ' make out I done t next time we run agin each other fur district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Cause if I ki n't have Pa 's old place , no one kin . LON Got matches ? SETH Yes . An ' Pa 's kerosene-can 's got ' bout a pint in it . Takes the can from the bottom shelf . LON I may as wall take these papers along with me . Picks up the newspapers . Seth moves to the table . Begins to fill his pipe . Lon takes his corncob from his pocket and coughs . Seth looks at Lon , meditates , then speaks . SETH Heve a smoke , Lon ? LON Maybe I will . Lon fills his pipe .  --  Seth strikes a match , lights his own pipe first , then hands the match to Lon. p. 21 SETH We 're brothers . LON The same flesh an ' blood has got t ' treat each other right . Lon starts to put Seth 's tobacco-pouch in his pocket , but Seth stops him . SETH An ' we would n't be treatin ' each other right if we let Pa 's property come into Ma 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They go out the back door and disappear . Thus , in disgust and rage , the brothers are united . Then Seth 's voice is heard . SETH in the yard . Wait a minute , Lon . Seth returns . He picks up Pa 's tobacco-pouch , knife and scissors , glances toward the door to see that Lon is n't watching , and sticks them into his pocket . LON in the yard . What yuh doin ' , Seth ? Appears at the door . SETH I thought I left somethin ' valuable . But I ai n't . He leaves . Lon and Seth pass out of sight.
