Visitors in the U. S. last week included : <P> <P> The Mayor of Budapest . Dr. Eugene Sipocz was one of some 500 distinguished Hungarian " Kossuth Pilgrims " who landed at Manhattan , last week , led by Baron Sigmund de Perenyi , a onetime Hungarian Minister of Interior . <P> They came to dedicate and present to the city of New York a monument commemorating that titanic hero , Lajos ( Louis ) Kossuth ( 1802-94 ) . For a day Manhattan rang with speeches fervently recalling how Kossuth proclaimed the independence of Hungary and became Dictator in 1848 , only to see his fatherland reconquered within a twelve-month by Austro-Russian troops supporting the Austrian Boy-Emperor Franz Josef , then a stripling of 19 . The fact that in 1851 Kossuth was brought to Manhattan on a U. S. man-of-war and honored as a supreme apostle of Liberty gave point to the dedication of last week . <P> <P> Lord Dunsany , famed Irish romantic , 18th Baron Dunsany , poet , dramatist &; man of letters , arrived to revisit the U. S. last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last visit he ubiquitously exhibited bad manners but last week he seemed the authentic dreamer of such works of genius as Tales of Wonder , A Night at an Inn and The Laughter of the Gods . <P> Mrs. Margaret Sanger ( Mrs. J. Noah H. Slee ) , famed birth controller , declared last week , as she landed from the He de France that in Germany 98% of all prospective brides apply to government bureaus where they are told how to prevent conception . <P> Rosie ( " Dolly Sisters " ) Dolly landed at Manhattan last week with her new Dominion husband , Mortimer Davis Jr. , tobacco scion . Asked about the amazing luck of herself and twin-sister Jennie , at the baccarat tables in Cannes ( TIME , March 12 ) , Mrs. Davis ruefully admitted that luck has turned against Jennie , who has now lost the whole of a spectacular win totaling 40,000 ( $195,000 ) . <P> Trader Horn . Shameful was the exploitation last week , in Manhattan , of a white-haired and quavering old man of 75 whose name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trader " ) Horn . His arrival from Johannesburg , South Africa , via London , was made the occasion for a humorous publicity campaign by the Publishers of Trader Horn , a biography of Afric blood and thunder which the old man is said to have " dictated " ( TIME , June 27 ) . Throughout the week , Mr. Smith wandered like a puzzled Rip Van Winkle through a series of functions at which he , in contrast to most of the literati present , was creditably sober . <P> The enterprising South African novelist to whom Mr. Smith " dictated " Trader Horn is a Mrs. Ethelreda Lewis . How large a share of the best-selling royalties goes to her was guessed , last week , from the fact that Mr. Smith reached Manhattan traveling second class on the Olympic and put up at the modest Fifth Avenue Hotel . <P> There correspondents prodded him with questions about his early life until he cackled : " I have been a little bit a rogue elephant-as I have written , something of a rascal elephant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for minutes thereafter eager camera men cried : " Wink that eye again , Trader Horn ! . . . Hold that wink , Trader ! . . . You 're not winking , Trader Horn .
