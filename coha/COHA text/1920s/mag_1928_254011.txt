From two sources , last week , word came that musicians get big figures ( financially ) , think in big figures , have tiffs in big figures . And loud was the cry that they care more for these figures than for music . <P> George Engles , manager of Schumann-Heink , Taliey , Paderewski , Heifetz , estimated that the U. S. spends 20 million dollars for music each year . His budget allots six millions to the 13 major symphony orchestras , three and a half millions to the Metropolitan and Chicago Opera Companies , the rest to individual artists , summer concert orchestras , a few minor opera companies . Grade A box-office attractions , according to Manager Engles , are Pianists Paderewski , Hofmann , Rachmaninoff ; Violinists Kreisler , Heifetz , Elman , Yehudi Menuhin ; Singers Schumann-Heink , Garden , Farrar , Jeritza , Galli-Curci , Taliey , Ponselle , McCormack , Chaliapin , Gigli , Schipa . Their gross receipts amount to some three millions a year . <P> But the figures in one Louis Sherwin 's " Report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough to be incredible . He estimates that Paderewski earned $1,000,000 from concerts in two years , that ten other instrumentalists and singers* had earning capacities which equaled or exceeded Paderewski 's . He also notes : " One young pianist of quite recent reputation was paid $12,000 for a week at a movie theatre . Thereupon , Kreisler refused an offer of $15,000 for a similar adventure , not on the ground that it was beneath his artistic dignity , but because the sum was below his weekly earnings in recitals . " <P> *Among these are Hofmann , Heifetz and Kreisler , Galli-Curci and Schumann-Heink , McCormack and Chaliapin.
