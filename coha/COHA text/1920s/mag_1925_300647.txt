THE STREET OF THE EYE-Gerald Bullet-Boni Liveright ( $2.00 ) . Simmering , sizzling , boiling , gurgling , spitting , the fear of God bubbled like Hell 's lava in the head of Bellingham ; it drove him out of bed and across the arid plains of Hell under a sky monotonously grey except where the sun , a bloody red , like a huge socket from which the eye had been torn , stared sightlessly at him . In this story , the first and most powerful in the book , Mr. Gerald Bullet adeptly spins out mystification until it becomes mysticism . The Enchanted Moment tells how a certain gnome made a top-hatted , cut-awayed , striped-trousered bondholder do a dance without top hat , cutaway , trousers . The Mole was the size of a pea . It was situated on the chin of a storekeeper 's wife . Out of it grew three black feline whiskers and the storekeeper 's destruction .
