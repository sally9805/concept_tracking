Back from the American Pro-Cathedral in Paris to sun-swept Mt . St. Alban , highest point in Washington , D. C. , will be brought the body of Norman Prince , founder of France 's Lafayette Escadrille , there to be sepulchred within the Washington National Cathedral . Bishop James Edward Freeman made the announcement last week , together with a statement that Norman Prince 's father , Frederick Henry Prince of Prides Crossing , Mass. , who was mentioned for U. S. Ambassador to France ( TIME , April 15 ) , had made a " generous gift " toward the construction of a $200,000 chapel in the south choir aisle where his son will rest . Three famed dead now rest within the cathedral 's gaunt unfinished walls : Woodrow Wilson , Admiral George Dewey , Melville Elijah Stone . A brave aviator , Norman Prince , after 122 aerial combats in which he brought down five hostile planes , was killed in October , 1916.
