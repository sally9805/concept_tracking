A PECULIAR interest always attaches to humor . There is no quality of the human mind about which its possessor is more sensitive than the sense of humor . A man will freely confess that he has no ear for music , or no 1r ataste for fiction , or even no interest in religion . But I have yet to see the man who announces that he has no sense of humor . In point of fact , every man is apt to think himself possessed of an exceptional gift in this direction , and that even if his humor does not express itself in the power either to make a joke 1r to laugh at one , it none the less consists in a peculiar insight or inner light superior to that of other people . The same thing is true of nations . Each thinks its own humor of an entirely ; uperior kind , and either refuses to ! limit , or admits reluctantly , the humorms quality of other peoples . The Engishman may credit the Frenchman with L certain light effervescence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may acknowledge . that f.nglish literature shows here and there . sort of heavy playfulness ; but neither f them would consider that the humor f the other nation could stand a moaent 's comparison with his own . Yet , oddly enough , American humor Lands as a conspicuous exception to this ? neral rule . A certain vogue clings to t . Ever since the spacious days of Lrtemus Ward and Mark Twain it has njoyed an extraordinary reputation , nd this not only on our own continent , ut in England . It was in a sense the : nglish who " discovered " Mark Twain ; I mean it was they who first clearly cognized him as a man of letters of the n.emost rank , at a time when academic Vor .. CXLIV. ? No. 8 ( 2. - 55Boston still tried to explain him away as a mere comic man of the West . In the same way Artemus Ward is still held in affectionate remembrance in London , and , of the later generation , Mr. Dooley at least is a household word . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has grown around American humor . It is presumed to be a superior article and to enjoy the same kind of preeminence as French cooking , the Russian ballet , and Italian organ grinding . With this goes the converse supposition that the British people are inferior in humor , that a joke reaches them only with great difficulty , and that a British audience listens Lo humor in gloomy and unintelligent silence . People still love to repeat the famous story of how John Bright listened attentively to Artemus Ward 's lecture in London and then said , gravely , that he " doubted many of the young man 's statements " ; and readers still remember Mark Twain 's famous parody of the discussion of his book by a wooden-headed reviewer of an English review . But the legend in reality is only a legend . If the English are inferior to Americans in humor , I , for one , am at a loss to see where it comes in . If there is anything on our continent superior in humor to Punch I should like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our midst than E. V. Lucas and Charles Graves and Owen Seaman should like to read what they write ; and if there is any audience capable of more laughter and more generous appreciation than an audience in London , or Bristol , or Aberdeen , I should like to lecture to it . During the last three months I have had very exceptional opportunities for testing the truth of these comparisons . It has been my good fortune to appear as an avowed humorist in all the great British cities . I have lectured as far north as Aberdeen and as far south as Brighton and Bournemouth ; I have been eastward to Ipswich and westward into Wales . I have spoken , on serious subjects , but with a joke or two in loco , at the universities , at business gatherings , and at London dinners ; I have watched , lost in admiration , the inspired merriment of the Savages of Ade1phi Terrace , and in my moments of leisure I have observed , with a scientific eye , the gayeties of the London revues . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking by and large , the two communities are on the same level . A Harvard audience , as T have reason gratefully to acknowledge , is wonderful . But an Oxford audience is just as good . A gathering of business men in a textile town in the Midlands is just as heavy as a gathering of business men in Decatur , Indiana , but no heavier ; and an audience of English schoolboys as at Rugby or at Clifton is capable of a wild and sustained merriment not to be outdone from Halifax to Los Angeles . There is , however , one vital difference between American and English audiences which would be apt to discourage at . the outset , any American lecturer who might go to England . The English audiences , from the nature of the way in which they have been brought together , expect more . In England they still associate lectures with information . We do n't . Our American lecture audiences are , in nine cases out of ten , organized by a woman 's club of some kind and drawn not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call it ? ? the class that does n't have to work , or , at any rate , not too hard . It is largely a social audience , well educated without being " highbrow , " and tolerant and kindly to a degree . In fact , what the people mainly want is to see the lecturer . They have hoard all about G. K. Chestertonand Hugh Walpole and John Drink-water , and so when these gentlemen come to town the woman 's club want to have a look at them , just as the English people , who are all crazy about animals , flock to the zoo to look at a new giraffe . They do n't expect the giraffe to do anything in particular . They want to see it , that 's all . So with the American woman 's club audience . After they have seen Mr. Chesterton they ask one another as they come out ? just as an incidental matter ? " Did you understand his lecture ? " and the answer is , " I ca n't say I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can now go and say that they have seen Mr. Chesterton ; that 's worth two dollars in itself . The nearest thing to this attitude of mind that I heard of in England was at the City Temple in London , where they have every week a huge gathering of about two thousand people , to listen to a ( so-called ) popular lecture . When I was there I was told that the person who had preceded me was Lord Haldane , who had lectured on Einstein 's Theory of Relativity . I said to the chairman , " Surely this kind of audience could n't understand a lecture like that ! " He shook his head . " No , " he said , " they did n't understand it , but they all enjoyed it . " I do n't mean to imply by what I said above that American lecture audiences do not appreciate good things or that the English lecturers who come to this continent are all giraffes . On the contrary : when the audience finds that Chesterton and Walpole and Drinkwater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecturers , they are all the better pleased . But this does n't alto the fact that they have come primarily to see the lecturer . Not so in England . Here a lecture ( outside London ) is organized on a m net sterner footing . The people are there feu I am a Canadian . But for lack of any ( Abel word to indicate collectively those who live be tween the Rio Grande and the North Pole I have t4 use American . If the Canadians and the Esi , imo and the Flathead Indians are not Americana , wha are they ? information . The lecture is organized not by idle , amiable , charming women , but by a body called , with variations , the Philosophical Society . From experience I should define an English Philosophical Society as all the people in town who do n't know anything about philosophy . The academic and university classes are never there . The audience is of only plainer folk . In the United States and Canada at any evening lecture a large sprinkling of the audience are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London ) none of them are ; philosophy is not to be wooed in such a garb . Nor are there the same commodious premises , the same bright lights , and the same atmosphere of gayety as at a society lecture in America . On the contrary , the setting is a gloomy , one . In England , in winter , night begins I at four in the afternoon . In the manufacturing towns of the Midlands and the north ( which is where the philosophical societies flourish ) there is always a drizzling rain and wet slop underfoot , a bedraggled poverty in the streets , and a dimness of lights that contrasts with the glare of light in an American town . There is no visible sign in the town that a lecture is to happen , no placards , no advertisements , nothing . The lecturer is conducted by a chairman through a side door in a dingy building ( The Institute , established 1840 ) , and then all of a sudden in a huge , dim hall ? there sits ? 1 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they sit as quiet as a prayer meeting . They are waiting to be fed ? on information . Now I do n't mean to say that the Philosophical Society are not a good audience . In their own way they 're all right . Once the Philosophical Society ? has decided that a lecture is humorous they do not stint their laughter . I have had many times the satisfaction of seeing a Philosophical Society swept away from its moorings and tossing in a sea of laughter , as generous and as wholehearted as anything we ever see in America . But they are not so willing to begin . With us the chairman has only to say to the gayly dressed members of the Ladies ' Fortnightly Club , " Well , ladies , I 'm sure we are all looking forward very much to Mr. Walpole 's lecture , " and at once there is a ripple of applause , and a responsive expression On a hundred charming faces . Not so the Philosophical Society of the Midlands . The chairman rises . He does n't call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have with us Lo-night , " he says , " a man whose name is well known to the Philosophical Society , " ( herehe looks at his card ) , " Mr. Stephen Leacock . " ( Complete silence . ) " He is a professor of political economy at ? " Here he turns to me and says , " Which college did you say ? " I answer quite audibly in the silence , " At McGill . " " He is at McGill , " says the chairman . ( More silence . ) " I do n't suppose , however , ladies and gentlemen , that he 's come here to talk about political economy . " This is meant as a jest , but the audience takes it as a. threat . " However , ladies and gentlemen , you have n't come here to listen to me " ( this evokes applause , the first of the evening ) , " so without more ado " ( the man always has the impression , that there 's been a lot of " ado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll now introduce Mr. Leacock . " ( Complete silence . ) Nothing of which means the least harm . It only implies that the Philosophical Society are true philosophers in accepting nothing unproved . They are like the man from Missouri . They want to be shown . And undoubtedly it takes a little time , therefore , to rouse them . I remember listening with great interest to Sir Michael Sadler , who is possessed of a very neat wit , introducing me at Leeds . He threw three jokes , one after the other , into the heart of a huge , silent audience without effect . He might as well have thrown soap bubbles . But the fourth joke broke fair and square like a bomb in the middle of the Philosophical Society and exploded them into convulsions . The process is very like what artillery men tell of " bracketing " the object fired at , and then landing fairly on it . In what I have just written about audiences I have purposely been using the word English and not British , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is , for a humorous lecturer , no better audience in the world than a Scotch audience . The old standing joke about the Scotch sense of humor is mere nonsense . Yet one finds it everywhere . " So you 're going to try to take humor up to Scotland , " the most eminent author in England said to me . " Well , the Lord help you . You 'd better take an ax with you to open their skulls ; there is no other way . " How this legend started I do n't know , but I think it is because the English are jealous of the Scotch . They got into the Union with them in 1707 and they ca n't get out . The Scotch do n't want Home Rule , or Swa Raj , or Dominion status , or anything ; they just want the English . When they want money they go to London and ' make it ; if they want literary fame they sell their books to the English ; and to prevent any kind of political trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seotehmen . The English for shame 's sake ca n't get out of the Union , so they retaliate by saying that the Scotch have no sense of humor . But there 's nothing in it . One has only to ask any of the theatrical people and they will tell you that the audiences in Glasgow and Edinburgh are the best in the British Isles ? possess the best taste and the best ability to recognize what is really good . The reason for this lies , I think , in the well-known fact that the Scotch are a truly educated people , not educated in the mere sense of having been made to go to school , but in the higher sense of having acquired an interest in books and a respect for learning . In England the higher classes alone possess this , the working class as a whole know nothing of it . But in Scotland the attitude is universal . And the more I reflect upon the subject , the more I believe that what counts most in the appreciation of humor is not nationality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not think that there is any doubt that educated people possess a far wider range of humor than the uneducated class . Some people , of course , get overeducated and become hopelessly academic . The word " highbrow " has been invented exactly to fit the case . The sense of humor in the highbrow has become atrophied , or , to vary the metaphor , it is submerged or buried under the accumulated strata of his education , on the top soil of which flourishes a fine growth of conceit . But even in the highbrow the educated appreciation of humor is there ? away down . Generally , if one attempts to amuse a highbrow he will resent it as if the process were beneath him ; or perhaps the intellectual jealousy and touchiness with which he is always overcharged will lead him to retaliate with a pointless story from Plato . But if the highbrow is right off his guard and has no jealousy in his mind , you may find him roaring with laughter and wiping his spectacles , with his sides shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry , clever little schoolboy that he was thirty years ago , before his education ossified him . But with the illiterate and the rustic no such process is possible . His sense of humor may be there as a sense , but the mechanism for setting it in operation is limited and rudimentary . Only the broadest and most elementary forms of joke can reach him . The magnificent mechanism of the art of words is , quite literally , a sealed book to him . Here and there , indeed , a form of fun is found so elementary in its nature and yet so excellent in execution that it appeals to all alike , to the illiterate and to the highbrow , to the peasant and the professor . Such , for example , are the antics of Mr. Charles Chaplin or the depiction of Mr. Eggs by the pencil of George McManus . But such cases are rare . As a rule the cheap fun that excites the rustic to laughter is execrable to the man of education . In the light of what I have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every English or American audience are much the same . All those who lecture or act are well aware that there are certain types of people that are always to be seen somewhere in the haIl . Some of these belong to the general class of discouraging people . They listen in stolid silence . No light of intelligence ever gleams on their faces ; no response comes from their eyes . I find , for example , that wherever I go there is always seated in the audience , about three seats from the front , a silent man with a big motionless face like a melon . He is always there . I have seen that man in every town or city from Richmond , Indiana , to Bournemouth in Hampshire . He haunts me . I get to expect him . I feel like nodding to him from the platform . And I find that all other lecturers have the same experience . Wherever they go the man with the big face is always there . He never laughs ; no matter if the people all round him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock ? or , no , like a toad ? immovable . What he thinks I do n't know . Why he comes to lectures I can not guess . Once , and once only , I spoke to him , or , rather , lie spoke to me . I was coming out from the lecture and found myself close to him in the corridor . It had been a rather gloomy evening ; the audience had hardly laughed at all ; and I know nothing sadder than a humorous lecture without laughter . The man with the big face , finding himself beside me , turned and said , " Some of them people were n't getting that to-night . " His tone of sympathy seemed to imply that he had got it all himself ; if so , he must have swallowed it whole without a sign . But I have since thought that this man with the big face may have his own internal form of appreciation . This much , however , I know . To look at him from the platform is fatal . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecturer would be lost ; inspiration would die upon one 's lips ? the basilisk is n't in it with him . ? Personally , I no sooner see the man with the big face than instinctively I turn my eyes away . I look round the hall for another man that I know is always there , the opposite type , the little man with the spectacles . There he sits , good soul , about twelve rows back , his large spectacles beaming with appreciation and his quick face anticipating every point . I imagine him to be by trade a minor journalist or himself a writer of sorts , but with not enough of success to have spoiled him . There are other people always there , too . There is the old lady who thinks the lecture improper ; it does n't matter how moral it is , she 's out for impropriety and she can find it anywhere . Then there is another very terrible man against whom all American lecturers in England should be warned ? the man who is leaving on the 9 P.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a schedule which is expressly arranged to have the principal train leave before the lecture ends . Hence the 9-P.M. - train man . - Ile sits right near the front , and at ten minutes to nine he gathers up his hat , coat , and umbrella very deliberately , rises with great calm , and walks firmly away . His air is that of a man who has stood all that he can and can bear no more . Till one knows about this man , and the others who rise after him , it is very disconcerting ; at first . I thought I must have said something to reflect upon the royal family . But presently the lecturer gets to understand that it is only the nine-o'clock train and that all the audience know about it . Then it 's all right . It 's just like the people rising and stretching themselves after the seventh inning in Waseball . In all that goes above I have been emphasizing the fact that the British and the American sense of humor are essentially the same thing . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar preferences of material that often make them seem to diverge widely . By this I mean that each community has , within limits , its own particular ways of being funny and its own particular conception of a joke . Thus , a Scotehman likes best a joke which he has all to himself or which he shares reluctantly with a few ; the thing is too rich to distribute . The American loves particularly as his line of joke an anecdote with the point all concentrated at the end and exploding in a phrase . The Englishman loves best as his joke the narration of something that actually did happen and that depends , of course , for its point on its reality . There are plenty of minor differences , too , in point of mere form , and very naturally each community finds the particular form used by the others less pleasing than its own . In fact , for this very reason each people is apt to think its own humor the best . Thus , on our side of the Atlantic , to cite our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor of bad spelling . We have , indeed , told ourselves a thousand times over that bad spelling is not funny , but is very tiresome . Yet it is no sooner laid aside and buried than it gets resurrected . I suppose the real reason is that it is funny , at least to our eyes . When Bill Nye spells wife with " yph " we ca n't help being amused . Now Bill Nye 's bad spelling had absolutely no point to it except its oddity . At times it was extremely funny , but as a mode it led easily to widespread and pointless imitation . It was the kind of thing ? like poetry ? that anybody can do badly . It was most deservedly abandoned with execration . No American editor would print it to-day . But witness the new and excellent effect produced with had spelling by Mr. Ring VT . Lardner . Here , however , the case is altered ; it is not the falseness of Mr. Lardner 's spelling that is the amusing feature of it , but the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al , I would of role sooner , " etc. , he is truer to actual sound and intonation than the lexicon . The mode is excellent . ' But the imitations will soon debase it into such had coin that it will fail to pass current . In England , however , the humor of bad spelling does not and has never , I believe , flourished . Bad spelling is only used in England as an attempt to reintroduce phonetically a dialect ; it is not intended that the spelling itself should be thought funny , but the dialect that it represents . But the effect , on the whole , is tiresome . A little dose of the humor of Lancashire or Somerset or Yorkshire pronunciation may be all right , but a whole page of it looks like the gibbering of chimpanzees set down on paper . In America also we run perpetually to the ( supposed ) humor of slang , a form not used in England . If we were to analyze what we mean by slang I think it would be found to consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of a metaphorical character , strained almost . to the breaking point . Sometimes we do it with a single word . Then some genius discovers that a " hat " is really only " a lid " placed on top of a human being , and straightway the word " lid " goes rippling over the continent . Similarly a woman becomes a " skirt , " and so on ad infinitum . These words presently either disappear or else retain a permanent place , being slang no longer . No doubt half our words , if not all of them , were once slang . Even within our own memory we can see the whole process carried through ; " cinch " once sounded funny ; it is now standard American-English . But other slang is made up of descriptive phrases . At the best , these slang phrases are ? at least we think they are ? extremely funny . But they are funniest when newly coined , and it takes a master hand to coin them well . For a supreme example of wild vagaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry 's " Gentle Grafter . " But here the imitation is as easy as it is tiresome . The invention of pointless slang phrases without real suggestion or merit is one of our most familiar forms of factorymade humor . Now the English people are apt to turn away from the whole field of slang . In the first place it puzzles them ? they do n't know whether each particular sort of phrase is a sort of idiom already known to Americans , or something ( as with 0 . Henry ) never said before and to be analyzed for its own sake . The result is that with the English public the great mass of American slang writing ( genius apart ) does n't go . I have even found English people of undoubted literary taste repelled from such a master as 0 . Henry ( now read by millions in England ) because at a first sight they get the impression that it is " all American slang . " English people also find tiresome our American " anecdote " ? the conversational form of humor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how much addicted we are to telling one another stories . With many people it becomes a settled idea of pleasant social intercourse . If two men meet in the train one says , " I heard a good story last week ; perhaps you 've heard it . " And the other has to say , " No , " before waiting to hear what it is , because he 's going to get it , anyway . At a dinner party our people no sooner sit down than the host begins , " I heard a story the other day ; perhaps you 've heard it , " and there is chorus of , " No , no , " all round the table . I often marvel at our extraordinary tolerance and courtesy to one another in the matter of story-telling . I have never seen a bad story-teller thrown forcibly out of the ' nom or even stopped and warned ; we isten with the most wonderful patience : o the worst of narration . The story is dways without any interest except in he unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it does come , is in more interesting than to-morrow 's ireakfast . Yet for some reason or other re permit this story-telling habit to nvadc and damage our whole social life . : ' he English always criticise this and hink they are absolutely right . To mymind in their social life they give the " funny story " its proper place and room and no more . That is to say ? if ten people draw their chairs in to the dinner table and somebody really has just heard a story and wants to tell it , there is no reason against it . If he says , " Oh , by the way , I heard a good story to-day , " it is just as if he said , " Oh , by the way , I heard a piece of news about John Smith . " It is quite admissible as conversation . But he does n't sit down to try to think , along with nine other rival thinkers , of all the stories that he had heard , and that makes all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in liking to tell and hear stories . But they have their own line . They like the stories to be grim , dealing in a jocose way with death and funerals . The story begins ( will the reader kindly turn it into Scotch pronunciation for himself ) , " There was a Sandy MacDonald had died and the wife had the body all laid out for burial and dressed up very fine in his best suit , " etc . Now for me that beginning is enough . To me that is not a story , but a tragedy . I am so sorry for Mrs. MacDonald that I ca n't think of anything else . But I think the explanation is that the Scotch are essentially such a devout people and live so closely within the shadow of death itself that they may without irreverence or pain jest where our lips would falter . Or else , perhaps they do n't care a cuss whether Sandy MacDonald died or not . Take it either way But I am tired of talking of our faults . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English . In the first place , and as a minor matter of form , I think that English humor suffers from the tolerance afforded to the pun . For some reason English people find puns funny . We do n't . Here and there , no doubt , a pun may be made that for some exceptional reason becomes a matter of genuine wit . But the great mass of the English puns that disfigure the press every week are mere pointless verbalisms that to the Amerjean mind cause nothing but weariness . But even worse than the use of puns is the peculiar pedantry , not to say priggishness , that haunts the English expression of humor . To make a mistake in a Latin quotation or to stick on a wrong ending to a Latin word is not really an amusing thing . To an ancient Roman , perhaps , it might be . But then we are not ancient Romans ; indeed , I imagine that if an ancient Roman could be resurrected , all the Latin that any of our classical scholars can command would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Channel steamer . Yet one finds even the immortal Punch citing recently as a very funny thing a newspaper misquotation of " urbis et orbis " instead of " urbi et arbor , " or the other way round . I forget which . Perhaps there was some further point in it that I did n't see , but , anyway , it was n't funny . Neither is it funny if a person , instead of saying Archimedes , says Arehimeeds ; why should n't it have been Arehimeecls ? The English scale of values in these things is all wrong . Very few Englishmen can pronounce Chicago properly and they think nothing of that . But if a person mispronounces the name of a Greek village of what 0 . Henry called " The Year B.C. " it is supposed to be excruciatingly funny . I think in reality that this is only a part of the overdone scholarship that haunts so much of English writing ? not the best of it , but a lot of it . It is too full of allusions and indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer finds it hard to say a plain thing in a plain way . He is too anxious to show in every sentence what a fine scholar he is . He carries in his mind an accumulated treasure of quotations , allusions , and scraps and tags of history , and into this , like Jack Homer , he must needs " stick in his thumb and pull out a plum . " Instead of saying , " It is a fine morning , " he prefers to write , " This is a day of which one mightsay with the melancholy Jacques , it is a fine morning . " Hence it is that many plain American readers find English humor " highbrow . " Just as the English are apt to find our humor " slangy " and " cheap , " so we find theirs academic and heavy . But the difference , after all , is of far less moment than might be supposed . It lies only on the surface . Fundamentally , as I said in starting , the humor of the two peoples is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One final judgment , however , might with due caution be hazarded . I do not think that , on the whole , the English are quite as fond of humor as we are . I mean they arc not so willing to welcome at all times the humorous point of view as we are in America . The English are a serious people with many serious things to think of ? football , horse racing , dogs , fish , and many other concerns that demand much national thought ; they have so many national preoccupations of this kind that they have less need for jokes than we have . They have higher things to talk about , whereas on our side of the water , except when the World Series is being played , we have few , if any , truly national topics . And yet I know that many people in England would exactly reverse this last judgment and say that the Americans are a desperately serious people . Thai in a sense is true . Any American whc takes up with an idea such as Ness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " uplift " of the kint becomes desperately lopsided in his seri ousness . And as a very large number o : us either cultivate New Thought , a practice breathing exercises , or eat saw dust , no doubt the English visitors thinl us a desperate lot . Anyway , it 's an ill business to criticiz another people 's shortcomings . What said at the start was that the British ar just as humorous as are the American or the Canadians or any of us across th Atlantic . And for greater certainty repeat it at the end .
