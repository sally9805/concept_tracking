" Sisters Wow in Tab " The Cold , Commercial Chatter of the Amusement Business <P> How many doctors read Printers ' Ink ? How many brokers ever peruse The Casket ? How many barbers devote their spare time to India Rubber Review ? Or actors to The Iron Age ? <P> Yet all these periodicals are very interesting-even more fascinating , perhaps , for an occasional reading , to the layman than to the professional whom they more directly concern . Curious words-odd advertisements-the plots for a hundred stories are in them for the taking . And the theatrical weeklies are among the most interesting of them all . <P> Variety , The Billboard , The Clipper , Zit 's Weekly-the average citizen not in " the profession " who stumbles upon one or more of these stumbles at once into a new and diverting world . A world where the verb " to wow " means unqualified success , where " sisters " are seldom if ever related , where a " tab " is not what old Mr. Webster said it was , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the circus freaks come from ? The Billboard will tell you . " WANTED for 20-in-l-FREAKS . At all times . Glass- Blower , Sword Swallower , Fat Woman , Punch and Judy , Tattooed Lady . " <P> Some lonely sword-swallower will be happy when he sees that advertisement ! " Wanted , " again , " lady who has had experience in Iron Jaw . " <P> Ladies , step up ! <P> More , by studying such columns you can buy a Wire-Walking Male Dog , a Live Alligator , a Carrousel , the Lord 's Prayer on a Pinhead , a Two-Headed Child , a Devil 's Bowling Alley . Opportunity plus ! <P> Are you anxious to know " The Inside Stuff on Legit ? " Variety will tell you . Do you happen to want an ant-eater for a pet or to know just exactly what the home folks in Terre Haute are seeing in the way of vaudeville ? The Clipper can quote you a price on one and the entire bill of the other . <P> Or are you more interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other such affairs . Zit 's Weekly will keep you posted on matters town-topical with considerable frankness . And it runs a weekly column of " Greenwich Village Chatter " which every proprietor of a batik tearoom should read . <P> Here are the cold , commercial facts on every play in New York- how much money each made or lost last week-whether you should buy your seats for them at the agency , the box-office or the cut-rate ticket place . Here is the entire , gigantic amusement business of America , seen from within-births , marriages , divorces , deaths-its laughter and sorrows-its successes and failures-down in print .
