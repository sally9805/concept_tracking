A result of last week 's political convulsion in Republican Illinois ( see p. 11 ) was the acquisition of 49 of his home State 's 61 delegates by Candidate Lowden . Other victories in the Midwest having brought the Lowden delegates to a total of 183 , Clarence F. Buck , the Lowden impresario , announced that Mr. Lowden would be nominated at Kansas City on the fourth ballot . <P> To this statement Impresario James W. Good of Hooverism gently replied : " Every indication points to Mr. Hoover 's nomination on the first or second ballot . " <P> Men who like Hooverism little better than Lowdenism were saying , last week , that Uninstruction and Coolidge-Anyway controlled between 200 and 300 delegates ; that other claims were exaggerated ; that the nomination was in nobody 's bag unless , as Vermont last week said it hoped , in President Coolidge's.
