San Francisco 's huge-domed Temple Emanu-El is a bright Byzantine touch on Arguello Boulevard . The coruscant half-globe catches the sun 's rays , seems to blaze with its own light . On an especially sunny day , last week , when the dome was very bright 600 Jews of the " reformed " faith gathered underneath it . One of them , glancing at the synagog , quoted " How beautiful are thy tents , O Jacob ; thy dwelling places , O Israel . " Thus opened the 31st Council of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations . <P> Soon the synagog echoed with prayers , speeches , music . From 60 voices rang the triumph of Felix Mendelssohn 's Elijah* The speeches had to do with various aspects of Judaism , youth , science . <P> Said Rabbi James G. Heller of Cincinnati : " Let the behaviorist and psychoanalyst beware . They may be able to use science for the dissection and description of matter , but they can not use it to tell men why to live or how to live . Freud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming influence of Newtonian physics . That is of the past and of the past their conclusions based upon it will also be . " <P> Said onetime ( 1913-16 ) U. S. Ambassador to Turkey Henry Morgenthau : " The Jew is going to be judged not by his commercial or other financial successes but by what we contribute to the spiritual welfare of the world . If we do not respect one another none will respect us . For real advancement we need more colleges . " <P> It was about colleges that most of the delegates were thinking , particularly about Hebrew Union College , U. S. Judaism 's Reformed rabbinical institute in Cincinnati . + <P> As most religious conferences slowly work up to a climax so last week did this one in San Francisco . The climax came when Adolph S. Ochs , owner-publisher of the New York Times read his report on the $5,000,000 endowment fund for Hebrew Union College . Impressive was the list of names and donations which Mr. Ochs read . From David , Murry , Solomon and Simon Guggenheim , $500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. and Mrs. Felix Warburg , $500,000 ; from Julius Rosenwald $500,000 if the fund reaches $4,000,000 by July 1 . Other gifts were from New York 's Lieutenant-Governor Herbert H. Lehman ; from Simon Lazarus , Benjamin Altheimer . . . . Mr. Ochs , modest , had no intention of mentioning his own gift but Chairman of the Executive Committee Ludwig Vogelstein interrupted , announced an Ochs gift of $200,000 . <P> As the names and donations were read , the 600 people in the temple became excited , enthusiastic . Soon they were calling out pledges . By the time Mr. Ochs finished his report , $65,000 more had been added to the fund . <P> In 1873 Dr. Isaac Mayer Wise called the first council of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in Cincinnati . Its prime purpose was to found Hebrew Union College . Two years later , with a faculty of two , and 16 students , the college started . The library consisted of a few Bibles .
