Cross-examination of the two doctors , Dr. Hugh T. Patrick and Dr. Archibald Church , Chicago psychiatrists , occupied virtually the entire day , Dr. Church 's direct testimony taking only a few minutes . The proceedings were enlivened by a heated three-cornered clash between , Dr. Church , Clarence S. Darrow , chief of defense counsel , and Robert E. Crowe . State 's Attorney , curtailed only ' when Judge - John R. Caverly ordered a five-minute recess . Mr. Darrow was questioning Dr. Church as to the guise under which he I had approached the youths . Dr. Church had asserted that he had been introduced to the youths as a doctor and that the purpose of his visit was explained to them . " Now , is n't it a fact that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence on which they could be hanged ? " Mr. Darrow Inquired . " You know that Is n't true , Mr. Darrow , " lie said , heatedly , shaking his finger at the defense attorney . Mr. Crowe wa. ; on his feet shouting for the doctor to continue his reply , while at the same time Mr. Darrow , uttered an apology and requested the question be stricken from the record as " an inadvertence . " Judge Caverly added his calm voice to the uproar with an announcement of a recess , with Mr. Darrow and the prosecutor exchanging final verbal thrusts . 1 Agrees . Glands Affect Conduct . Forty minutes of questioning Paved , the way for the defense 's first attack upon the conclusions of the State 's men- , tal pathologists . Conditions In the State Attorney 's office , where Leopold and Loeb were examined soon after their arrest , the number of persons pies ent and the lack of acquaintance of the I doctors with the youths ' background I were brought out . " Did you ever in your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances ? " asked Benjamin Bachrach of defense counsel of Dr. Patrick . " I think not , " replied the psychiatrist . Virtually the same question was asked later of Dr. Church by Mr. Darrow and gained approximately the same re . sponse . " Too many persons were present for an ideal examination , " and " really there were very few questions asked , " were replies by Dr. Church . Dr. Church agreed with defense alien- ists that the endocrine glands have an influence on human conduct . Part of the defense 's plea for penitentiary sentences instead of hanging for Leopold and Loeb is based on the theory that functional disorders of the endocrines has helped to make them mentally sick . Dr. Church qualified as an expert on endocrinology , saying he thought he had reported the first case . Under careful cross-examination by Mr. Darrow , Dr. Church admitted that the present ages of Loeb and Leopold are within the " trying period of a young man 's life . " and that no doctor nor teacher could examine youths of their age without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abnormal . The State alienist further agreed with the presentation of the defense alienists ' claims of mental sickness in the youths by an admission that if Loeb 's phantasy of being a detective had lasted from childhood into young manhood it would be " abnormal , " it being another Part of the defense 's plea that childish phantasies continuing as evil influences affected their . years after adolescence . " Phantasies modify conduct when carried on into older life and the individual tries to live up to them , " said Dr. Church . but he drew a strict line between phantasies , or " day dreams , " and delusions . Dr , Church Was excused from the witness stand with a final question as to who had retained him to act for the prosecution . As in the instance of Dr. Patrick . who testified yesterday , he was Paid a daily fee of $230 .

When t Dr. Patrick took the stand for cross-examination , Mr. Bachrach brought up the subject of the doctor 's twenty-minute conversation with Leopold upon which conclusions as to sanity were based . - There was some conversation about the psychology of man , of animals and human behavior , and the question of where instinct ceased and reason began , and how each was controlled . ' said the doctor . " I do n't think there was any particular subject ' outside that range . He selected the subjects . " . s " Did you regard that conversation as a part of your examination ? " and " Did you consider the situation well adapted for your purposes ? " were questions asked by Mr. Bachraoh . Dr. Patrick gave affirmative replies . Leopold Coot During Test . " I was not paying any attention to other things and apparently Leopold was not , " said the doctor . " Leopold did not seem at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his notes , Dr. Patrick continued : " Leopold was responsive , although very . inaccessible . Emotionally normal in discussion . Seemed quite susceptible to flattery . " " Mostly , I listened . " said Dr. Patrick , in reference to his conversation with Leopold . The questioning took up the statement that more than fifteen persons were present when Dr. Patrick examined Leopold . " Did you ever in your life make an examination as to a mental condition under such conditions ? " asked Mr. Bachrach . " I thin , c not , " replied Dr. Patrick . Then , after the .. doctor repeated the story of the crime as Leopold : recited it , the question of motive came up . " Mr. Crowe asked Leopold if money had anything to do with it , " said the witness , " and both Loeb and Leopold said it was part of the plan . " Dr. Patrick said he did not hear anything said about the " perfect crime , " but that that idea was present during his conversation with the youths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Patrick read : " AftersLeopold had finished his luncheon he took a little bottle from his pocket and put Its coutents in the glass of water and drank it . It was significant for me to note that his hand was very steady . ' " Mr. Loeb , in reply to one of the questions as to the motive , said ' It was donel in a spirit of adventure . ' " " Did Leopold appear to be anything but frank in his statements to you ? " asked Mr. Bachrach . " There was not any obvious evidence of his lying . It looked to me as if they were telling the story right in the main . Of course , . I could not tell whether there was anything other than the truth . But I do n't think there was anything misleading . Might be , of course , I do n't know . I have the same conclusions about Loeb . " " Did you get the impression from anything Loeb said or . that occasion that he was trying to make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Mr. Baehrach . " Oh , no , " Dr. Patrick said . " Was there . any evidence shown you that either of the boys were mentally diseased on May 21 , 1924 ? " asked Mr. Bachrach . " No , sir , " was the response . Wrangle Over " Intent to Hang . " Dr. Church resumed the stand and in reply to direct examination reiterated his finding of no evidence of mental disease in Leopold and Loeb . Then Mr. Darrow began the cross-examination which led to the question whether the doctor had gone to the boys for any other purpose than an alienist for the State to obtain testimony on which to hang them . His lips quivering , his naturally ruddy countenance redder than ever , and his finger pointed shakingly at Mr. Darrow , the doctor managed to get , out : " Now , Mr. Darrow , you know that was not true , " before Mr. Crowe was on his feet with a loud objection . " Let him answer , let him answer ! " Mr , Crewe shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question with an apology and Judge Caverly ' ordered it stricken out . ' He asked a question ' and saw the . answer was going to hurt him , " Mr. Crowe- said in reference to Darrow " You know I do n't play tricks , " hurled back Mr. Darrow . " I inadvertently used the word , and I have had it stricken out . " " You have played plenty of tricks , " Mr. ' Crowe got in before Judge Caverly directed the recess to permit tempers to cool . Leopold and Loeb enjoyed the wrangle thoroughly , laughing as their chief counsel and the man accused of the intention to have them hanged wordily battled . When cross-examination was resumed Dr. Church admitted that too many persons were in the room " for an ideal conversation " when he examined Loeb and Leopold , and continued : ' I asked Leopold why he committed such a crime and he replied : ' I do n't know why in the world I did it . ' I asked Leopold if he did not know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he knew the criminal nature of what he was doing and he said he did . " Youths Lived Near the Expert . " You never saw either of these two before and you have never seen them again until you came into court to testify ? " asked Mr. Darrow . The doctor replied that they lived in his neighborhood , but that the little he had seen of them did not enter into his opinion . " Did you ask any questions in an effort to find any mental disease ? " pursued the defense attorney . " No , " said . Dr. Church . " Did any one else ? " was then asked , " Well , all the questions and conversations were for the purpose , so far as I was concerned , of determining their mental status , " said the doctor . " Did you find any lack of emotion in either of them ? " was asked . " There seemed to be a distinct lack of emotion on the part of Leopold , but there was some display of emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leopold said he did not have any remorse , but that Loeb did have some repugnance when he came to pour the acid over the Franks boy 's face . " Leopold said he could not have done the crime . ' When it came to_the the striking of the blows , Leopold said earnestly he would be incapable of hitting anybody over the head . It was beyond his capacity , he said . " Did you see anything in the manifestations of the youths which were not intellectual ? " asked Mr. Darrow , " No ' , sir , " was the reply .
