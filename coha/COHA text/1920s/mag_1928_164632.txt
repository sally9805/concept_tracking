The Soviet Bureau of Foreign Concessions announced at Moscow last week the amicable termination after three years of the 22 year manganese concession let to W. A. Harriman &; Co. , Inc. , of Manhattan . ( TIME , June 22 , 1925 . ) <P> The capital sum of $3,500,000 spent by the concessionaires will now be regarded as a loan , it was announced , and will be repaid as such by the Soviet Government . Thus would seem to end the largest incursion of U.S. business into Soviet Russia , an incursion from which profits of $120,000,000 were once prophesied .
