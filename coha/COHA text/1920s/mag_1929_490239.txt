comes these autumn twilights comes the return of the old men-ace . The cocktail hour is Wo-man 's hour , and she snakes the most of it . Freshly gowned , holding a tinkling silver shaker , she is at her best ; while Man , the unspeakable dolt , having been at work all day , is at his worst and dullest . It is no wonder he takes what is handed him , which usually is a mixture of gin and the nearest fruit juice  --  almost any juice the lady hap-pens to have laid her hands on and mixed in almost any proportions she happens to have hit upon in the confu-sion of the moment . ( Women are always pleasantly confused just at dusk . ) This twilight potion is quite deadly . It is sweet , because women do n't like dry cocktails ; and it is apt to be strong , to keep pace with the gathering darkness . Man , a little tired and sometimes a little bored , has no alternative ; he obediently drinks up . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thrall of the hostess and the victim of Night with its terrors . The old sober days of public bars had their advantages  --  before liquor was brought into the home and taken over by Woman , who does n't quite know what it is all about . UITE our favorite correspondent V is the Consolidated Gas Company . We received a bill from them the other day , which we sent back unpaid because it was wrong . It was for supplying gas to an apartment weno longer occupy , so we simply wrote on the bill : " Pull yourself together ? I vacated that medieval old but on October 1 . " Yesterday , we received the following reply : " Dear Sir : Your recent letter addressed to this office is hereby acknowledged , and is receiving our prompt and careful attention . " TN a circular describing that new I combination phonograph and alarm clock we find this disquieting phrase : " Now one can be jazzed out of bed in the morning . " Frankly , we have seen it coming . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every block , have imposed a fox-trot tempo , momentary but exasperating , on our passing feet ; we have been jazzed to sleep through the courtesy of our neighbors and the American Tobacco Company ; a maniacal boop-a-doop persisting into our dreams , syncopating them . Now we are to be jazzed out of bed . Out of bed and into the psychopathic ward . It is the beginning of the  --  vo-do-deodo  --  end . STEPPING back from the age of jazz we paused a moment the other day before some Lucas Cranachs in the Van Diemen Gallery in Fifty-seventh Street and our fancy was caught particularly by a St. Jerome shown in the full tradition  --  in a sixteenth-century German study with beasts and beasties wild and tame beside him , the lion atpeace with the hind . There were not only these two creatures but a poll parrot cocking its eyes at the rest , a squirrel , a rabbit , a covey of what are undoubtedly partridges right under the peacefully sniffing nose of the lion , and what might be a woodchuck or badger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardinal  --  it is really all the portrait of Cardinal Albrecht  --  and when Cranach painted it in 1526 he added for good measure his signature device , a flying dragon . Somehow or other it tickled us to note from the catalogue that this happy family is owned and was lent for exhibition by John Ring-ling , the circus man . We feel as if old Cranach would like to know that . WE once seriously considered pur-chasing the Leviathan when it was on sale . Somehow we never went through with it . Now we see by the papers that the government is going to sell three obsolete cruisers at public auction . One of these would suit our needs even better than the Leviathan . We suspect it would be a lot of fun to own a battleship , be it ever so obsolete . It would holster our ego . How pleasant to overhear young ladies whispering : " Not the Mr. Tilley who has the battleship ? " Pleasant , and advantageous socially . It would he pleasant , too , to make use of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy . We would like to come on a sham battle on a foggy day and sneak in with our cruiser to participate , first on one side then on the other , annoying admirals , confusing the issue . It may not be too late . About how much would a battleship he ? Train in the Sky WHEN the plane fell into Sixty- fourth Street we were over at Teterboro Field about to step into the biggest heavier-than-air ship in America , the monster Fokker . It can carry thirty-five people . A tri-motored Ford , once considered pretty large , stood nearby , looking tiny . The more than thirty persons about to go up heard of the accident in Manhattan while the four motors of the giant roared like the end the world . They took it calmly and were talking about the market when they climbed in . It is a proof of where air-mindedness has got to ; also market-mindedness . The women passengers exclaimed over the interior of the plane . Well they might . It is a big step forward . The thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riviera . There are four compartments , each done in a different color , nice plush chairs to sit on , pictures on the wall , lounges , a cloakroom . You can take twenty or more good hearty strides up the aisle . You could even lose people in the plane . The engineroom  --  it 's too big and elaborate to be called a cockpit  --  has enough space , under the controls , for eight or ten stowaways . Everything in it is painted green , the bars and levers , and the twisting stairs the pilot must climb to get to his seat . When he gut tip there and looked down to see if everyone was seated , his helmeted head absorbed some of the green and he looked like a figure from Mars running one of those impossible ships you read about in Scientific Horror Tales and such magazines . He took the monster off the ground as unconcernedly as though he were piloting an electric engine out of the Grand Central . At one thousand feet the assistant pilot , also in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folded newspaper for him to see , and pointed to something on the market page . They both grinned and shook hands . Fifteen minutes afterward we were over the city , over the place where theother plane had fallen an hour earlier , but too high to see much of the fuss that was going on around the infinitesimal Whalen on the roof . These thirty-five-passenger planes are being built as fast as they can build them for a western passenger line  --  west of Kansas City . They 're away ahead of the East in air travel out there ; in fact they arc threatening to give some railroads a run for their money . As far as we were concerned we found the air coach more comfortable than a Pullman , and it rode as staunchly as a steamboat . Each one costs about a hundred thousand dollars . The Motorist WE have the usual motorist 's anec- dote . It is about a traffic cop on Riverside Drive who caught a small sedan sneaking past a red light . He blew a blast on his whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the curb , and went down to thrash the matter out . He came back to his post a minute later looking pretty much up in the air . Someone asked him , what was the matter . " Matter ? " he retorted . " There 's an old guy , see , about ninety years old in the car . So first off he tells me he did n't notice the light because he do n't see so good any more  --  and then when I tell him why do n't he go get some glasses , I ca n't make him hear me ! " Bent Lights IFyou have ever stood and watched them make Lucky Strikes in the store at Broadway and Forty-fifth Street , you must have noticed the brass rail which prevents crowds from pushing against the corner window . This window has a very special kind of glass , known simply enough as just what it is ? " bent gla . " It bends from the Broadway side of the store around to the Forty-fifth Street side , which is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The making of this window was quietly turned down by every glass company in America , as too delicate a business . Finally a devil-may-care French concern took the contract  --  with the condition that at least three such panes be ordered . So three were . The original one , put in place when the store was first opened , cracked when it was set up . It was thought to be safe , however , if peo- ple could be kept from leaning against it , ? and the brass rail was put up to protect it . Recently a certain amount of settling of the building caused the fear that the cracked window would break entirely , so one of the two sound panes kept in storage was substituted . This delicate operation took place one Sunday morning , from two to eight o'clock , and was fun to watch but not fun to do . The six men who made the exchange were not just ordinary glaziers . Every one was a foreman of glazier crews , the most expert that could be mustered . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , only one other pane will he left and after that is used , there wo n't be any more . The French company wo n't make any more because breakage in making these was too high  --  they broke by dozens . No insurance company would insure the windows . Each one cost twenty-eight hundred dollars ? but then the rent of the shop is eighty thousand dollars a year . Another interesting window around town is that , or rather those , in the John Ward shoe store in Fifth Avenue . You will have noticed the big circular show window there  --  a dome-like affair that sits in the middle of the en trance-way . It 's made of four pieces of bent glass , clipped together with silver clamps . The whole thing can he lowered down into the basement , where the display is changed . ( Once this change was made in ninety seconds , if that interests you . ) This big glass dome might distract your attention from the window-light just in back of it , of which Ward 's is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec that this other glass is also bent . In gold letters on the window appears this statement : " This is the largest light of bent glass in the world . " The Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company made it , even though it turned down the Lucky contract . While the Ward pane is larger , it does n't bend nearly as much , and hence was n't so risky to make . The plate-glass bill for this Ward 's store was fifty thousand dollars . There is a curious story which explains why the entrance-ways to Ward stores are so irregular in shape . In the early days , one of the executives was looking out of the window of one of the stores at a man who was musing upon the shoe displays . As the executive watched , a drunken fellow came along , jostled the window shopper , and so disconcerted him that he hurried away instead of coming in and buying . From this arose the idea of having en trance-ways with curious angles and turns in which a gentleman could hide from drunks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barber shop in the French Building the bibs they tuck around customers are embroidered with red letters . This is traditional , but here the letters are in reverse . Thus the patron , studying himself in the mirror , inevitably reads , all the time he is in the chair , " French Building Barber Shop . " Even the crafts are getting subtler . Plans and Whispers THE new Museum of Modern Art , temporarily housed in the Heck-seller Building  --  what , you have n't heard of it ? Well , the plans for it were announced this summer , probably while you were away . The gallery is endowed by various wealthy people , and the idea is to purchase paintings by living artists , paintings which , if proved worthy by time , will go finally to the Metropolitan . A man who keeps his ear to the ground tells us , however . that that is n't really the true plan at all . He says that the Metropolitan , assuming it were interested in contemporary works , would not he flattered by the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern gold from the modern dross . Our man says that the Modern Museum , after four or five years of collecting contemporary paintings , by which time it will have become a very important galle r y indeed , will be housed in the projected opera centre , as one of its most noteworthy mats . He points out that Mrs. Rockefeller ( wife of the gentleman who bought the opera site ) is prominent among the founders of the Modern Gallery , with a gift of seventy-five thousand dollars , and that , furthermore , a representative of the architect for the Rockefeller development was present at all the meetings held to inaugurate the new Modern Gallery . So there you are . Probably , four or five years from now , you can slip out and look at modern paintings if the opera bores you . Or you can go home . Glass Pants PROBABLY you 've heard about it , but a prominent businessman of Bay Ridge , Brooklyn , called on a monument-maker and said he wanted to order a tombstone . " I vant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glass pents ! " exclaimed the monument man . " Glass pents , " reiterated his eall cr . The tombstone man said he would n't know how to go about putting glass pants on a headstone . " It 's easy , " said his visitor impatiently , " lookitl " He held his hands up before his face and joined them in a handclasp . " Glass pents , " he said again . Cotuits ONCE we gave out a general summary of the oyster situation , indicating broadly how to tell one from another . Now we are enabled to go more into detail , especially about one kind , the Cotuits . New Yorkers rarely get a chance to eat them , although the name often figures on menus . They grow only in the waters of Cotuit Bay , on Cape Cod : the output is small , and the cost of shipping high . Consequently , only the best places serve real Cotuits ; the others call Long Island oysters Cotuits and let it go at that . Only connoisseurs would know the differ-ence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other oyster has . The reasons are many , and a little bewildering , but one is that Cotuit Bay has a sandy bot-tom , instead of a rock floor like most oyster beds . Because of this , . omehow , the Cotuits r e vegetable matter ? seaweed and so on  --  mixed in with their food , which has the same healthful effect t h at spinach has on humans . Another thing is that Cotuit Bay is fed by a number of fresh-water brooks and streams . This makes its waters , and hence its oysters , less salty . Because of the sandy bottoms , however , the oysters can not be bred in the Bay itself . They are taken elsewhere to breed , the young being brought hack from the nurseries to be " planted " when old enough . Most oysters get soft and flabby during the summer . It is for this reason that the " R " rule holds good ; in the other months they spoil before they can be eaten . Here again the Cotuits , however , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But so , as our oysterman points nut , can any oyster , in Brooklyn , where the summer months are Jern , Jerly , and Augerst . Hotel Notes THE Piccadilly Hotel phone operator , if you call up there , gives you good morning , or good afternoon  --  or even good evening , thus going Saks-Fifth Avenue one better . The Hotel President slips under the door of its out-of-town guests , every morning , a copy of their home-town paper , but will cease the practice if protest is made . Baldy FROM Philadelphia an obliging man sends us news of Baldy Jack Rose , about whom a fellow-contributor was recently wondering . The gentleman says Baldy lives in a bungalow colony in the suburbs of Philadelphia . He says he ran into him there one night at a fire . A row of bungalows was burning , and Mr. Rose , his sleek dome agleam in the firelight , distinguished himself by neglecting his own blazing dwelling in order to haul furniture out of one of the others to oblige a lady . Further report is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he attends the theatre , however , he does not take his seat . That remains empty and he stands at the rear of the house , his back firmly planted against the wall  --  as though even at this late date he had a superstition about having too many people behind him . Anyway , it 's interesting to know that the man who sent Charles Becker and four gunmen to the chair is a Philadelphia suburbanite . Total Strangers THE crescendo of life in New York bothers little old ladies , whose thoughts go hack to the quieter movements of earlier decades . Nowadays , even the curb in front of one 's house is trespassed upon . Vie saw a little old lady come out of her house the other morning to remonstrate with a motorist who had parked in front of her door . She wished , she said , that he would not park there ; it made it so inconvenient when she had callers . She had to keep watching all the time . She had always been bothered that way . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before used to tic their horses right in front of my door . Now it 's automobiles . All these cars " ? she made a forlorn little gesture ? " belong to total strangers ! " Tanbark and Art A - the moment of writing Mr. Ringling is out in Indiana inspecting the stock and equipment of several of his circuses and blocking out next year 's routes . just as soon as that is done he will centre all his attention on preparations for the opening of his great museum at Sarasota , Florida , about the first of the year . This will be an event of major importance , for it will bring together for the first time his entire art collection , hundreds of paintings acquired during the past twenty years at a cost of twelve million dollars . He has , among other things , the best collection of Primitives in the world ; it is even ahead of the one at the Metropolitan Museum . Now the paintings arc widely scattered . Some ninety examples of medieval masters arc THE NEW YORKER 21 stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zurich , on loan to an international show . Several other groups are here and there over the country being exhibited , mostly for charity . Within two months , however , they will all be together at Sarasota . The museum building itself is about ready . It was put together from pieces of old Italian villas , castles , and other landmarks noted for their antiquity , which Ringling bought up shortly after the war . The circus man has ambitious plans for an art school in Florida and hopes to bring to it the best teachers of Europe . He has invited art experts from all over the world to attend the opening of the museum . When all the Ringling brothers were alive , John was the one who had to look after the circus posters . This led to his interest in art . He was disturbed because the lithographers could n't print really good likenesses of animals on their posters . Tracing the trouble to its source , he found that the artists invariably knew little about animals . Ringling began to buy good paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clues to these through art books . Art , and books on it , soon became his hobby . His collection of books on art now is one of the most complete extant . It will comprise the library at the Sarasota school . The circuses owned by Ringling now number ten and these are still the great thrill of his life . He never tires of seeing the man shot from the cannon , or Goliath , the sea elephant . An item in a weekly paper saying that Goliath had died caused him great anguish until he got word from his winter headquarters that it was n't true . Goliath was down South , and well , eating barrels of fresh fish daily . Goliath has an understudy , incidentally , but he has n't had to go on yet . Last summer there were few circus parades . This year there will be none . They have passed from American life . The principal reason is the difficulty of vetting the right kind of horses to pull the wagons , and you ca n't have a circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always wanted to know  --  what causes the hollow , clucking sound made by the circus wagons as they rumble along . Well , a circus wagon has to be made without washers on the hubs to allow for a loose axle . Otherwise the heavy load would cause a hot box . This makes the wheels rattle and produces the old familiar  --  and , alas , all but departed  --  racket . Bench Wit AN attorney tells us that Justice 1 X Dunne of Brooklyn is a wit , citing the following case in point . ( Readily to appreciate it you must bear in mind the name of the Justice  --  Justice Dunne . ) A woman witness was on the stand in some case he was trying and to every question put by the lawyer cross-examining her she came back with a query of her own , " Who , me ? " " Where were you at nine o'clock on the night of . . . etc ? " the lawyer would ask , and she would retort , " Who , me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so ? " " Who , me ? " the lady would demand . This went on for quite a while a n d eventually led to considerable wrangling . One lawyer got purple . Finally the witness announced that she was tired of the whole matteranyway , declaring angrily : " I did n't come here to answer a lot of foolish questions . I came here to see justice done . " The Justice lifted his eyebrows in mock-incredulousness . " Who , me ? " he asked .
