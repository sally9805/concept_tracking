txt Dr. William Norman Guthrie , rector of St. Mark 's - in - the - Bouwerie , whom Bishop Manning summoned before him to explain the the symbolic dances in St. Mark 's in its parish hall , left New York suddenly yesterday morning for " somewhere in New Jersey . " Mrs. Guthrie said that her husband wished to go where he could prepare his Sunday sermon in peace . " It must not be thought that Dr. Guthrie is running away , " said Mrs. Guthrie . " He has naturally been under the greatest strain in the past few days and felt he would have a breakdown unless he could get away . Dr. Guthrie will be back probably late on Saturday night . He is at a very quiet place in New Jersey , a spot which can not be reached by telephone . He always goes there when he seeks rest . " Mrs. Guthrie indicated that the rector was " extremely satisfied " with the outcome of his conference with Bishop Manning at Synod Hall on Thursday afternoon when the Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church programs . A vestry meeting scheduled for this afternoon has been postponed until next week , but it is expected that Dr. Guthrie will make his position clear to his congregation tomorrow morning before he makes his usual address . Neither Side Forced the Issue .. Fresh light was thrown on the Synod Hall conference yesterc ' ? ay by one in close touch with the situation . Though the participants agreed not to reveal to the press what took place , sufficient details have come out to make it plain that neither Bishop Manning nor Dr. Guthrie forced the issue . Supporters of St. Mark 's say that Bishop Manning does not wish to have a split in the ranks of the Episcopal Church at this time when many important projects are in hand . Before the conference Dr. Guthrie was asked by many of his supporters to bring the controversy to a head . Dr. Guthrie was , told that if he cared to raise the question of the legality , from an ecclesiastical point of view , of his activities at St. Mark 's , Dr. Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement from an authoritative source , certain extremists in St. Mark 's are determined not to let the matter rest , but to settle , once for all , Dr. Guthrie 's position . On the other hand , persons In touch with Bishop Manning . declare that the Bishop , if he had wished , could have cc.miemned Dr. Guthrie on canonical gtounds . They point out that on Nov. 2l Dr. Guthrie turned St. Mark 's over to the Bahai for a memorial service , and that he was aware of the fact that Mountford Mills , the senior warden , was connected with the Bahai faith , which , It is declared , is not a Christian organization . Mr. Mills defined his position yesterday . Warden Explains Bahaism . " In the first place , " he said . " I am hctraying no confidence that the Bahai memorial service was not brought up at the conference . I am not even aware that the Bishop knew such a service had taken place . If he did , he evidently preferred to make no reference to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ns of the Protestant Episcopal Church to say whether this memorial war a violation or not . And I could make no definite statement on this print until I have seen Dr. Guthrie after his return from New Jersey . As the matter was not brought up it looks to me as if certain people were fishing in ? troubled waters . " The Bahai was founded in the early ' 70s with the appearance of the Bab . who announced himself as having come to pave the way for the revealer of a new universal faith . Later came the son of the founder . Abdul Baha. from whose name Bahai was taken . " Bahaism practices the Christianity of Jesus Christ . This , it is true , ? may not be the Christianity of modern day theologism. but I can not conceive how the memorial services violated the Episcopal canons . Let me quote the words of the son of the founder of the faith just before he died . He said to me : ' These are the main tenets of the creed ; Jesus was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To know Him was to know God . To love Him was to love God . To obey Him was to obey God . ' " On those principles Bahaism has worked for fifty years , and I defy any broad-minded Christian to find anything unethical in them . I notice today that Dr. Francis Joseph Hall of the General Theological Seminary has had a rev remarks to say on this subject . I will confine myself in answer to say that all he said is mixed up and twisted . There is hardly a correct word in the n-hole of his statement . " Church to Open Art School . Officials of St. Mark 's yesterday announced that the church would open next Wednesday an academy for poor art students of all nationalities and creeds . The academy will be calleg the Leonardo da Vinci School , and will be housed in the old St. Mark 's ' Memorial Chapel founded by Pete .. t ** in 1660 . The Rev. Fortunato G.

" Honorio Ruotolo , a sculptor from Rome , " he said yesterday , " will head the organization with a staff of fifteen Italian artists . all members of the church , who have volunteered their services as instructors . St. Mark 's Church is equipping the mission with studios and classrooms . but the instructors , who will teach without salaries , plan to make the academy self-supporting by installing art and pottery ovens , the products Of which will be exhibited and sold . " Many students have already enrolled to take up sculpture , painting , drawing , architecture , wood-carving , etching . mosaics and pottery .

Besides the classes at the mission the students will be entitled to attend the weekly lectures by poets , sculptors , musician* and artists conducted at St. Mark's-inthe-Rouwerie by men and women nati opfdly known in these fields .
