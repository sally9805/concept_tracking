DIANA-Emil Ludwig-Viking ( $5 ) . <P> Young , intelligent , fatally beautiful , Diana von Wassilko is the kind of girl who gives and goes . In her coolly amorous passage through the social high spots of Europe , she has many calls on her generosity . When the story opens , she has just left one lover , an unripe Viennese poet , after an idyllic two weeks on a Mediterranean island . When her story ends , she has apparently lost her freedom but attained respectability by a morganatic marriage to a Middle-European prince . But between these two points the huntress of men has had good hunting : Diplomat Count Mnsterberg , Millionaire Scherer , simple-minded Wilhelm , Bolshevik Kyril Sergeivitch , English Soldier Felix . <P> In her love-affairs , Diana is rarely the one to suffer ; and Author Ludwig has so arranged matters that her willing victims , though never forgetful , always forgive . Between diversions , Diana is the capable secret agent and business adviser of canny Millionaire Scherer . Only once is she the cause of tragedy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . No introvert , Diana does not often brood ; and when she does , her pessimism is only of the morning after . " To taste of everything just once-in order to be able to despise everything . " In Diana , Author Ludwig has tried to give the ideal of modern emancipated woman : a realistic romantic , he has called her by the name of a goddess . <P> Emil Ludwig is chiefly famed for biographies ( Napoleon , Bismarck , The Son of Man , July ' 14 ) ; Diana is his first novel to be translated into English .
