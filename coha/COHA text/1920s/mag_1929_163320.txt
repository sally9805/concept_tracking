A decade or so ago , Manhattan 's Hippodrome was famed for monster , lustrous theatricals . Visitors swarmed to see such sights as Bandman Sousa , Skater Charlotte , Diver Annette Kellerman , Buffoon Nat Willis and whole menageries of animals in congress on one huge stage . Behind the scenes was Showman R. H. Burnside , purveyor of size rather than taste or wit . <P> Showman Burnside has long since abandoned the Hippodrome to vaudeville , cinema , possible demolition ( TIME , Feb 11 ) . Lately he went to the seaboard 's playground , Atlantic City , N. J. , to institute a new Hippodrome show-house . Last week , in a $15,000,000 auditorium which seats 41,000 , he presented Here and There , a pageant calculated to crowd what is reputedly the world 's largest indoor stage . <P> Featured were oldtime Hippodrome names and numbers , including : Comedian De Wolf Hopper ( appearing as wizard , interlocutor , Mephistopheles , Chinese Mage ) ; Tramp-Comedian Joe Jackson and his disintegrating bicycle ; ballets ( Tiller , Rasch , Lenora ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the tunes were written by Bandman Sousa , including the blaring , brassy march " ' T is the Eagle .
