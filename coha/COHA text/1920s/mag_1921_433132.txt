You will proceed to Ceuilly Woods at once , ascertain the conditions existing upon that front , and report the result of your observations by the quickest available means . By command of NW on GENERAL - , Colonel , General Staff , Chief of Staff . I received the above order within half an hour after reporting for duty as liaison officer for the ? th Division , A.E.F. Brief , to the point , apparently simple of execution , it was the cause of months of the most perfect and unmitigated hell to me . . My automobile , a beautiful Cadillac limousine , was waiting on the street , below the general 's office . I climbed aboard , directing my chauffeur to drive toward the front ? we were then about ten miles behind the infantry lines . On the way , I stopped to pick up two Salvation Army girls , walking laboriously through the mud to their advanced station . About three miles back of the lines , we came to the field artillery , and were met in the road by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit for automobiles . I sent the car back to Division Headquarters , grabbed a side-car , and went on . It was an active sector , and things became interesting very soon . We went on , however , until we reached 738 a camouflaged road . I got out , told tilt driver to wait for me at a town I shored him on my map , and went on afoot , gathering up a lieutenant liaison officer familiar with that section of the front . We walked along the road a hit , lea , ing it at an opening in the camouflage , through which ran an abandoned Boche narrow-gauge railroad . We followed this railroad , picking our way carefully , while listening intently to the occasion al Boche shells that came over , in order to drop on our bellies in case our ears told us the shells were close . At inter . vals we were jolted by our own artillery fire , as the seventy-fives searched for some irritating battery of the enemy . Soon we reached the reserves of our infantry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonel about conditions , and went on , still up the abandoned Boche railroad . We were in the woods , and the railroad was the easiest road to travel . Shells came thicker , and now and than we would drop as fast as our legs would wilt , wait an instant for the crash , get up and go on . Soon the shelling became heavier , and one time I dropped and heard a man laugh at me . I got up and looked back at him . He was without a helmet , a dirty , nonchalant boy , not as bluffed as I had been by the shelling . I looked to the front again , and just as I did so , I heard the most terrifying thing I had ever heard in my life ? the loud , malicious scream of a big shell . I believe that there can be nothing more utterly terrifying than that sound . It is wicked , awful ; it makes one feel cold and sick when it is loud . These shells carry with them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no cseape unless God is good to you and vim are quick enough to get close to the mound before the spray of splintered flies in all directions . This shell was louder than any I had ever heard ? it seemed to be right in front of my fare ; it called its message with a fluttering , whimpering scream that froze me , amiscated me , weakened my legs , made no breathe a most devout , heartfelt : gayer : ' 0 my God , do n't let that hit me ! ' I dropped . I crumpled up . I simply collapsed on the ground . But I did not get there fast enough . As I was falling , the whole world blew up . It is inde.aribable , that crash of sound , so loud one can not hear it . It stuns , it seems to hit you all over at once ? things seem to stop going altogether . Perhaps I was knocked out ; I do n't know . I remember citing to my feet , my head throbbing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to get my balance and stay up . I put my hand to my head in a dazed way , to wipe away from my mind the fogginess that seemed to surround it . Another crash came and knocked me down . Again I got up . The blue layers of smoke were lying all about me , layer on layer , quiet and still , with the trees showing in between . I turned around , and still I saw those horizontal layers of blue smoke . I could n't think , or move away from where I stood . Then , as if it had just happened , I heard a man screaming . He was holding his body with both hands , kneeling on the ground , and screaming in agony . Another and another were lying quietly on the track . Then my eyes rested on what was left of the boy who had laugh-el at me , the blood pumping out of his body like red water from an overturned bucket . Then I realized that the shelling was still going on ? heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many at a time , a perfect din of sound . I fell to the ground , and rolled over and over , off the track into the woods on the side , into a shell-hole , and lay there . My head hurt , my face hurt , my ears and eyes ? I hurt all over . I put my hand to my face where it scented to burn , and found it was covered with blood . I thought how messy it would make my trench-coat , and wondered whether a dry cleaner could get blood out of a fur collar . I lay there in that hole until the barrage lifted a bit ? it was a six-inch barrage : the Boehe was covering our approaches , which he knew all too well , since we had just pushed him out of that same area the day before . He knew that track very well , and exactly where it was . I went on to the front , slowly feeling my way , until I got to the lines . There were no trenches , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugging the ground until they went forward a few yards more , only to hug the ground again . At a field-telephone , a bit later , I telephoned back what information I had , and started to return . It took me all the rest of the day to get back to a dressing-station , where I was sewed up . That night I investigated the rest of that immediate sector , found my sidecar , and went back to the division , hugging the right of the road , with no lights of any kind , meeting ammunition-trains lumbering up on the other side , big spectres in the night , noisily making their way to the lines with their load of the iron ration . At times a shell would whinney and flutter ? and crash to our right or left . It was a wild ride . Early in the morning we reached headquarters , and I breakfasted with the general and his staff . Jokes were cracked at my hurt face , and I was congratulated on having won a wound-stripe . The Armistice came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command a field-artillery , regiment that was to march into Germany . I was glad , as I wanted to make that historic trip . But I wished to high heaven that my head would quit aching . We got ready for the march in , gathering horses here and there , resting our men , sprucing up all we could under the circumstances , hating the quiet and inactivity of it all , wishing we could go home for a week or so , talking about the past already . And still I wished to high heaven that my head would stop its ache , its throb , its feeling as if it were in a vise . Then our orders came , and in we went . Through miles of horribly devastated France , past miles on miles of barbed-wire entanglements , over roads full of shell-holes , past utterly ruined towns . And then into beautiful Luxemburg , with fields of grain , wonderful forests ; through quaint towns , and then to Luxemburg City , where , as I rode at the head of my regiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feet ? flags waving from the windows , people cheering , until my heart came into my throat and tears to my eyes , and I realized that never in my life again would I feel as I did then . And always my head ached and throbbed , always I wished to high heaven it would some time stop . The regimental surgeon began to dope me . Every night he would stick somethine , into me , or give me something to drink , feel my pulse , chat a while . Next morning he would stop in and ask how I slept , and sometimes how I ate . I did n't sleep , I could n't eat . And always the ache . And then that dream ! It would wake me up in a sweat . Every now and then I would hear that fluttering , whimpering squeal , ? and then I would see myself lying on the ground with my face gone ? and the blood pumping itself out of the pieces of the boy who had laughed at me . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no appetite ? and always that damnable ache , and throb , and the vise would squeeze my head . Food became more scarce , transportation was not adequate , the &chi; was moving fast , and we must keep up to him . My horses had been gassed from grazing in gassed areas back of the front ; they had not had sufficient nourishment , and were weak . My men were very weary . One time we were told that the next day 's march was forty-two miles . It almost broke my heart to make the regiment turn out at 4 A.M. , and march those forty-two long miles . Horses died , men were evacuated to the hospitals , and between nine and ten that night we staggered into our billets , almost all in . And the hill we climbed that day ? what a pull for those horses ! I love horses , and as I rode up that hill , I thought of how little these drafted men knew of driving a six-litre team up a hill with a jack-knife turn ar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that there was road-mum between the carriages , and personally drove every gun-carriage around that turn . There were only three men in the regiment who knew how to keep sin horses in draft around a turn like that . The two majors knew , one a West Poinier , the other an old-type field-artiller ? first sergeant . I was the other one . took six hours to get the two miles of regiment over the top of that hill . Then got there , though . Across the river into Germany ! How I do remember that day . From the laughter , the waving flags , the happy children strewing flowers in Luxemburg , into Germany ? silent , sullen Germany . The women turned their backs : the children clung to their mothers skirts , and stared , or scampered into the house , looking backward as they ran . HOW quiet it all was ! How sullenly antagonistic ! My men joked and kidded each other about the way the girls tinned their backs , and comments were made on how that would all change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did change , too , almost overnight , as if it had been ordered from the German Great Headquarters . Then we were treated well , almost as guests . The sullenness vanished , to be replaced by a welcoming hand and offers of food and shelter if we did not have enough . My orderly came to me and said , ' Colonel , we ' ve been fighting the wrong people ! ' It shocked me for a moment and made me think , and has made me think a good deal since ? that remark . I began to learn how many of my men spoke German , how many had been born in Germany , or were of German parentage . I was made military governor of an area , was treated well by my host , the mayor of the town where I made my headquarters . I remember how delicious his Frau 's outing-flannel sheets felt to me at night , after the variety I had been accustomed to at the front . But I could not sleep well at all , nor could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my taking a rest , a few days in the hospital , and so forth , to ease up a bit . And there was more dope in my arcs , or something to drink . But the throb in my head kept on ? and so did the dream . For about three months that continued ; my nerves were getting bad , I was becoming more and more irritable . I was ill , but did not quite know it . I was sent to the hospital , was transferred to another , fainted once , was put to bed . And then things began to fade away at times . They were kind to me there , very kind . I shall always remember the kindness of those nurses and doctors . The next thing I remember I was at Saint-Nazaire , waiting in the hospital for a transport to take me home , with a lot of wounded and sick men . They told me afterward that I acted all right ; but the five weeks intervening between the hospital in Germany and SaintNazaire are a blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across was fine ? did me lots of good . I was looking forward with a great deal of happiness to meeting some dear friends on this side , and subconsciously waiting for the kind welcome they would give me , and the rest and peace that I would have . A wireless came to me from a girl who had written to me a good deal . If only my head would have let up a bit , ? and the nausea have stopped , ? I could have been quite happy . We were met in New York by a reception committee , and handed newspapers . Officers came to me , saying that the men were angry at something and wanted my opinion . I happened to be the senior officer on board and , although on sick-report , was , nevertheless , asked about this thing that bothered the men . After hearing it out , I put it up to the men themselves , and they voted to a man that they did not want to be received by a committee headed by a New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Boche at least would fight ? this man stayed home and did all he could to mess up our work apparently . So I told the committee that the men wanted no reception from them , and they departed . How odd it seemed to me that we should be met by a pro-German at such a time ! As I look back , I remember this as the first of the disappointments which my country had in store for its men from overseas . I was feeling a bit rocky , and dodged the good people who met us . The surgeon , who had been sleeping in the same room with me on the way across , took me to a receiving hospital in New York City . A friend of mine , an officer who had been shell-shocked , was missing , and I asked for him . The surgeon said that he had jumped overboard . Then it dawned upon me why the doctor had slept in my room . I want to give all credit to the wonderful staff of the hospital . The nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness itself , thoughtful , and most considerate . At times in the months to follow there were other bright lights of happiness that shine forth as I look back ; but , in the main , the year that followed was dominated by misery , physical pain , and mental anguish . If I knew that I was doomed to go through that period again , I would not face it . For some reason I shrank from meeting my friends ? and the girl . But after a bit I was allowed to go out , and I called on her . She was apparently glad to see me , and for a while I enjoyed her company ; but some intuition made me feel uncomfortable ? why , I could not tell . Gradually this began to become clearer to me , however , as I came to realize how far apart we were , how different her sheltered life had been on this side , and how utterly impossible it . was for her to appreciate how I felt . I closed up like an oyster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be told . I tried to a few times , only to catch the look of conscious interest ? and again shut up . This was my second disappointment . It surprised me ? it hurt me . The longer I - remained in this country , the more it hurt , until , finally , I became callous to the fact ; for I realized , much against my will , that my friends , my country , spoke a different language ! That thought rang through m , ) brain in the long months that followed ! Back in my own country , back among my friends , among scenes that I loved , th , t meant everything to me , and yet not back at all . I know that I am but repeating a thing that has been told mane times , but the big fact remains , that the quick abandonment of interest in em overseas men by Americans in general is an indictment against us as a nation , not soon to be forgotten by the area in uniform from the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who at this very moment are liv . ing their broken lives in almshouses , jails , insane asylums , and hospitals , or wandering , hopeless , about the streets I wanted relaxation , rest , anything to take my mind away from myself . I wanted to see musical comedies , read light books ; I wanted to laugh and play . These were difficult things to obtain , however . My best friends wanted to see heavier plays ? they wanted to see Nazimova writhe and squirm about the stage ; they wanted to hear Heifetz play exquisite music , over which they raved . Exquisite music , yes , but not the sort to feed to a man who was in dire need of something vastly different . I had friends who were intellectual , who were interested in things of real worth ; but they could not discuss them in the human terms that interested ma In New York drawing rooms I met musicians of international repute , men of letters , of travel , who were interest ? ing to most people and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only bored . Back my mind wandered to France ; and now and then that old dream came back , and I saw the red blood streaming from the ripped , torn body of the boy who had laughed at me . I became more nervous as sleep kept away , and food lost its interest . A party of us drove up the Hudson and spent a few hours at my old Alma Mater , to me the most beautiful spot in America , from which have come so many of our most famous men : the school , founded by George Washington , which gave us Grant , Lee , Sheridan , Sherman , Taylor , Pershing , and many others of international fame in civil as well as military life . There is something chant that school that holds its graduates with a loyalty that exceeds anything I have seen . It was good to be back , but those with whom I was did not understand . They had no realization of the value of such a school to the nation . Somebody remarked that West Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had done us no harm . That grated on me , and I replied that , if I knew anyone who was pro-German at the time , I would most certainly report him to the authorities . ' Would you report me ? ' asked an American woman in the party . ' I most certainly would , ' I answered . ' Well , ' she replied , ' you know my friend Fritz ? is a German , and I have a great deal of sympathy for Germany . ' My comments were a bit sharp , I am afraid , and were apparently distasteful to another member of the party , who mid that I was a coward if I were willing to report to the Secret Service such a friend as the other woman was to me . Things grew disagreeable , but we drove back to New York in peace , though I was warned and tired out . I retired that night exhausted in mind and body , and could not sleep , though the doctor gave me an opiate . That clement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had seen too had felt too much , to be kindly disposed . Besides , it was a distinct shock to learn that my own friends felt so friendly toward those people with respect to whom I felt quite the opposite , bemuse of things I had seen and been through myself . I learned later that that feeling was very prevalent among people calling themselves good Americans . After a bit I was assigned to duty with the General Staff in Washington . My duties began at once ? getting ready for another war . Another war ! I used to sit at my desk in the War Department , thinking it over . Another war ? God , what no thought ! How tinder high heaven it could be that we should prepare for another war was beyond my powers of comprehension . I could not keep my mind on my work , I thought of other things , fumbled with my papers , dreamed and took walks during office-hours , trying to get my mind clear and get away from that damnable ache in my head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the night before . To the Department I was practically useless . Occasionally I went to New York , but had best have stayed away . I met an editor of a newspaper which had as its object the uplift of people ; but I never got to know exactly what he wanted ? he seemed a bit vague himself on that score . I listened to many conversations on the subject of the improvement of the condition of this and that . Then came Germany and the indemnity , and how awful it all was to make poor Germany pay . I went to hear a preacher of the gospel , and was disgusted with his ideas . I heard him address a meeting in Madison Square , attended by hundreds of men and women . As I looked around , I saw not one face that I took to he American ; and as this American preacher remarked that the Bolshevild must succeed , he was cheered to the echo , hats were thrown in the air ? the crowd went mad . I told my companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American uniform ? and left . They came , too , not because they did not sympathize with the speaker , but because they would not stay alone , without the protecting influence of that same uniform . The drive home started in silence , but became a nightmare memory to me . Two women , one an American , one a foreigner of aristocratic birth , began to talk ? and such talk ! Again were my eyes opened very wide , and I was stunned and shocked by the opinions expressed . I was told that America should never have entered the war at all ; that we should have accepted things peacefully ; that , even if the Germans came over here , they would make themselves so hated that they would soon depart whence they came ! I was informed that I should be ashamed of myself for ever going to the front ; that my decorations were a disgrace to wear , as being tokens given to me for killing Germans ! It was a disgrace to be a soldier at all , killing helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that American troops were not accustomed to doing such things . And this too from well-bred women ? intellectuals , so-called . This was the beginning of the end of my association with these people , of whom I had been very fond before I sailed overseas . I reported them to the Secret Service in Washington , and believe that their pernicious activities ceased . The foreigner had taken refuge on our shores from the violence and anarchy which reigned in her own country ; had for three years accepted all that we had to give ? our safety , hos. pitality , music and art , the associations which meant most to her . And yet , in conversation with me one evening , holding her aristocratic arms aloft , shr loudly proclaimed that REvoLutiox was what was needed to cure my Country 's ills ! Some things are beyond comprehension , beyond the power of ha man understanding . IV Back in Washington , we still worked on war , preparing for the next one . I did my best , but one day things broke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was something rahcally wrong . I got to my feet , laughing and feeling silly . I saw little ulna circles chasing each other in front of my eyes . They came slowly into view from nowhere and tumbled from left to right , scurrying along one after another ; and as I looked after them , they hurried on , always from left to right . I turned my head ? and still they rolled over and over , those soft , round things that came out of nothing and fled away just as I turned my head to see where they were hurrying . I grew tense , and laughed . Then I began to play with them as they rolled along from left to right , always just a little ahead of me . I grabbed at them ? and laughed and giggled in my play . I turned my head , but they rolled on , always just a bit ahead . I turned around myself , grabbing at those datenably elusive things that seemed to mock me in this game . And as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of it all I stopped ? there came a noise outside that brought me up sharp . I stopped and listened ? everything was very still for an instant . Then a car-bell rang on the street be . low ; then came steps in the hall outside , and the subdued voices of officers in the next room in a conference . I felt a chill of fear grip me . I locked myself in , sat down , and held on to my desk as things got gray and the ache in my head gave way to a hum , a low chanting hum , like the one that comes when one is just going under an aniesthetic . It required all my will-power to keep conscious then . Many times afterward I used my will to keep control of myself ; but I remember that as the first time , and it left me tired physically , hot all over , and shaking with an intangible fear of a thing not understood . Than a thought came to me , slowly , in a vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear God , I was losing my mind ! I grabbed my head in my hands , closed my eyes to keep away those fooling , fluffy , flying things that came out of nowhere and tumbled off into nowhere again . Things became quiet , I got control , picked up my cap , unlocked the door , and started to leave the office . My secretary met me at the door and laughingly asked me why I had locked her out ? that she had been knocking . I said I would not be back that afternoon . I went as straight as I could go to the attending surgeon , an old friend . In the seclusion of his office I told him my story , and went all to pieces and sobbed like a woman . Pretty soon we were in my ear , and he was driving me to the Walter Reed Hospital , talking to me quietly on the way . Then followed those interminable examinations , day after day , ? blood-tests , eye-tests , ear-tests , balance-tests , every test apparently that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gave me a room to myself . There came interviews with a famous nerve specialist , a man whose grasp of human nature was wonderful ; but he did not know the answer . He advised one thing and then another ; he was kindness itself , and his understanding was remarkable . A man nationally famous , he had given up his practice to help the army in its time of need ? but he had not been ' over there , ' and he did not know . It was this man , whose opinion I valued so highly , whose keen perception was always a source of wonder to me , whose training was all along the line that would lead to a real understanding of my case , who first showed me how utterly alone I was to be in the year that followed . I had been more or less alone before , because everyone seemed to be so incapable of seeing things as I saw them , but my previous feeling was but little , compared to what followed . I wish that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . I wish I could in some way convey to those who laud their men on the other side how perfectly damnable that solitude is to some of those men . I wish more still that I could in some way get it into the minds of all Americans who have not been through it , how dreadfully alone a shell-shocked man can be , even though surrounded by those who love him most . After some weeks I was given more liberty and would drive out to see friends ? but with what result ? Always I met with the same thing , that lack of interest , ? either assumed or real , I do not know , ? and would go back to the hospital and lie on my bed and lose all control of myself , and cry like a baby . Sleep did not come when I seemed most to need it , and food was positively repulsive a great deal of the time . There is no use in going into the details of what followed in the hospital , except that one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have something on their minds , but took some time to get it off . Finally , with the greatest consideration , calmly and with expressions of regret , I was informed that it was their opinion that I had best get my affairs in shape as I would probably not live for more than a month , or at best would be permanently insane . Angry ? When I had heard them out , I was more than that . I seemed to have an insane desire to hurt those men . I called them all the names I could think of ; damned them with as much abuse as I could command . I wanted to break the furniture , to smash anything that came near me . They must have thought me crazy ; perhaps I was , but it was the craziness of a wild rage at anybody who was such a fool as to think I was ready to die . Die ? Why , I would not have died to please those doctors ? and I did n't . The thought has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a purpose . I do n't know ? I have never asked ; but it has occurred to me that perhaps they told me that to bring out all the fight there was in me . If that was their object , I will grant them a hundred per cent of success . That interview was the turning-point in my illness . From that minute I was obsessed with the idea that I would not die ? I was damned if I would die ! The whole object of my life was to show those men what fools they were to think that I was going to die . I remember how I screamed at them in that room , and how they stood there listening to me , watching me , and saying nothing . I screamed and cursed those men until I cried , and slung myself down on my bed , and wore myself out trying to control the hysterical sobs that seemed to shake me all to pieces . I locked my nurse out , but she got in and was good to me and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter of a great matt , giving her time and earnest effort to doing good . I knew her brother , who , himself a shell-shock case , had killed himself after returning from overseas . At my own request I was soon allowed to leave the hospital on a low sick leave , to do whatever I wished . Apparently the doctors had done all they could ? it was up to use . I was mad all through , fighting mad I was simply possessed with the idea that I would not die , that I would shun those doctors what fools they were . In the year that followed , I exhausted everything I could think of that would help me to get well , to get back to where I had been two years before . My constant thought was that I was going to win in some way . It would be tediou , to tell it , except in the most general way , but I want to remind anyone who may read this that that period of eon. tinual , continuous scrap lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one person who spoke my language . With this one exception , I was as alone as if I had been in a deserted world . I went to one friend after another , searching for help , suggestions that would assist me ; but it was like searching for the pot of gold at the rainbow'g end ? it simply was not there . There were those who were sympathetic in thought and in deed , but apparently they did not know how to do anything practical . The one person who knew was the military attache at the French Embassy , a young captain of the French Army . We were chatting in his apartments one day , talking over the past , when it dawned upon us both that we had been through the same terrible thing . It was like finding some precious possession , long mourned as lost , far on to find each other . We clung to each other like blind men left alone . Ile spoke English ? I spoke French ? we both spoke the language of the Front , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exists between two men who have experienced shellfire and suffered the misery of exhausted , shattered nerves known to the world as shell-shock . In the Somme offensive with the battery , he had been filling a sand-bag , when a shell of large calibre struck within a few feet of him . He had been peppered with splinters , but not badly hurt . He had been caught running back and forth behind the front , muttering to himself , and had been for months in hospital until his mind began to clear . Being of a prominent family in France , he had been sent to the United States to get him away from the war , and was going through the same thing I was , fighting it out alone . What long talks we had ! We drove about in the country , lay on the grass in the woods , and talked and talked , searching together for the spark in the empty dark that would be a hint of the life to come . I went to an old friend , a teacher who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a graduate of Vassar , and I thought she could help me . And the disappointment that followed ! I thought that she was human , but she was n't . She had developed into the same sort that I have found elsewhere since then ? the type of neurotic weaklings who hide away from reality and live in a comfortable fog of voluntary ignorance . While the war was in progress , she had refused to read about it , on the ground that it was all too horrible . She had purchased Liberty Bonds , in order to be able to tell her clientele how patriotic she was . She had ' closed her door on the war , ' as she dramatically told me . ' Close your door on the war ? ' I said ; ' how can you close your door on the biggest event since the coming of Christ ? ' She was shocked , horrified at my blasphemy . She folded her hands , closed her eyes , and said that I must seek solitude , weeks of solitude ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the list of people to whom I went looking for help . To their credit be it said that many of them wanted to do something ; but they never slid it , because they could not , since they did not have the understanding to do it . So I left them , one after another , and went my way ? alone , always alone . My head continued to ache and throb , I continued to be nauseated , I still could not sleep . An insane desire to kill myself , as four other friends had done , took possession of me . I would toy with my automatic , and think how best to do it . I would lock myself in my room when attacks came that I had to fight , attacks that made me tense all over , that made me want to scream , break the furniture , pull my clothes to pieces . I would lean against the wall , tears running down my face , and scratch at the plaster , and sob and gag , and end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort to regain control . I would lock my windows before retiring for the night , lock my door and throw the key through the transom , to prevent my doing some insane thing before morning . I would go to sleep late , and wake at about half pastthree in the morning , and stare at the dark , trying to think out the meaning of this thing . I read Now Thought , studied Christian Science , read the Bible , became a regular attendant at church . I got a copy of that great piece of logical thought , Burke 's ' Conciliation with the American Colonies , ' and read it carefully , searching it for his great ideas on how to cure an ill by removing the cause . What was the cause of this thing ? That was what I searched for in my own case . The thing to do was to remove the cause ? but what was the cause ? My mother came and stayed with me . Never in my life before had I known what a mot her could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers . I know I never appreciated mine until then . I have never seen such utter unselfishness , such obliviousness to her own desires , her own interests , as in my mother 's loving thought , her anxiety to help her son . But it was too much ? I could not stand her anxiety . I could not have her coming to my room in the middle of the night , and sitting with me hour after hour , listening to my raving . So I got a nurse and traveled for months on end . I took a ship and sailed off on a cruise through the Southern Seas . I stopped at an island in the south , took a house near the sea , and spent a month or more there . It was wonderful in that quiet and peace . I lay in a hammock , looking out over the beautiful blue Caribbean , listening to the pounding of the waves on the rocks , with the limpid azure of the sky , and its fleecy , scattered clouds overhead . I breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moonlit nights , until a wonderful thing came to me . The shadows broke , the night of that hideous fight was gone , and the first faint dawn of another day of my life came to me , in the knowledge that I was winning . Then the light came truly bursting in upon my consciousness . I was winning ! I was getting well again ! I was sleeping better ? I could eat ? the pains in my head were lessening ? my periods of depression were coming at lengthening intervals . I was getting well ! The knowledge that I was coming back came to me suddenly , all at once , and gave me a strength that I thought I could never have again . But once it came , the months that were to come were easy indeed , compared with the ones that had gone before . It was still a struggle , it still required all my will power to keep going ; but I knew that I could win . Before that time I had been trying to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I received the order that sent me into the shelled area of the Front , I left the army and return . ed to civil life . I got a job that took No again away from my country for several months . I was not yet really well , ha this change helped a great deal , and rapidly I returned to normal again . Periods of ache and pain became ery short , and few and far between , I believe the last one has come and gone , Ii was several months ago that I ha , writing on a typewriter , smoking me pipe . The pipe suddenly rattled in on teeth , my fingers became tense , an muscles tightened . I grabbed my pipe out of my mouth , stood up , forced ore fingers out straight against my desk , took my hat , and walked and walked out into the country for a few miles fighting for myself again . Finally I lighted my pipe again , and smoked . There was no more rattle then , no fingers were again all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time . Since then I have never had an indica. tion that I had a nerve in my body anywhere . That was the last dying gasp of the thing that had held me in its grip for so long . My work brought me back to the United States . I began to read the papers Articles caught my eye ? ex. soldiers not cared for , ea-soldiers out of work , in insane asylums , in jails , walking the streets . I looked into the matter and found that there were thousands upon thousands of these men in straitened circumstances , in poverty . There were more thousands , who needed ha.s- pital attention , who were not getting it . There was trouble in Washington over the means to care for these men . Governmental bureaus overlapped , passed the buck to each other ? and still nothing seemed to be accomplished . What one the matter with my country ? Was it really ungrateful ? Was it true that the public had tired of this responsibility ? Statements were made to me that magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer print anything pertaining to the war , or the men who had fought in it . I found that these statements could he easily disproved , but , nevertheless , it tray disheartening , when I kept learning for myself how these men were suffering . I was walking down Broadway , and my walking-stick accidentally struck against a man . I apologized perfunctorily , but upon looking at him , I saw a poorly dressed man who looked familiar . Then he spoke . ' Colonel , ' he said , can you do me a favor ? ' I was astonished ? did not know him . But he knew me ? he had been in my regiment overseas . He wanted money ? two hundred dollars to start a cigar-stand . We went to the bank and he left me happy . Some day I shall hear from that man , who drove a lead per on the march into silent , sullen Germany . He will win some day . All he needed was a little help , practical help to start again ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many others there are just like him , who need just a little help . Are we going to give it ? I believe we shall , if we but realize the truth ; if we will but see , and not close our door on the war ; There has COMO a thought , to me that I wish t he American people would ponder over when they grow tired of the war , which they felt so very , very little . When they damn the men who bother them for jobs , who pester them for help , they should search their own hearts first . Shall we help back those thousands of humble men who trod the rocky pathway of the Front in France ? Shall we give them the little boost that they need , to come back ? And what of those other men who have suffered , whose minds are gone ? Shall we be but ghosts for those unburied dead ? who did not die ?                @ @ @ @ @
