txt The early Crowd which gathered at Mitchel Field , near Garden City . L. I .. Yesterday for the air carnival was stunned when Private Aage Rasmussen , attached to the Sixty-second Aero Squadron , fell to death after being carried into the air by a drag rope of the army dirigible TC-2 , which had just arrived from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds , Maryland . The unusual accident occurred during the landing of the dirigible , which was being manoeuvred by a ground crew of 2G0 , of which Rasmussen was a member . Becoming excited when the TC-2 started upward during the procedure , Rasmussen forgot to /et go or the drag rope to which he had been assigned and was At least fifty feet in the air before he realized his peril . He managed to wind a part of the rope end around his leg and clung to the swaying drag while officers on the dirigible encircled the field , ' frantically valving out gas In an effort to bring the airship down . In full view of the thousand or more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen suspended Flom the rope , fifteen feet below the body of the ship . Then , when Rasmussen was within fifty feet of safety his strength gave out and he fell to the ground and instant death . Dirigible Almost Made Fast . The TC-2 , the second largest dirigible in the exinY ; service , arrived from Aberdeen at 11:40 , nosing toward the centre rof the , flelde  --  where-eMajOr William N. Hensley Jr. , Commandant at Mitchel Field , was in readiness with his men to bring the huge craft to earth . Three ropes , each about 150 feet long , were thrown over from the two gondolas of the ship , soldiers on the ground catching them . Then began the muscular task of hauling down an : Twilling lighterthan-air craft . The TC-2 was almost safely berthed on the ground when the expansion of the hydrogen gas within the bag , aided by a gust of wind , caused it to rise . Such happenings in landing lighter-thanair ships are not unusual and the practice is to let go the ropes and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order " Let go ! " which was repeated by the officers and sergeants . Rasmussen and Leroy Harris , a negro military prisoner brought to Mitchel Field to serve a sentence , assigned to separate ropes , either did not hear the command or became excited . Both held on as the TC-2 began to ascend . Harris . when about ten feet off the ground , released his hold and dropped unhurt . Rasmussen , who several officers believed would have also dropped if he had not been afraid of landing , on the negro soldier , clung to the slender rope as the dirigible floated upward . - Airship Pumps Out Gas . Watchers then saw him wind the rope around his leg and there was a feeling of relief among them , as it appeared that he could maintain his hold until a landing could be negotiated . Meanwhile . Lieutenant Bruce Martin , pilot of the TC-2 , mindful of the life that was at stake , was making every effort to bring the dirigible to the ground . White his men were valving the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two miles of the field , getting his proper wind direction preparatory to nosing earthward again . Officers on the TC-2 said that Rasmussen frequently looked upward in mute appeal and they signalled him to hold tight . It was futile to attempt to haul him upward as the rope was suspended from the bag of the ship and he could not have been reached . The dirigible reached a height of 400 feet before it started to descend . This meant that Rasmussen was 250 feet from the ground . Five minutes were required . to encircle the field and then the eager watchers saw the machine start earthward . It was a tense moment . Rasmussen could be seen still clinging to the rope . The earth was nearing him and safety seemed in sight when suddenly , within fifty feet of the ground , his strength gave out . His body , like a. plummet , plunged to the ground within a few feet of where the landing crew was stationed . Skull and Legs Broken . For a second or two there was not a. sound among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there was the confusion of cries and orders as rescuers went toward the body . A field ambulance shot forward . Major F. H. Poole , an army surgeon , found that Rasmussen had been instantly killed . His skull was fractcred and both legs broken . The body was taken , to the post hostal and relatives in this city notified . Describing the accident as ho ' saw it from his control car , Lieutenant Martin said : " The rise of the ship vas due to expansion of the hydrogen Iran used in our non-rigid dirigible and to the fact that we used up approximately MO gallons of gasoline on our flight from Aberdeen . The expansion was caused by the higher temperature that existed at Mitchel Field at noon as compared to the temperature at Aberdeen at 8 1A . M. " The ship was acting light . That means it was harder to get . it to the ground than would have been the es.ee had the temperature been lower and had those 500 gallons of gasoline been in the tanks . When the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except two men . One was a col gyred man end the other was Rasmussen found out ? later . The colored man dropped from about ten feet . but Rasmussen hung on . I tried to signal to him to let go , but he was not looking up . Manoeuvred for a Landing . " When he had gone up a ways more he looked at me and I tried to encourage him ' by signals to hang on . He had wrapped the rope around his legs and we in the gondola believed he would be able to hang on until he would get down to earth again . I opened the motor up in order to make a quick cirCult of the field so as to get momentum that would bring us to the ground for a landing . " We completed the circuit and were going down gradually . In a few seconds I would have had Rasmussen down to the ground . We were still so high that Rasmussen was about 200 feet from the ground . I signaled again to him to hang on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all over with him . " It is not an uncommon thing for a man to be carried up on a rope , especially when there was inexperienced men in the ground crew . There are standing instructions that all men may let go their hold on the ropes when they have been pulled six feet from the ground . But sometimes a man does n't . I have known men to wrap their legs around the rope and hold on for as long as fifteen minutes . That gave ample time to bring them to land safe . " /0,000 at Air Carnival . The air carnival , repeated as a benefit for the Army Relief Society . drew a crowd of about 10,000. few of whom left until the last event as the Mitchel Field ' flyers put on a show that was replete with interest . A miniature village , constructed in the centre of the field , gave army aviators an opportunity to give a realistic demonstration of bombing a city .

An observation balloon used In the defense of the place , was shot down in flames , the burning gas and bag illuminating the field for miles around in the dusk . The fatality which followed the arrival of the TC-2 prevented the plans which had been made to tow the Nordman sailplane into the air and release it from a height of 2.000 feet . The inventor was certain that from that height the favoring currents would aid him in setting up a new glider record . In order not to disappoint the crowd , which was keenly interested in the motorless plane , Arthur Hinrich made a short flight , propelled into the air by a motorcycle which towed the craft at full speed over the field . The sailplane remained in the air almost two minutes .
