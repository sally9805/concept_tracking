Herewith are excerpts from letters come to the desks of the editors during the past week . They are selected primarily for the information they contain either supplementary to or corrective of news previously published in TIME . <P> Sade Assailed <P> Sirs : In your efforts to be impartial you occasionally become weak . There are certain scoundrels who should never be mentioned without branding them as such ! One of them is or was the Count Sade whom you let off with a " notorious " in your Jan. 18 issue ! ( See FRANCE . ) He was the greatest scoundrel who ever lived ! I can not refer you to such of his works as Justine or Juliette for confirmation of my assertion-because they have been completely suppressed ! If you think I am a milksop-prude , however , I call your attention to the following facts , which are to be found in any authoritative work upon the man . In 1766 Count Sade married a young and beautiful commoner , a Mlle. Montreuil . ( Incidentally she remained faithful to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1768 ( less than two years later ! ) he " attempted for his pleasure partially to dissect while still alive " an English woman , Rose Keller , whose French husband had " sold " her to Count Sade . In 1770 he seduced his sister-in-law and took her to Italy , where she died-in no one knows what circumstances ! In 1772 he and his valet were convicted of having given the files de joie of Marseilles-then as now the most disreputable in Western Europe-certain pastilles containing cantharides which roused them to superhuman excesses , during which one of them died . From then on he was in and out of custody all his life . Knowing Napoleon I 's lascivious nature , he tried to curry favor by getting out a special combined edition of Justine and Juliette , in ten volumes , with 100 illustrations , which he dedicated to the Emperor . Napoleon had them burned ! Yet you let this man off as merely " notorious ! " I suppose you have read those sentimental descriptions which sadists have written of him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tres beaux. . . with an air le plus aimable . . . with une admirable politesse . . . un vieillard robuste et sans infirmities ! " Without infirmities indeed ! He had them all ! PAXTON BROCK <P> New York , N. Y. <P> From a Free Thinker <P> Sirs : Although it is beyond my means to subscribe to TIME , it always gives me great pleasure to read it . As a freethinker I am glad to see at least one magazine not afraid to attack religious intolerance-so prevalent today . Your one-word title " Intolerance " for the article regarding the statue of Buddha in New York City was a fine choice in my estimation . Noticed your ad about Thomas Paine . Why not feature an edition containing information about that Great American-such a stranger to many so-called " good Americans " ? Good luck and Happy New Year . VOLTAIRE H. ZIZKA <P> Cleveland , Ohio <P> TIME made no " attack " upon religious intolerance . TIME prints facts , makes no " attacks . " - ED . <P> Young Bismarck   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
