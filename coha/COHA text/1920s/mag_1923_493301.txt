A Stroll on Main Street YOU may smile as much as , you please , I shall still go on doggedly saying it : Robertsville is distinctly worth knowing . You sophisticated travelers do not seem to think so , as you look out scornfully from the car window upon us and our town for a moment while you journey ( some of you ) all the way from Chicago to Sioux Falls . Yet after all , Robertsville is America . It was from our W. C. T. U. meetings , Tuesday nights for decades through icebound winter and stifled summer heat , that prohibition came at last . It is with us that Fundamentalism lingers , and lingering , turns to strike a rear guard blow in that anti-Darwin legislation which you find so absurd . Here is where the farm bloc is produced and the third party movement ? when there is one ? and the circulation for Gene Stratton Porter , and the nation 's food . ' You complain that we " spring things " on you ? ? that we are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , whose fault is that ? We are keeping no secrets , if you care , to come within earshot . On the whole , I strongly suggest that you suspend judgment for a little ; that you descend from your impressive train ( three daycoaches and a Pullman ) ; that you stay over at least from the 9 : 12 until the 4 : 33 ; and that you come for a little stroll on Main Street . We shall begin , naturally , at Court House Square , where once the farmers ' horses gnawed at wooden railings through the long Saturday afternoons . Today , a phalanx of parked cars stands on the clean cement in the shadow of the big elms ; farmers ' cars , ranging upward from a Ford . Next , we go along the three blocks of the business district , where the low wooden stores with false fronts are beginning to be replaced by two-story brick edifices with cunningly arranged showcase space on the street level . Later , we shall see the residential section where the big wooden houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the jigsaw fretwork of the eighties is just as respectable as the occasional imitation stucco bungalow of the bride and groom , a bungalow out of Ladies ' Home Journal by Montgomery Ward , 1922 . Robertsville , you do not need to be told , is a prairie town in fruitful Iowa . Let me murmur confidentially at once that her population , now 2,358 , was somewhat larger than that ten years ago . This fact is a terrible humiliation to - us good Americans whose first faith is in growth , growth for its own sake , growth of any kind . We do n't mention the tragedy , of course , at our monthly Chamber of Commerce meetings ; but our silente is eloquent . Where we are , is the true heart of the prairie . It is not flat ; over and over we are obliged to say this to fatuous Eastern friends who mutter about an inland , grassy sea . It rolls in long , slow hills , some of which , I assure you , are nearly fifty feet high ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cliffs clustered over with low willows . Those pioneers who came overland in covered wagons from Wisconsin , Michigan , Ohio , and produced Robertsville upon the virgin sod at the northern edge of Muddy Lake , laid out the town in the simplest fashion . Main Street runs north and south and ends among the cat-tails and rushes of the lake shore . First Street runs east and west . There are a dozen other streets ; no doubt they have names , on the yellowing map in the courthouse , but no one knows them . A stranger asking directions is told " two blocks beyond the Wilfrid Place , turn to the left , and it 's the second house past the vacant lot with the cottonwoods . " But as a matter of fact , strangers rarely do ask . Robertsville 's visitors are almost exclusively traveling men in automobiles . They drive into town in the evening , stay over night at the Astoria House and call on the merchants next morning . In the late afternoon they leave for Woolett , thirty-two miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so straight across this vast expanse of placid earth that a visitor has been known to exclaim " thank God ! " when his car reached the little hitch in the boulevard three miles south of Redwing . ( This remark fell rather flat when quoted at a meeting of the Robertsville Tuesday Club , where it somehow got into the general discussion following Mrs. Barton 's paper on Resources of Porto Rico . The ladies felt that to invoke the name of the Deity just to make a mild joke was an unnecessary and undesirable performance . ) From time to time we read in one of the Eastern magazines ( of which the public library takes several ) how our life has been changed by the coming of the automobile , the phonograph , the radio and the movie . We are no longer isolated , it appears . We have been brought into tune with world affairs . These statements tell the physical truth ; but spiritually . . . one wonders . There are several radios in town , I admit . There is a movie theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a great many of us have got tired and stopped going . Every home has a phonograph , and most of them have not been played for more than a year now , not since Cousin Mamie came over from Hagar on Thanksgiving and , brought those two young ones of hers . Somehow , we remain extremely calm about these marvelous inventions . If they leave any imprint on our minds , it is one so shallow that the casual observer would be hard pressed to point out just how it had changed us . Certainly , the automobile has made a difference . It has produced this wonderful new system of good roads laced across the state . Every family in town owns a car ; and all the prosperous members of our middle-class aristocracy , the families of doctors , lawyers , retail merchants , have two . One of these is a coupe ( pronounced , quite soberly , coop ) and this one " the madam " drives , whether her age be twenty or thrice that . She drives , it must be recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , so do the men ; so do the children , down to the very smallest sizes . Our cars have lengthened our radius of activity from a township to a cluster of counties . The business man thinks nothing of going to Hagar in the morning , to Woolett in the afternoon and perhaps returning by way of Milbank , thirty miles further west . This is broadening , without doubt ; though Hagar and Woolett and even Milbank are not notably diSsimilar from Robertsville . . . . The automobile has also aggravated for us the problem of the younger generation which gives us some concern though not so much , apparently , as it does dwellers in the big cities along the Atlantic Seaboard . A few of our boys are wild , and use their fathers ' cars at night to drive over to Hagar or some other distant town , where they are not known and are , of course , beyond parental control . They go to dances and movies ( which are always doubly fascinating in foreign places ) ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink very much ; and sometimes they pick up prostitutes ( known in our vernacular as " the bad women " ) . Prohibition , however , is not a very serious ques ' tion to us . The town , as a whole , is so overwhelm .. ingly dry that it is impossible to get up a discussion as to whether the national law should be repealed or modified . There are not three homes where liquor ( wine , spirits and beer are all " liquor " to us ) is served habitually , or was before prohibition . Our politics is mostly conservative Republican ; the " radicalism " of the Middle West , of which so much is heard , is a farm product , only faintly reflected among the townsmen . Even on the farm it is not so much the result of deep-rooted conviction as it is the harassed desperaticin of good American citizens caught in a trap and trying , unhappily and uncertainly , to find a way out ? a way which will enable them by their honest hard labor to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mostly of the type which accepts proudly the characterization safe and sane . " We voted for Mr. Harding in 192o ; we are inclined to like Mr. Coolidge ( " he 's not stuck up ? imagine , he 's never even yet owned a car " ) . We were not especially opposed to the League of Nations in 1920 ; but are much more so now . Europe is far away , big and terrible : we feel her diplomats are sure to be too clever for any American product we can send against them . We ( the women in particular ) abominate war ; we should be glad to have " the government " able to do something to stop it : but we do not believe this is possible . We go to church , every last one of us , and we mean it , after our quiet fashion which holds it as indecent for a man to talk about religion as it would be for him publicly to confess his affection for his wife . If there is a " new freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance ? we do n't know it . The slightest step aside from rigid lifelong monogamy is a sin never to be condoned or forgotten . A definite stigma clings about a divorced person , and this is doubly the case for a woman . The theory of evolution hardly exists for us at all , though we accept Mr. Bryan 's assurances that it is atheistic and therefore ought to be prevented by law . We have also heard vaguely that the scientists no longer believe in it . For the children of the town , our new public library means much . In it , they devour those volumes produced for their especial benefit ? narratives of radio , aeroplane and Boy Scout . The women , too , come to its shelves for the popular novels of the day ; but the general feeling is that there is something improper in a man 's reading a book after attaining his majority ? unless , of course , he is a lawyer . Perhaps because reading is so largely a feminine and juvenile occupation , we maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have a committee of five ? Reverend Gibbs , the Methodist minister , Miss Wilkins , who sells stationery and notions and has always been literary , Mrs. Fremke , president of the Tuesday Club , Mr. Ottison , principal of the high school , and Miss Enghardt , the English teacher . One adverse vote excludes any book from the shelves ; and as the whole committee passes on each doubtful volume , the rejections are numerous . Mrs. Fremke barred Black Oxen , because it made light of age ( she is getting on , herself ) ; Mr. Ottison turned down Frederick O'Brien 's South Sea books ; , having always intended to go there some day , he an authority on those regions , and found O'Brien most inaccurate ; The Glimpses of the Moon went by the hoards because Reverend Gibbs felt it was unwholesome . As for D. H. Lawrence , or the later manner of ? May Sinclair , or Schnitzler , no one dreams of even attempting to get them in . But we are entirely sure of Harold Bell - Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iron Door . Our social life has in it four high spots : bridge , lodge meetings , golf and automobile riding . Theaddiction of Robertsville to bridge is something , beyond description . There are clubs without number , they meet incessantly , they ' play until one o'clock in the morning , and every one who is any one belongs to at least two . You might marvel at the robustness of a population which can do this and yet be out and about at eight the next morning , until you perceive that the funeral pace of the day 's activities is itself a restorative . Lodge membership is another unanimous occupation . Any unlucky stranger who wanders our way and must blushingly confess that he is not a Mason , an Oddfellow , a Knight of Pythias or an Elk , is looked upon with horrid suspicion . Evidently , there must be some secret thing terribly the matter with him . If we found any one who not only was n't a member of anything but did n't play bridge or golf or drive a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail in the Court House-basement on suspicion as an escaped lunatic . We are not so self-centred that we do not recognize and admire the country 's greatest metropolis : Chicago . We have heard , to be sure , of such a place as New York . We have also heard of Paris and London , and any one of these three places seems about as near as the others . There are reports that Manhattan supposes itself hated by Main Street . On the contrary , it is ignored . Chicago is where our wealthiest people go for their annual holiday . From Chicago we buy our furni ture ; Chicago department stores dress our flappers . The Chicago Tribune is our Bible , giving us all we know of what is going on in the world in general . We supplement it , of course , once a week , with the Robertsville Courier , four pages local , four pages patent insides , edited by Harry Hughes who was born here , inherited the paper- , from his father , never saw the inside of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Robertsville rather late ? our course is only two years old ? but the visitation is a serious one . Every male above the age of fourteen goes twice around the nine holes at least four times a week . We have no clubhouse , yet , and the way our course is laid out would cause any professional to commit suicide on the fourth green , but we adore the game . We bought for it the old Edwards forty , a mile east of town . If you want to be romantic , you might sentimentalize over the fact that the ruins of Grandpa Edwards 's sod house , built the first winter he was on the prairie , now form part of a bunker on the approach to the eighth hole . Perhaps by this time you are smiling the quiet smile of pity at pathetic Robertsville , stuck down here in the midst of the prairie , out of touch with the great world , turning its back on the beauty and wonder of nature 's fruitfulness , scorning her servants even though every soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . If so , we refuse your pity . We are conscious of no deficiencies in our intellectual existence . If other parts of the country choose to discuss other subjects , amuse themselves with other recreations , that is their right , which is no less and no more clear than is ours to do and think as we please . Mr. Sinclair Lewis wrote a book about us once . We wore out seven copies of it in the public library and our general verdict was that he may have ' tried to be fair , but he was n't , at least to the Robertsville of today . We do n't feel that we need reforming ; but any of our girls coming home from college with Mrs. Carol Kennicott 's ideas for improving things , would n't need to be lonely . After all , most of the young married women in town have also been to college and would agree with her ? that is , within reason . It is worth remembering , we think , that never in the history of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high general level of education and behavior as in the Robertsvilles of the Middle West today . If our material progress has somewhat outrun our development in artistic and " cultural " lines , after all we feel it is better that way than with the reverse condition . Also , every one of the traits Mr. Sinclair Lewis pokes fun at exists just as much among ninety-five percent of the inhabitants of every big city as it does out here among the cattle , corn and wheat . The New Yorkers go to the same bad movies , read the same trashy books , play the same bridge as ourselves . We ca n't see that they have any right to laugh at Robertsville ; nor has anybody else . We are honest , hard-working , sober : if these are qUalities which are to be despised then the world , we think , must certainly be coming to an end . We say grace at our tables three times a day without shame ; we pay our debts when the government follows a policy which permits us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education our prairie colleges know anything about . It 's pleasant , I agree , for you to hop on the 4 : 33 train and slide away from the little town , with its jealousies ( certainly we have some ) , its gossip ( which is terrific , I admit , being the natural product of active minds with too little to do ) , its daily round of the same few short streets , the same familiar faces , the same jokes in the barber shop , the same smiling stupid amiability at the church supper . But it is fair to remember that if you had been born here , almost certainly you would be here yet , making the best of it . Also , that if the rest of us did n't stay here the pickings would soon be very poor in those big Chicago restaurants you are so proud of . Goodbye . Come again .
