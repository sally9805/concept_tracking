H ER ALD E D to the Cyrus K. Curtis newspapers as- being " the most vigorous and dynamic message that he has issued to the Capitol in the four years and four months that he has been in the White House , " the President 's message to Congress appears to us lame and weak , with as little evidence of courageous leadership as usual . It is to the New York Herald Tribune a document rounding aut " with exceptional vigor and felicity his political program , " expressing " appealingly his political philosophy . " If that is the case , then Mr. Coolidge 's political philosophy must be to face no issue until compelled to do so , to content himself with stating problems without seeking to solve them. , by more than temporizing measures . Only when he touches on the question of tax reduction does he hit from the shoulder . Evidently the Chamber of Commerce of the United States has touched him and Secretary Mellon upon - the raw . For the first time in his Administration , to our recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his rebuke : - If special interests , too often selfish , always uninformed of the national needs as a whole , with hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries as engines of propaganda , are permitted to influence the withdrawal of their property from taxation , we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust , bad for business , bad for the country , probably resulting in a deficit , with disastrous financial consequences . This is the solemn truth . What a pity it is that the President can not see that it applies to other special-interest groups , most strikingly to those manufacturers who rush to the Treasury to obtain special tariff legislation as a sort of government guaranty of their profits . To the tariff Mr. Coolidge continues his unshakable devotion . Yet , curiously enough , he goes out of his way to prove that 65 per cent of our imports come in free and that , of the remaining 35 per cent , 23 per cent are luxuries - and only 12 per cent are goods which can be classified as " manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thereupon he makes this cryptic remark  --  with that " exceptional vigor and felicity " of which the Herald Tribune speaks ? " While this amount duty-free would be large enough seriously to depress many lines of business in our own country , it is of small importance when spread over the rest of the world . " We confess that this is beyond us ; - we do not know what the President means . The President declares against naval competition , yet announces that " we should refrain from no needful program . " He declares one moment that " we know now that no agreement can be reached with other nations which will be inconsistent with a considerable building program on . our part , " and the next moment , speaking of treaty limitations , declares that where there are none , " the size of the navy which America is to have will be solely for America to determine " ? as if this had not always been the case . Then he declares that if we had come to an agreement with Japan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of continuing our building program . " So we are not to compete in armaments , but we are to show to all other nations that we shall do what we please without foreign dictation , and we shall promptly build a large number of ships , which we should have built anyway if the Geneva Conference had been successful . This is , indeed , " exceptional felicity " of statement . As for the vital question of agriculture , the President suggestA the establishment of a government board to lend money from a revolving fund to aid cooperative marketing . Beyond this , he opines that " any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will have the earnest support of the kovernment . " In other words , in place of bread the farmer again gets a stone . As the New York World says , the message " is vague to the point of sheer unintelligibility on practically every contentious issue about which Mr. Coolidge - knows that action of some kind is necessary . " The whole document confirms us in our belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the English language properly . There are passages in it which for confusion of thought , lack of clarity , and misuse of words would shame a high-school boy . Were Mr. Coolidge able to use clear and concise English he could surely have made a far better case for himself and his philosophy , such as it is . The clearest example of the injustice the President does himself by his misuse of words remains , of course , his " I do not choose to run for the Presidency . " At any time he could have clarified this . It is his own fault if people have believed that he did not mean to withdraw and have credited him with duplicity . The Society for the Prevention of Waste in Industry  --  if there is one  --  ought carefully to compute the saving in ink , paper , and brain labor there would have been had Mr. Coolidge used the words in which Charles E. Hughes has just reaffirmed his refusal to run : " I do not wish my name to be used in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the nomination . " Governor Smith ? Penologist G REAT fluttering and raucous cries from the nests of the eagles of the daily press ? Governor Smith has laid impious hands on the sacred robe of Justice ! He has had the temerity to suggest that there might be a better way of determining the penalty to be imposed on a convicted felon than to leave it to the puzzled discretion , the whim , or the caprice of the trial judge . He proposes that the State Crime Commission should take a year to study the question , and he wonders if it would not be better to confine the court to its primary function of trying the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused and to set up a separate tribunal , a board composed of well-paid experts  --  psychiatrists , physicians , lawyers , etc. ? to make a careful study of the convicted offender and , upon the basis of the knowledge so gained , to determine what should be done with him . In order that this study may be made with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing-house to which the convict shall in the first instance be committed and where he shall be kept under close observation until all the facts relative to his mental condition and his criminal propensities have been established . Upon this diagnosis the board will then commit him to the type of institution and for such length of time as the public interest shall seem to require . " Fantastic , " " futuristic , " " revolutionary " are some of the terms employed by the startled editors to characterize the Governor 's bold conception . One editor describes it as a proposal to " turn our criminal administration upside down " ; another begs to remind us that " Albany is not the capital of Utopia . " These critics were probably unaware that Governor Smith 's proposal is in line with the main current of criminological thought ever since Beccaria , 164 years ago , demanded that the judges should be deprived of the arbitrary power of determining the kind and amount of suffering that should be inflicted on the convicted felon . Let us hope that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed for the study of the question , these leaders of public opinion will have led the public to agree with the Governor 's view that his plan provides " a sensible , modern , up-to-date way of treating criminals . " The proposed plan is neither novel nor revolutionary . " It would deprive judges of the power to sentence persons convicted of felonies , " exclaims the horrified editor of the Times . This sounds pretty awful until we recall how little is left of this venerated judicial power . Our legislatures are forever curbing it by prescribing and changing maximum and minimum sentences below and beyond which the judges are forbidden to go . Much of the legislative activity of the last two years in this country has gone into the enactment of mandatory penal statutes whose sole object has been to restrict still further the sacred prerogative of the courts in sentencing persons convicted of felony . It is in connection with the indeterminate sentence ( and in some of our States all sentences to State prison are indeterminate ) that we have become familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board ; sometimes , as in New York , a board of parole  --  invested with the function of determining the actual duration of the sentence . In several of the Western States , notably in California , the court has practically ceased to function as a sentencing agency . The legislature fixes the maximum and the minimum limits of the sentence to be served for a given crime . The jury finds the culprit guilty of that crime , the judge commits the convict to prison , and the prison board , after a study of the prisoner , determines the sentence to be served . This has now been going on for many years , and the skies of California still bend lovingly over her amiable sons and daughters and her temples of justice still stand . Now , what Governor Smith proposes is , in effect , to provide a thoroughly competent study of every person committed to a State prison before a decision is reached as to the disposition to be made ' of him . The survey of prison inmates made by the Sing Sing psychiatric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mingled indiscriminately in the prison population of , say , 1,500 men , there were not less than 180 who were definitely insane , 260 irresponsible psychopaths , and more than 400 feeble-minded . The courts had neither the specialized knowledge nor the facilities to ascertain these facts . These wretched creatures were all thrown promiscuously into the same human ant-heap together with some 700 men of normal mental faculties . Is it too much to say that under any decent , not to say humane , system of criminal administration , these unhappy and incongruous elements of the prison population would be weeded out and committed to institutions adapted to their care and treatment ? ( The splendid hospital erected a few years ago at Sing Sing Prison was built as the first step in the development of such a clearing-house as Governor Smith suggests . ) Perhaps before our year of grace is up we shall all give thanks to a just but merciful God for a Governor who refuses to tolerate the chaos in criminal administration which we have so shamefully endured . The Forgery as O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in facsimile a- document submitted on November 10 to the editor of this journal by a representative of William R. Hearat . On its face it purports to be a warrant , signed by President Calles , for the payment to the editor of $25,000 from the secret expenditure fund of the Department of Industry , Commerce , and Labor " for subscriptions and propaganda in favor of the Government of Mexico . " Mr. Hearst 's representative was informed at once that no moneys had ever been paid to The Nation or to its editor by the Government of Mexico , or any citizen of Mexico , for subscriptions or propaganda , except for legitimate advertising so marked , and that he would immediately take legal steps if the Hearst publications printed this document . Later in the day the representative of Mr. Hearst telephoned that " no publication will be made . " None the less , on the second of December , the New York American resorted to the cow a r d l y subterfuge of printing the warrant with the name of the editor and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed in facsimile purporting - to show that one other American publication received $25,000 , and that $50,000 was paid to an American newspaper syndicate  --  with the names blotted out in each case  --  for the same purpose of creating " sentiment in the United States favorable to Mexico . " Why- did Mr. Hearst delete the names of the two publications and of the newspaper syndicate ? If the documents were genuine , he need not have feared to publish them in full . Plainly , Mr. Hearst did not believe in his own evidence . Mr. Hearst did not stop there . He next charged that he had documents proving that $1,215,000 was paid to four United States Senators to work for the interests of Mexico , and he again showed his contemptible cowardice in deleting the names of the four Senators . This had immediate consequences . On Friday , December 9 , the Senate , on motion of Senator Reed of Pennsylvania , voted an inquiry into the charges , to begin December 14 , Senator Reed correctly stating that as long as the charges were unsifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake . " Besides Senator Reed , the committee comprises Senators Jones of Washington , Johnson of California , Robinson of Arkansas , and Bruceto The Nation of Maryland . Already the question has arisen whether the committee can subpoena the Mexican Consul General and fiscal agent in New York or whether that official may claim diplomatic immunity . Mr. Elias , the Mexican Consul General , has declared that he will not stand upon a technicality , but will come forward to cooperate with the committee to sift this matter to the very bottom . And we trust that the Senate will not limit its inquiry to the charges in regard to its own members but will investigate the allegations as to the press and to all other individuals . Honor is as dear to editors as it is to Senators . We are aware , of course , that the . Senators look upon the entire series as impudent but unskilled forgeries and that they joked about them , Senator Borah inquiring where the money was that he should have received as chairman of the Senate Com-mittee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the documents is faulty , that the Hearst forces changed the date of one dis-patch three times in three consecutive editions , and that no officials of any govern-ment which- disburses secret funds for corrupt purposes are so stupid as to commit anything to paper . Some of the allegations , that Calles was contributing large sums to revolutionists in China and strikers in England to " bolshevize " political and economic movements in those countries , are too absurd to arouse even a smile . Since there is , however , the possibility that the publication of these documents is likely among the unthinking to arouse antagonism to Mexico , their falsity ought to be exposed , and the suggestion that they have been used to filch sums from the Mexican treasury , adjudicated . The Nation 's reputation of sixty-two years ' standing , and that of its editor during his thirty-one years of journalism , surely make unnecessary any formal denial of the charge . Everybody knows that its opinions are not for sale and that its ardent support of smaller nations seeking to achieve economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth here for purposes of historical record . As insistently as the Senators whom Mr. Hearst has clouded with suspicion , we demand  --  and in this the American press will join us  --  that Mr. Hearst print the names and tell the facts  --  where he got his documents and what members of his staff believed them authentic .
