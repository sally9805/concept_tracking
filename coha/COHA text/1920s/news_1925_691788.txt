txt Reduction of the maximum surtax rate to not more than 15 per cent . and the repeal of , the inheritance and gift taxes and the publicity section of the revenue law were advocated today by Representative Henry W. Watson , Republican of Pennsylvania , a member of the Ways and Means Committee which will initiate legislation in the next session of Congress in December . Mr. Watson said he felt that some of the so-called nuisance taxes could be eliminated , also . Adoption of such a program , he said , probably would leave little surplus revenue from tax sources to be used in addition to payments received from foreign governments on their wartime debts , for the purpose of reducing the principal of the public debt of this Government . In a reegnt letter to the , Iowa Tax Clubs . Under Secretary Garrard B. Winston said that the Treasury Department . believed sufficient " revenues would be obtained if the maximum surtax were reduced from the present level of 40 per cent . to 20 per cent. , and the maximum normal tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. combined maximum normal , and surtax of 25 per cent . The Treasury Department has been opposed to tax reduction which would curtail revenues so severely that it would be necessary to abandon the policy of applying a considerable sum from general revenues to reduction of the public debt . In the last fiscal year the debt was reduced about *734,000,000 , and of this sum about ** came from payments ' by foreign governments and other revenues which the law provides shall be used fur debt reduction ; and approximately $230 , ( , t ) , u0a from general receipts . Charges Ito Would Like to See . " The Committee on Ways and Means , " said Mr. Watson , " will meet in October to frame a revenue bill for Congress to enact previous to January first , " - said Mr. ' Watson . " Lf the present plan is carried through , the Federal taxpayers Of the present year will profit by lower taxation . The maximum surtax rate should not be above 15 per cent . Two sections of the act of ) 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , and the gift tax should be repealed . The publicity clause also should be abolished . " The estate tax in its nature is confiscatory , it dissolves solvent estates , is unjust to the heirs , and frequently causes the abanConment of large tax paying concerns . An inheritance tax is a state prerogative , and should be a source from which the States may derive returns . The gift tax should be buried with the Inheritance tax . The purpose of the gift tax , of course , is to cover up the loop-holes by which the inheritance tax might escape . " A gift tax is not justifiable , narrow in its conception , and unwise in its enactment . The present surplus in the Treasury is $155,272,191 . This amount , however , is a necessary balance . The estimated revenue required for the fiscal year of 1926 is $3,375,000,009 . When the surtax was reduced to 40 per cent . the revenues therefrom was increased by $34,000,000 . It is estimated that $200,000 , - 000 might be collectO if the surtax were placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 20 per cent . " The gift tax in 1925 amounted to $7 , - 500.000 and the inheritance tax $I00 , - 000.000 . " The year 1916 revealed 45,126 estate ta. = returns , while in 1923 only 14,150 . The higher estate tax indicates fewer returns . There are about $14,000,000,000 invested in non-taxable securities , solid investments , but not available for Federal revenues . Non-taxable securities d6 not yield returns of high rates of interest . A lower surtax , however , would be an inducement for the investor to seek industrials . " In making this statement I also take in consideration foreign loans . The total principal and interest indebtedness f.3 $12,151=8,393 ; of this amount $40,099 , - 672 has been paid on account of principal . and $275,968,405 on account of interest . It is evident , therefore , that the present revenue law , with the maximum surtax rate reduced to 15 per cent and the gift and estate taxes eliminated with further reduction in nuisance taxes to the amount of $3,000,000 or $10,000,000 for the calendar year 1927 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government as now constituted . Strain Put on War Payments . " Of course , the maturing obligations of the Government would have to be refunded , so that the sinking fund and payment by our allies on account of ourforeign indebtedness would be the only source fur reducing our present debt . " For persistent efforts to secure all around retrenchment in the operating expenses of our Government the taxpayers are greatly indebted to the constant watchfulness of President Coolidge and the executive ability of Secretary Mellon . Our expenses for the coming fiscal year will therefore be carefully pruned by the Budgeting Bureau and the Appropriation Committee . " The " surplus " of $155,272,191 which Mr. Watson - makes reference is the balance shown by the Treasury general fund which is kept as working capital . The actual excess of expenditures over receipts for the present fiscal year , as of July 30 , was $50,508,395 , and this has been met by Mking money from the genzral fund .                   @ @
