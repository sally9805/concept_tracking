txt qwq lyrical not Alone in celebration of her intellect and her courage but in appreciation of her beauty as well . It appears that though she is only 28 , years old , she has already shown great talent as a lecturer and a contributor of essays to French period . feats , and that she has been much sought after by the most distinguished men and women of Europe . Seldom , it will be seen , does a writer 's first book go out to the world so heraided ? so royally , accompanied , It would be a poor and carping critic who would meet stich a company of acclaimers or so honored an author with distrust . One reads the book , therefore , with every expectation of participating in this high elation at the arrival of a new genius . The book begins as the diary of a young girl upon a note of intense selfconsciousness . Here is the revolt against parental authority , the bitter ' reaction to conventionality , the pas . sionate desire for independence . There follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not less noble love , then the birth of a child , and the curious , beWildering , and disappointing experleve of motherhood . Then comes ' the war . The woman loses both husband and lover . She is left with her child . She faces poverty , drudgery , but she Is undismayed . Her delight in her own life sustains her . In her joy at being able to preserve her economic independence , her passion , her beauty , and her zest for life , she fir.ds herself to be the herald of a new day . " Life wishes to become what it has never been , " she writes . " I came , I. a woman and like every other creature , I too , began by loving . Life was not the same , I swear it was not the same . ( She meats it was not the same for her as for the women who had preceded her . ) Life had a different taste , I shouldered it differently , and my death , while resembling other deaths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ; everything is changed . And even if I bad never lived , - other women are ready to change the earth . You ca n't tell what the women of my genera . tion are capable of. ? They themselves do n't know altocether . The memory of what they have always be-tn told weighs upon them . I simply say I live . I am honest , exact . I have muscles of steel . I like people to say what is ; I am loyal , willing . I ' earn my living , and I am inured to safe/inc . Whaf Magdeleine Marx is the ' author of " Woman " ( Thomas Seltzer ) . truth does one fail to recognize when , it shows Es face ? " 1 think . I want . I know . " .11 has taken me a long time to take in the bumble things I now know . I commenced with very hula : my youth passed in chaos . I had- to suffer very much . So it is not chance . randoui truths that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even my death will opt disprove them . Thus . a few scattered fr &gments; hover . I snatched and caught them in moments of alert intelligence , I held them fast with my willing heart . I gripped them between clenched teeth to keep from loathe them . " What are these truths which she has discovered and which move her so deeply ? It is best to read the hook and thus to receive the woman 's poetic interpretation of them . But it may be said in all gravity and courtesy that these truths will . seem in no way remarkable to the American woman . It is only in such a ceur , try as France that this book could create a sensation and be the cause of lectures , discusshins in the public print , and the source of dinner conversations . It is a long time since we learned in America that woman is her own justification , ? that her life flows deeply and richly by itself ' , and that with her as with man love is the supreme decoration of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnants ci worn out Ideas still cling to this woman 's emerging soul . The jealousy of other women , the mean suspicions , and the astonishment that friendship exists between women sound almost grotesquely obsolete . But they find their place in this book which the most advanced thinkers of France regard as the latest cry . My own reaction trom the book is one of interest and admiration . I applaud its finish , its focussing of purpose and theme , and its passionate poetic beauty . Yet I feel that the exhilarated critics , the friends of the author , have overestimated its importance and its permanency . I am glad indeed , how ? ever , that a personality so vivid has brought credit to ' women , and I hope the highest honors will come to this French woman , who holds with a sense of startled originality ideas which have long been held by the most interesting and distinguished women in our own ronuhlte
