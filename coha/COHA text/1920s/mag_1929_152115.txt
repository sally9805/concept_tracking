JEHOVAH 'S DAY - Mary Borden - Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) A competent novelist , Mary Borden has set in frameworks of nice prose such swift tumultuous stories as Jane , Our Stranger and Flamingo . But none of her past work presaged the ambitious conception , the flights of rhetoric displayed in her present work , which is the story of Evolution reduced to the limits of the popular novel . Jehovah 's " day , " a million years in human reckoning , dawns with Eryops , fat and repulsive Mud Puppy who dragged himself from primordial slime ; ends with Peregrine , fat and lovable scientist who rose to planes of pure intellect , and his wife Ann who reached for realms of pure spirit only to be dragged back to the slough of human passions . The human types chosen to epitomize extant evolutionary types are the horse-faced woman of London society ; the young aviator who just misses loving his machine more than his woman ; Martha , earthy female ; Patrick , vivid sensualist in restless search of the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howling melodrama , but in a setting of cosmic proportions it fades to the decent outlines of engrossing human narrative . Lost in the eerie privacy of a London fog , Ann and Patrick recognize that their life-long friendship is love , the real thing . Lest they shatter the life of Ann 's gentle husband , Peregrine , Patrick escapes to the Midlands there to conduct relief among striking miners-and seduce their handsomest daughter , Martha . In a feverish vision Ann realizes what has happened , pines for Patrick . The horse-faced woman snaps at the situation , meat for malicious machinations , invites Patrick and Ann arid Martha to her Mediterranean castle . For seven days the mistral blows them all madly sane . Martha pitches herself over a cliff into a raging forest-fire ; Ann returns wanly to Peregrine .
