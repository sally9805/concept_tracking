Packard is Packard . An automobile left Tsingtao last week for Peking and points west-the points being vague oases in the bandit-infested , scantily charted Gobi desert . Camels and asses had crossed it before , but never a stock touring car . The leader of the expedition is Mark L. Moody , head of the Packard Motor Agency of Shanghai . He and his companions plan to hunt bear , elk , antelope ; to meet and visit Scientist Roy Chapman Andrews somewhere in the Gobi <P> Meanwhile , in Detroit where Packards are made , President Alvan Macauley of the Packard Motor Car Co. wrote a letter to stockholders . He wanted to tell them that Packard is Packard , that it performs with distinction for distinctive individuals , that it will always do so . Wall Street , inspired by the Chrysler-Dodge merger , had been talking about more mergers and Packard had been mentioned . Here is what President Macauley wrote : <P> " Our position has been and is , that we will not merge or consolidate with any one . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a position for ourselves and a reputation that is distinctive and unique . We do not intend to surrender either . <P> " The personnel of the company from the beginning was made up of men who knew and loved fine things , mechanically and artistically , so the company was born to occupy the fine car field . . . . <P> " The history of fine things throughout the world shows that they are produced by men and organizations that have no other thought , no other ambition and no other ideals . <P> " We do not build to a price and we do cater to the world . . . . They are discriminating and we try never to lose sight of that fact . We know that the single standard of high quality will produce better motor cars than were we to attempt to secure the business of the world by building to all the pocket books in it . <P> " We are not opposed to expansion . . . . We may even from time to time expand by the absorption of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will enable us to best serve the public and win its favor . <P> " But , very definitely , we do not intend to lose our identity through any merger , combination or consolidation now or hereafter . " <P> Coincidentally , Packard issued last week its statement for the nine months ending May 31 , showing a net profit of $17,803,304 or $5.92 per share of common stock . This is nearly double the earnings for the same period in 1926-27 . <P> The position of Packard in the fine car field is largely the work of Alvan Macauley . He began as a lawyer in Washington , D.C. A good friend , Edward Rector , * recommended him to the National Cash Register Co. as a patent attorney . There , he soon turned himself into an inventor and engineer . Later , he went to the American Arithmometer Co. and turned it into the potent Burroughs Adding Machine Co . In 1910 , when Packard was making four-cylinder cars , 2,000 a year , Mr. Macauley became general manager . James Ward <P> Packard , who designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retired from the business in 1915 . He died three months ago ( TIME , Apr. 2 ) , beloved by his neighbors in Warren , Ohio , to whom he left $100,000 for a town library . Last year some 35,000 six-and eight-cylinder Packards were sold and Mr. Macauley said : " We keep only those men who , we believe , are personally interested in the work itself .
