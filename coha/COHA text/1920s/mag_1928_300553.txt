To James Couzens , Michigan 's millionaire Senator , the U. S. Treasury last week sent a check for $989,833 . The Senator accepted it , though noting formally that there was a " slight miscalculation " of $20,000 or more for interest . The money was a tax refund which Senator Couzens won as the result of a fight started by the Internal Revenue Bureau three years ago to increase the Couzens profit-tax on Ford Motors stock sold by him in 1919 ( TIME , January 17 , 1927 ) . <P> Check in bank , Senator Couzens returned to his favorite sport , Mellon-baiting . Said he : " This is a concrete piece of evidence of mismanagement of the Bureau of Internal Revenue under the greatest Secretary of the Treasury since Hamilton 's time . . . . "
