txt Niagara Falls have long been a bone of : ontention between those who want to ) ut them to work turning more indusrial wheels and those who wish to see heir scenic beauty left immaculate . The ) over companies already divert , through heir sluices and turbines , enough water .0 release almost unbelievable electrical ; nergy . It has been said that if a single me of the dynamos in one of the power louses at the Falls could manage to grapple a modern battleship , it could in s. few hours ' time hoist it as high as Everest . Naturally , the companies would like to divert even more water . But the uonservationists , fearful that the beauty of the Falls might be destroyed , have been on their guard , lest the processes of nature he reversed and too many diamonds turned into coal . There are extremists on both sides , but fortunately sober citizens also , who have been wondering whether it might not be possible to effect a compromise and possibly provide for additional diversion without a sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and Canada which are now under way . They are a natural sequence to the report of the International Niagara Board . Some years ago President-elect HOOVER , then Secretary of Commerce and chairman of the American St. Lawrence Commission , paid a visit to the Falls and noted how bare the flanks were and how the water seemed to be cutting a deep notch in the middle of the famous Horseshoe . He expressed the fear , then shared by other engineers , that the Falls might be " committing suicide . " The Niagara Falls Power Company had already built a model to show how works could be built in the river in such a way as to preserve the Falls and at the same time allow more water to be put to industrial use . Ultimately , a special commission was set up to look into the matter , composed of two men representing Canada and two representing the United States , one of the latter being Dr. J. HORACE MCFARLAND , past president of the American Civic Association , who could be counted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Niagara . In its interim report , published last Spring , the commission was able to dispel much of the anxiety about the Falls . They are not bent on self-destruction . The notch is apparently only a passing phase in the gradual recession of the crest , and the configuration of the floor of the rapids above the Falls is such that in a few years the Horseshoe is likely to be more impressive than ever , provided more water can be induced to flow over the flanks . To effect this no elaborate protective works are needed . The commission suggested that a little excavation and a few submerged weirs would do the trick , at a cost of only $1,750,000 . The present negotiations no doubt look to the approval of some such measures by both governments . Of course , there is in the background the question of additional diversion , but that should not be allowed until the works have been completed and actual tests made .                   @ @
