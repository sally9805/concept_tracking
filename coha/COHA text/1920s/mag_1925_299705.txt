Previously it had been thought , even by mortgage lenders and large operators , that the " building boom " was past its peak , and the evidence of unrented offices and apartments confirmed this view . But the ease in the money market has evidently set the construction industry in motion again . <P> According to reports of the F. W. Dodge Corporation , made last week , building operations last April were the largest for any month on record , and amounted to $546,970,700 . The month of April , 1925 , thus shows an increase of 14% over March , 1925 , and of 13% over April , 1924 . <P> The April totals for contracts awarded include : $256,414,300 ( 47% ) for residential buildings . <P> $95,432,400 ( 17% ) for public works and utilities . <P> $63,988,900 ( 12% ) for commercial buildings . <P> $46,567,900 ( 9% ) for industrial buildings . <P> $33,154,600 ( 6% ) for educational buildings . <P> <P> In work contemplated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April was also shown .
