Looming over the 9,000-acre campus of Leland Stanford Junior University , on the side of San Juan Hill , is a grey pile of masonry suggestive of an administration building and at the same time , with its terraced roofs for outdoor living , reminiscent of the communal dwellings that the Zui Indians used to build . No lawn and scant shrubbery relieve the austere approach . Within , all is spacious and gracious , the solidly furnished home of the family of a man of large affairs . Here lives Nominee Hoover . Hither he was returning last week to await formal notification of his high honor . <P> Stanford University , of which Alumnus Hoover has been a guiding force since his graduation in 1895 , was very much astir for the impending event .

Like any other social microcosm , the Stanford community ( faculty , students , trustees , alumni ) has its discontented minority-men who will never agree that all Hoover has done for Stanford has been for the best . They complain , chiefly , that under the Hoover influence-he has been on the Board of Trustees since 1912 - Stanford has changed from a liberal arts college of limited enrolment , which it was founded to be , into an evergrowing institute of technology . None knew better than Herbert Hoover the stipulations of the late Senator Stanford 's bequest . But after he had formed his own philosophy for industrial civilization , Hoover said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So mass education came in . The oldtime stars of the faculty , like John Branner and Dr. David Starr Jordan ( since 1916 president-emeritus ) , were surrounded and succeeded by run-of-the-mill instructors . Classics receded before technical subjects to the point where , for example , courses in art are now open only to students requiring such knowledge as the utilitarian equipment of a teaching career .
