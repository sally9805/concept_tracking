A dinner at which prominent men from Northern Ireland and from the Free State assembled was given last week by the Irish Club in London . Sir James Craig , Premier of Ulster , was unable to attend on account of the death of his brother ; President ( Premier ) William T. Cosgrave of the Free State was unable to be present ; but Governor General " Tim " Healy of the Irish Free State , " Tay Pay " O'Connor ( the only Irish Nationalist member of the House of Commons-known as " the Father of the House " ) , and the Duke of York , among others , were present . <P> The Duke of York twitted " Tay Pay . " He had , he said , heard only one complaint about him and that was that he was willing to do everything for Ireland except live there . <P> Governor Healy , " squat and square as the first Napoleon , " rose amid cheers to pay tribute to King George for the part he played in the Irish settlement : * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Ireland so wrung his Majesty 's heart that , but for him , no approach to a truce or settlement would have been possible . " <P> * It is common knowledge that King George insisted upon going to Belfast in 1921 against the advice of his Ministers . Moreover , he wrote his own speech-the speech which called for peace and settlement and which committed the British Government to making an agreement with the South ( later the Free State ) - and , so rumor has it , told Premier George , who threatened resignation , that that was the speech he would utter whatever he ( the Premier ) might do . Lloyd George has never denied this story , perhaps from a desire not to oppose the King ; but the chief truth of this bald version of the Kings action is that His Majesty played a leading part in the Irish settlement , as is well proved oy numerous tributes from eminent men .
