Said Newspaperdom , a journalistic trade sheet , in an editorial : <P> " Time , the news weekly , looks down rather disdainfully on the New York News . We never have been able to understand why . They both have much in common . Their size is not radically different ; both run pictures ; and the purpose of each is to condense the news of the world in the smallest possible space and here and there through it all planting little seeds of thought from which great ideas will grow and make this a happier place for all of us . They differ only in the selection of the community class they have decided to serve . <P> " Time 's frequent reference to the News as ' the gum-chewers ' sheet ' undoubtedly brings a smile from Dr. Marvin acting President of Rutgers University and his kind ; but it is as nothing to the giggle that would sweep Manhattan if the News would forget its manners and frequently ' brand the readers of Time as ' hairless-browed nuts ' * <P> " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they supply in their particular fields . From the standpoint of leading the world upward , the leadership of the News is much more important than that of Time . There are many more persons in the community the News has selected ; and it is in greater need of leadership . <P> " The News has started by leading its community class to read regularly ; and after that its following is going to think . The News , in the meantime , will continue financially successful so long as it maintains leadership . Permitting itself to be led , Time might step in and take its circulation . " <P> * " High brow , " the definition implied by Newspaperdom , is a loose , archaic slang-word , absurd in its application to the normal , intelligent people for whom TIME is written . <P> +TIME is a digest of fact . It professes to have no bias . It professes it is not trying to " lead " anyone anywhere .                 @ @ @ @
