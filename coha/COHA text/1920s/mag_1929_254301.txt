" We wish to send our new booklet to a select list of girls . . . . You likely know of some such girls in your town or elsewhere , and can send their names and addresses to me for this purpose ( confidentially , if you prefer not to be quoted ) . We shall appreciate the courtesy and reciprocate with the usual honorarium of $25 for each girl you list who may attend Glen Eden through this information ; or $50 if the attendance be consummated with the help of your personal influence . Our school and myself being perhaps unknown to you , may I suggest reference to Who 's Who in America and to Sargent 's Directory of American Private Schools . . . " <P> ( rubber-stamped ) " F. M. TOWNSEND " <P> So ran a letter received lately by many a minister in the East . One minister , an Episcopalian , at once sat down and wrote indignantly to The Churchman ( liberal weekly ) : " This sort of thing is an insult to the ministry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sargent 's Directory of American Schools says that Glen Eden , " is a finishing school offering a wide range of electives with special facilities in music , art , domestic science , expression , dramatics , physical culture and athletics . " <P> Who 's Who reveals that Dr. Frederic Martin Townsend , Glen Eden 's founder-director , was graduated by the University of Michigan and the College of St. Francis Xavier , Manhattan . For a time he was director of the National Park Seminary in Forest Glen , Md. , near Washington . Perhaps that is why he affixed a " Glen " to the Poughkeepsie " Eden " which he founded in 1910 and moved to Stamford , Conn , in 1919 . Before he founded Glen Eden he conducted parties of summer tourists to Europe . His excuse for circularizing ministers to drum up a clientele was that Glen Eden is to be a " Church boarding school , " a " worthy project " for which he desired " a discriminating publicity .
