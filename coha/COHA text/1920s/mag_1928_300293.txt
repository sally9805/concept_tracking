Liquor being a not illegal commodity in parts of Canada , Canadian government officials can not directly prohibit exporters from shipping their wares to the U. S. When 30 liquor docks were closed last week at Windsor , Ont. , the reason given was not the well known fact that many a shipment consigned to " Cuba , " " Mexico . " " Nassau , " etc. etc. , was going straight across the water to Detroit . But National Revenue Minister Euler represented that Canada 's export tax on liquor was being consistently evaded . Chairman Sir Henry Drayton of the Ontario ( provincial ) Liquor Control Board , also complained that export liquor was being smuggled back into Canada , often " cut " in the dreadful U. S. bootleg way , and distributed through unlicensed channels . <P> Not without its share in causing such official announcements , is diplomatic pressure by the U. S. in Canada . Last week the State Department announced that revision of the U. S.-Canadian anti-smuggling treaty of 1924 was under negotiation-an announcement meaning that U. S. Minister William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S.-Canadian border more tightly against liquor will probably be held next month . <P> Simultaneously with the closing of the 30 docks at Windsor , eleven U. S. border-patrol inspectors were arrested in Detroit by their superiors and charged with bribe-taking , conspiracy .
