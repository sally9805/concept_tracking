txt Into the controversy about polluted waters and beaches near New York The Engineering News - Record has stepped with a plea that the solution of the problem should be left to engineers , and that politicians should keep their hands off " except as the " latter choose from possible engineer " ing methods the one mast likely to " meet the demands of an intelligent " public opinion rather than of polit " ical expedience or revenge . " This pretty generalizatiwi ignores the Tact that , although the solution must be found by engineers , the problem itself directly concerns the public , whether or not the politicians leave it alone . A large section of the public , ? in New York as well as New Jersey , has seen with its own eyes that it is high time for the engineers to get busy and find a solution , and for the politicians to see that the solution is carried out . What the public saw was that during the early part of this Summer the beaches were unusually foul . Whence came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was so great as to make it highly improbable that it came from ships . The natural inference was that it came from the city 's scows . A complaint was followed by a cessation of excessive pollution . Since additional precautions have been taken to see that the city 's scows dump far out to sea , the beaches have been cleaner . To those who saw the filth on the beaches when it was most abundant , it was clear that , even if it did not actually menace the health of those who used the beaches , it was at least unsanitary , unsavory and unnecessary . Dead animals --  and rotting vegetables lying in the sun in large quantities covered with flies are generally considered inimical to the public welfare . Nor has it yet been shown ( even by engineers ) that salt water polluted with the refuse from a great city is altogether healthy for those who bathe in it . What the public wanted was cleaner beaches . It was and is perfectly ready to - leave the solution to engineers so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an ideal world the engineers would doubtless plan and execute without even acknowledging the existence of politicians . But in New York these gentlemen control the purse-strings . . So far as concerns a definite solution , The Engineering News-Record points out the significant fact that New York . is spending large sums for a primitive method of garbage and iefuse disposal . It wisely adds that under existing conditions affecting incineration and garbage reduction " it " is conceivable , until competent en " gineering , studies demonstrate the " facts one way or the other , that " New York 's refuse might be towed " so far out to sea as to insure its " never or rarely returning to shore , " at less cost , than the net cost of re " duction or incineration . " If this be found true . the people will have ' no possible objection to such a solution ? provided the refuse is actually taken far enough out to sea . The public wants unpolluted waters . It is quite ready to let engineers do the planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
