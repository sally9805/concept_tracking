Alice <P> ALICE IN THE DELIGHTED STATES-Edward Hope-Lincoln MacVeagh , Dial Press ( $2.50 ) . <P> Alice in Wonderland , loved these many years by doctor , lawyer , merchant , chief , was also loved by a newspaperman-very , very much . The offshoot of the affair was a daughter , also Alice , who started her pilgrimage through North Hysterica just as her mother 's manuscript body was being cruelly contested by the book-collectors . Once in the Delighted States , by way of the stem of a drinking glass , Alice Jr . revolved with the Rotarians round a luncheon table , but when she refused to make a speech the Rotarian next to her feared the girl was moody : " That comes from being too subjunctive and makes the situation tense . " Alice thereupon recited a poem for them . Suddenly her entire audience scuttled and scampered off to escape the American Mercurial twins , Twaddle-dum and Twiddle-dee , now that you mencken it , one with H. L. M. embroidered on his collar , and the other , G. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain her . But Alice declared herself bored , and immediately the two little men vanished , leaving her to walk the Primrose Path . . . . <P> Then Alice begins to grow up , much too large for her clothes . This so incenses the censor that he sends her to the court of appeals-sex appeals . The pressing press immediately takes her up , while the lawyers of the Persecution and Pretense select a jury of frightened white rabbits , parrots , and a sleepy possum that could not think what his name was . The judge , also dozing , is bound in red tape-red ribbons as Alice calls it . A very cross examination is interrupted by more news : PRIZE BEAUTY SLAYS LOVE MATE WITH ICE PICK AFTER JAZZ PARTY IN RICH NEST , and Alice 's trial is over . Alice is advised to go into vaudeville , or write her Life Story , on the strength of her recent publicity , but she goes to W7ash-ington instead , and comes very near making hystery . <P> Alice in Wonderland is a joke that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn , do not . The same categories apply to the joke by Alice Jr . ' s father , Colyumist Hope of the New York Herald-Tribune . Though his verse falls far short of Lewis Carroll 's the narrative ( packed as it is with social &; political quips , flagrant puns and rare etymology ) does credit to the English mathematician , and surpasses in satire more serious-minded modern U. S. Jeremiads . So also Rea Irvin 's illustrations , which are excellently done . <P> <P> On Page 143 DAISY AND DAPHNE-Rose Macaulay-Boni &; Liveright ( $2.50 ) . <P> Closer than David &; Jonathan , closer than Manuel &; Esteban , were Daisy &; Daphne . Closer because their relationship was not that of equals : Daisy admired from the depths of her self-disgust , Daphne tolerated from the fastnesses of her self-confidence . And because Daisy 's inferiority complex cowered behind Daphne 's blithe assurance , Daphne was bound the closer by protective responsibility for the girl she despised .                 @ @ @ @
