Progressive cities and towns , like efficient firms , are good advertisers , the main difference being that the former do not spend much money on this modern cult . <P> One of the greatest auto-advertisers is the Middle Western City of Chicago . One thing dear to the heart of the gumchewing section of Chicago is a joke at the expense of New Yorkers . <P> So when Harry J. Luce , President of Maillard , Inc. , ( euphemism for a restaurant at which the privileged few can toy with a few dainties at an an exclusive price ) " discovered Chicago " and forthwith leased 20,000 square feet of floor space in the Straus Building , the Chicago Tribune , which as everyone knows is the " world 's greatest newspaper , " splurged for a whole column . <P> The simple story was that Mr. Luce desired the floor space for a new restaurant which is to cater to Chicago 's fastidious few . The Tribune must have more " kick , " so it vapored about " a few daring New Yorkers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telling their friends about it . Mr. Luce had been told by " some such explorer " that Chicago existed , but he had been cold to his informer ; for he remembered that " a fourth cousin of his on a western hunting trip " had sent him a postcard of the place . <P> All this is contained in the auto-advertising slogan of : " Do n't Knock , Boost " ; but to boost successfully something apparently has to be knocked , which , while amusing the gum-chewers also serves to maintain the world 's greatest newspaper .
