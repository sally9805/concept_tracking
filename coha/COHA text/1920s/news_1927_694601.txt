txt This has been in some ways the most interesting flight I have ever made . For one thing , 1 . ' did more " instrument flying " than I did in the Atlantic - flight and I managed to get completely lost in the fog over Mexico and had considerable difficulty in finding my way again . It is a rather odd fact that I kept . a better course , when I , was flying blind for much of the time , during the night , than during the day , when I hit out from Tampico to Mexico City . Something went wrong and I guess it was me. , There were some moments during the two hours I was wandering around over Mexico when there was not much comfort in the terrain beneath me . There were  --  not many landing fields. , . , ? . - - Trip- Made in Face of Difficulties .

The . entire trip was made in the face of some difficulties which , I think , show conclusively the importance of cross-country training in flying . The Weather Bureau did not promise me good weather , but they did say that it was not an impossible bar to the flight . They- were entirely accurate . The weather was not good . It , was 12:25 o'clock Washington time , or 11:25 o'clock Mexican time , when I took off from Bolling Field . The take-off was not difficult . The tailskid stuck in the mud a little , but as soon as 1 got ' , that out the tail lifted easily and we got away easily long before we hit the . puddles . Fog , Showers and ' Rain Waiting for Him . The Weather Bureau had predicted . fog , showers and rain. , They were all waiting for us . After leaving Washington there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible to see through them , and considerable haze . This lasted down to North Carolina , where at 5:45 P. M. it . became dark as I was , still in the mountains . It was very dark then and up to midnight ' there was no moon . The sky was . overcast arid there was rain at frequent intervals throughout the night and sometimes heavy showers . It was almost impossible to see the horizon for much of the time , although occasionally it was possible to make out lights on the ground . It was during this period that instrument flying was necessary . I have never done so much of it before , even on the flight to Paris , for there were only about three hours then that I was flying absolutely blind and there were four to five hours of this ' trip when instruments were absolutely necessary ..

When I refer to instrument- flying , I mean the time during which it is impossible to keep the plane on a level keel , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show an instant deviation from the horizontal or vertical path of the plane . After 10 o'clock the moon came up and I think the first sight of the ground which was possible after leaving Washington was somewhere in Mississippi . Then 1 laid a course for the Gulf and.hit it fairly close to the course which had been plotted . Over Mexico I had not plotted courses , incidentally , and the flying was by Maps bought in the United States , which were not always accurate . a t a Guided ' by Surf in the Fog . When the Gulf Coast was reached there was a fog.for two or three hours and there was no check , after dark , from North Carolina ' until we were well down on the Mexican coast . While following the coast in the fog it was necessary to- come down low over the water , sometimes only two or three hundred feet above the white line of surf , and I often lost that and flew blind until I could pick it up again . It was far from pleasant flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length ? of the night . On the flight to France there was only about five hours of darkness because the direction was from west to east against the sun because of the northern latitude . ? ? ? But on this flight the direction was slightly west and in southern latitudes , where the nights are long . Consequently iliere were thirteen hours'and thirty minutes of darkness , and it vas impossible to get away from the necessity of instrument flying . Recogniied Tampico by Oil Tanks . When I got to Tampico I recognized the city by the oil tanks , despite the heavy curtain . I fog which lay over it . I came down within fifty - feet of the river . But Was unable to get beneath the fog and so I went up again and set a compass course for Mexico City . At a thousand feet it was . possible to get over the clouds and everything seemed set- for an easy flight from there to the flying field .. But I- must have made'some:bad errors , for when I dived down out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of Mexico City . It is rather amazing that the calculations by instrument flying should have been exact all night and that the course was maintained , but that when daylight came and another course was set over the clouds I got completely lost . Such , however , is the . fart . ? I judge that I must have been about fifty miles u est of the course when I went down ' below the clouds , but I have no way of knowing certainly . That . was rather a puzzler . I knew I was in a bad country to play around in . I tried to puzzle out where I was by the watersheds , and noticed that south of the , line of mountains which ran through the southern end of the State of Mexico the rivers all ran south , and that from a chain of mountains ' to the ' east they all ran east . So I imagined that if I kept north and east of these mountains and combed the entire territory that would be able to recognize some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set Right by Hotel Sign . But it was not until I. saw a sign of the Hotel Toluca that I really Maniged'to get located and then set my course again for Mexico City . i had been going only a little while when I saw the planes of the Mexican Army coming ' to meet me and I was very glad to greet my comrades of the air in this way . Of the reception I can only say that it was equal , in all its sincerity , with that which I received in France and England and on my return to America . Every one has been kind , and I look forward with pleasure to my stay in Mexico , which I trust will make the Mexican people realize that , after all . we have many things in common . The bond of aviation is a great one between men who devote their lives to it , and Mexico has some splendid pilots . There is a difference in all receptions , and I can only say that that of Mexico has been unique and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the admirable way in which the field was policed , and the protection given to my plane . I am grateful to both President Canes and General Alvarez for the great courtesy and consideration they showed me . I have always wanted to come to Mexico and I am glad to be here . The flying field is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen and very Smooth . I hope I shall see more-of Mexico 's aviation in the next days .
