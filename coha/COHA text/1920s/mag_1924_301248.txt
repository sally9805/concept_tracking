Farrar-fans roared vociferously , " tossed their sweaty nightcaps in the air , " and bore off such prizes as they could from the ensuing auction sale of the prima donna 's stage trappings . <P> For two years thereafter , Miss Farrar , dark and passionate , made only concert appearances , while the fair-haired , blue-eyed , milky-armed Jeritza held the central position in the Metropolitan 's female galaxy . <P> Now , however , the Farrar Carmen is coming back . Geraldine 's manager announced last week that an independent company is being formed . Its repertoire will consist of but one opera - Bizet 's masterpiece . The singers , revolving like planets around the central Farrar-sun , will all be artists of proved ability , the orchestra will be conducted by a " former conductor of the Metropolitan , " the dances will be arranged by the " foremost Russian master of choregraphy now resident " in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs by an atelier in West 57th St. , Manhattan , and the scenic effects will be suggested by the paintings of Zoloaga . Farrar and Zoloaga are the only names actually mentioned in connection with the enterprise so far .
