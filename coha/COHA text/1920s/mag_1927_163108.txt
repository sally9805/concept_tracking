And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance. - ACTS II : 4 , <P> Uproar broke forth in John Roach Straton 's Calvary Baptist Church , Manhattan , last week ; loud cries were raised for the police . In one corner of the church stood members of the Monday night Bible class , praying , faced by five deacons and their aids . <P> The Bible class members had worked themselves into hysteria , declared the deacons . They had been practicing Pentecostalism assiduously , vehemently . In the description of Reporter Hugh O'Connor of the New York Herald Tribune , " prayer meetings continued late into the night , with men and women intoning Scripture , chanting hymns and imploring the Holy Spirit with ardent cries to come into their souls-at times even falling to the floor of the church and lying outstretched on their backs , rigid , while their lips streamed mystical sounds , supposed to duplicate the ' Gift of Tongues , ' such as accompanied the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Biblical account of the first Pentecost . " <P> Uldine Utley , pupil of Evangelist Aime Semple McPherson and protge of Calvary Bapist 's Pastor John Roach Straton , had brought this abnormality into the congregation last January . Like prosperous Mrs. McPherson the stripling girl has the knack of exciting Pentecostal frenzies from her auditors , of throwing them into thaumaturgic fits . Warren Badenock Straton , 19 , third son of the pastor ( the sons are Rev. Hillyer Hawthorne , John Charles , Warren Badenock , George Douglas ) had had his " soul saved " in this fashion . The Monday night Bible class had sought " saving " to such an extent that the deacons had ordered class sessions discontinued at 10 p. m . Mondays . ( This was after they had discovered members of the class sprawled deliriously on the church building floor at 2 a. m. one Tuesday . ) The Monday that Aviator Charles Augustus Lindbergh reached Manhattan a woman went into ecstasies in the church . <P> For all this Pastor John Roach Straton was responsible , cried five deacons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease . Indignant , members of the Bible class , huddled together like college students yelling for their team , prayed that the Holy Spirit strike Deacon John Hurst , chairman of the Evangelistic committee , in salvation or else in punishment . Before police might come , sober members of the congregation hushed the malcontents . The deacons resigned .
