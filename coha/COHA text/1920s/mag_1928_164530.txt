" . . . Many thanks for the welcome to Wisconsin extended on behalf of your State as well as yourself . We are looking forward to a most enjoyable summer . " <P> The trace of informality in this letter from President Coolidge to Governor Fred Zimmerman of Wisconsin suggested the spirit in which the President 's summer outing was being planned . White House familiars said that , whereas the President attended his Rapid City office five days per week last year , trips this year from Cedar Island Lodge to the office in the Superior , Wis. , high school would be kept down to three or four per week . <P> At the Wisconsin end , preparations buzzed . Roads were oiled . An electric canceling ' machine was sent to the Brule , Wis. , post office to help Postmaster Harold E. Webster handle the swollen mail . Arrangements were also made to have air mail delivered specially to and from Brule . <P> Electricians swarmed through the cedar groves stringing telegraph wires and radio aerials . The U. S. Radio Commission notified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure good reception at the Summer White House . <P> Enterprising persons bid up the rents of all available house space in small Brule . Gift " shoppes " opened . Tourists arrived to look around long before the Coolidges ' trunks were even half-packed in far away Washington . <P> In Madison , Wis. , a jeweler was set to work making a gold button which , when inserted in the Coolidge lapel , will signify that he , a nonresident of Wisconsin , is legally licensed to take fish from Wisconsin waters . Boy Scouts in Superior " chipped in " for a $55 fishing rod to give the President . <P> Someone recalled that President Grover Cleveland fished the Brule River in 1894 , as the guest of the St. Paul Club . Antoine Denny , oldtime caretaker of the club 's lodge on the Brule , was reported to be still at his post , eager to take care of another President . <P> In Washington , the party chosen to board the Coolidge Special for Brule grew to 60 , to 80 , to 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did not account for Rob Roy ( white collie ) , Terrible Tim ( red chow ) , Diana ( white collie ) , Bessie ( yellow collie ) , King Cole ( black police dog ) and the five White House canaries , all of whom were going too . <P> Besides Secretaries Sanders and Clark , Physicians Coupal and Boone , and Colonel J. Osmun Latrobe ( aide ) , all of whom receive public mention fairly frequently , the moving of the White Household reminded citizens of White Housekeeper ( Mrs. ) Ellen Riley and of Personal Stenographer Erwin Geisser , who transcribed the famed " I do not choose " last summer . <P> Mrs. Coolidge , after some hesitation , let it be known that she would forego seeing John Coolidge graduated at Amherst College and go direct to Brule with the President . <P> The Coolidge Special got up steam . Behind it , when it started , would lie a Capital devoid of newsful Governmental activity save for the Federal Trade Commission 's lively but long-drawn investigation of the Power Trust . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
