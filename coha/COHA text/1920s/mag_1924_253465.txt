Capable son of a capable father , John Hays Hammond Jr . sailed in to the port of New York back from a fresh conquest . He came from Rome , ancient city of the Caesars and brought back a triumph . <P> In the first place , he had arranged with the Italian Government for the formation of a semi-official radio casting company , to have the monopoly of the air in Italy . The name of the company is the United Broadcasting Co. of Italy . It is a coalition of a number of companies , chief of which are the Sirac ( Hammond ) , Radiofono ( Marconi ) , Italian Western Electric and Radio Araldo ( owned ' by a banking group ) . The coalition is to build three radiocasting stations . One at Milan with 395 metre wavelength , one at Rome with 425 metre wavelength and one at Taranto or Messina with 455 metre wavelength . <P> The semi-official nature of this enterprise is evident in all the provisions made . By arrangement with the Government , the coalition will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or annual fees , from those who have receiving sets to get the benefit of the radiocasting . The Government reserves the right to use the radiocasting stations during the hours of 1 to 2 and 7 to 8 ( p. m. ) daily . Doubtless , although Mr. Hammond did not say so , the Government will exercise a strict censorship and employ radiocasting for propaganda purposes . Having obtained complete subservience of the press , Mussolini 's next step was naturally to master the radio . This has gone to the extent that all radio equipments must be of Italian manufacture , and foreign parts can not even be imported for assembly . <P> This is typical " Mussolini . " But the interesting part of Mr. Hammond 's arrangement is the provision for making radio listeners pay for their entertainment . <P> The other important result of Mr. Hammond 's trip was the approval which the Italian Government gave to his system of narrowcasting , or secret radio . This system employs short wavelengths , superimposed with high frequency modulations . Unless a receiving station was properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own phrase , " to straighten out the dents in the rays , " the message could not be made out . <P> The advantages of his system are that it permits multiplexing ( sending several messages at once ) , that it is largely free from atmospheric disturbance and can achieve great distance . He went so far as to declare that " using the new methods of photographic transmission , it will be possible to flash complete pages of print across the Atlantic , increasing the transmission speeds in this way enormously . " <P> This invention of Mr. Hammond Jr . is the product of 14 years ' work-although at the present he is still a young man of 36 . The younger John Hays had his early schooling abroad , partly in France , partly in England , partly in South Africa , where his father was working with Cecil Rhodes. *
