Sacks <P> Sirs : <P> TIME-Vol . XI-No. 24-Territories- " The Pit " . . . . <P> Those sacks that you see the natives carrying along the white , beautiful roads on Sunday morning contain , sometimes , cocks . . . . And , what about it ? There is no doubt that you will find the same flask of bitter liquor , the knife , volleys of cheers and curses , and many other things in many another American sport . Cockfighting is one of their sports and they will stick to it , same as Americans stick to theirs . <P> I am a Porto Rican , proud of my country ! <P> <P> A. O. RIVERA <P> Lancaster , Pa . <P> <P> " Drinking Man " ? <P> <P> Sirs : <P> Is Governor Al . Smith a drinking man ? <P> I maintain that he might occasionally take a drink but could not be classed as a drinking man . <P> <P> CHAS . E. HEMPSTEAD <P> Cupples Company , Des Moines , la . <P> <P> Candidate Smith , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional cocktail and highball , relishes a stein of cool Mnchener beer . Candidate Smith is no alcoholic , no inebriate . Neither secretaries nor friends can recall when overindulgence has forced him to shirk his official duties . ' Unless all who drink are drinking men , TIME would not classify him as a drinking man. - ED . <P> <P> Optometry <P> Sirs : <P> Shame on TIME ! The idea of you allowing your columns to be used as a means of spreading propaganda for the medical profession to the detriment of other schools . It just goes to show that even TIME can be hoodwinked . <P> In your issue of June 18 , under the caption Medicine you say " the irregular medical schools such as chiropractic , naturopathy , optometry ( and others ) are falling before the onslaught of legal medicine and legislation . " Be fair TIME . Your correspondent neglected to inform you that in 1905 there were 153 medical schools in the U. S. , while at present there are only 69 such schools . All professions have increased their requirements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consolidate with a stronger institution or else " pass out of the picture . " During these years optometry has been building-true , a few of our " weak sister " schools have closed their doors , but during this same time we have established courses in Optometry at Columbia University ( New York City ) , University of Rochester ( Rochester , N. Y. ) , Ohio State University ( Columbus , Ohio ) , University of California ( Berkeley , Calif. ) and have many other institutions which confine their curricula to optometry exclusively . <P> Optometry is recognized as a separate profession from medicine in every state in the Union as well as in the District of Columbia . Separate Boards of Examiners in Optometry are appointed in the several states to administer the Optometry Laws . <P> Do you suppose , TIME , that any of your readers believe that Universities such as mentioned above would carry courses in Optometry , of four years duration , if , by placing a student in the medical school for the same length of time they could teach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
