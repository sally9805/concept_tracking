If Explorer Roy Chapman Andrews , Dack at Peking last week after four months in the Gobi Desert , was quoted correctly in despatches , he has found the skull of antique monster more stupendous than any ever before learned of by man . <P> The head is broad , shaped like a saddle , and weighs 400 Ibs . That itself indicates colossal body . But Dr. Andrews ' first comparison-and there is little evidence that the cable garbled his words-was unbelievable . As quoted , he said that the beast was " about the size of the Woolworth Building if the building were in a horizontal position . " The Woolworth Building is 792 ft. high . <P> At the American Museum of Natural History , for which Dr. Andrews explores , Dr. George G. Simpson , of the Museum 's department of vertebrate paleontology , last week pooh-poohed his colleague 's cable-quoted magnification . Said he : " At most it could n't be more than 150 ft . The largest animal in existence is the whale and it never exceeds 100 ft . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at first jesting with newspapermen . Serious now , he compared the old beast to a story and a half house , 25 ft. tall by 25 ft. deep . With its heavy head it belonged to the rhinoceros family , ate the leaves of low trees . <P> Dr. Andrews ' own official despatch , directly to the Museum last week , merely mentioned the find among others . Splendidly succinct it read : <P> " Expedition travels 5,000 miles . Explores ; maps much new country . Discovers new geological formations , fossil deposits . Finds residence sites dune dwellers , culture everywhere , yielding thousands stone implements , decorated bones , shells , tooth necklace , indicating that 20,000 years ago Mongolia more densely populated than today . <P> " Have ninety cases fossils . Two skulls , many bones , skeleton of gigantic new mammal , possibly larger than Baluchitherium . Humerus big as man 's body . Huge titanothere , extraordinary saddle-like skull . New mastodon , spatulate jaw , lower incisors eighteen inches wide . <P> " We consider extremely successful expedition . Unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew up several cases of gasoline . <P> Dr. Andrews came to two important conclusions : 1 ) That titanotheres , large horned quadrupeds which became extinct in America in the early Oligocene period ( geologically fairly recent ) , lasted for a much longer period in Mongolia ; 2 ) That mastodons were , in the same period , en their way from Africa to Western Europe , Siberia and North America .
