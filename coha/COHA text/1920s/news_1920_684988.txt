txt Rome conquered the world and/eft it bound in law . The Romans were few in number but powerful in patriotism and justice . Their successors in the modern world have been the men of England  --  powerful in patriotism and justice . Their ideals were still ours when we rested government upon the shoulders of the masses . Yet , our immigration from England has been relatively small . We have records only for 300 years past and they show that of the 33,000,000 immigrants to this ' country , less than four millions were from Great Britain , while nearly 4,350,000 came from Ireland . IMMIGRANTS AND NATIONAL IDEALS It will astonish most people , however , to know that our large immigration has been from Germany and totals nearly 5,500,000 . It is of modern date and has had the smallest impress in ideals upon the nation . Teuton ideals have never flourished outside of Germany . They have been based upon force and have been resented by other nations , peoples and colonies . Italy and Austria-Hungary have each sent us a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these four kingdoms 66% , or two-thirds of our immigration : Russia has given us only 10% , or 3,300,000 ; Scandinavia a little over 2,000,000 , and all other countries 5,900.000 , or less than 1S% . English immigration has been most effective because it was the earliest . Irish immigration was in tic decade from 1845 to 1854 and was started by the Irish famine . It gave the United States brawn and muscle workers on lands and roads . The movement from Scandinavia was from 1880 to 1900 . Since 1900 Italy , Austria-Hungary . Russia and Southeastern Europe have led the procession to this country and for several years preceding the war , the ocean swept in upon us more than a million souls per annum . The panic of /P9.7 arrested the wave crest at 3,285.349 . The year preceding the war , or the 12 months to June 30 , 1914 , saw an inflow of 1,218,480 .

The flood-gates of Russia and of southern and eastern Europe had been opened upon our shores and the alarm bell was sounding only against Japan and China . ' Now we.have had time to think and determine how far we can , without danger to ourselves , be our brother 's keeper And invite to our table of national prosperity the whole unlettered and untutored world . We have now thirty regulations concerning immigration , the statutes of which ? need amendment . The latest one ? relates to illiteracy . If an illiterate family of goodintentions , ambitious to be a part of United States citizenship , and assist to develop our wealth of lands and minerals , expresses a desire to make its home in the United States , that family should not be barred because the autocracies and social burdens of Europe have kept them illiterate . MORE LAWS NECESSARY Right here two further laws are necessary . Intentions should be known by foreign representatives of the United States and immigrants should be permitted to enter and go to that part of the United States whore they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will strengthen the future brain and sinew of the land as well as its principles for human freedom . Government regulation of immigration beginning at foreign ports should pass the deiirable immigrants to destinations in the States without permitting congestion in cities and mill centers . In this way the United Statei can best serve its fellow man and promote Christian civilization . An open door for the heathen of all lands to enter and make foreign soil of any part of the United States should not be permitted . OUR EARLY IMMIGRATION The danger was not apparent in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Our immigation for the first nundred years after the founding of our republic was from intelligent or God-fearing countries in the north and west of Europe which so late as 1S82 furnished 71% of our immigrants , when only 11% came from southern and eastern Europe . But in 1902 only 21% was arriving from northern and western Europe and 75% was incoming from southern and eastern Europe . Up to 1870 northern and western Europe , including Switzerland and Scandinavia , had sent us nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern and eastern Europe . Thus only one in a hundred of our immigration had come from Austria-Hungary , Serbia , Montenegro . Greece , Italy , Poland , Portugal . Roumania , Russia , Spain and Turkey . Harm TIDES FROM ? RUSSIA ASD THE TROPICS But in the decade up to 1880 the proportion had risen from 1% to 10% , or 201,000 from the countries above named , and 2,071,000 from northern and western Europe . In the decade to 1890 the proportion had risen to 25% with 960,000 from Russia and southern Europe against 3:780,000 from northern Europe . In the last decade of the last century the lower countries furnished the major immigration . 1,942.000 as compared with 1,644,000 from the northern countries . Now comes the astonishing change . The first ten yearS of the 20 years we have lived in this century give 6,300.000 from southern Europe and only 1.911.000 from all other sources of immigration and these proportions continued up to the outbreak of the war in 1914 ? more than three from southern Europe to one from northern Europe . TIIEDANGER FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Ingersoll declared that health and mental life and freedom were from the north and not from the south . " Mate a Harvard college professor with a Wellesley graduate lassie and send him to the tropical islands and in a few generations you will find their descendants with a cro  --  nless straw hat , and astride a mule with a rooster under each arm , going to a cockfight on Sunday . " Even Ingersoll saw the danger to the Sabbatical institutions and Christian civilization of the United States from the tropics . The Smithsonian Institution has carried on extensive experiments and clearly proven that brain vitality develops in the temperate zones and decreases with every degree of heat above a normal temperature . THE LESSON OF LIFE All the deleterious bacterial life that keeps the invisible atmospheres at war for our protection is stimulated and propagated by high temperatures . All the consumption fever in human lung and brain is killed by light working in a cool temperature . We must have a certain amount of evil bacterial life to keep the good bacteria at work . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to keep active good citizenship . We must absorb a measure of warm color in art and architecture from the Italian and the Turk , and can take to our national bosom a measure of the warmhearted Russian peasantry . AMERICANISM But we must receive all these only as we can digest them and make them and their descendants American citizens with American ideals founded upon Roman and English justice and Christian brotherhood . Otherwise our ideals are endangered and we lose our opportunity for political and social and economic good both within and without our own country . We are our brother 's keeper only so far as we can do him good and not permit him to do us harm . The American defense is not primarily in ships of war or home guns in array . Our national defense is primarily in patriotism and justice and united ideals that promote and defend that " fine sweet spirit of nationality  --  the nationality of America . "
