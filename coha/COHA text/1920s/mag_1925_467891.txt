THAT the April number of this magazine comes out may be accepted as a sign that the world did not come to an end on the sixth of February , as was so confidently expected by a few people , and so widely advertised in the newspapers . Coming along after the eclipse of the sun , the end of the world would have been timely enough in these parts where the eclipse was visible , for that of course reminded one that all affairs of Earth are transitory , and not so durable as they look to us . Nevertheless , to the Easy Chair , Earth 's finish in February did not look likely . Predictions of the end of the world almost always disappoint expectation . Apparently people can compute eclipses . We have all seen eclipses which they predicted and we know that they were true to the time-table . But as to the end of the world there has been no one who has guessed right since Noah , for that was substantially what Noah predicted . The world did not exactly end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about , except those who sailed with him . Somehow the Flood has been coming nearer to us . It says in the Bible that it rained for forty days and nights ? and no doubt it did rain ? hot according to contemporary judgment the main job of causing a large-sized flood is handled by geological disturbances : continents sinking , continents rising ; water spilled off here , water shut in there ; a new arrangement of land , and of course a lot of people drowned . Nobody seemsto object very much in these times to relating Noah 's Flood to the sinking of a continent like Atlantis , or something of that sort . There was a flood . Noah with due notice might have built a ship and out-floated his world , as the Bible says . Theoretically it was possible . How much of the Bible story is fact and how much is legend it is not easy to say , except for a Fundamentalist , but in the main it looks like a story based in fact , for we practically know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come for many , many people on this earth . One may wonder how Noah 's contemporaries bore it . It must have been quite like the loss of the Titanic . Were there folks on rafts in Noah 's time who commented on Noah , and criticized him ? No doubt there were . It is hard to think of any eye-witness of the Flood from outside of the Ark taking a cheerful or even a reasonably philosophical view of it . It was trying . Even Noah himself , after it was all over , felt the need of relaxation . Of course it was wet , probably stormy . People on rafts or in tree-tops would get so miserable physically , from wet clothes and lack of creature comforts , that their spirits would be much affected by it . But theoretically the prospect of the end of the world ought not to bother any really well-informed person , for it would be a great riddance of troublesome problems and people . It is just as Emerson said to the Millerite who told him the world would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along just as well without it . " We ought to , and when we realize that we ought to , perhaps we shall be better able to endure the vicissitudes and imperfections of a world still with us , and widely felt to he too much so . One of the encouraging signs of the times is the great prevalence of dissatisfaction with life as it is lived . There is an immense amount of action , particularly organized action , and vast differences of opinion as to whether most of it is doing any good . The Drys have moved heaven and earth to stay the flow of rum , and the Wets are sure that the harm which has been done by limiting free will and bringing law into contempt far more than offsets the gains of unwilling abstinence . In polities nowadays there is a more novel ailment than the ordinary ruction between opposed parties , to wit , the suspicion grown widespread that neither party is much good , and that government itself is such an imperfect instrument that there ought to be a consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time seemed to be gaining a little heat , to collect war debts from Europe is petering out and nowadays has come to he no more than lukewarm . Just as in the late presidential campaign it was impossible to get people interested about issues , so now they decline to be excited about foreign debts . Most of them do not want to think about the foreign debts . It is too complicated a subject . If their taxes are a little less they like it , but if they do think about the subject at all they begin to doubt whether our taxes can profitably be reduced by collecting money from Europe . Where is all that fury of sentiment which finally developed over Mr. Wilson and the League of Nations ? There is nothing like that now on any subject . Most of the leading promoters of it are dead , and those who remain talk to yawning listeners . Things are not going badly . These States are not failing altogether just now in their duty to Europe . They are furnishing money in useful quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there to render specific services . The way they have accomplished it has done us credit , but as for a general , all-pervading interest in anything ? even in Europe ? it does not exist . What interest there is runs to details . Hereabouts there is a vast deal of building going on : road building , cathedral building , immense construction of abodes for schools and colleges , also of human habitations . The minds of men seem to have got away from general ideas and to be fastened just now on particulars . Perhaps that is just as well . There is a time for all things and this seems to be the time for organization and construction . When we are carried away by a great idea and have a big job on our hands as we had in the War ? con-struction goes to grass . Everything not necessary to the accomplishment of the great purpose is cut out . The construction that is going on now is partly a War result . Besides that , there is another aspect of it : when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with their hands . That is soothing and helpful ; it applies to the ordinary routine of life ; we all feel more or less the need to do something with our hands that we may the better do something with our heads . Manual training and golf are forms of recognition of that need . Society builds and organizes because use must be found for idle energy and idle money . Presently there may come along something that will sweep through all this construction and give purpose and motive to it . Do you remember how in the War days , as one traveled or drove about the country , he took a new notice of mills and factories and the accumulated apparatus of our civilization as so much power to win the War ? So we go on now accumulating apparatus , for ends that arc not clear yet , but which certainly . has some sort of destined use . For civilization does really require a very considerable apparatus . We are not yet stocked up as well as Europe with objects interesting and stimulating to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present rate of construction it will not be long before we are . We can not provide ourselves with antiquity over night , but time works ceaselessly and will fetch antiquity without extra charge if only we make due provision of objects proper to become antiquated . Meanwhile all this constructive effort does not go on without outcries . The big New York cathedral , whereof the building has started up again so prosperously , seems to some people entirely out of date ? a useless fabrication not adapted to our day or to twentieth-century needs . But , of course , nothing so handsome as that cathedral will be when it is finished is ever useless . For beauty 's sake alone it is worth the effort it calls for , and it may serve a very valuable turn in increasing unity among all varieties of religious people . It is unusual for anything like that to be accomplished without disagreement , and probably the cathedral will not he finished without some friction . But that is all in the day 's work . Great expansion must be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of this and the decrease of that and more administration . Consider the case of Harvard College , which for fifty years past has been trying to keep its place in a rapidly growing country . Fifty years ago it was a college of national renown . In that half century colleges and universities have multiplied in the land , received immense endowments or liberal allowances of tax-money , and taken strong root , and old colleges which had no special advantages of some kind have lost in relative importance . Those that were not willing to take that loss have had to bestir themselves , and they have bestirred themselves . They have spread their organizations in the West , they have vastly increased their endowments , laying under tribute their graduates an anyone else who had money to par with . In fifty years most of them hays quadrupled or more in size and they ar still adding , scrambling for more money organizing their graduates , advertisim by their prowess in sports , and all th , time building and undertaking new ex ploits in education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ? some o them a little ahead of it . As for Har yard , one hears that it is full of dispute that a certain proportion of its graduate : are very dissatisfied with what it now doing ? that everything about it b criticized : its new Business School ; loss of Mr. Baker , the dramatic teacher who was carried off by Yale ; its recent deficiencies in the major sports ; the disposition to put the standard up r little so as to reduce the number of lazy scholars . That college was the lose last year in all the major sports . Graduates who are chiefly interested in those concerns are sure the University is in c most unhealthy state . The loss of Mr Baker produced a violent eruption of criticism . The gift of a large endowment to the Business School by another Mr. Baker , not yet a member of the Harvard faculty , suggested to a considerable cohort of observers that Harvard was turning to materialism and that the concerns of the mind and spirit were on the way to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently the gentlemen who have been organized for purposes of money getting and construction have come to feel , not unnaturally , that their wishes must count for something in the administration of the University . And so discussion abounds in Cambridge and about it , and what does it all come to ? Simply to this : that construction there and in the Boston district has come to a point where discussion has naturally broken out about what it is all for . What sort of life , what sort of character , what sort of ability shall all these vast endowments and buildings and organizations aim at ? That same question lies ahead for all f us . Here we are building all sorts of hings , improving all the means of comiunication , piling up money , piling up dueation as we understand it , aceumuiting even knowledge , and driving traight on towards discussion of the uestion ? what is it all about , what ort of a life are we planning for , what . asis has it got , and shall we like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; every ich country has built . The world bounds in such construction , some of : in ruins , some of it underground , sonic f it handsome but inoperative , a great . eal of it still useful and busy . Building /ill go on and so will expansion . If here is money they always do . They rent on in Germany for thirty years iefore the War to a marvelous extent . ; ome time since they went on in Nineveh , labylon , India , Egypt , China. , Africa , .. ' eylon , Yucatan , Mexico , and various arts of South America . It is a dull ' eek for the newspapers nowadays hat does not announce the discovery of ome forgotten city . Thus , building is core or less instinctive and inevitable . t comes along when the materials for I are available . The great question for is is whether our turn at it will produce ornething which will endure , and wheher human life will prosper in the appaatus we are contriving for it . Whether , n short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the contrary . That is the whole question ? the soul if man . If the soul prospers the ap ? aratus will keep going and do good . If it does not , the apparatus will go to mt . In Germany , so lately , the appa ? atits was wonderful . It included a ? ertain kind of learning , very remarkable in its department . But the soul lid not prosper . That country put its ' ntire trust in its apparatus and presmtly it fell down with a very heavy jolt ? one , indeed , that shook the world . Ne do not want any more of those jolts ; especially we do not want them here . In this large , fairly comfortable continent a thousand years of progressive life is a moderate expectation . We have a great deal , we are getting more all the time , but we are far from being in agreement about what we are headed for , whether we ought to get there , whether the means we arc using are helpful to get us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College just now that it is full of blocs , each of which sees its own interest big and wants to be sure that it gets its share of the common fund . That is also the way of the country at large ? it is full of blocs , no one of which wants any other bloc to get ahead of it . Very well ; and what is the remedy ? Is it in more organization , more money raising , more construction , more and better machines , more " education , " as the training for all these activities is now called ? No . God , who was not in the whirlwind , the earthquake , or the fire is not in the factory or the machine shop , or in salesmanship or advertisement . He remains , as heretofore , in the still small voice . Organization , construction , and all those useful things are like the operations of the body . When they need to be quickened or corrected or improved in some way , the doctors ( if they are skillful ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to whom the doctors can bring nothing better than alleviation , and often not even that , then you say they need an infusion of new life and you wonder how they are going to get it . Sometimes they do get it and you see them get well , and recover energy , and go on and finish their course . And so it is with the world . Organization and all that may benefit it but wo n't cure it . The cure has got to come from something that will increase knowledge and revive faith . Such succor to a troubled world usually has come from irregular and even disputable sources , and it may do so again .
