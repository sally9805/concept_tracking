txt The bill repealing the prohibition of marriage within a year after divorce has been passed by the house , and , it Is to be hoped , will be enacted . The prohibition was well intended ; but , like many otter moral enactments , did riot work out as expected . It has not put an effective check upon hasty divorce or collusion or added , so far as any observer can see , to the sanctity of the marriage bond . It has added to the confusion of our marriage laws , created technical illegitimacies , unjust to innocent children , and clouded property rights . The notion that a year 's . bar upon remarriage would discourage infidelity is one of those fallacies of reform which is always proposing to ? produce morality by law . This prohibition offers an excellent illustration of Herbert Spencer 's comment on reformers , who , he said , were often like an unskilled worker trying to hammer out dinges in a piece of metal . Every time he strikes a blow he flattens one dent and raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the twenty-first anniversary of the Twentieth Century Limited , and of its rival , the . Broadway Limited , which represent the highest type of passenger transportation in the world , consideting not only Its equipment , operation , and the importance of the points connected . We congratulate the railways which initiated and have maintained this service , and we would include In our congratulation the American railroad man generally , whose skill , enterprise , and devotion it ' represents . The American railways have been under pretty constant criticism from politicians and discontented. , eiatrons for a generation , and It is in the interest of the public not less than of the railways themselves that some consideration be given to the unequaled efficiency they have achleved  --  and what it means to the country . American railrixid. lag represents the highest mark reached in transportation and , granting its shortcomings , such as they are , we doubt If its vociferous critics could manage it better . Faults of management there are , ' but they are not going to be diminished by political Manipulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is private intHalve , not political control , which has given us that and will , if permitted , give us more . So the coming of age of the ' Century and the BroadwaY Limited is worth celebrating . At the same time perhaps it is not ungracious to suggest two small details for improvement , Why not inStall a telephone service on the trains ? Light military wire might be used to connect the cars . Much time would be saved in this way for trainmen and passengers . Another , detail which calls for attention is the baggage service at the New r ( Srk terminal . there are not enough men to handle the band baggage , and passengers who fail to get help have to watt or carry their own . Trucks should be used in Chieago . The companies should not neglect the comfort of their patrons In this respect . THE MYSTERY OF LEIGHTON MOUNT . .

" The jury recommends that the police continue the investigation and that " such person-or persons be apprehended and held on a charge of murder . " A good deal of criticism was directed at the Chicage newspapers in connection with this " case . Tau TRILIUND has printed some letters of complaint . One reproach was that a murder /lad been committed by two of Ragenei Colts and net much space Was given to it . People connected with Northwestern university , - or Interested in it , were provoked or embittered by the manner in which reporters handled the story and by the emphasis the papers gave it . This young man , matriculated at the university , disappeared after a class ' rush , and twenty months later a skeleton , ! dentine ( ' convincingly as his , was found weighted ' . by rocks under a- pier in Evanston .

No one believes that the . young man was deliberately murdered in the class rush , although he might have been killed in it accidentally . Moe dents may happen In such affairs . The authorities and the reporters tried their best to find out what had happened and the attitude of the university was one of hush . That was the mistake . .

The mistake was irying to protect the university reputation by minimizing tho matter , hushing it , presuming that at the worst it was merely an episode reflecting on the boy 's character , etc . When the skeleton was discovered the university continued to take offense at reasonable attempts to determine how the young man had been killed , whether he had been murdered , how his body came to be under the Pier. : 1 , t woul ? be a:teneer conception . of human nature to think , thar peeple .

The controversy- in the American rubber induatry , discussed by Scrutator yesterday , is of more than financial or business moment . Rubber is an essential in modern warfare . Hence it is an essential to national-defense . But an , ? ssential supply located on the other side of the world is not a safe reliance . There is a proposal to develop rubber plantations ' n the Philippines . As a commercial proposition . his may be highly advisable , but as a defense iroposition it is worse than nothing . The PhilipAries are the most vulnerable and the most endan ; ered region under the flag . Rubber supply In the stands could be easily cut off by Japan or Great Britain and would be a valuable prize for them to hold . It would be a deficit , strategically , rather than an asset . , Furthermore , American owned rubber in the East Indies would avail us little in a serious war indeed we commanded the Ewa or were allied with the power commanding the long route from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements , therePore , there is but one course tpfollow , and that is to develop rubber within our ' secure reach . Rubser in the wild state was formerly the chief supply tied South America was its source . But the demands have far outstripped the possibilities of wild rubber ' and cultivation is- necessary . We have therefore a clear duty to develop the cultivation hf rubber on this continent , If necessary , with ; overnment aid . On the isthmus and in South America we could probably keep access to supply , ) y sea , but it would be wiser to have communication also by land . This is to emphasize again the importance of an dl-American railway system . We have the physical ieginnings of this system now , but there are gaps o fill and extensions to be made . American statesnen and individuals who are so preoccupied with the needs of Europe would show better sense If they turned their attention to this problem .

Such a system would nclude and extend the Mexican railways under riendly agreement and pass down the isthmus at east to the Canal Zone . But it ought not to stop here . It should proceed to connect up with Colomda , Venezuela , and Brazil , and pass down the " aelfic coast to Chile . This is a great task , but by no means an ' reposable one , and its benefits to all the peoples of sforth and South America would be enormous .

Evidently the ; 75,000 appropriation for the attorney , general to prosecute the civil suit against Small et al . for the recovery of state money had te , be killed either in the senate or the house . The senate passed the bill and the buck to the house and 4 did the dirty work . Such operations generally are cut up fifty fifty between the house and senate and the senate decided this was to be the work - of the house . Small is saved the pain or the pleasure of vetoing the appropriation which would have been used for the suit against him . The state prosecutor will go on with it , but he 'll do it without a fund set aside for , the purpose . The legislature at Small 's bidding already had sustained vetoes which deprived the attorney general of $500 ; 000 , and he is trimmed financially as close as Small can figure it . Similar proceedings two years h made it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Herrin cases .

Free translation from Prosveta ( J. e. : Enlightenment ) , Slovenian . A mania has arisen for telling us what is moral and what is immoral . Our modern saviors are showering on the people in ' all the states of the Union the doubtful blessing of their laws . Thus it came to pass In Utah : a pressure was brought to bear on the legislature there until a last ) was adopted which forbade the smoking of eigarets In public places . The law did not uplift the people any , but led to the arrest of prominent men , such as lawyers , mine owners , and bankers . And the inevitable consequence was that ' the legislators had once more to investigate the statute thus passed by them . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen out already !
