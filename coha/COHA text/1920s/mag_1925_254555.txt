HERE COMES THE BRIDE-Irvin S. Cobb-Doran ( $2.00 ) . With the air of a man rolling a cigar in his mouth , savoring it , puffing , chewing the butt , spurting forth smooth smoke-curls and rich juices as the philosophical fruits of his rumination , Humorist Cobb drawls on and on about intoxicants , ancestors , being homely , the zoo , national holidays , Christmas presents " and so forth . " Very different from " chewing the rag . " He is the delight of a vast audience that relishes : an elaborate Southern simile- ( false teeth that clattered ) " like a fox-trotting horse with a loose shoe crossing a covered bridge ; " an unexpected wise-crack- " King George the Fifth and Queen Mary the Four Fifths ; " a sensible suggestion-floor lights , clothes ockers , tractable windows , longer blankets for Pullman cars , wash suits for city men in summer .
