At Peking , Death won its inevitable victory . Its victim was Dr. Sun Yatsen , founder and leader of the Kuo Mintang ( Young China ) Party . <P> A year ago ( TIME , May 26 ) , his death was prematurely announced ; but it was not until last January that he was taken to the Rockefeller Hospital at Peking and declared to be in the advanced stages of cancer of the liver . <P> Dr. Sun was born in a small village near Canton , where the people are the " old " Chinese , driven south centuries ago . As a boy , he traveled far to reside with his brother , a prosperous contractor , at Honolulu . There the spark of revolt against the lethargic and superstitious regime of the Son of Heaven was ignited . His brother feared for him , sent him back to his native village ; but he had not long been there before he committed an act of irreverence toward a village god and was consequently expelled . <P> He left the village sorrowfully , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went to Hong-Kong , studied surgery , became a doctor , was probably the first yellow man to perform a scientific operation . <P> In all this time he was active , spreading revolt through his Anti-Manchu organization , known far and wide in China as the " Dare-to-dies . " <P> The Manchus were not easy to conquer and , on numerous occasions , Dr. Sun was almost caught by Imperialists and had , consequently , to flee the country . Thus it happened that he spent a great part of his time abroad , always , however , working for the overthrow of the Son of Heaven at Peking , always with a price upon his head . At every capital , his opponents sought to assassinate him . At Tokyo , where he established his headquarters next to the Imperial Chinese Embassy , his very footsteps were dogged . At New York , he proved to a number of skeptical Manhattan bankers , with whom he was dining in a Fifth Avenue club , that he was being watched . He strode to the window and pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At London , he was kidnapped and released only through the mediation of Lord Salisbury . <P> In 1911 , the revolution unfurled its desperate banners ; and , by the twelfth day of the following year , China , the oldest of monarchies , had become a republic . Dr. Sun did not get what he wanted out of the revolution ; he formed a separate republic in the south and kept up the spirit of revolt against successive administrations in Peking . It was this attitude that earned for him the soubriquet of " the perpetual rebel . "
