In Tokyo , they saw a fat Japanese standing in a doorway , staring out into a twilight street where yellow children were playing a curious game . The next day , they were above China . <P> In China , they saw a long narrow river , twisted like a silver whiplash , across flat lands to the ocean . The next day they were above the mountains , where it was cold . <P> When they reached India , they slept in a low dirty town : a wind , as hot and sticky as a conjurer 's hand , passed slowly in the air . After breakfast , they flew away . <P> From Basra , Irak , they followed along the River Euphrates and in the early evening flew above the flat country to Aleppo . At Aleppo , they rested long enough to remember seeing a pretty girl , whose name they would never learn , standing in the amazed crowd that watched them fly away . <P> In the course of Icarus , they went through the air to Athens , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant city grew into the darkness under them . They landed at six in the evening and had a bitter wine with their dinner . They made a journey which many a splendid army has made in two months ; by the middle of the spring afternoon they were in Marseilles . <P> In Marseilles , they paused while their plane was being refuelled before starting for Paris . They flew , over the dreamy provinces of France , toward a last great city . There , in the late afternoon , a huge crowd was waiting for them .

They had dallied in the U. S. and crossed the Pacific , which no man has ever spanned by air , in a boat . Their last spurt broke all speed records for the journey . <P> Parisians were determined to honor their own heroes as they had honored Lindbergh eleven months before . The members of the U. S. legation turned out in full force . Government officials cried and kissed the aviators ; the older ones had never expected to see them again . People in Paris stood outside their shops talking , laughing . . . you could n't walk along the Champs Elysees . The Government decreed a special stamp for Costes and Lebrix . <P> Costes and Lebrix allowed a barber to remove the short stubble which appeared upon their faces since tonsuring in Tokyo ; they learned that the ambassadors of 22 American republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would take a short rest and then fly across the Atlantic to New York .
