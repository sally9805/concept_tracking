September began to wane and the friends and enemies of The Happy Warrior* agreed that , so far , he had not got off the defensive . <P> First there was Charles C. Marshall , in the Atlantic Monthly of March 1927 , on Roman Catholicism . The Warrior answered that . <P> Then there was the Dry bloc at Houston . The Warrior surmounted it , but not without losses . <P> Then there was William Allen White and Vice . The Warrior enmeshed Mr. White but came out under the sign of the saloon . <P> Then there was Preacher Straton and more Vice , more saloons . The Warrior was so vexed that he " dignified an insect with an incident . " <P> Then there was extravagance . The Warrior answered Under-Secretary of the Treasury Ogden Livingston Mills , but not so bravely but that Mr. Mills could still rebut with a semblance of conviction . The Warrior 's terms as Governor of New York had been costly , perhaps for good reasons . But the Warrior did not restate the reasons . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had voted appropriations under him . It was defensive move Number Five . <P> Finally , culminating last week when ( the Warrior was starting West , there was the Whispering Campaign-on Roman Catholicism ( again ) , Drunkenness , Social Eligibility ( TIME , Sept. 17 ) . It was mean . It was poisonous . It was unworthy of the Nominee it helped . But it persisted and the Warrior 's friends grew wroth . Chairman Work of Hooverism disowned the Whispers . But Chairman Work , perhaps forgetting President Roosevelt 's historic misunderstoodness about liquor , could not refrain from adding : " Why is it necessary for a man 's friends to deny that he is intoxicated ? " <P> In the last week of preparation for his first national appearance , the Warrior tried to point at a specific Whisper and track it down . A man named Keenan in Parkersburg , West Va. , had written him that a woman named Bauer in Parkersburg was passing around word that a woman named Sanford in Syracuse , N. Y. , had written her that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N. Y. , State Fair . It was just the sort of story that is heard at least weekly by most of the Warrior 's friends and foes alike . <P> The Warrior got an exoneration from a New York State Senator who had been with him constantly at the Syracuse fair . He got a denial of the letter from its alleged writer and an evasion from its alleged recipient . Then he issued a document entitled : " Nailing a Lie in the Whispering Campaign . " <P> The effect on Smith sympathizers was one of satisfaction . But nailing a lie in a whispering campaign is much like nailing an ant on a rotten plank . The hammer blows shake out a lot of other ants and start them swarming furiously . A lot of the Brown Derby 's best friends wished that the unhappy Warrior would leave lienailing to his assistants and confine himself to constructive campaigning . <P> The Post Office Department ( Harry S. New of Indiana , Postmaster General ) made a gesture in answer to the charge that , by laxity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postmaster Benjamin F. Woelper seized 100 anti-Smith postcards which Postmaster General New later pronounced the work of " a depraved and degenerate mind . " <P> ...
