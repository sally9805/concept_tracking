Brigadier General Lord , Budget Director , who announced six weeks ago that the Treasury would probably have a deficit of $180,000,000 on June 30 , changed his estimate . He just announced expectation of , not a deficit , but a surplus of $60,000,000 . <P> Hardly were the words out of his mouth when Secretary of the Treasury Mellon raised the " expectation " from $60,000,000 to $125,000,000 . The cause of the change from a deficit to a surplus is , in part , economy on the part of Government departments , but even more so , an unexpected influx of revenue . The income tax quarterly payments due March 15 exceeded the expected $400,000,000 by $63,000,000 . In addition , the tariff receipts calculated at $500,000,000 for the year , are now estimated at least $40,000,000 in excess of that amount . <P> Beginning with the fiscal year of 1921 , the budget has included as regular expenditure the sinking fund and other provisions for retiring the public debt . Something over $400,000,000 was paid out annually in 1921 and 1922 for this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to about $405,000,000 . <P> So in addition to paying its way , and retiring $405,000,000 of debt , the Government may expect to end the fiscal year on June 30 with from $60,000,000 to $125,000,000 of pin money in its pocket .
