txt After four months of hearings and =Rings , the Republican members of the Committee on Ways and deans have drafted a tariff bill said o contain 85,000 words and a report stimated to have about the same espectable length . No doubt they lave been as quick as they could Ind have done their best ; but there orthodox Republican authority for iaying that much of the bill dis ) leases various Republican Representatives . . In the necessary course of procedure , the progress of the bill will be a little slow , even in the House . Even in that . body of timesavers a- tariff revision bill , most immediate of all things to the Republican heart and stomach , is likely to eat up the rest of the month . But that is nothing . Time and trouble begin to walk when the Senate Committee on Finance gets hold of the bill . In a moment of unwonted buoyancy Senator SMOOT hoped or dreamed that his committee would be able to report in not more than a month after the House treasure had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dream . That hope has gone glimmering . He and the other Old Faithfuls have heard from the industrial altruists . The Republican economists , always asking themselves timorously , " What will Mr. GRUNDY say ? " have been hearing him say it . In divers States divers Grundys have put to the grindstone the noses of their Senators . The Senators , as the Washington correspondent of the true-blue Boston Transcript tells us , have read the riot act to Mr. SMOOT . The solid citizens whom they represent expect the Finance Committee to hear their testimony , " at reasonable length . " Let us take a peek at " reasonable length " and some delicacies of Senatorial chronology : Senators estimate that the minimum length of time the Finance Committee will require to take testimony and rewrite the bill will be six weeks . Experience has proved that any Senatorial estimate of time required for action in a given matter Is inadequate . Thus it Is fairly safe to assume that the committee will have the bill for perhaps two months . If it acts within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate before July 15 , and any extension of time will delay the report till about Aug. 1 . This is n't prophecy . It is sound conclusion from past performances . And so far we have been dealing only with preliminaries . When the glorious hour of " debate " and " deliberation " strikes , then the words , hours , weeks , months begin to fly . If the Senate succeeds in exhausting its vocal supply and passes the bill ? its bill  --  then comes the clash of conference between the two chambers . " Do they miss me at home , " do they miss me , at morning , at " noon or at night ? " Musical Mr. LONGWORTH and the other poets of a short session and limited revision may well rehearse the old song . We sympathize with them , with the country , with President HOOVER . He must regret that he ever made that unnecessary promise , ever listened to the singing of the Idaho Lorelei.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
