txt " A wind of dictatorship is blowing over Europe . " With these words a Belgian statesman , Count CARTON DE WIART , who has twice been Minister-of War and Prime Minister of Belgium , begins an article in the Paris Figaro , He briefly passes in review the events which led to the emergence of MUSSOLINI in Italy and PRIMO DE RrvERA in Spain . He might have broadened his view . Mr. LLOYD GEORGE did so in an article which he recently contributed to The London Daily Telegraph . He traced MUSSOLINI straight back to LENIN . The latter , Mr. LLOYD GEORGE apparently identified as heir or imitator of the great English dictator of the seventeenth century , OLIVER CROMWELL . But neither the English writer nor the Belgian spoke of the wind of dictatorship blowing in Greece and in Turkey , or foresaw the rise of Prussian and Bavarian dictators . The great provocation to a dictatorship in Italy was much the same as that which revealed itself , or was made the ostensible excuse , in Spain . Parliamentary institutions had seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , for a strong Government , but a strong Government had been- rendered almost impossible by the system of " group " representation in Parliament . Instead of resolute and constructive Prime Ministers , we had a- succession of feeble and shortlived Executives , appearing and disappearing almost like phantoms . Among the people there was profound if vague dissatisfaction . They suspected not only weakness in the Government , but corruption . Hence , as Count CARTON DE WIART says , it was not astonishing that alleged reincarnations of CAESAR should be hailed in different countries as the very god from the machine whom the political exigency demanded . For the time being at ? . least the old cries have been changed for new ones . The emphasis is not placed so much upon liberty as upon efficiency . It ? can hardly be doubted that a reaction will set in sooner or later . But for the moment the world is evidently in for a movement in behalf of greater energy and more direct control of administration on the part of those , ' however they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We : in- the- United - States - would be tempted to smile at the thought of our needing a dictator . We have , in fact , occasionally had one in a State , or even at Washington , disguised as a " servant of the people . " But the particular moral for Americans just now to draw from whatv , is happening in various parts of Europe is that we ought to bend our efforts to remove here as many as possible of the causes which have led there to acquiescence in a dictatorship . Our Government , too , is threatened from the side of a swarming and meddlesome bureaucracy and by the insidious advance of blocs in Congress which are more and more tending to wreck the old system of government by parties . There is no present fear of a dictator bestriding the American people , but there is a danger , against which . we ought to be on our guard , lest our established governmental methods be brought into disrepute , with the result of predisposing many restless persons to run after any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
