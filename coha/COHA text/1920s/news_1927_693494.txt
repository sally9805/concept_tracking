txt Prices of Prison-Made Shirts . I read with some amusement the article headed " Fancy Shirts Hit Prison , " based on a report by Warden en K. W. Scott of the Connecticut State Prison in support of a request for a deficiency appropriation . I happen to know that the shirts manufactured in the penitentiary at Weathersfield . Conn. , consist solely of men 's work shirts . I also know that 1926 was one of the best years manufacturers of work shirts have had in some time . All of them reported profits larger than during the past five or six years , and in every instance such manufacturers had their garments made for them by penal institutions . If Connecticut would obtain for such work a price more in line with the price paid to free labor for making similar garments , it is believed that there would not only be no deficiency but actually a surplus .
