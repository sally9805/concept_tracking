UPON returning last summer from a long sojourn among the islands of the eastern Pacific , I decided to break my journey across the continent at Prairie Hills , a little town in Iowa where my aunt Harriet Mason lives . It is a homely sort of place , at the end of a branch line of railroad , and owing to its isolated position and the conservatism of its long-settled inhabitants it still has the aspect and the feel of the eighteen-nineties . My aunt 's house is of a yet earlier period . It is a large square brick dwelling surmounted by a glassed-in cupola , with a view to the westward over a dozen miles of upland prairie . A wide hallway , cool on the hottest days of summer , divides the lower floor and , as all the rooms give on it , the mingled fragrance from all of them pervades it ? a fragrance of dried rose-leaves , of Pears ' soap , of pine-needle sofa pillows , of Civil War Memoirs and bound volumes of Harper 's Magazine . Many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been aware of that perfume , which is composed of scores of ingredients too subtle to define . To breathe it again in reality was almost to doubt the passage of time . I rapped gently at the screen door and , receiving no reply , walked through to the back porch . Aunt Harriet was sitting on the steps , shelling peas into a salad-bowl . Two hours later we sat down to supper . There was delectable fried chicken , mashed potatoes with giblet gravy , corn on the cob , green peas in cream , beet salad , apple , grape , and currant jelly , hot rolls , strawberry shortcake , and iced tea . ' A pick-up supper , ' Aunt Harriet called it . I had dreamed of those pick-up suppers often enough when eating coconuts and fish on lonely islands in the South Seas . I hated to hurry through this one , but there was no help for it . There was to be a meeting at the church of the Foreign Mission Society and , as of old , my aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of the Sunday School room , where I met the minister , Mr. Williams , and the visiting missionary , a thin , sallow-faced man just returned from New Guinea . He was dressing several of the local young people in the ceremonial costumes of the New Guinea savages : headdresses of brilliant feathers , garments of dyed grass , anklets of human hair , bracelets and necklaces of pearl-shell , sharks ' teeth , and brightly colored seeds . They were very self-conscious and plainly dreading the moment when they must appear before the audience . ' Is n't it awful , ' whispered Aunt Harriet , ' to think of human beings getting themselves up like that ? And think of it , dear ! They have souls to be saved just as we have ! Mr. Robinson ' ( the missionary ) ' has saved hundreds of them . He ' s lived in New Guinea for nearly fifteen years ! He 's doing a wonderful work ? wonderful ! ' She was busy for half an hour helping with the preparations . Then we took seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the pulpit a large map of New Guinea had been hung . It was colored a deep and uniform black , save for narrow fringes here and there along the coast . These were dazzling white to show the progress of missionary enterprise on that immense island-continent . The church was crowded . People were seated in the aisles , standing in the vestibules and at the open windows . After the invocation the congregation sang that old militant hymn : It was splendidly sung , everyone joining in . Aunt Harriet 's eyes shone as she added her clear strong voice to the others . The missionary , standing very straight , gazed in rapt listening attention over the heads of the audience . At the conclusion of the hymn he stepped forward , without introduction , and in a quiet , impressive voice and manner he began : ' My friends , there are those who believe , or profess to believe , that the spirit of the Christian religion is dead . The same view was held a generation , a century , five centuries ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubters , faint-hearts , and there will always be . But I am here to say ? and I believe it with all the strength of my soul ? that the Son of God goes forth to war at this moment , as triumphantly as He did in the time of the Apostles themselves . A kingly crown to gain ! To gain ? In countless dark places of the earth it has been gained to the everlasting glory of the Church . But how mighty are the hosts arrayed against us ! How far-flung is the battle-line of the great army of Christ ! I have come , this evening , to tell you of one of the farthest outposts of that conquering army ; to speak , not so much of what has been done there , but of what remains to do . ' Then in the same simple , deeply earnest manner he told the story of his years among the savages ? of the dangers , the hardships and privations , of the opportunities for service . He engaged one 's interest , one 's respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture , every intonation of his voice . I could see that he lived only for his lonely mission-station among the coastal swamps ; that he would go on living for it , and die for it at last , conscious of a life well spent . He was in the midst of his narrative when there was a slight stir in the crowd at the rear of the church . A slip of paper was passed from hand to hand to my aunt Harriet . She read it hastily . Mrs. Wintersteen is very ill , ' she whispered . They want me to come . I must go at once . ' I knew what a disappointment it must be to her to miss the rest of the meeting , but there was not a moment 's hesitation . No one ever called on Aunt Harriet in vain . You need n't have come , dear , ' she said , a little reproachfully , as we were walking toward the Wintersteens ' house . ' I do n't see how you could ! Were n't you interested ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do n't like to stay indoors on such a night , and remember , Aunt Harriet ? this is my first visit here in ten years . ' Yes , I know . ' We walked in silence for a little way , and when I left her at the Wintersteen gate , ' Now go right home and do n't bother about me any more , ' she said . You must be tired and sleepy after your long journey . Your room 's all ready , and there 's some nice fresh milk and a cherry pie in the ice box . ' After exploring the ice box I went out on the back porch . The view from that vantage point is beautiful at all times , particularly so by moonlight on a summer night . A short distance beyond the house the hill slopes steeply to the densely wooded bottom-lands along the Chaquaqua . River , and on the farther side the prairie stretches away to an horizon , distant and gently undulating , like an horizon at sea . The night was very still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currant bushes and around the peony beds . The frogs were in full chorus along the river , and a whippoorwill was calling from the wood-lot . I stretched out in the hammock , meaning to pass in review fragmentary periods of boyhood ; but instead my thoughts turned to my recent wanderings in the South Seas . The missionary was responsible for that , with his talk of New Guinea and the dark places of the earth . The islands I had visited in the eastern Pacific had been called dark places , too , not many years ago . Now , doubtless , they are shown in purest white on the military maps of the ever-victorious army with the red banner . And yet it was curious to think that at the time when my Aunt Harriet 's father , whom I could vaguely remember , was felling trees for his first log-cabin at Prairie Hills , the inhabitants of most of those islands were still heathen . ' There are men living to-day , ' I thought , ' who must have been carried as babies in arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those very places . ' What vast changes had taken place in the Pacific in less than a century ! Now the blood-red banner streamed beyond horizons far to the westward . Supposing that within another fifty or seventy-five years the vanguard of that great army should overtake the rear guard on the other side of the world ? what would they do then ? Perhaps the eager pioneers would be appalled at the realization that there were no more heathen lands to conquer . Some , perhaps , would go on through sheer force of habit , sheer necessity . Others would turn and , marching slowly back over old battlefields , would look about them , noting the changes which had taken place . Would they be satisfied in every case ? Would they speak as freely then of victories gained ' to the everlasting glory of the Church ' ? It was an interesting subject for speculation . I had seen some of their ancient battlefields during my recent wanderings . The recollection of one of them in particular was made the more vivid by a burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Evidently the missionary had finished his address . The congregation was singing the closing hymn . It was Onward , Christian Soldiers . ' II When I first saw the island I had been traveling for several weeks on a small schooner whose captain and owner is one of the few independent traders left in that part of the Pacific . We had gone from island to island and from group to group , picking up a few sacks of copra or pearl-shell , a parcel of vanilla beans ? anything in the way of cargo which might be found at the more remote , sparsely populated places . One evening , the wind coming fair from the southeast , a course was laid for Taputea . ' We might as well go up there now as later , ' the captain said . I 've got some mail for Mr. Cowden . I expect he ' s wondering what ' s become of it . ' Who 's Mr. Cowden ? ' I asked . He 's a professor , a countryman of yours . Been coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays for as long as a year , studying crabs or snails , I forget which it is . They 're going through some queer kind of evolution , he says . But Mr. Cowden ' s all right . I 've known him since the first time he came out here . ' At dawn , two days later , we could just make out the land , a faint bluish triangle showing above the horizon every time we rose to the swell . It was the peak of Tanifa , the highest mountain on the island , the captain informed me . It is n't often you have that view , ' he added . We ' re still about sixty miles off . We ' 11 be at anchor to-night if the wind holds . ' All day , from a perch aloft , I watched the land emerge , changing color as the light changed . At sunset we were close enough to see the surf breaking against the cliffs which rose perpendicularly in many places to heights of more than a thousand feet . Above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jagged peaks rose clear of a level film of cloud . We coasted along , close inshore , past several deep valleys filled with purple shadow , and at length , rounding a headland , we entered the most beautiful harbor I had ever seen . It was about half a mile wide , completely landlocked , with portals of sheer rock to seaward , and a broad sandy beach around the inner border . The valley itself , as nearly as I could make out , was of great depth and filled with trees and dense bush . The houses of the settlement were hidden for the most part , but I had glimpses of a few of them ? an upper balcony with pillared arches , a diminutive church-spire , the white wall of a warehouse . Soon they were merged in the gathering darkness . No lights were to be seen , and the only sound I heard was the plaintive bleating of goats far up in the mountains . An awning was stretched over the main boom . I placed my deck chair under it and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain joined me . Neither of us spoke for some time . Finally he said : ' Well ? what do you think of Taputea ? ' It seems a very lonely place , ' I replied . ' One would think the arrival of a schooner would be quite an event here . Where are all the natives ? asleep ? ' Yes , that ' s it , ' he said in his gentle drawling voice . They 're all sleeping in the bosom of Abraham . ' Of a sudden he heaved his immense bulk out of his chair and stood by the rail , looking toward the land . Lonesome ? I should think it is ! I hate to come up here in these days . Too bad you could n't have seen Taputea forty-five years ago . Even then it was finished , only I did n't realize it . The first time I came was in seventy- eight . I was twenty , and Taputea was the first South Sea Island I 'd ever seen . We came in about this time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens and dozens of natives came swimming off to us . I ca n't begin to tell you what a fine lot they were ! Since then I ' ye seen every kind of native in the Pacific , but none of ' em could hold a candle to these . But I remember as we were coming in to the anchorage Captain Pritchard ? old George Pritchard , the man I named this vessel after ? told me just about what I 've been telling you . " This place is done for , " he said . " You ought to have seen it twenty years ago . " Very likely some other skipper told him the same thing twenty years before that . I ' d like to have been the first white man that ever saw the place , back in the old days . The worst of it was , ' he continued , ' that all through these islands the first white men were nearly always missionaries . I 've got no use for that tribe ! I suppose it 's because I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye heard too many songs of Zion rising over the deep . Little they cared about the old days ! What they wanted was the New Jerusalem , with all the inhabitants , dressed in white trousers and black Mother Hubbards , going to prayer meeting with Bibles under their arms . They meant well , I suppose , but Lord deliver me from your well-meaning people ! He did n't deliver these poor heathen . You can see what 's happened ? they 're all dead . When I first came there were still three or four hundred living in this one valley . Now I could take all that 's left aboard my schooner and still have room to spare . ' But are n't you a little unfair in blaming this on the missionaries ? ' Not at all ! Not the least bit ! You remember the old song : ? That 's the missionary spirit ! It always has been and it always will be . They ' 11 save your soul if they have to kill you to do it ! They believe there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it ; so they snuff yours out . I said just now that I could take all the people there are left in this valley aboard my schooner and have room to spare . It 's a fact ; I could . Do you know how many there are ? Eighteen , and five of those are white . There ' s Mr. Cowden ; old La Motte , the government agent ; Rudge , the Protestant missionary ; Father Gilbert , the Catholic ; and Sister Theresa at the convent . The rest are natives , all in a state of grace except two ? an old man and woman that live a good way up the valley . They ' re pure heathen . The missionaries have been trying to save them for years , but they 've had no luck . More power to that old couple ! If ever they give in ? well , Mr. Cowden will have to find someone else to bring him his mail . I 'll never come to Taputea again . Hello ! There 's light . That ' 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tihoti ! We ' II have kaikai on deck this evening ; and fetch up those sacks of mail out of my cabin . ' I waited with a good deal of curiosity to see this lonely man who had spent the better part of twenty years at Taputea , ' studying crabs or snails . ' He hailed us from a distance and came alongside , rowing vigorously . Having made fast his skiff , he clambered aboard with the agility of a boy . He was about sixty , with a white moustache , thick white hair , and a deeply tanned , healthy skin . Well , Captain , ' he said , I thought you were never coming . ' Yes , we ' re a little late , Professor . But you know how it is at this time of year ? no wind . Until yesterday we have n't made a fair day 's run the whole voyage . Meet my first-class passenger . He ' s having a look round the islands . I was just telling him that he ' s forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . However , Taputea has its attractions even to-day . I would n't have believed it possible to become so attached to a place . ' Then , excusing himself , ? ' This is my first mail since last November , ' ? he emptied on the deck the sacks we had brought him and made a hasty examination of their contents . I noticed that the bulk of his mail was made up of periodicals and parcels of books . These last he examined eagerly . By Jove ! ' he exclaimed as he opened one of them . ' Here ' s a piece of luck ! Captain , do you remember my speaking of Lieutenant Collingwood , who came to Taputea in the Resolute , in 1832 ? He wrote a Memoir of that visit . I ' ve had every bookseller in England and America searching for it , and here it is at last ! Edwards , of London , discovered it . That man is a marvel ! Give him time and I believe he could unearth the lost books of Livy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked of it all through supper . He now had everything , he said , which had been written about Taputea from the very earliest days . Are there many volumes ? ' I asked . No , not a great many ; thirty-odd , not counting the missionaries ' records . But they are all extraordinarily interesting . ' Well , ' said the captain , ' I would n't give you three ha'pence for all the missionaries have written . ' Mr. Cowden laughed . You may have discovered , ' he said to me , that the captain is a little violent on the subject of missionaries ? Strange , is n't it , that traders nearly always are ? They could n't have made a living anywhere in the Pacific if missionaries had not prepared the way , and yet they see red the moment the name is mentioned . ' You 're right , Professor , we certainly do ? and with good reason . I 've never held that traders were any great blessing to savages , but they believe in living and letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say for the best missionary that ever drew breath . Is n't that so ? Come now ! What ' s your honest opinion ? ' ' On the question , " The Trader versus the Missionary as a Civilizing Influence " ? It ' s an old controversy , Captain . It seems hardly worth while reopening it in these days . ' Well , traders have one thing to their credit ? a sense of humor . When I look at Taputea and see what white men have done to it ? traders , missionaries , all of us together , in the name of God and the Higher Civilization ? I could laugh if it was n't so downright tragical . But take old Rudge or Father Gilbert ; they 're still exhorting away and sending up prayers of thanksgiving that the heathen have all been saved . I ' d hate to be left in this place with those two for company ! How do you manage , Professor ? ' You forget , Captain , that I 'm not a trader . Missionaries are not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of man I would choose for a companion , but Father Gilbert can be quite interesting if you can start him on matters outside religion . ' How ' s he getting on with his dic-tionary ? ' ' Oh , famously ! He ' s halfway through the letter K now . ' The captain laughed scornfully . You know , ' he said , turning to me , Father Gilbert has been writing his dictionary of the Taputean language for the last twenty-five years , and by the time he ' s finished there ' 11 be no one left to speak it but himself , Mr. Cowden , and me . ' You ' re forgetting Rudge , La Motte , and Sister Theresa . Well , Captain , I must be going . What are your plans ? You ' 11 not be leaving at once , I hope ? ' No . I want to take in a supply of firewood , and to-morrow afternoon I ' 11 give the sailors a run ashore . We ' 11 sail sometime Sunday morning , very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first-class passenger ? Would you like to come ? ' he added , turning to me . ' There ' s plenty of room at my house , and to-morrow you might enjoy a walk around the settlement . ' I accepted the invitation with pleasure . It was a warm starlit night , so profoundly still that long after we had left the ship I heard one of the sailors there singing softly to himself . We passed around the end of a ruined pier and entered a river with immense trees overarching it from either bank . Hardly a gleam of light came through the interlacing branches . Presently we brought up before a flight of stone steps descending into the water , where the skiff was made fast . It was so dark there that I did not see the man seated at the top of the steps until Mr. Cowden switched on his flash-lamp . He was a native , a very old man , naked to the waist , and wearing a pair of knee-length cotton drawers . His white hair was closely cropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the appearance of a mask . He rose as we approached , and stood leaning on a paddle . I noticed then that his whole body was covered with tatooing in curious and intricate designs . When Mr. Cowden spoke tohim he made a barely perceptible gesture of assent by raising his eyebrows ; otherwise one would have thought that he had not observed us at all , and as we passed he stood gazing sombrely over our heads toward the opposite bank of the river . My host preceded me through an arched gateway opening into a garden overgrown with weeds . Just before we reached the house he stopped . Has the captain told you of the old heathen Father Gilbert and Mr. Rudge have been trying to save for so many years ? Well , that ' s the man . He has no use for any of us , though he tolerates me , after a fashion , because I furnish him with tobacco . You should see his manner of accepting my small favors , like a king receiving tribute from a petty prince . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . You noticed his height ? He is six feet four . Imagine this island in the old days filled with men of that stamp ! ' He led the way then into a spacious two-story dwelling , with upper and lower balconies all round . It was in a sorry state of repair . Heavy wooden shutters hung askew ; the pillars supporting the balconies were crumbling away , and large fragments of plaster had fallen from walls and ceilings . Mr. Cowden occupied three rooms on the upper floor . These had been comfortably furnished , and were in the agreeable state of disorder of most bachelor establishments . When the lamps had been lighted my host sorted over his mail . I 'll not bother with this to-night , ' he said . I 've only three or four letters to get off ? plenty of time to-morrow ; but if you do n't mind I ' 11 just glance through this volume of Collingwood 's . Here are some magazines that might interest you . ' He lit his pipe and stretched out on a sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of monthly and weekly reviews , some of which I had read in America long before . There were articles on religion , politics , social questions , criticisms of novels and volumes of poetry , and in all of them I was conscious of a recurring note of cynicism , of disillusionment as plainly discernible as the melancholy laughter of a trombone in a ' Blues ' symphony . I made a brief extract in my notebook of one critical article ? a review of an anthology of verse called American Poetry since 1900 . ' There are more than five hundred professional poets , ' the critic began , practising their trade in America at this moment ! So solemn a thought must make anyone pause . ' He then paused at length , to consider the contents of the volume , and having quoted and commented through two columns he came to the following conclusion : ' Futility , vulgarity , overconsciousness of the one , blindness to the other ? these are the two things that weigh upon our time . With no dreams left that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear what is cheap or turn in weariness from all . While we cast our voices across the Atlantic without having anything to say ; while we fly across continents in a day without knowing what to do when we have arrived , this is the sort of literature we produce . Wireless and aeroplanes are the poetry of our age , mustard gas and high explosives the stage-properties of its tragic genius ; but of memorials outlasting bronze we have raised ourselves but few . ' Well ! ' said Mr. Cowden , closing his book with a sharp clap , I 'm going to have a rare time reading Collingwood . It ' s interesting to find that he bears out what all the other explorers and travelers have said of the beauty of life at Taputea in the old days . It must have been so . It 's impossible to doubt it in the face of such unanimous opinion . Have you read anything about the island ? ' One or two old hooks , ' I replied . Otherwise my knowledge is limited to what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you ' ve heard , with respect to missionaries in particular . I often take issue with the captain on that question ; but , you know , I think he 's right . I doubt whether there has ever been , elsewhere , a primitive race so utterly and quickly destroyed by the Christian Church as the inhabitants of this island . That ' s a broad statement . One might talk until doomsday without convincing a churchman of the truth of it . Various causes contributed to the disappearance of these people , but there is not the slightest doubt that the missionaries bear by far the larger part of the responsibility . You know , very likely , that the group to which Taputea belongs was among the last in Polynesia to resist the encroaching whites . The natives had an instinctive distrust of us from the first , more deeply ingrained than is often the case with a primitive people . When representatives of the first Mission Society attempted to establish themselves here , the result was utter failure . The two men chosen to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record as a " boot-maker , " and William Creel , " gentleman 's servant and since tin-worker . " Nearly the whole complement of saints on the mission ship were fanatical , narrow-minded , ignorant people , with an appalling conviction of the sacredness of their cause . The natives would have nothing to do with them , and small wonder , for they were a proud , intelligent race for all their primitive culture , and they were not long in discovering the truth ? that they were superior to the men who had come to them as teachers and preceptors . And they learned as quickly that the purpose of the missionaries was nothing less than to overthrow their society and to establish in its stead a civilization as joyless as it was ugly and alien . Well , as I have said , the first attempt was a failure , but the missionaries had the horrible persistence of their kind . They came again and again , and when peaceable methods failed they resorted to force . They were landed under cover of the guns of warships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative . The result was the inevitable one . The missionaries set to work at once to destroy the tapu ? a system of laws , half secular , half religious , which constituted the only reetraints the natives knew . These restrictions were always enforced and rarely violated . They covered every phase of human life , from the insurance of an adequate food-supply to the worship of the gods and the Levitical code governing childbirth or marriage with a relative . All of this was destroyed , as it had to be if Christianity was to thrive ; and that is why I say that the Church is as guilty with respect to these people as though it had lined them up in their thousands and shot them down . Take from any nation its religion , its secular law , the tradition and immemorial custom which have all the binding effect of law ? what is there left ? What happens ? Precisely what has happened here . Think of it ! This wholesale desolation has taken place in one man 's lifetime ! The old native we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembers the last of the tribal wars . The Taputeans had wars , of course , but compared with ours they were as innocent as boys ' mimic battles . In the old days , although they had bows and arrows , these were only for sport . It was considered ignoble to use them in warfare , which was a man-to man adventure . And here is another thing to their credit : they abhorred infanticide , the system of birth-control which was practised by other branches of the Polynesian family . Children were welcomed , cherished , and almost spoiled by love . Strangely enough , during their centuries of isolation Nature seems to have adjusted matters so that the men far outnumbered the women . Their marriage customs , which so shocked the early missionaries , were undoubtedly better suited to their tribal life than the monogamy which was the white man 's substitute . Each woman had two husbands at least ? a young man who was her lover , and an older man to provide for her . The position of women was high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ' Am I boring you with all this ? ' he asked suddenly . ' What started me anyway ? Oh yes ? Collingwood 's book . ' Please go on , ' I replied . ' Tell me something more of the people . Cook , as I remember it , called them the finest race in the Pacific . Was that true , do you think ? ' Yes , I think it was . If there were time for you to go through these books of mine you would be impressed by the unanimity of opinion on that point . Every explorer , without exception , who visited the island in former times , described the inhabitants in terms of almost extravagant praise . Naturally enough , the women came in for the larger share of it . Mendaila said they were lovelier than the famous beauties of Lima , and you may remember the later account of Cook 's surgeon . He declared the women to be the most beautiful he had ever seen , and that the race as a whole surpassed any nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly impressed by their beauty . A droll incident occurred when they first came here . A group of young women , dressed only in girdles of leaves , swam off to the mission ship . There were some famished goats on board , and in their eagerness for green fodder they soon stripped these nymphs of their light garments . Imagine how shocked the missionaries must have been ! But evidently they did n't turn away their eyes , for in their record it is stated that " for symmetry of form these young women might have served as models for the statuary and the artist . " Let me make one more quotation , from Collingwood this time . He visited Taputea , as I have said , in 1832 , as second-in-command of the Resolute . While his captain was charting the bays and harbors , Collingwood , with two young midshipmen for companions , explored the valleys . He spent six months ashore , living with the natives , and during that time not a single unpleasant incident occurred to mar his relations with them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as brave . This is a part of what he says of the inhabitants under a chapter called " General Observations " : ? ' It is not possible to praise too highly the beauty and grace of body of the Taputeans . The men are unusually tall ? rarely less than six feet in height ? and splendidly proportioned . The women by comparison seem uncommonly diminutive . They are of a pale-olive complexion , with exquisite hands and feet , and their hair would be the envy of the most richly endowed women of England or France . Both sexes have teeth of milky whiteness , due perhaps to their largely vegetable diet . Their features are regular and so distinctly European that one could easily believe this race to be some lost remnant of our own . During my six months on the island I saw no instance of natural deformity , and disease appears to be unknown . The Taputeans have developed a complex and highly organized system of government and religion well suited to them . The communal life as it exists in their valleys seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society is ever likely to become . We have nothing to teach the Taputeans which could benefit them in any respect or make them happier than they now are . If for once the nations of Europe could forget their hatreds and jealousies and their eagerness for dominion ; if they could agree to unite in protecting these islands , never to visit them , never to interfere in any way with the lives of their inhabitants , there might remain to after time an example of a primitive race living under natural and social conditions which one may truthfully say approach the ideal . ' Mr. Cowden threw the hook on the table and walked restlessly up and down the room . ' What a splendid suggestion ! ' he said . ' Supposing it had been carried out ; supposing that England and France and America had joined forces for that purpose . They might have taken the mandate in turns . There is one small island in this group which has never been inhabited , and it is far enough away from the others so that there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sailors . This might have been made the station for a man-of-war whose purpose it would have been to see that no ships of any nation ever touched at the islands . The natives would have been left wholly to themselves . Once every fifty years or so , a few men of Collingwood 's type might have been permitted to spend several months ashore so that the outside world might keep in touch with this primitive civilization . Personally , I should have been content merely to know that it was in existence . And it might have been at this moment ? think of it ! ' But how absurd for me to be talking like this ! ' he added with a wry smile . ' What nations could have been found with the forethought , the unselfishness to carry out such a plan ? No , no , it would have been impossible ; but we 've lost something here well worth preserving , and it can never be replaced ? never ! Think of the people who were asking , one hundred years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is human happiness to be found ? " And at that very time ignorant men and women were destroying , in the name of Christianity , the one place in the world , perhaps , where happiness was the rule and not the exception . And the old missionary record says , " The devout intercessions of the Christian world were continually ascending , like incense to Heaven , for the success of the embassy . " They were ? there 's no doubt of it . Well , their prayers were answered . ' What happened after all the natives had been converted ? ' I asked . ' What has happened nearly everywhere else in Polynesia . The old life was completely changed , and the natives , exploited by men of superior cunning , lost heart . By 1850 they were rapidly decreasing in numbers . Trade had followed the Word , of course , and disease followed trade . The white colony was growing all this while . In the sixties there were three hundred or more ? planters and traders making small fortunes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in persuading the natives to work on the plantations . There was nothing they wanted . Knives , mirrors , cheap jewelry , and gaudy calicoes ? the usual inducements of the white man ? were worthless here . At last the traders thought of opium , and after that there was no more trouble . The natives would do anything to get it , even work . ' I suppose this old house is a relic of those days ? ' Yes . There are half a dozen others like it in the settlement . No one has lived in them for years . After the Civil War , when American cotton was again on the market , the place began to run down , and by the late seventies nearly everyone had gone . Old La Motte , the government agent , is the only one left of all that crowd . He must be nearly ninety ? in his dotage , of course , and very deaf . The Resident Agency used to be quite an important post . It was abolished in 1901 ? there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was retired on half-pay . But he 's forgotten all about that . He thinks he 's still in the government employ and goes to his office every day . I ' 11 take you to see him tomorrow . ' The sun was an hour high by the time we had finished coffee the following morning . I decided to spend a part of the day in an excursion up the valley , but before starting I went in my host 's company to call on Mr. La Motte . The government building was a gloomy-looking structure , so encompassed by the jungle that the air inside was like that of a cavern and the light very dim . The walls of the hallway were covered with the mud cells of wasps , and open doorways revealed high-ceilinged rooms filled with a litter of old furniture , copra sacks , barrels , and packing-cases . We found Mr. La Motte in a large room at the rear of the building . He was seated at a table , writing , his eyes within an inch of the page before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was not until he touched his shoulder that he looked up from his work . He was frightfully emaciated , quite bald , with a face so pale that it seemed to radiate a faint light . He gazed at us with a puzzled expression . You wish to see me ? ' he asked , in a low colorless voice . Yes ; you remember me , Mr. La Motte ? Cowden , Professor Cowden . The George Pritchard came in last night . She ' s brought us a visitor . ' He seemed to be pondering the words , trying to rearrange them in his mind . At length he nodded , smiling wanly . George Pritchard ? Oh yes , I remember him . ' He looked doubtfully from one to the other of us ; then , speaking to Mr. Cowden , ' This is his son ? ' No , no ? not his son . Merely a visitor . He came by Captain Grey 's schooner . You remember , he calls her the " George Pritchard . " ' Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Of course ! ' he added ; you wish to register . Just a moment . ' He rose painfully , went to a shelf filled with ancient ledgers , and stopped irresolutely before it . While he was making his search I glanced around the room . It was musty with the smell of old documents , which were piled everywhere on tables and chairs and scattered over the floor . The walls were covered with faded photographs of sailing vessels , picnic parties , and plantation scenes . In a tarnished-gilt frame above the table was an engraved invitation requesting the presence of Mr. Alfred La Motte at a dinner and ball to be given on board H. M. S. Implacable on the evening of November 21 , 1872 ; and under this was the menu card of the dinner prepared and eaten a half-century ago . Mr. Cowden touched my arm and nodded toward the old man , who was wandering vaguely here and there . Noticing some papers on the floor , he stopped to pick them up . Having collected an armful , he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at finding us there . You wish to see me ? ' he asked again , in the same puzzled way . Some other time , Mr. La Motte . It is n't at all important . We ' 11 call again when you ' re not so busy . ' Yes ; you 'll excuse me , gentlemen ? I have some very important matters to look into . Come round to the club at four . We have very jolly times there . ' And he resumed his chair and began fumbling over his papers . I 'm sorry I brought you , ' said Mr. Cowden when we were again outside . But sometimes his mind is fairly clear , and in that case it would have pleased the old chap immensely to have had a visitor . He would have made no end of a fuss in looking over your papers and having you register . Here 's the club , by the way . Hardly worth while going in . It was closed long before my time . ' We halted in front of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' still faintly visible over the door . I 'll leave you here , ' he said . ' A little farther on you will find a path leading off to the left . Follow it past the convent to the river . Then you have only to keep straight on up the valley . Wait a moment ! Here 's Father Gilbert , our philologist . ' A robust little man wearing a sun helmet and a black soutane had just emerged from the path I was about to take . He had a long grayish beard and pale-blue eyes , all but hidden under shaggy eyebrows . Well , Father , how are you getting on with the dictionary ? ' Mr. Cowden asked , after I had been introduced . Slowly , slowly , ' he replied . ' I ca n't say that I see the end of the K 's , but I 'm making progress . And by the way , Professor ? you remember our discussion , some time ago , of kaki , the word for " albacore " ? You said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kakahi in the Proto-Polynesian tongue ? ' Yes , I believe it was . ' Well , I 've been searching out modifications of the word , and I find that it is kakasi in the Penrhyn Island dialect ? there , you see , the consonants are still retained . But note this ! The Tahitian variant is aahi , and in Rarotongan we have aai , the pure root form . Is n't that interesting ? It is an excellent illustration of my point , that in all the Polynesian dialects the roots are vowel . ' I left them a moment later for my walk up the valley . The path was clearly defined at first . It led through a thicket of weeds and bushes to the convent , a large two-story building with a grass-grown gravel walk before it . All the windows were closed and shuttered save those of one room at the corner . Hearing the sound of voices I glanced in . It was a schoolroom running half the length of the building , filled with rows of empty desks . Sister Theresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe , stood at a blackboard with a pointer in her hand , and two native girls , her only pupils , were repeating after her in singsong voices , deleted material They were pretty children of fourteen or fifteen , and one of them had the splendid hair Lieutenant Collingwood had praised so highly in her ancestors . Crossing the river by a steel girder ? all that remained of the bridge ? I passed through a grove of mango and breadfruit trees where there were three or four thatched huts . They were evidently occupied , but I saw only one old woman sleeping in the shade of a doorway . Far up the valley I came upon the house of the old native I had seen the night before . He was leaning against a tree , and his wife lay on a mat near by , her chin propped on her hands . I passed within a dozen yards of them , but neither spoke or gave the slightest indication that they had seen me . There was no trail beyond this point , but I pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and around the trunks of trees , walking sometimes in the river and sometimes along the banks . All the way up the valley , on both sides of the stream , I saw great stone platforms on which the natives had formerly built their houses . Most of them were overgrown with trees and shrubs , but they had been so massively built that hardly a stone had been dislodged by the encroaching jungle . Toward midday I entered a ravine so deeply shaded by overhanging mountain-walls that it was nearly free from undergrowth . After following it for some distance I found it blocked from side to side by a terrace of stonework . A rude stairway led to a second and a third terrace , and beyond this was a paved platform , fully one hundred pacas long by half as wide . At the back of it , in a recess hewn out of solid rock , was an immense stone image , partly covered with moss . It had fallen from its pedestal and was leaning against the mountain wall , gazing with wide-eyed vacuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , but not so lonely , I think , as another in the main valley where I stopped for a swim . There the river descended in a series of cascades to a splendid bathing-pool , walled on one side by a flat-topped boulder almost as large as Mr. Cowden 's house . Steps had been cut up the sloping face of the rock . These were plainly footworn , and there was another depression at the summit where countless generations of island children must have stood before leaping off into the still , deep water . I returned slowly toward the settlement , trying to imagine the scenes one would have witnessed in the valley a century ago . Collingwood had estimated its population at twenty-five hundred , and that of the island as a whole at six thousand . Now it was indubitably a Christian island , but the cost of making it so seemed out of all proportion to the result achieved . The silence of the place , its forlorn and lonely aspect , brought to my mind that dolorous land in Lyonnesse where King Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary ramble were a few tiny iridescent lizards rustling over the dead leaves , and a species of small dust-colored bird which fluttered soundlessly through the undergrowth . But no ? I had forgotten . Late in the afternoon , about a mile above the settlement , I met the native girl whose beautiful hair I had admired as I passed the convent school . She was walking arm in arm with two of the half-caste sailors from the schooner . They saw me from a distance and all three vanished into the bush . When I passed the place I heard a ripple of laughter hardly to be distinguished from the murmur of the stream . Iv On Sunday morning the captain sent word that we were to sail at ten . I was glad to leave Taputea , although reluctant to part from my kindly host . We had talked as men do who meet by chance , and part knowing they will never meet again . I have not forgotten an observation of his made as we were walking along the deserted grass-grown street toward the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . Take a last look , ' he said . ' Here you see the result of three generations of missionary effort . ' The service in Mr. Rudge 's church had just begun . There were four worshipers ? one man and three old women . Mr. Rudge was reading the lesson from a native Bible , rounding off his periods with vigor and solemnity . The church stood close to the beach , and as we waited there for the schooner 's whaleboat we ( . uld hear the missionary 's voice echoing through the empty building . Think of it ! ' said my host . ' What a fiasco this whole civilizing , Christianizing experiment has been ! Who has profited by it in any way ? Who has been made happier ? No one ? not a soul . The natives are dead ; the island is forgotten by the nation that stole it from them . As the captain said , it would be amusing if it were not so tragic . ' I wonder what Mr. Rudge and Father Gilbert think ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appreciate either the humor or the tragedy . I doubt whether they ever have . Listen ! Mr. Rudge can speak for himself . Do you know that hymn ? ' They were singing at the church . The words were in the native tongue , but the air I recognized at once . It was ' Onward , Christian Soldiers . '
