Robinson of Arkansas , for the most rancorous of the many attacks he has delivered in the Senate against the Catholic Church and Governor Smith of New York , Senator Thomas Heflin of Alabama today demanded that the Arkansan resign his leadership . Senator Robinson immediately ' accepted the challenge and summoned his Democratic colleagues to a caucus tomorrow , morning to vote on a motion , the effect of which , it is believed ? here tonight , will be ' to put ? every minority : member on recur ' tr ; whether , or not he believes the fa , . that a man a , merabtr of t Roman Catholic Church renders 15 ' for the Democratic no. nation for President of the Uni. , States . At the same time and on the sat motion the Democrats will vote thek repudiation or endorsement of the ; anti-Roman Catholic tirades of Seaator Heflin and sustain or prove Senator Robinson 's leadership and rebuke of the Alabaman .. Robinson Rebukes Heflin . For more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Heflin ? had denounced the Catholic Church , its clergy and Governor Smith in terms even more bitter than he has employed in previous speeches on thy same topic . When he sat down , hir race covered with perspiration and his big frame quivering with passion , Senator Robinson took the floor , and in a speech as scathing as any delivered in the Senate in years repudiated the utterances of his colleague as not only undemocratic , . but as unworthy of a Senator or any other person . Senator Heflin , his face red with anger , jumped to his feet and demanded that Senator Robinson resign as leader , because of the rebuke , and like a ' flash Senator Robinson accepted the challenge . Tomorrow morning , he announced , his colleagues would have the opportunity to vote on which side they stood ; with Heflin for bigotry and intolerance , or with him for . tolerance and political justice to all.men and women , regardless of whether they be Protestant . Catholic or Jew or of any other faith . That the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic nomination for President at Houston in June is frankly conceded by the Democrats . That it also may vitally affect the chances of Governor Smith is not denied . As the unofficial poll shows , the prospect is for an endorsement of the declarations of Senator Robinson by a majority . that will approach unanimity . The impression prevails that not more than three or four , if that many , Senators will vote to support Heflin . Heflin Attacks Smith . The Senate was ready to dispose of the motion to declare the seat of Frank L. Smith as a Senator from Illinois vacant , when Senator Heflin took the floor . The Senate had been in session only a few minutes . The Alabama man said be was going to discuss the forged Mexican documents published by William R. Hearst , especially the one which purported to show that about $350,000 had been allowed by the Mexican Government to Senator Heflin himself . At the outset of his speech he brought in the name of Governor Smith . If it could be . proved , . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents printed in the Hearst newspapers , it would be " a death blow to Smith . " . " Would you , " the Senator shouted , " want this Roman Catholic wet in the White House ? Would you want this Al Smith in charge of this Government , with power to appoint , a Secretary of State , with power to appoint the Ambassador to Mexico , with power to send American boys to Mexico to be killed in the service of the Pope of Rome ? " Oh , let me tell you , there are some important men in the Democratic party wh , , are supporting him , but they are not coming back to Washington when this thing is all over . " The Catholic machine threatens to break the party , to smasb , the 14emocracy , if it . does , 40t ' 4ituPiLlgita Smith . Let them break it . Let the scatter it to bits as they did in 1924 But let that bunch support one hon est Democrat before they elute to u with a candidate of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce legislation in this Senat to deport every man and woman wh can not take honest allegiance to th American flag and the America Constitution . I am going to ask th Senate to deport every man an woman who think they owe doubl allegiance , first to Romanism an second to Americanism . " In a voice that could be heard i the rotunda of the Capitol he shout ed , " the Catholic machine of th Pope of Rome , guided in this coun try by the Order of Jesuits , is broad casting political propaganda the pur pose of which is to bring about th nomination of Governor Smith b the Houston convention . " " Talk to me about Al Smith ! " con tinued Senator Heflin , as he face full square the gaze of the packe galleries . " He will never he nomi nated with the deliberate judgmen of the people of the United States . " At another point he declared " th results are influencing weak-minded people . " As for the Ku Klux Klan , whos particular pet . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a year ago , he said he held no brief for the hooded men but he endorsed nearly everything the Klan stands for . Mrs. Hearst 's name was introduced when Senator Heflin declared a Catholic obtained the forged documents , that two Catholics were alleged to have pilfered them and that Bishop Diaz , spokesman for the Mexican Roman Catholic Episcopate , had been mentioned as the man for whom the documents were intended . " Hearst 's wife , " added the Senator , " is a Roman Catholic . m body without some expression from . a constitutional Democrat . The word " constitutional " brought a titter from the galleries and broad s smiles were noted on the faces of many Senators on both sides of the aisle . 7 " Whenever the Senator from e Alabama , " Senator Robinson reo sumed , " can determine who shall be e ' leader of the Democratic Party in n I the Senate of the United States , that party can get somebody other than e myself to lead it . " d He suggested that Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit ' ? of doing , revise his remarks to " an I " I extent that tbels are not recognizable after he speaks here . " n Senator Heflin snouted " That 's not true , " and repeated it . Vice President Dawes reminded him that the e Senator from Arkansas had the floor . Condemns Reference to Candidates . e " With peculiarly bad taste , " cony tinued Senator Robinson , " without justification in the conscience of a single one of his colleagues , either d cn this side of the chamber or the - other , the Senator from Alabama has t'lugged into this debate the names of Heflin Objects to Reply . " So far as I am concerned , " interjected Senator Heflin , " I am going to object to the Senator from Arkansas remaining on that committee any longer . He feels called on to try to answer my speech today and go out of his way since somebody has come down there and had a conversation with him , and I am going to object to the Senator remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is fair to me , and as a representative of the Democratic Party I repudiate his speech . " " You can do all that now or at any other time , " was Senator Robinson 's retort . Then he continued : " I am making this statement from a sense of fairness and justice . I have served in this Senate a good many years . But I feel that I have a duty to perform on this occasion . I may be wrong about it , the Senator from Alabama may be right , but I do not believe there is a member of this committee who does not in his conscience justify my declaration that the inference asserted over and over again by the Senator from Alabama that the Catholic Church and the Knights of Columbus forged or inspired the forgery of these documents to injure him is unjust and unwarranted . " Senator Reed of Pennsylvania , the Chairman of the committee , rose to say he endorsed every word uttered by Senator Robinson . " There was not , " said Senator Reed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inspired by any religious sect or any religious group whatever . " No Proscription for Religion . Senator Robinson then went on : " For months the Senator has been repeating these so-called anti-Catholic speeches , and now he has brought into the Senate the question as to who shall be nominated by the Democratic Party . He has said we should prospective Presidential candidates . e The Senate of the United States can not determine whom the Democratic Party will nominate for President at its next convention , to be held at Houston , Texas . The Senator from Alabama has asserted over and over that the Governor of New York , Mr. Smith , will not be nominated , and he gave as his reason the assertion that Governor Smith is a Catholic . " " That he was a Tammanyite , a wet and a Roman Catholic , " Senator Heflin interrupted . " And a Catholic  --  yes , " Senator Robinson replied , " and he said that Democrats should hang their heads in shame at the mention of the name of Governor Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of such an irrelevant declaration , but it does seem to me that the statement made from this side of the chamber as with the authority and approval of the Democratic members of the Senate should be denied . " " I never suggested the matter to any Democrat , " interrupted Senator Heflin , " and I do not care whether they endorse it or not . I am at liberty to speak about it . Does the Senator from Arkansas take the position that I can not say he will not be elected ? " Heflin Speaks of Tar and Feathers . " Oh , no , " retorted Senator Robinson , " I heard the Senator from Alabama a dozen times during the last year make what he calls his antiCatholic speech . I heard him denounce the Catholic Church and the Pope of Rome and the Cardinals and the Bishops and the priests and the nuns until I am sick and tired of it , as a Democrat . " " I would like to have the Senator make that speech in Arkansas , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will make it in Alabama too , " Senator Robinson said , facing his colleague . " Yes , and if you do they will tar and feather you , " the Alabamian shouted , his face livid . " Oh , yes , " retorted Senator Robinson , " that shows the proscriptive spirit which dwells in the bosom of the Senator from Alabama . It is illustrative of how a good man can go wrong , and how far wrong he can go , and what a fool he can make of himself after he has gone wrong . " Robinson Calls Conference . " The Senator from Alabama has served notice on me because I do not agree with him respecting this subject , and the statement that he made about it , that he is , in some mysterious way , going to remove me from the leadership of this side of the chamber . " The Senator can attempt that at any time , and I am going to call a conference tomorrow , and I challenge the Senator from Alabama to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Democratic Party of the Senate . " We will take a vote on the subject there and find out whether the Senator from Alabama is entitled to discredit millions of good citizens of the United States in the name of the Democratic Party because of their religion . " I have never been classed as an kl Smith supporter , but I have not been one of that class who believed Governor Smith should be excluded from the list of candidates because he is a Catholic . " I do not believe in excluding a candidate on account of his religion , nor do I believe in nominating a candidate on account of his religion . " I believe , Mr. President , that one who is a Catholic has just as much right to apply for the favor of his party associates as one who is a Methodist or a Baptist , and I believe that when you deny that right you deny a fundamental prinbiple of this Government . " If I had my way about it , I would stop Catholics from abusing Protestants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address of the Senator from Alabama is unwholesome ' and harmful . The trouble about the Senator from Alabama is that he takes himself so seriously he thinks he can dictate to the whole Democratic Party what is right , and I do not think he can do so . " There is not any well-grounded feeling in the Democratic Party of antagonism toward Catholics . Many of our strongest supporters are members of the Catholic Church . Many of the greatest Democrats this nation has known are members of the Catholic Church . Londemns Heflin 's Speeches . " Whether I continue to serve on the select committee or am removed on the motion of the Senator from Alabama , I think that he has too long and too often injected the religious controversy into these debates . " I do not challenge his right to differ , but as he differs from me , he can not question my right to assert my own opinion . Written deep in the history of all the centuries gone by is the record of persecutions , religious persecutions . " Catholics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shames and crimes have been perpetrated in the name of religion . It is all contrary to the spirit of this Government and he does his country no service who lights the torch or sounds the cry of religious intolerance and persecution . " Robinson to Offer Resignation . Immediately he had ended his Robinson Refutes Heflin . ? The Senate galleries were packed to the doors when Senator Heflin sat down . It was not expected that anybody would reply to him . Up to today none has done so . But this afternoon the big Alabaman had the surprise of his career . Senator Robinson , who was seated in the front row on the Democratic side , directly facing Vice President Dawes , asked recognition . There was no mistaking the seriousness with which he viewed the task he was undertaking . He explained that he was going to make a statement from a sense of duty , a statement that in fairness and justice it was up . to him to make in reply to what the Senator from Alabama had said . Senator Robinson spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the special Senate committee that had investigated the authenticity of the Mexican documents and finally as a member of the Democratic Party . He declared that the bringing in of Mrs. Hearst 's name was absolutely unwarranted and that there was not a scintilla of evidence to support the allegation . He added that it was not chivalric on the part of Senator Heflin to seek to cast so grave an aspersion on an innocent woman in no way , form or manner , o far as the evidence disclosed , inVolved in the Hearst-Mexican controversy . Nor was there any justification for the inferential statement of Senator Heflin " that the Catholic Church or Catholic agencies inspired or promoted these forgeries for the purpose of humiliating him ( Heflin ) or disgracing him or for any other purpose . This was not supported by a word of the testimony before the Senate Investigating Committee , Mr. Robinson added . hang our heads in shame at the mention of the name of Governor Smith . " No man who is a Democrat in the finest sense of the word would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I do not belong to the Catholic Church ? what little religion I have is invested in the Methodist Church  --  the fact remains that one who looks at history with an unprejudiced eye can not fail to recognize the fact that the glory of this Republic and the lustre of the flag and the promise which the future holds are locked up in the memory , the deeds , the achievements of American citizens , and no distinction has been made , or can be made , as to what religion they profess . " Senator Heflin jumped to his feet in unsuccessful effort to interrupt , when the Democratic leader proceeded to defend the patriotism of men and women of the Catholic faith in America . He referred to Cardinal Mercier , lifted his hands high and exclaimed : " God bless his memory ! " He told the story of the nuns who had gone from the North into Memphis when that city was scourged by yellow fever forty or more years ago and recited the fact that Catholic boys had fought and died in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that Senator Heflin demanded the deposal of Senator Robinson as leader , shouting that the latter was no longer the man to lead the Democratic minority in the Senate . " We are , " he exclaimed , " going to draw the line ! I will insist on it . The Senator from Arkansas can not remain leader of the Democrats and fie the battle of the Roman Catho- a lio . " KeFy time it is raised in this r speech , Senator Robinson announced the call for the Democratic caucus to meet tomorrow morning at 10:30 o'clock . The only business will be the endorsement or repudiation of Senator Robinson . Senator Robinson , it is said , will tender his resignation as leader and immediately the vote will follow on a motion , probably to be made by Senator Reed of Missouri , to refuse its acceptance . Later , probably tomorrow afternoon , Senator Robinson will give the Republicans a chance to put themselves on record . This will be when he offers his resignation as a member of the special Senate investigating committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican side , that the resignation be rejected . All the indications tonight ow , re for a lively crenate day -- tomor ?
