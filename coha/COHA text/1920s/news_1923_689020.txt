txt Further rumblings from the dark cloud hovering over the venture of the Locomotlye Engineers ' Brotherhood into the coal mining business are audible . On May 14 The Wall Street Journal printediquotations from letters which had passed between Chief Warren S. Stone , of the engineers , and officers of mine union locals , in which the engineers in their role of coal barons were accused of employing non-union labor at less than the union scale to produce coal while the United Mine Workers were on strike . More recently press dispatches quote Mr. Stune as saying that his Coal River Collieries Co. never asks a man whether he is ? union or not , that the men can organize if they want to , but that the mines are in a field where no union has existed for twenty years . Meanwhile , the company is charged by unionists with having dismissed union missionaries from its employ . Realizing that Mr. Stone is a busy man , this newspaper suggests a form-letter for use in replying to the remonstrances likely to pour in upon him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like this : Dear Sir and Brother : Replying to yours of recent date charging prominent members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers with owning and managing a scab coal mine in utter disregard of the sacred rights of labor , the . dictates of humanity , etc. , allow me to call your attention to the fact that the degree of sanctity attaching to the cause of labor varies directly as the force of the punch behind it . That , in turn , is a function of the ratio between union and non-union labor in a given industry . It follows that the cause represented by the B. of L. E. , with about 99% of all locomotive engineers enrolled , is far more sacred than that of the miners , who are organised in only about 60% of the industry . Although I am now writing as a coal , mine owner , let me step out of that role for a moment and give You a friendly - tip on practical union management . You do n't suppose that it was Garretson 's sob-stuff , , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? Or that it was the ? living wage dope of Jett Lauck and ' Warne that preservid the- war-time scale in the union - mines last summer ? The intelligent labor leader delegates that sort of thing to economists hired for the purpose , while he concentrates his own attention upon perfecting a machine capable of wringing the consumer 's neck . Of , course , he never contemplates using it that way and Is never respensible for anything such as happened at Herrin lasebsumrner . Still , he should have the maohine . I never owned a railroad , and so I can hold fast my conviction that there is only one side to a controversy between a railroad and . its men , but as coal mine owner I have discovered that there are at least two sides to every labor dispute in the coal mines . As long as our men are willing to work for the wages we offer I see no reason why they should not do so . union or no union . If you should succeed in getting all our men out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . As things are , collective bargaining does not enjoy the social sanction in eastern Kentucky that it does in Ohio or Illinois  --  or on the railroads . Economic laws are immutable , and the first of these is that it makes a whale of a difference whose ox is gored . If the above meets Mr. Stone 's requirements he is free to use it without price .
