Two cells in the " death house " at the Charlestown ( Mass . ) State Prison last week failed to receive two occupants who were scheduled to move into them . For Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti , sentenced to be electrocuted during the week of July 10 , were given a one-month respite by Governor Alvan Tufts Fuller of Massachusetts to permit further investigation of their seven-year case . A similar respite was also given to one Celestino F. Madeiros , condemned killer , whose testimony is an important factor in the Sacco-Vanzetti investigation . <P> In granting the 31-day respite , the Governor did not give any indication of what may be his final action . His Advisory Committee ( President Abbott Lawrence Lowell of Harvard , President Samuel W. Stratton of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Judge Robert Grant ) has not as yet held any meetings , presumably owing to Commencement duties of two of its members . Friends of Mr. Sacco &; Mr. Vanzetti were disappointed because the respite was only for one month , but of course there is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seem necessary . <P> Mr. Madeiros , respited along with Messrs . Sacco &; Vanzetti , is to be electrocuted for the murder , in November , 1924 , of a bank cashier . He was a member of a bandit group known as the Morelli gang , has claimed that this gang murdered the South Braintree ( Mass. ) paymaster and guard for whose deaths Messrs . Sacco &; Vanzetti are sentenced to die . He has sworn that neither Mr. Sacco nor Mr. Vanzetti belonged to the Morelli gang , nor were they in any way involved in the South Braintree crime . Mr. Madeiros was first sentenced to be executed in September , 1926 , but his connection with the Sacco-Vanzetti case has procured him a series of respites , though there is no question ultimately as to his death .
