Wisconsin went to the polls and in effect re-elected the late Senator Robert M. LaFollette to the Senate . Senator LaFollette was elected in 1922 to serve until 1929 . He died in June , and three months later his elder son , Robert M. LaFollette Jr. , 30 , barely of age to enter the Senate , became Senator-elect to serve out his father 's term . <P> There were five candidates . The votes they polled in the election were : <P> <P> LaFollette ( Insurgent Republican ) ... 230,000 Dithmar ( Independent Republican ) ... 90,000 <P> Work ( Socialist ) 11.00 ( <P> Bruce ( Independent Democrat ) 10,000 <P> Bauman ( Socialist-Labor ) 700 <P> From Spokane came a telegram to Mr. LaFollette : " I gladly surrender the distinction of being the youngest member of the Senate to a man who is really young . " was sent by Clarence C. Dill , 40 , Progressive Democrat . <P> In not so far off Terre Haute , Senator James E.

Young LaFollette made his campaign on a platform of lambasting President Coolidge and the Republican Party , and he can not be recognized as a Republican when he enters the United States Senate . " <P> The question of whether young Bob , like his father , will be excluded from the Republican caucus of the Senate depends on the action of the caucus . Senator Watson 's words are a prediction ( probably correct ) , not a decree .
