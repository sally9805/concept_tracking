txt By . unanimous decision the Court of Appsals upheld here today the constitutionality of a law passed on March 12 , 1925 , forbidcreation ding the of voting trusts to control bank stocks . The decision , which revc.rse , d those of both the Appellate Division and the Special Term , upheld the contention of former Governor Nathan L. Miller against the counsel for the ? directors of the Bank of America of 44 Wall Street , that the motion of Edward P. Morse , a stockholder , praying for a new election of directors should be granted . Former Governor Charles E. Hug:les was one of the opposing counsel . The proceeding was to review the election of directors of the bank which took place on Jan. 11 , 1927 . The question at issue was the right of trustees under a voting agreement entered into prior to March 12 , 1925 , to vote the stock held by them at the election .

Edward C. Delafield is now President . Excerpts From the Decision . Judge Cuthbert W. Pound wrote the opinion . He said in part : " A voting trust agreement confers on voting trustees the right to vote on stock transferred to them for such purpose , irrevocably for a definite period . * * * The right to vote is thereby separated from the beneficial ownership of the stock . The courts below have upheld the validity of the agreement in question . * * * " Voting , trust agreements whereby the voting power of the stock is separated from its beneficial ownership have been the subject of discussion and wide difference of opinion . " They have in some jurisdictions , in the absence of statutory restriction , been held within the policy of our law and lawful so long as their object is to carry out a particular policy to promote the best interests of all the stockholders or the corporation .. * * * " In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voting power is inherently attached to and inseparable from the real ownership of each share and can only be delegated by proxy with power of revocation ; that all agreements and devices by which stockholders surrender their voting powers are invalid as against a sound public policy . " In New York voting trusts do not stand or fall on common-law theories of public policy . They are recognized and regulated by statute . * * * " A New York voting trust rests for its validity on the statutes . No voting trust not within its terms is legal . * * * The test of validity is the rule of the statute . * * * " Banks Not Excluded . After quoting Section 50 of the Stock Corporatioi. law , prior to the amendment of 1925 , Judge Pound continued : " We are unable to apply ? any rules of statutory construction which would exclude banking corporations from the operation of the ? section . * " Voting trusts are , therefore , legal in New York only when organized and existing under the statute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were excepted prior to the amendment of 1925. * * * However cogent the reasons may ' have been for not applying the voting trust statute to banks by reason of their peculiar relations with the public , it is enough to say that the Legislature did not recognize such reasons as controlling . " The trust agreement herein considered was , therefore , valid at the time it was entered into , viz. , Dec. 31 , 1924 . " On March 12 , 1925 , a new public policy was declared by the Legislature . The words " This section shall not apply to a banking corporation ' were added to Section 50 ( Ch. 120 , L. 12925 ) . - The only question here presented is as to the effect of this amendment as to existing valid voting trust agreements made by the stockholders of banking corporations . " The amendatory statute is not a ' mere repealng statute . It creates a ispecific exception to the , existing law . * * * " It follows that no existing rights of stockholders or voting trustees I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the General Construction law relative to the effect lof a repealing statute upon rights accrued prior to the repeal of a statute . Transfer Rights Ceased . " After March 13 , 1925 , the application of Section 50 in its original form ceased . No stockholder could lawfully transfer his stock to a voting trustee or trustees for the purpose of conferring the right to vote thereon , even though the voting ' trustees were already acting as such for any other stockholder or stockholders of the bank . * ' " The right and power so to transfer his stock rested in the provisions of Section 50 , and when the section ceased to be applicable that right and power became non-existent . * ' " " The effect of the amendment on the right of the trustees to vote on the stock which had been transferred to them when the amendment took effect must next be considered . One of the elements of a legal voting trust agreement is the privilege of any stockholder to become a party to such agreement . . " We may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect and operation . What is the result ? A principal purpose of such agreement is to obtain the control of the bank by the deposit thereunder of at least a majority of the stock of the bank , but this purpose had not yet been accomplished . " When this purpose is thwarted , when a stockholder is prohibited from becoming a party to the agreement , the voting trust agreement has failed in one of its essential purposes . It is no longer an instrument of inchoate complete control . On Rights of Legislature . " When the right of stockholders outside the charmed circle to avail themselves of its privileges ceases its character is changed . It becomes an instrument to unite those who have availed themselves of its privileges and exclude all others instead of an instrument aiming at ultimate control of a majority of the stock . " Referring to arguments against the power of the Legislature to enact such a law the opinion concludes : " The purpose of the Legislature . to correct an evil , real or imagined , is clearly revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature . I " The trustees exercise certain vot- , ing powers , not for their own benefit but for the benefit of the stock-1 holders and the corporation . They1 have no beneficial interest in the stock and thus their right or interest lacks those elements of ownership which are so associated in our minds with the idea of property as to be beyond legislative power or I control . ( Metcalfe v. Union Trust Company , 181 N. Y. 39. 44 ) . " Whatever line of attack on legislative power is taken , the assault is turned back by numerous decisions on the subject . The orders of the Special Term and the Appellate Divisicn should be reversed and peti-
