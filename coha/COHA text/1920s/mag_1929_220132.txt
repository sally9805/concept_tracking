Since 1920 the Department of the Interior has been freely passing out neat permits , at the rate of about 6,000 per year , which set inquisitive oil drills a-rattling on the public domain . Above most of these drills were " wildcatters , " adventurous independent prospectors , sending their small assets down the drill holes on the chance of striking a gusher . <P> Some 20,000 drilling permits were outstanding last week when President Hoover decreed that no more should be issued , that no new oil leases should be executed , that the undiscovered oil supply of the U. S. Government should remain undiscovered indefinitely . He said : <P> " There will be no leases or disposal of government oil lands . . . except those which may be made mandatory by Congress. * In other words there will be a complete conservation of government oil for this administration . " <P> Secretary of the Interior Wilbur promptly picked a committee of three to sift outstanding drilling permits . They were : Commissioner of the General Land Office William Spry , Director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Finney . They will revoke permits which have lapsed or under which specified development has not occurred . <P> Theodore Roosevelt began Conservation in 1907 by withdrawing 16,000,000 acres of forest land from commercial exploitation . William Howard Taft in 1909 withdrew 7,000,000 acres of oil-bearing land . In 1920 Congress passed an oil-leasing act which upset the Roosevelt-Taft policy by permitting the Secretary of the Interior to allow oil prospecting , to grant oil leases . This act spawned the oil corruption of the Harding administration . Now , in the acreage it affects , the Hoover order far outdoes Roosevelt and Taft orders combined . <P> The oil industry 's overproduction , not its underhanded dealings with the U. S. , prompted the Hoover decree . As Secretary of Commerce Mr. Hoover was a member of the Federal Oil Conservation Board and heard predictions by fellow engineers that the U.S. oil resources would be exhausted in five , ten or 25 years , unless steps were taken to check the flow . He knew the U.S. possessed only some 15% of the world 's oil supply , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Businessmen wondered if the Hoover order would help the oil industry out of the depression it has sunk into through overproducing . Only one-tenth of U. S. oil production comes from government land . The Hoover order will cut this production in half , thus reducing the whole industry 's supply by only 5% . But the moral effect of the move may be great . <P> The only protest against the Hoover oil policy came , ironically enough , from Montana 's Senator Walsh , the dynamite who blew the oil scandals above ground . Some of his criticisms were : 1 ) the " wildcatter " whose enterprise developed the oil industry will be penalized ; 2 ) the State of Montana would be " impoverished " by the loss of its one-third share of royalty oil revenue by the withdrawal of 20,000,000 acres of government land in that State alone from further exploitation . Senator Walsh beheld the " big interests " profiting by the Hoover order , and the small concerns operating on U.S. leases squeezed out . <P>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
