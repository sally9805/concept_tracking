Mr. Robinson stands in definite contrast to Senator Lodge of Massachusetts , who will not relinquish the Republican leadership . Mr. Lodge is ultra-conservative and a sectionalist . His policies are much the same as those he expressed when he first came to the Senate 30 years ago . <P> Mr. Lodge appears to have chosen for his lieutenants the two men who might take the leadership from him , Senators Wadsworth of New York and Lenroot of Wisconsin , Actual direction of party legislation will be in their hands , and a fiery session is promised by the three young men in control of the Senate . Mr. Robinson is 50 , with 10 years in the House and 10 in the Senate to his credit . Mr. Wadsworth is 45 and Mr. Lenroot 54.
