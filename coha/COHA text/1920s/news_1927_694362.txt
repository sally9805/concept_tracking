txt A portion of the proceeds taken in by the new Arlington ' Heights race track on Its opening day , Thursday . Oct. 1:1 , are to go to the Illinois Children 's Hume ? me and Aid society . Men and women interested in the society have been busy selling boxes and seats . The charity they seek to aid is one of tho worthiest to which the generous can contribute . There can be no doubt , either of the personal or the social value , of helping children to the fair start in life denied them by circumstances over which they have no control . REFORM LAWS IN PRACTICE . A famous architect , celebrated equally - for his sentimental waywardness and for professional talents , enlists the aid of the federal authortties in charging his lately divorced wife with sending cbsceno matter through the mails . His action replies to his former wife 's attempts to , have him prosecuted under the Mann act and to secure the deportation of his woman companion . The whole manner in which federal law has been invoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation directed at the moral reform of the individual . No laws are so misused , perhaps , as those pieces ? of federal legislation aiming to cure human nature by statute . Every federal agent knows how few charges under the Mann act arc found to be bona fide . The public knows how often the laws pertaining to obscene matter are seized on for sheer publicity purposes and how , in several widely advertised cases , the statutes pertaining to deportation on grounds of immorality were made farcical in their application . This latest case we mention is but another instance of the fallihility of attempting to drill morality into people by force of law . SECRECY IN THE RESERVE BOARD . We hope that Roy A. Young , who has just been sworn in as governor of the federal reserve board , will not fall into the error of assuming that the heavy responsibilities of his office justify him in neglecting . to Inform the public of his Policies and the facts and conclusions which justify them . The position which he now occupies is a difficult one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be revealed and he will be tempted , as other men in his place have been , to reveal as little as possible of other matters which ' are , properly speaking , not matters of confidence . That is the tendency of most men who have long occupied fiduciary positions . The indignation over the enforced lowering of the rediscount rate in Chicago resulted almost as much from the secrecy with which the order was surrounded as from the motives which were believed to animate or at least strongly color it . As government appointees , the governor and members of the reserve board . are respNasible ? to the public for their acts . The whole reserve system was shaken by the opposition of farmers a few years ago , and , if other influential sections of the population are also alienated by indifference to public opinion , it is not difficult to see what the end will be . All true friends of the reserve act hope that the new governor will be mindful of his obligations to the public as well as to the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact . THE POLISH-AMERICAN FLIGHT . Adamkiewicz has returned from Poland with a project to raise $25,000 among Polish-Americans to finance an airplane flight by a Pole from Warsaw to Chicago . He has even started the fund with a personal contribution of $500 . We do not understand why Americans should be asked to contribute to a venture for the glorification of a foreign nation , however friendly . If the flight were to be from Chicago to Warsaw by an American , there might be some justification for it on patriotic grounds ; as the matter is now projected it appears to us to be unfortunate in its encouragement of a divided loyalty . Further than that , the proposal is unwise . The world has been appalled by the number of lives sacrificed in trans-Atlantic flights with only a small gain in aeronautimi knowledge to compensate for the losses . Opinion the v. ? orld over has frowned upon men who have tempted others to their deaths with the promise of prizes and glory If they succeed In highly dangerous feats . There is no way of preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families in mad enterprises , but it Is littl6 short of murderous to tempt men with money to undertake such feats . We hope the good sense and patriotism of the Polish community of Chicago will reject this proposal as summarily as it deserves to be rejected .
