Spring was beginning to brighten over the hills of Nazareth , in Galilee . Mary watched the dandelions , listened to the birds , dreamed of the bridalhood soon to crown her betrothal to the boy Joseph . But one night a voice clove through her dreams like a sword edged with moonlight : " Hail , thou that art highly favored , the Lord is with thee ; blessed art thou among women ! " <P> Mary awoke , and rising from her white pallet fell to her knees , frightened , for a figure of blinding light stood above her . <P> But the Angel spoke comfortingly : <P> " Fear not , Mary , for thou shalt . . . bring forth a son , and shalt call his name Jesus . . . . " <P> Then Mary bowed her fair head and answered : " Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . " <P> And the Angel vanished into the breath of a little spring wind , that dawn at Nazareth. - ( St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dante Gabriel Rossetti . ) <P> But when the boy Joseph found his beloved already heavy with child , he was quite heartbroken . He said nothing , but he reflected how he might put his betrothed from him , gently and without scandal , because he loved her notwithstanding . While he pondered thus one night the Angel came to him , and said : " Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife ; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost . And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus ; for he shall save his people from their sins . " So Joseph was reassured , and took Mary as his wife. - ( St . Matt . I , 18:25 . ) <P> Summer passed with its flowers , fall with its gleaning ; the stalks stood bare in the fields . A general taxation had been decreed for all the Roman Empire . In compliance with custom it became necessary for Joseph to make the nine days ' journey from Nazareth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of David , there to be taxed . It was nigh Mary 's time but he took her with him . <P> Bethlehem was crowded . Joseph could find no room at the inn , or any decent lodging . So humbly in a stable , warmed by the breath of kine , the Babe was born , Mary wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him wailing in a manger , between an ox and an ass ; and the animals fell to their knees before the Babe. - ( St . Luke II , 1:7 ; and tradition . ) <P> Up in the hills that frosty night , huddled in their mantles about a tiny blaze , shepherds were watching their sheep . A sudden glory fell about them , and a shape of beauty stood before them and said : " Behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people . For unto you is born ... a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord . " Then for a moment all around stood a multitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest , and on earth peace . . . " <P> When they had gathered their startled wits , the shepherds went to Bethlehem and found the Babe in the manger , and impulsively adored him . But his mother wondered that strangers should come and thus adore her child ; and she adored him herself , and was more sure of his goodness. - ( St . Luke II , 8:21. )
