In the public auditorium of which Portland , Ore. , is proud , Conductor Willem van Hoogstraten last week led his symphony orchestra through an orgy of fantasy . A native of Portland , Dent Mowrey , had studied music in Paris , and in dreamy moments had idled over the lle de la Cit , whereon is the Cathedral of Notre Dame . Student Mowrey would enter the felted front doors , would sniff at the dank air , would think he could hear the paint cracking on the pictures . Outdoors , on the grey square , he would crane his head up at the rain-spouts , which old artisans had carved in the appearance of fantastic beasts . They were gargoyles , that seemed to droop their eyes in mischievous lure , in vague invitation to Student Mowrey . He pictured the old church standing silent in moonlight , and the gargoyles coming down from their towers for a rowdy riot of dance and clatter . This was material for a symphony , Student Mowrey , cold , sober , realized . <P> Later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' The Gargoyles of NotreDame , " and it was this solo , elaborately orchestrated , that Conductor van Hoogstraten led last week . It was the first composition by a native of Portland that the symphony orchestra had performed , and Conductor van Hoogstraten took quick advantage of the situation . When the first clatter of applause quieted itself there were brought to the platform two wreaths , " evidently denoting genius , and certainly denoting musicianship and adeptness , " wrote the Portland Oregonian 's music reporter . Conductor van Hoogstraten , grinning , put one wreath about the shoulders of Composer Mowrey . Composer Mowrey sought to drape the other on Conductor van Hoogstraten 's shoulders . But Conductor van Hoogstraten ducked .
