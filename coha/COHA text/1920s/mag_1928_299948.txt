Voices shouted , brakes screamed , the cars stopped without crashing , no one was hurt . <P> Nominee Smith , Governors Ritchie of Maryland and Moore of New Jersey , and Senator Edwards of New Jersey , sat on top of a tall tallyho and paraded through Camp Moore at Sea Girt , N. J. An escorting horseman let his mount sidle into one of the coach 's four horses . The coach horses reared , swerved . The tallyho tipped sharply , on two wheels . Nominee Smith and friends clutched their seats . Driver Charles Die reined the horses , straightened the coach . No one was hurt .
