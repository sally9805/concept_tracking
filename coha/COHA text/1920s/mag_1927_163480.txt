Though aware that famed Leopold Stokowski was taking a year 's leave of absence , they had half expected to see the sharp and mobile curlicue of his conjuror 's face , to be entertained by the hunch-ings and bendings of his thin black back , to listen to the superb and golden music which he has been able to coax from his musicians .
