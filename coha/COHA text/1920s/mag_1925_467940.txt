Vital religion is one of the three deepest needs of men . Men must have bread ? that is the economic need ; they must have friendship ? that is the social need ; they must have faith in the spiritual meaning of life ? that is the religious need , In this article and those to follow ? they will appear every month throughout the coming year , con. stituting hereafter a regular department of the Magazine to be entitled " Religion and Life " ? Doctor Fosdick proposes to talk about religion 08 en urgent , present power desperately wanted by men and women everywhere , being sought by men and women in all sorts of strange forms and unconventional settings , and just now trying , amid much confusion , to get itself expressed in ways of thinking and ways of action that modern folk can understand and use . Wherever Doctor Fosdick sees religion springing hot out of life or reacting powerfully on life , or going wrong and perverting life , or gaining sanity and steadiness and purifying life , there he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AN ALERT and spirited reviewer , himself a scientist , recently laid somewhat violent hands on J. Arthur Thomson 's new book Science and Religion . What bothered him was not so much that the biologist of Aberdeen leaves the door wide open to the possi ? bility of intelligent religious faith ; he was vexed that Professor Thomson in particular , or anybody in general , should desire religious faith at all and waste time upon it . He had gone past dis ? cussing the credibility of religion and was skeptical of its desirability . Why , he asked , should anybody want to be ? lieve in God ? Typical as this is of certain limited areas of thought in the new generation , it illustrates the disastrous separation that has taken place between religion and life . Believers must expect , and should be prepared to meet , as their forefathers always have met , antago ? nists who doubt the truth of religion . But when men begin doubting the use ? fulness , the desirability , the practical soul , its sin , its salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A never-dying soul to save And fit it for the sky . For the most part modern congrega ? tions sing such eighteenth-century words without the vivid and picturesque mean ? ings which the words conveyed to eight ? eenth-century minds . We are not other ? worldly in our aspirations . We expect to die , but we spend little time thinking of it , and fitting a never-dying soul for the sky is certainly not the way in which a typical member of the younger generation would describe his major and dominant ambition . Nevertheless , modern as we are , and plainly requiring other frameworks of thought and modes of expression to make genuinely articulate our spiritual experiences and aspirations , we need not suppose that by any modernity we have evaded the necessity of an inward ap ? proach to the problem of living . If we dislike eighteenth-century hymns we may have twentieth-century substitutes , as in Edna St. Vincent Millay 's " Re ? nascence " : The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide ; Above the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is high . The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand ; The soul can split the sky in two , And let the face of God shine through . Rut East and West will pinch the heart That can not keep them pushed apart ; And he whose soul is fiat ? the sky Will cave in on him by and by . If it pleases us better , we may speak about the soul in such terms as these and leave behind us the eighteenth-century 's other-worldliness . But we still are dealing with the same age-long , fun ? damental , human problem ? the success ? ful handling of a man 's own life from within . Here is the real line of discrimination between the realm of physical science on the one side and of religion on theother . The task of physical science is to master the latent resources of the external universe . Magnificent have been its achievements there . Still more splendid will they be . But we could get along for many years with no more accomplishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddle through with only so much steam and electricity under our control as we have now . What we can not do is to muddle through much farther in western civilization with no more control than we now have over the inward lives of men . The wild , phys ? ical universe ? we will tame that yet ! We will harness its forces , saying to this one " Go " and it will go , and to that one " Come " and it will come . But the inner world of man 's life , with its igno ? rance , prejudice , bitterness , pessimism , its instability , waywardness , passion , and sin ? shall we ever bring that into captivity to the obedience of Christ ? Shall we ever make that wholesome , in ? telligent , reverent , unselfish , and broth ? erly ? That is the deepest single question in civilization to-day . To suppose that this central spiritual task of human life can be achieved on an irreligious basis seems to me a contra ? diction in terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what religion means . To be sure , it is possible to define religion in terms of early stages in its evolution , to identify it with magic or superstitious reverence for taboos , or an historic stage of doc ? trinal development ; and some indulge in that cheap and easy method of defa ? mation . They might as well scoff at astronomy because it once was astrology , or outlaw chemistry because it came from alchemy . Religion , like every other interest in human life , dealing with real ? ity and growing in the apprehension of it , has shown endless capacity for change , evolving as other human activities of mind and spirit evolve , never to be ade ? quately described in terms of its chrysa ? lis when at last it has gotten wings to fly . Religion at its best has supplied ? and it can now supply ? the motives , faiths , insights , hopes , convictions by which men inwardly come to terms with them ? selves , gain spiritual ascendancy over their baser elements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquer ? ors . Religion means the achievement of such a view of life , its source , its mean ? ing , its destiny , such personal relation ? ship , moreover , with the Spirit from whom our spirits come , and such fellow ? ship with ourselves , with other people , and with God as will furnish inward spiritual dynamic for radiant and tri ? umphant living . To tell men that they are accidental collocations of physical atoms , that what they think is spirit in them is as much a chemico-mechanical product as phos ? phorescence on the sea and essentially as transient , that they are the passive results of heredity and environment , and by them are as mechanically determined as is a locomotive by its steam pressure and its rails , that they have no spiritual source , no abiding spiritual meaning , no spiritual destiny , and no control over their own character or development ? that is sheer irreligion and , not only can it not solve the problem of which we have been speaking , but if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even try . It would leave the matter helplessly to be decided by the blind action of physical forces that are sup ? posed automatically to control the uni ? verse and us within it . By every step that a man moves away from this thorough-going irreligion to ? ward interest in , and serious concern about , and practical endeavor to deal with the problem of moral autonomy , he comes that much nearer to religion . If he undertake the problem earnestly he is thereby in the thick of religion . He already is discovering in human life spiritual values which he wishes to con ? serve , for the beautifying and purifying of which he is seriously concerned , with ? out whose development and effective dominance he sees no hope for society . He already is thinking of the central meaning of life in terms not of the ex ? ternal world , but of the internal world , with its possibilities of goodness , truth , and beauty . That in itself is in so far religious . And if , as some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but intelligently must go farther to find in this internal world of spirit the revela ? tion of the Reality , whose we are , and whom we may find liberty in serving , we can not long travel this road of inward approach to life before we find ourselves " not far from the Kingdom of God . " Coming at life by way of a merely inherited religion is a played-out pro ? cedure for most thoughtful people . But coming at religion by way of life , and a deep desire inwardly to live it well , is a procedure full of endless promise . As soon as one strikes that road he finds himself in the highway where the seers and prophets of the spirit always have walked , and above all he can distinguish clearly there the footsteps of the Son of Man . This desire for inward peace and power , overflowing in useful and radiant living , is humanity 's profoundest char ? acteristic . It is everywhere to-day alive and urgent . And the churches at the center of their Gospel have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on specializing in irrele ? vancies ? Why so often , like football players who continue a scrimmage after the ball has been carried far down the field , do they keep up a melee at a point from which the vital needs of their gen ? eration long since have departed ?
