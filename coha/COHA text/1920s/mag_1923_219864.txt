The Charles Lang Freer Gallery , a Florentine granite palazzino , was duly opened in Washington by an official visit of the President . The Gallery contains the Freer collection which Mr. Freer gave to the nation through his friend , Theodore Roosevelt . <P> Whistler is the greatest single name in the collection . His famous " Peacock Room , " transported bodily from London , is there , the room which Whistler painted for the English shipping magnate , Leyland , whom he satirized as a peacock rising from a mound of gold . <P> Other noted American painters are there , but the paramount distinction of the Freer collection is that it contains the world 's finest and most complete examples of Asiatic art . Both Europe and Asia must go to Washington to study Asiatic art .
