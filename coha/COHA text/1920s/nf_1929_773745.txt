txt Zoo Ancient Rites and Ceremonies When a man died his children did not succeed , but his brother , or his sister 's son ; the argument being that no man could be certain whether the children of his wife were also his , whereas the children of his sister must be hers , and consequently came of the same stock as himself : this custom ensured the property being kept in the family . Almost from their infancy , children were quite independent of their parents . These people were extraordinarily expert with their light canoes . The only arms they possessed was a club , made of the arm and leg-bone of a man , with a pointed end , and so sharp that the slightest stab would kill . They were also such experts at stone throwing that they could almost penetrate through trees . Men never forgave or forgot an insult , although a long time might elapse before they took revenge . Homicide and theft were regarded with the greatest abhorrence ; houses could therefore be left open with perfect safety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a fly in the ointment of this gentle people which became visible in regard to their marriage customs . A man might take as many wives as he chose , but he usually found that one was sufficient . This commendable abnegation was not so surprising , when one learns that women were so much mistress in their own houses that a man was not even allowed to touch anything without obtaining her permission . If he lost his temper , or did any of the things he ought not to do , the woman either chastised or left him , taking her children and her chattels with her ; thus at any moment a man could be left by a capricious woman . For her , all became once more serene when she and the children adopted another man . If a man 's wife had a liaison , his only remedy was separation ; he had no right to punish his rival , Marianne Islands ( Ladrones ) tot Should , on the other hand , a man have an affaire , his wife called upon all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stick , and put on her husband 's hat . Thus they advanced towards the habitation of the guilty husband , tore up his crops , treading them under foot ; and having broken everything they could lay their hands upon , they finally beat him and drove him away . He might , indeed , consider himself lucky if , in addition to this ill-treatment , they did not pillage everything he possessed and destroy his dwelling . This drastic system of dealing with man 's frailties was hardly calculated to produce in young men a yearning to marry ; they found considerably less discomfort in hiring girls , or buying them from their parents for a piece of iron or tortoise-shell . These girls were kept in a separate establishment , which their lovers visited when they desired . It was in these islands that Dampier first discovered the bread-fruit tree . He describes the fruit as being the size of a man 's head ; when cooked it tasted like our white bread with a flavour of banana , and was very nourishing . There were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the only animal food was a kind of wild-fowl . But Nature had in all respects released these people from any struggle for existence . Time in their lives had no meaning , for beyond the division of a day into an almost equal night , each day monotonously succeeded another ; while the season 's clock of ripening fruits , was merely the procession of pleasant occurrences , and taken as a matter of course . Very few people could be more eloquent in their bereavements , or more lugubrious in their wailings at a death : they wept , literally , in torrents . Their cries were heart-rending ; they also abstained , at least for Io2 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies seven or eight days , from all kinds of food , during which period they kept up a doleful dirge . On a necklet or a cord a knot was tied on each anniversary of a lost child or parent . The wails of tribulation were devastating in the case of the death of a woman belonging to the exclusive class . Trees were uprooted , houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm branches ; while one and all lifted up their voices in some extravagant and poetical rhapsody regarding his affliction , such as , " There is no more life for me now " ; " The Sun which animated me is eclipsed " ; " The Moon which illuminated my way is obscured " ; " The Star which guided me is extinguished . " These people had great belief in the power of their magicians to control the elements , produce rain or sunshine , as well as to cure diseases and bring success in all their undertakings . They had also , apparently , some vague ideas of a Devil somewhere , in a place where he could torment them ? and of a Paradise ; but their future destiny in either place did not seem to depend so much upon their manner of life as on their manner of death . Those who died a violent death would find themselves in a place inhabited by the Devil ; but those who died a natural death would eat of the fruits of Paradise , where sugar-cane and cocoa-nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // and named after the Marquess de Mendana , viceroy of Peru , under whose protection the expedition started . Nikerlieva is the principal island of the group ; and the inhabitants of the Typee ( Taipi ) valley are the most noteworthy . It is recorded that cannibalism was prevalent in all these islands , the menu consisting of slain enemies only ; and as Typee signifies eaters of human flesh , it is possible that this particular tribe were specially addicted to this gruesome form of repast : they have undoubtedly been credited with murdering and eating all the crew of a vessel which visited those waters . They are a brown , coffee-coloured race with straight hair , but as in Tahiti , the natives yearned after fairness of skin . The juice of the popa root was much resorted to as a cosmetic for this purpose , and in addition to acquiring what nature had denied , they screened themselves , when possible , from the direct sun rays . Five or six times a day they bathed , drying their luxurious hair after each time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfuming it with a powerfully scented oil made from the cocoa-nut . The distinctive characteristics of these islands is the European caste of features ; and all voyagers call attention to the symmetrical and physical beauty of the Typees ; their dress was merely a minimum covering , easily put on , easier removed . Russell , in his Polynesia , tells us how they excelled // in tatooing , though very young girls had few of these ornamentations ; but as they grew older they had their right hand and left foot most elaborately tatooed ; this was also an indication that they were married . Among men who had reached very mature age this tatooing had been so frequent , that according to Herman Melville they occasionally presented the most repulsive appearance , their skin covered by deep indentations and fissures . By long practice of this custom their bodies sometimes became a dull green hue ; in addition their heads were quite bald , while their feet were unlike any ordinary feet , their toes standing out in every direction . The reason of this does not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their constant use as fingers . The principal food of the Typees was one of the many preparations from the bread-fruit tree . This fruit is the size of a citron melon , and after the rind has been removed resembles white pulp ; the leaves are of enormous size , scalloped at the edge . When nearing the stage of decay their colour becomes of a many-hued richness , and the natives wore them as strikingly picturesque head-dresses . The Typee maidens delighted in flowers , and not being less vain than most maidens , they wore dainty single hybiscus in their ears , and necklaces , coronets , bracelets , etc. , of intertwined leaves and blossoms . They were magnificent swimmers ? even infants of a few days old were taught to swim ? so had no use for canoes , which were taboo for women and would have meant instant death . A favourite drink in the South Sea Islands was called arva , made from a root , in much the same fashion as Lava was made in Tonga : its primary effect was stimulating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Typee valley it was usually drunk at their convivial // gatherings as an ordinary stimulant . Their music must have suggested something weird , for besides drums they had nasal flutes , which were blown through the left nostril , the other being closed by a muscular contraction . In regard to their marriages , a man might have but one wife , while a girl was allowed at least two husbands ? probably because the males far outnumbered the females ? yet any form of marriage was usually dispensed with . The girls were wooed at a very early age , and when , as frequently occurred , they tired of one another , a third party in the shape of a man swooped down and carried them off to his hut ; it would seem this menage a trois worked very harmoniously . We hear of a curious observance which was practised every night . The inmates of a house , as they sat on their mats , would commence a low dismal chant ? not song ? with music made by two small sticks tapped slowly together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . Whether it was a religious rite or merely to induce sleep is not known . The religious rites of fanaticism and horror were held in the Hoolah Hoolah ground in the taboo groves of the valley . At each end of this spot was a high terraced altar , guarded by a multitude of frightful idols . Gigantic trees stood in the centre , their huge and gradually spreading trunks railed in with sugar canes , from which the priests declaimed their pagan teachings . The fear of taboo guarded the secrets of their sacrificial rites : should any female enter or even touch with her feet this sacred ground , she was immediately killed . Apart from the rites held in the Hoolah Hoolah ground , the Typees held funeral orgies from which all sense of decency was omitted : dancing , singing and feasting lasting for two days after the burial . They had mastered 2o6 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies either the art of embalming or " fuming " ; the bodies were hung up on the side of the house close by the skulls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century , the number of these classic people are dwindling to extinction ; the debased remnant have lost all affinity with the unique environment of the beautiful valley of Typee . THE NETHERLANDS THE Dutch were described in 176o as being tall and strongly built , but in his Geographical and Historical Grammar , Mr. Salmon says , " both Men and Women have the grossest Shapes that are to be met with any-where , or rather no Shape at all . Nor is their Motion less disagreeable than their Shape ; they move heavily and awkwardly . " He is kinder to their features and complexions , and allows the Boors or Husbandmen are industrious , " but slow of understanding ; not to be dealt with by hasty Words , but easily manag 'd by soft and fair , and yielding to plain Reason if you give them Time to understand it . " The seamen were , apparently , a mannerless crew " which is usually mistaken for Pride . " Sir William Temple accounts for their surliness " from their con-versing with Winds and Waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The dress of these people , with the exception of the officers of the Army , seems to lack entirely in elegance : " Their Coats have neither Shape nor Pleats , and their long Pockets are set as high as thir Ribs ; but that of the Women appear something odd to us , their Coats coming no lower than the Middle of their Legs . " Their many taxes included a Land-tax , Poll-tax and Hearth-tax . The amusements of the Hollanders were varied , but " they seldom play for any Thing but Drink , and the Tavern where they spend their Winnings always concludes the Diversions of the Day . Hans never cares to go Bed without his Dose . " They seem to have ro8 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies been a stolid people ; quarrels were rare , revenge still rarer , while the sensation of jealousy was almost unknown : " Their Tempers are not airy enough for Joy , nor any unusual Strains of pleasant Humour , nor warm enough for Love .. . . The Men are addicted to Drinking , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health as well as the Improvement of their Understandings . " The inhabitants of Holland may be divided into the following classes : The Peasants or Boors , who cultivated the land ; the Marriners or Schippers , who supplied their ships with produce ; the Merchants or Traders , who filled their towns for the purpose of Barter ; the Renteeners , or Men who lived in the principal cities upon their Rents , or Interests of Estates previously acquired by their families ; Lastly , the Gentlemen and Officers of their Princes . As an example of their hospitality , the following was written by an English gentleman ( 1691 ) , attending the Court of the King of Great Britain after a voyage to I-Tolland : " When you are entered in the house , the first thing you encounter is a Looking-Glass ; no question but a true Embleme of Politick Hospitality ; for though it reflect your selfe in your own Figure , ' t is yet no longer than while you are there before it . When you are gone once , it Flatters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there . " A custom regarding the period of childbirth , suggests both thoughtfulness and philosophy and is thus described : " When the Woman lies in , the Ringle of the door does penance , and is lapped about with Linen , either to show you that loud knocking may wake the Child , or else that for a month the Ring is not to be run at . But if the Child be dead , there is thrust out a Nosegay tied to a stick 's end ; perhaps for an Emblem of the // Life of Man , which may wither as soon as born ; or else to let you know that though these fade upon their gathering , yet from the same stock the next year a new shoot may spring . " A French voyager in the Pays-bas Unis ( 1815 ) , tells us that the Dutch believed in a numerous progeny which indeed outnumbered any other country in Europe . The customs in regard to their period of engagement differed in every town and village . Among the bourgeois classes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocras or wine , in which cinnamon , bark , and sugar were infused in bottles ornamented with true lovers ' knots in ribbon , symbolizing " fiancee 's tears . " Women multiplied plentifully , as we have heard . Immediately their first child was born , the father announced the tidings to all friends and relations . In Harlem and Enkhuisen there was attached to all the doors where a woman was lying-in , a small board covered with rose-coloured silk , above which was a piece of lace folded in the shape of a fan . This board was never removed until the mother was able to rise from her bed ; during the time it was there no creditors nor officers of justice were allowed to disturb the husband , be the pretext what it might . A curious sight might sometimes be seen in the streets : children dressed half in black and half in white , with chamois leather gloves up to their elbows . These were orphans , and their bizarre appearance was to call attention to their existence , and to move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of lugubrious faced men in sombre black clothes with a white cravat , a long trailing crepe hat band , an umbrella under the arm , a cigar in the mouth , with pencil and mourning cards , who ringing at the door-bell would bear the invitations of the obsequies of those who were no more . izo Ancient Rites and Ceremonies The houses were built of light material , with a central room to which no sunlight ever penetrated , but was protected from the cold by being surrounded by other rooms : this was the family 's sitting apartment . The staircase had the steepness of ladders or of ships ' gangways . On entering a working man 's house a few articles of furniture were seen scattered about the receiving room , but where were the beds ? ? behind a cupboard or door , let into the wall , one above the other . The mention of Holland was associated with the Kermesses or Fair . Teniers has popularized them in his pictures but not idealized them . These outbursts remained for long the passion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human heart of primitive humanity . They took place both in towns as well as in country districts . Men who at one moment were respectable citizens suddenly became frolicsome and irresponsible . A crowd might be looking at some illumination , when suddenly the old cry , " Hos , Hos , " would be started . This refrain acted like magic ; a sort of frenzy ensued , the people joining arms , commencing to jump , stamping their sabots , and jostling their neighbours . Everyone indeed was in a state of delirium , and not a few were given up to complete sottishness . These Kermesses were not the Hollanders ' only form of delirium ; for travellers in the 16th century wondered more than a little at the wild excitement in which the whole of the population behaved during the skating season , when the inland waters became solid enough to support them . They had other channels in which they displayed an unconscious sense of humour . If a man kissed a girl without her sanction , she complained to the Burgomaster . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here it was passed on to The Netherlands iii the Court of Appeal at Amsterdam , who were indulgent enough to exonerate the criminal ? because a kiss was a justifiable expression of admiration , and moreover such a motive was not criminal . At Gouda is to be found the long " church-warden " pipe , which the bridegroom smoked on the eve of his marriage ; and to show his capability in smoking and handling the pipe he laid it back without breaking the old clay stem . This pipe was the emblem of the husband 's dignity ; it also indicated that in the house he was lord and master . Smoking was a national trait ; frequently a child of eight might be met , walking between his parents and smoking a cigar . In this land were water and fire vendors ; and in the early hours servants were sent out to buy a quantity of boiling water for breakfast , or some hot embers for lighting a fire . Among their superstitions Monday was considered an unlucky day to commence a journey . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the over scrupulous neatness and cleanliness of the people of Broth ; the paving of the main street was of fine polished stones and bricks of various colours , resembling a mosaic , and kept spotlessly clean and polished . The houses were like dolls ' houses , looking as if they had just come from the toy makers ; each painted in various bright colours with pavements of various coloured stones , resembling the contours of flowers and streets , and everything , everywhere , carefully washed and polished every day . But to keep their houses so spotless , at the threshold of the house , the visitor was expected to exchange his boots for a pair of slippers . Cows were regularly stabled , curried and rubbed down ; the tails of the cows were all turned up and II2 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies secured to the rafters of the roof . But the strangest custom of all , thought this traveller , was that they never opened the principal apartment of their house except at the baptism , the marriage , or the death of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hermetically closed and kept sacred . At Amsterdam , criminals whose offences were not capital were placed in the Rasphuis , their employment consisted of sawing wood . If they were indolent or refractory they were shut up in a cellar into which water was allowed to run ; so unless they worked at a pump which was fixed there , they must be drowned . The Spinhuis was another singular establishment . In this building one part was devoted to women whose offences were not of an aggravated character , and another separate part for serious offences . Young ladies of even high families were sometimes sent to the former place , on account of undutiful behaviour or domestic offences . They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress and work a certain number of hours a day . Husbands who had to complain of the extravagance of their wives could send them to the Spinhuis to acquire more sober " habits " ; on the other hand , a wife who brought a complaint against her husband might have him accommodated with lodgings in this charitable Institution . NORTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably an overflow of Asiatics by way of the Behring Straits . When Europeans first became acquainted with these Indians , they had spread , fan-like , and occupied an area extending about 1500 miles north and south , and 2000 miles across the North American Continent . They were located on both sides of the Rocky Mountains . The most Northerly groups were the Blood Indians , Crees , while the Camanchees and Norahoes were on the borders of Mexico . The renowned Sioux Indians occupied the central area . In appearance they were all fundamentally alike , usually of a dark copper colour , with very long black hair , especially the men . When first known , they numbered about sixteen millions , but in- 1833 they were reduced to less than two millions . To use their own figure of speech , " We are travelling to the Shades of our fathers , towards the setting Sun . " All these people erected tents of hide , called Tipis ; all dressed in the skins of animals , and all vied with one another in the gaudiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds ' feathers , especially those of the eagle . The custom of scalping was universal ; when a man was killed in combat , or trapped in their perpetual raids , the victor would rut about four inches off the skin of his enemy 's head , with the hair attached ? a deed of which the victor was mightily proud . " The scalp having proclaimed him to be a warrior , it was then dried , and finally secured to the end of a spear , or to a war club ; 8 // it might even be stitched to his clothing as an ornament , and became ever after an honoured trophy , and an evidence of distinction . It was also honoured by a public orgy and dance , after which it was returned to its owner . Another universal object of pride among the Indians was their pipe ; not only was it an emblem of dignity but of utility , being from 4 to 5 feet long , and decorated in various colours ; the bowl part was made out of a special red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarry . This quarry seems to have been a sort of Mecca , to which every man from every part , was expected to journey once in his life , both for the sake of the pipe-bowl , and to satisfy the needs of his soul . It was , moreover , a universal Sanctuary , for according to an injunction from the Great Spirit at this quarry , there should be no blood shed : enemies would meet as friends . All North American Indians were daring hunters and expert riders : some cultivated the soil but sparsely , trusting entirely to the products of Providence . It was this trust in the spirit of Nature which made them believe that it existed in various secret articles and forms , which , in the manner of a mascot , helped them in their undertakings ; it made them collect all kinds of odds and ends , to make what they called " good medicine . " This included a specific antidote against someone else 's " good medicine . " One kind of " good medicine " ensured a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or success in any enterprise . This word , " good medicine , " had a very wide meaning . All the Indian tribes hated and dreaded the white man , because their " good medicine " was superior to their own ; in other words , he had more knowledge , more enterprise , and was better equipped against misfortune . Indian chiefs as well as others had collected all kinds V // of articles which they called " good medicine , " but if a medicine man , soothsayer , or diviner professed to cure and failed , his medicine became " bad medicine , " and he was immediately killed . A man 's particular power of healing , or his talisman , was revealed to him through a dream , and apparently took the form of some creature . As soon as he reached man 's estate , he retired to the woods , fasted , meditated , and prayed to the Great Spirit that a vision of his totem animal should be revealed to him . After this vision appeared , he made every effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this mascot was hung on his body for the remainder of his life ; it was even buried with him , and accompanied him to his happy hunting grounds . If it should happen that he lost it , or was deprived of it by an enemy , he could only acquire " good medicine " and regain his former prestige by slaying another man , and looting his " good medicine . " Whatever its imaginary properties may have been , it was something that stimulated his bravery , and for which he fought as he would for his own life . The Blackfeet were the most numerous and powerful of the tribes ; they were acknowledged to number fifty thousand . Of middle stature , very muscular , and deep chested , they spent a great part of their time hunting for enemies among their neighbours . In every tribe their wigwams were so set up as to be removed at a moment 's notice : the mode of transport was by trailing large poles tied to horses , on which were platforms ; dogs were also used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their size . The women of all tribes parted their hair in the middle , and painted the line of separation with vermilion . The men of the Blackfeet had two partings on the top of the head , leaving a middle lock of hair about two inches wide ; this " fringe " they allowed to hang as far rib Ancient Rites and Ceremonies as the bridge of the nose , when it was cut square . The skins they wore were dressed and usually dyed black , as also their footwear ? hence the name " Blackfeet . " The Crow Indians were very near neighbours of the Blackfeet , but their language was totally different ; their hunting ground was at the head waters of the Missouri , and on the north-west of the Continent of the Indian groups ; they occupied their spare time in hunting for their neighbours ' scalps , as well as losing a great number of their own ; consequently they became a rapidly diminishing people . All the skins with which they built and decorated their wigwams were ornamented with designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were decorated with scalps and skulls . The Crows were reputed to be a more honourable race than most of the other tribes . Their hair grew excessively long , sometimes dragging on the grass ; but not contented with that , they even promoted its growth by the constant use of bears ' grease : " Long-hair , " a chief of the tribe , had hair which measured To ft. 7 ins. long ; women cut their hair short . As a sign of mourning , it was customary for the men to cut off a lock or two , and for the women to cut theirs close to the scalp . They appear to have been phlegmatic to the highest degree . Catlin relates how a chief , having been embellished and adorned with European clothes , by some person of distinction , returned to his tribe after a year 's absence . For fully half an hour he stood before his wife and children , simply and purely that they might admire his elegant appearance ; during that time there was no symptom of recognition , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each seemed to unbend , yet with no expression or emotion , until he at length seated himself among his wife and family , as though continuing a conversation of a year ago . // Except when boasting of any successful enterprise , they practised this art of reserve on all occasions , probably to conceal some weakness ; or , as some writers assert , to disguise an intense shyness or self-consciousness . This , however , only applied to tribal ethics , and included neither hunting , scalping , dancing , nor selfadornment , nor when they were acting in the role of an arbitrary chief . The 1llandans were a tribe in the Upper Missouri district , close to the boundary between America and Canada . They believed themselves to be the first people created on earth . Owing to the constant hunting for their neighbours ' scalps , their numbers had diminished to a very considerable degree . They lived in lodges , in other words , in villages ; a number of lodges constituted a village , which was secured and fortified against any invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet below the level of the ground , the materials being timber ; the lodge had walls and beams , and the roof and sides were covered with willow boughs ; the whole was plastered over with mud and clay . The slope of the roof was sufficiently flat on the outside , either to provide a resting place or a " look out . " The lodges were made to hold about thirty people ; couches being arranged round the sides above the floor , while buffalo skins stretched over four posts formed the mattress . Along the side of each bed was a post studded with pegs , where the owner hung all his precious belongings , and his " medicine " when he was asleep . In the centre of the village was an open space , in which all sports and games and other functions were held ; and facing this space the " medicine " belonging to the tribe was kept in a barrel-shaped receptacle . Elsewhere , in the village , were long poles zr8 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies on which were scalps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just behind the village was the burial place , called the village of the dead ; here , on a scaffolding , the bodies were placed , out of reach of wolves and dogs , and left to decay . The deceased was , however , prepared for burial , dressed in his best array ; and placed beside him , painted and oiled , was the dead man ' pipe and tobacco , his bows and arrows , and a few days ' provisions . His body was finally wrapped in fresh buffalo 's hide , and tightly bound from head to foot until he resembled a mummy ; he was then laid with his feet towards the East ? the rising Sun . For a long time after burial , the near relations of the departed man sat under this simple scaffolding , perhaps cutting and mutilating themselves to appease the spirits of the dead , for any acts of omission committed while he was on earth . When skeletons had fallen from the scaffolding , the skulls were preserved , and a ring of these would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre . In the middle of this ring was a small mound with a pole from which " medicine " hung , to protect and guard this sanctuary . Here , perhaps , long years afterwards , someone would pick up a piece of a skull , fondle it , and recount memories of a past when they were together in life . Here a mother would sit and work for hours , recounting to herself the story of its birth , the tales of its life , and recalling the anguish of its death . Catlin is of the opinion , that this group of people were the offspring of the aborigines of America , prior to the arrival of the North American Indians , for it is stated that there were many whose skins were almost white , one in ten of both sexes , and of every age , and who , from their infancy , had light silver grey hair , sometimes indeed almost white . // Mixed bathing was not permitted among the Mandans ; when women and girls bathed , armed sentries were stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thoroughly anointed themselves with bears ' grease , massaging it well into their skin . The Indians felt it a great source of amusement , that Europeans were so stupid , as not to understand why they greased their bodies , slept with their feet towards the fire , or why they walked with their toes turned in . Among all the Northern Indians , the chief of his tribe always wore an heraldic head-dress surmounted with buffalo horns ; not only was it an emblem of rank , but also of authority , gained either by some deed of daring influence , or power . These horns were so ingeniously secured to the headpiece as to give a certain dramatic effect , and to emphasize any point of oratory expressed by the additional action of the head . This custom seems to have originated through imitating the buffalo 's toss of his head with its powerful horns , and to suggest by his magnificent strength ? the emblem of Force . Catlin relates that when he had painted the portrait of a man , he was accused of weakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme likeness , a chief was alive in two places . This could only be possible if his existence in both places was halved . But if it was possible to remove half of a man , then the artist must have power to remove all he would , even the whole of a man ; therefore an artist was dangerous " medicine . " Later , however , after a dog had been sacrificed to square the matter , everyone , especially the women , when dressed in their best , were anxious to see themselves reproduced on canvas . Another universal custom of the North American Indians was for the host to wait on his guest ; the visitor 's pipe was filled and lighted for him , and after the // first draw , the host took a whiff from the same pipe ; then , and only then , did conversation commence . A chief enjoyed a plurality of wives , and on the occasion of a husband entertaining any company , the women sat round and looked on . Polygamy was regarded both as an evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was through the woman 's labour of preparing skins for sale or barter , that a man acquired riches . Thus by acquiring wealth he was able to speculate in wives ; for , owing to the losses incurred in the sport of scalp hunting , there were nearly three times as many women as men , consequently , polygamy fitted very well into the situation . In nearly all cases women were bought from their fathers , their price being from one or two horses , a couple of gallons of whisky , several pounds of beads . The Mandan girls married about the age of twelve or earlier ; whatever beauty they may have possessed very quickly vanished , owing to the heavy toil to which they were subjected ; amongst other duties , they fetched wood and water , cooked , dressed ( chewed ) all manner of skins , prepared meat , and dug the ground for the growing of corn . The Indians had no stated time for their meals : there was always a pot stewing , and if any man , woman or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this system was reciprocated , and each contributed to the contents of the pot , all went well ; but there were confirmed loafers and wasters , who never subscribed anything , and who helped no one . These people often ate in a reclining position . Women sat on their heels ; men sat cross-legged , and helped themselves first ; the remainder was given to the women , who consumed far more than the men . All meat was cut in long slices , and had been cured in the sun ; in this state it was called peynican. // The Mandans ' dance suggested more a form of posing than dancing , almost corresponding to our Swedish drill , accompanied by yells and whoops , which gave it the aspect of suddenly becoming threatening . No doubt , at an early epoch , each step or posture suggested some meaning , probably connected with the chase , or stealth in head hunting ; but , possibly owing to the constant repetition , it became latterly , to the accompaniment of drums and a monotonous chant ? merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The buffalo dance was a form of ritual to try and induce the herds of buffaloes to approach nearer , at the time when that kind of food was scarce . A number of the tribe , adorned with buffalo-horn headpieces , skipped up and down and yelled ; others began beating drums ; finally the beasts advanced near enough to be slaughtered . Since the dance was for the definite purpose of coaxing the trusting animals it was bound to continue till they approached ; so it was always a success , although it might involve several weeks of dancing ; in fact , they danced for a purpose until they achieved it . " Medicine " men went through a certain performance to produce rain . They burnt sweet-smelling herbs , projected an arrow into the air , or stood on the top of a wigwam gesticulating for hours ; they eventually succeeded , because they continued the farce , perhaps for several days , until it did rain . Mandans had a great belief in self-sacrifice ; they would give up their most precious property to hang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an annual orgy of blood and fearful lacerations which served as a test of endurance among the budding youth ; as a picture of fright122 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies fulness was a test of fortitude at the sight of mangled men . Young men , emaciated with fasting , were , for the sake of fanaticism , skewered through the back or on the chest , and through their other limbs ; they were then swung round and round , while others added their weight by clinging to their bodies . Except as a final test of stoicism , their self-inflicted savagery had no meaning . This festival took place yearly , and many bore scars showing that they had gone through the ordeal on several occasions . In spite of the severe tortures they bore on these religious ceremonies , the maimed would offer a sacrifice to the Great Spirit , with a devout prayer for more fortitude than they had already shown , for any future occasion of endurance ; they stoically submitted to the amputation of the little finger of the left hand ; sometimes they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon every occasion of feasts and festivals , the pipe was lighted ; before , however , it was smoked , the mouthpiece was turned upwards towards the Great Spirit , and was then pointed to the four cardinal points of the compass in succession ? North , South , East and West ? somewhat resembling the act of making the sign of the cross ; co-related to this , the number four was regarded as a mystic number . It is deeply to be regretted that these interesting people were , in 1838 , decimated by smallpox ; the handful left , but twenty , deliberately , for the purpose of suicide , braved thousands of Sioux Indians ; they all faced certain death , probably in the same stoical manner as when they tortured their flesh on the occasion of their annual festival . Thus they became extinct . The Sioux ( pronounced as a French word ) were a numerous , tall , virile , and warlike tribe ; their name for themselves was Dahkotas . Inhabiting a vast tract of // land , they were essentially nomadic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies , followed that of the animal and vegetable world . When , owing to food-shortage , their migrations became urgent , the old and feeble were left by the way . The able-bodied went through the ceremony of " Exposing " ? in other words , they took a final leave of them . These derelicts and feeble ones would be placed under the shelter of a stretched buffalo skin , with a small fire and some firewood . Stoically , an aged man would say , " I am too old and too feeble to march ; I am an encumbrance and burden , and wish to die . " These episodes , common to all Indian tribes , were what , under similar conditions , constitutes what would be termed an epic poem among civilized people : such , for instance , as the act of Captain Oates , in Captain Scott 's expedition to the South Pole , where he alluded to him as " a gallant gentleman . " A horse , deer skins , or buffalo robes were the usual objects of barter ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were used for war belts , became not only an article of barter , but a coinage , measured either in hand breadths , or fathoms ( the length from the tips of the fingers of each hand , with the arm extended ) . After an imitation of this Wampum , made in Europe , was introduced to the Indians , its circulation as coinage ceased . The value of a woman , as has been seen , was about two horses , with perhaps a few extras thrown in ; but after the death of one , Catlin relates how a father offered him ten horses for a painted picture of her . The same artist and author said , that the men could not understand why he should confer such an honour on a woman as to make a picture of her , and that under no circumstances should the portraits of men be exhibited with those of women . This attitude seems curious , when it may be noted that // the death-rate among the tribes was very great , while the birth-rate was diminishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe . The Alguoguins made a distinction between the wife whom they called " The entrance of the hut , " and those whom they termed " The middle of the but ; " these last were servants and of inferior rank . Dogs were the Indians ' best companions ; they hunted together , they shared the produce of the chase ; the dog was his watcher and sentinel , and the image of the dog , as they painted him on their deer-skins and robes , was the emblem of fidelity . In paying the highest honour to a visitor , he would sacrifice what he cherished most ; and the food on this occasion would be his dog ; in fact , the dog feast would be the scene of the most solemn ceremony , in sealing a pledge , or in appeasing evil spirits . Their smoking mixture was called K'nick K'nick . Orpheus and his lute had passed the fable stage , among these Indians : they made a flute , much resembling our tin flute , on which three or four musical notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The instrument was called the Winnebago courting flute ; a youth sat on a rock or a log , and repeated the order of certain notes persistently , calling the attention of his sweetheart to his presence , until it pleased her to come to him . Dancing , if that was the name of the form of violent exercise by which they amused themselves , was frequently enjoyed ; the accompaniment was the usual primitive drum , and voices , for encouragement . The steps consisted of jumps , as well as contortions of the body and face , with yelps and screams . These primitive dances partook of the idea which they desired to represent , much of the meaning of these caperings being // symbolical . Only men were performers ; women derived the enjoyment of being worked up to an enthusiasm for laughter by looking on . There would be a " Bear dance , " in which the spirit of the bears was appealed to ; also the " Scalp dance , " the name of which speaks for itself . The Northern Indians differed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low foreheads , high cheek bones , full cheeks , Roman noses , and , usually , broad chins . The men seldom grew any beard until they reached middle age ; even then it was of scanty appearance , but remarkably strong and bristly . As it was considered unsightly , and not conducive to their good looks , many pulled it out between the finger and the blunt edge of a knife . The Indians in Hudson 's Bay suffered such acute pangs of hunger that they were frequently reduced to cannibalism . Mr. Hearne thus describes several of these unfortunate wretches : " A smile never graced their countenances ... while the eye most expressively spoke the dictates of the heart , and seemed to say Why do you despise me for my misfortunes ? The period is probably not far distant when you may be driven to the like necessity . ' " The Copper Indians were evidently in complete ignorance as to the appearance of an Englishman until they beheld Mr. Hearne . On the whole they agreed that he was a perfect human being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former , they said , reminded them of the stained hair of a buffalo 's tail ; the latter being light resembled those of a gull . They also spoke slightingly of the colour of his skin , declaring that it was like meat which had been rendered sodden by being put into water , until all the blood had been extracted . Taking him all round , he was regarded as such a curiosity , that ! 2b Ancient Rites and Ceremonies whenever he combed his hair he was begged for the combings , which were carefully wrapped up , at the same time saying , " When I see you again , you shall again see your hair . " The morals of the North Americans were somewhat shady : it was quite an ordinary occurrence for the men to exchange a night 's lodging with one of their friend 's wives . And , far from it being regarded as an insult , it cemented friendships between families ; and if one man died , the other was most scrupulous in looking after the children of the deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copper Indians and the Esquimaux . We read of how , on one occasion , the Esquimaux were brutally massacred by the Indians , when peacefully sleeping , who , before they committed this cowardly onslaught painted their shields or targets to the very edge , with different images ; the sun , moon , birds and beasts of prey ; hieroglyphics and imaginary figures , believed to be the inhabitants of the earth , sea , air , etc . Each one painted what he considered would be most likely to secure him success in his undertaking . After the murder of the Esquimaux , the Indians who had touched the slain , went through a strange method of purificat ion : they were forbidden from cooking any food either Inc themselves or others . Those who were under the ban when food had been prepared , painted their faces between the nose and chin , and most of their cheeks with a sort of red earth , before they would taste a morsel ; they also refused to eat of any dish but their own , or smoke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of having no confirmation , that on still nights he actually heard the Northern Lights make a rustling and crackling noise , like a large flag flapping in the wind . The Northern Indians never North American Indians t2 buried their dead , so by many it was believed that they fell a prey to birds or animals ; for this reason they never ate foxes , ravens , etc. , unless from necessity . After the death of a near relative , they wept repeatedly for a year , the time being measured by moons and seasons ; even during eating and conversation they made a sort of howling noise ; they also cut their hair and rent their clothing . Of religion , they had practically none , nor any idea of a future existence ; they had their superstitions and their diviners ; probably , also , their totem animals , for they would sometimes upraid their children for speaking disrespectfully of some beast or bird . In the late autumn men usually painted the mouth and part of the cheek before each meal ; during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor eat certain parts of the deer . But when winter set in , a man unseen by any woman , lit a fire some way from the tents , into which were thrown all their orna-ments , pipe-stems and dishes . After which a grand banquet was prepared , at which they ate all that had previously been forbidden . They might also embrace their wives and children " at discretion , " which limita-tion had , from what we understand , a wide margin . Among these Northern Indians , as well as the Copper and Dog-ribbed Indians , they had three or four parallel black strokes on each cheek , made by running a needle or awl under the skin , and upon drawing it out imme-diately rubbing in powdered charcoal . Their dispositions were far from attractive , for they were morose , covetous , and hypocritical , yet the mildest tribe of Indians . As a rule , the men were extremely jealous of their wives , who were usually mere children ; these unfor-tunate children , from the age of eight or nine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancient Rites and Ceremonies sex ; instead of which custom dictated that they should be watched and guarded , cooped up with old women , and occupied in scraping skins , mending shoes , and suchlike household duties . Divorces were fairly common ; the girls had first a good pummelling , then were turned adrift , and told to rejoin their paramours or relatives as the case might be . It is as well , perhaps , that these people , as in Greenland , were not prolific . No form of cradle was used for infants ; as with the Southern Indians , a lump of moss was tied between the legs of their offspring , who were thus carried on their mothers ' backs , next to their skin . When girls became of a marriageable age , they wore for some little time a kind of veil , or curtain made of beads , as a sign of modesty . Should two parties of these Indians meet , they came to a sudden halt about twenty or thirty yards apart , and either sat or lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be one amongst them , held forth as to all his misfortunes since last they met ; also recounting all the deaths and misfortunes of any other Indians of which he might have heard . Then the most elderly man on the other side began his tale of woe and tribulation . If these became too harrowing universal howls were then commenced , an art in which young girls were specially expert . After a short time , however , tobacco was handed round , and conversation drifted on to good news ; so that in less than half an hour smiles were on every face , and small gifts frequently exchanged . The amusements of these people were few ; they had an out-door game played with short clubs , sharpened at one end , called holl , which slightly resembles quoits . Sometimes , at night , they amused themselves with dancing , although they had no dances or songs of their own ; but they tried to imitate the Dog-ribbed dances ; // I i , were easy to learn , as they consisted only of lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as high as posiIdle , without moving the body ; the hands kept closed , .1 ml close to the breast , the head inclining forward . I his dance was always performed in a state of nudity except for the " breech-cloth , " which was also sometimes flung off . The vocal music accompaniment consisted only of a ( ) petition , such as " hee hee , ho ho , " etc. , which by 1aising and lowering the voice , and dwelling sometimes longer , sometimes shorter , on a word , produced the resemblance of a tune . The dancing was accompanied by a drum or tabor ; or sometimes by a rattle , made from dried buffalo skin , into which shot or pebbles had been placed and shaken about . The dancing of the women was still more monotonous , for they crowded outside the tent in a straight line , and shuffled from right to left , and back in the same line . When the music stopped , they bent slightly as though making an awkward sort of curtsey , pronouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When any of the important Northern Indians died , it was believed that it was through the evil machinations of either some of their own people , the Southerners , or particularly the Esquimaux . They did not bury their dead , which were devoured by the wild beasts and birds . Should the deceased be a near relation , they rent their clothing , and mourned for a year . They held a curious tradition that the first person who lived on earth was a woman , who in her searches after berries , which was her only food , met with an animal resembling a dog , which grew attached to her , and followed her to the cave where she lived . This dog possessed the peculiar faculty of transforming itself into a handsome young man at night , although always resum-9 // ing its old shape in the daytime ; so the woman looked upon the strange happenings as so many dreams and delusions . But matters arrived at a point which could not be ignored , as the mother of the world advanced in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man appeared , of such surprising height that his head touched the clouds , for the purpose of levelling the land , which he did by the help of his walking-stick . He marked out the rivers , lakes , and ponds , and caused them to be filled up with water . Next , he took the dog and tore it in pieces ; its entrails he threw into the lakes and rivers , commanding them to become fish . The flesh he threw over the land , ordering it to become various kinds of beasts ; while the skin he tore into small pieces , throwing them into the air , and decreed that they might become all manner of birds . He finally gave the woman and her offspring power to kill , eat , and never spare , for he had commanded that she should be supplied abundantly with all she desired . After this , he returned to the place from whence he came , and has never been heard of since . 01d age was the greatest catastrophe which could befall the Northern Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrespect , served last at meals , given the worst and poorest of the food ; while the coarsest of their skins served for their old parents ; they might even die of starvation and neglect . These people believed in different kinds of fairies called Nant-e-na , who they imagined inhabited the various elements of earth , sea , and air , and whom they frequently declared they saw . The Aurora Borealis they called Ed-thin , that is Deer . For experience had shown them that when a hairy deerskin was briskly stroked with the hand on a dark night , // it gave out sparks of electrical fire . And when the meteor was very bright in the planet , they said there were many deer in that part of the atmosphere , although , as Hearne shrewdly observes ? they had nat yet extended their beliefs to such a point as to indulge in any hopes of tasting this celestial animal . THE NORTHERN REGIONS AND GREENLAND THE famous explorer , Captain Ross , in his expedition of discovering a North West passage into the Pacific Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through the aid of a Greenlander on board , was able to converse with them , and learn something of their beliefs and customs . They are described as being of a dirty copper colour , about five feet in height , fat , and squarely built ; their dress consisted of seal , deer , and bear skins . Although only eighteen of these people were seen , they pointed to the north , and said there were " plenty of people " there . The amazement of these Esquimaux , when they first beheld Europeans and a ship , can well be imagined , for they had always believed that they were the only human beings in the world , the rest being ice . It was also a matter of astonishment to them , that there were no women on board the ships of Captain Ross . There was much for them yet to learn , even their power of counting ( lid not extend beyond ten . In their primitive state , we hear dark stories of cannibalism , infanticide , and other crimes ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cranty tells us that in 1740 a Dutch brig was captured , and the whole crew massacred . These people seem to have had an inner conception of a Supreme Being , but it was vague and undefinable . Their houses were six feet in height , built half underground of stone , and " mudded " to prevent the damp from getting in ; on the floor , skins were thrown . Several // families lived in one house , each keeping a lamp burning , never allowed to go out , and which served for purposes of cooking as well as for heating . Their staple food was the liver and blubber of the walrus and seal ; but as winter darkness approached , and the ice froze , as a last resource to prevent starvation , they ate their daily companions , their dogs : surely not a very remote step from their uncles and aunts , and even nearer relatives . The regulated ceremonies of mourning for the dead , was a curious one ; to use Dr. Kane 's words : " they weep according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join . It was the official right of the most distinguished among the company , to wipe the eyes of the chief mourner . There were frequent weeping gatherings ; at other times , someone would be suddenly convulsed by sobs , the others following politely , although perhaps quite ignorant of the particular source of grief . It was not indeed necessary that death only should produce such abandonment of sorrow ; the failure of a hunt , the snapping of a walrus-line , etc. , would have the same result . But occasionally there entered a totally different reason for mourning : for the ancient Esquimaux believed that death was sometimes caused by supernatural agencies , and that some form of conciliation was necessary to pacify these offended powers . The Angekok , or medicine man who claimed supernatural attributes , regulated the period and penances of grief : the stricken husband might be forbidden to take part in the walrus hunt for a whole year , or to abstain from one of their meagre luxuries . Among their many avocations , the Angekok professed to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fasts and meditations , became the medium of 7 communication with the spirits . By working themselves into an hysterically inspired condition , they claimed to hold communion with those not of this earth ; to pro- , phesy according to their visions . As well as the Angekok , there were the Issiutoks , but these worked evil spells and incantations ; they were treated in the same brutal manner as the witches of old . Having been harpooned and mutilated , small portions of their heart were eaten , to make sure that this man of the " evil eye " could not return to earth unrecognized . One of the curious customs of the Esquimaux who lived in Hudson 's Bay , was that the men had all the hair of their dead plucked out by the roots , to distinguish them from every other tribe . Their native dance consisted more in motions of the hands than of the feet ; the latter were kept close to-gether , occasional jumps being given , while with the arms , a continual swinging motion was maintained . Their small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sheepish look . Their teeth were very bad and worn down to the gums , especially in the women ; this was due to their chewing the skins , which constituted their dresses , and to make them pliable for wear . At Peteravik the dead were sewn up in skins with their limbs outstretched . Should the deceased be a woman , her husband carried her , unattended , to her last resting-place , where he piled up stones over her one by one , to form a cairn . In the meantime the blubber lamp was kept burning ; then the mourners assembled beside the cairn to lament and howl , while the widower recounted the virtues of his wife , and his own devastating sorrow . Esquimaux were usually buried with their knees drawn close to their body ; desolation is the word // which best describes that last scene . As Dr. Kane observes ? there was no Mother Earth to receive the dead ; so their companions encased their bodies in sacks of skins , grouped their implements around them ; over all were placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that the Esquimaux never disturbed a grave . Greenland was discovered by a Norwegian called Torwald in 982 , when driven out of Iceland . The sight of the green vegetation , during the season of spring appearing along the coast , suggested to the discoverer the name of Green land . It was revisited about seven or eight centuries ago . Some authorities suggest that these people originated from Tartary . In 1742 , a trading station was established by the Danes in Frederic Shaab . The first known community of these natives assembled at a place called God 's Shaab in 1721 . In 1730 , the native population was estimated to be about 30,000 , divided into a dozen communities . There is an eight months ' winter in that land , the autumn winds being so violent that houses are blown down , while tents , and even small boats are lifted up and carried a long distance . Indeed , Greenlanders assert that these cyclones have raised stones of 2 lbs . weight from the ground , and when it was necessary for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and knees . Similar cyclones occur in summer , the season of no night . At this period of the year the natives hunt and fish throughout the hours which we call night . On the other hand , from a certain latitude towards the north , there is for months no daylight visible ; but the light of both the moon and stars is much more brilliant than in more temperate zones , where the atmosphere is less rarefied . In these ice-covered lands , the Aurora Borealis , // wondrous mirages , and subjects of dreamland are all represented upside down . Asbestos is found in this country ; the natives use this mineral for lamp-wicks ; also as a funeral envelope , within which they bury their dead . A particular kind of moss grows which the people use for a bread . Accord-ing to Cranty it is anything but palatable , but leaves a pleasant flavour in the mouth . As Nature had provided the Greenlanders with no other means of subsistence , they were forced to be both hunters and fishermen ; and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection against wild beasts , more especially the Polar bear , they live in communities . ' This land of storms and electric pictures could not fail in having diviners , ranging from medicine men to soothsayers ; these sorcerers impressed on the fishermen that to successfully combat a whale , it was necessary to wear their best and cleanest apparel ; for , said they , if anyone wore soiled clothing , or had touched any dead object , the whale would most assuredly escape or , when wounded , sink to the bottom of the sea . Thus , from canoes , men and women attacked the whale with harpoons , to which were attached inflated seal-skins , used as buoys , in such a manner as to prevent the whale from diving . In appearance , Greenlanders much resemble the Esquimaux ; in addition we are told their faces are round and flat , with high cheek bones and very beady eyes ; their mouths are small , with a large under lip . They are , moreover , copper coloured , with a rich coating of dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected , considering they lived in a chronic atmo-sphere of grease and oil , and seldom or never washed ; although we hear that after a long fishing expedition the men dipped their fingers in fresh water , and wiped // the salt out of their eyes . Their eating habits , too , were excessively dirty ; their cooking utensils were licked clean by the dogs , while their knives scraped off remnants of food from their mouths , teeth , and fingers . Unlike most hunters , who then and there devoured the beast they had slain , these people merely drank some of the warm blood , and ate only a small piece of the flesh . After the day 's toil was ended , the unsuccessful hunters or fishermen partook equally with the more fortunate . All food was consumed that same day , no allowance being made for a possible disastrous tomorrow , nor for bad seasons . Under such a happy-golucky existence , it was not surprising that , sometimes , for days at a time , they were entirely without food . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their boots , or even on their tent skins , boiled in the oil which was usually burnt in their lamps . The women were specially sturdy ; this enabled them to carry the weighty burdens , so essential to the existence of the tribe . In regard to the dress of these people , when outside their tent , the neck and throat were left exposed to the weather ; but inside they stripped to the waist ; yet , whether clothed or semi-nude , the Danish missionaries had to make the most superhuman efforts to submit to the stench of a congregation of Greenlander humanity . There seems to have been an absence of all individuality among these people ; all were phlegmatic and tranquil , almost to the stage of melancholy or stupidity . Life was sufficient unto the day , yesterday was already forgotten , to-morrow had not yet arrived . In this state of self-complacency , they had a certain contempt for Europeans ; although they admitted that they were more industrious , intelligent , possessed a greater variety of property than themselves . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any of these things . In our times a similar comparison could be made between the life of a gipsy with that of a stock-broker with a fine mansion in a fashionable neighbourhood . The Greenlanders ' occupation was whaling , seal fishing , or bear and deer hunting , etc. ; and , given a sufficiency of this for their subsistence , of what use was anything more ? Why the loss of temper and uncalled for energy they observed among their visitors ? Excessive patience was a necessity to their success in hunting , and immobility of body in one particular position was the only camouflage possible in approaching their prey . On account of the rigour of the climate , and the sterility of the soil , they could never remain long idle ; during the protracted days they only hunted five or six hours ; in the never-ending nights for an hour at the utmost . But whether they worked or watched during the night , they slept most of the day . These people lived in tents during the summer , but in houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built below ground , but , for choice , on the summit of a hillock , or on a single rock , in order not to he entirely snowed up . So long as the temperature was below freezing , these houses were adequate enough , but summer rains occasionally washed away the cementing material , in which case they had to be rebuilt before the following autumn . These houses were so devised , that the inmates had to enter them on their hands and knees ; the walls were lined with hides , which had been previously used for canoes or tents . Each of these buildings held from three to six families , who slept in a sitting position , leaning against a bench on which cooking utensils were placed ; the men with their feet resting on the floor , the women sitting cross-legged . Windows made from the // intestines of fish , were let into the walls , which were sufficiently transparent to let in a moderate amount of light . A lamp fed with whale oil , served the same purposes as for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps , fish and meat stewing , combined with other insanitary arrangements , these houses would certainly have overpowered a European ; yet here , a community of natives lived not only in good health , but in absolute self-satisfied contentment . Nature was more generous to these people in their covering than in their food : for vests they used either deer skins , or the skins of water birds ( penguins ) , the down being worn inside ; stockings were manufactured from the skins of unborn seals . Over all , was a garment in the shape of a sailor 's jumper , usually low-necked with long sleeves and a hood , reaching to the knees . Fishermen 's clothing was made in one piece , and so water-tight that de la Harpe tells us it acted as a lifebuoy , in case their canoe should be swamped . Owing , no doubt , to the coldness of the climate , the relation between the sexes was apathetic rather than ardent . Conversation flagged between them ? in reality there was little to say . Their laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a maiden a pinch of tobacco , it would be regarded as a great insult . Youths seldom married before they were about twenty , and girls were about the same age . The marriage rites of the Greenlanders was the ancient one of marriage by capture . Consent having been obtained from the parents , the bride was fetched from her home by several women , under pretence of force . On arriving at her husband 's house , she betook herself into a corner , and with dishevelled hair , she covered her face with well studied abasement . In course of time , however , z. o Ancient Rites and Ceremonies she became less unapproachable , and the marriage was concluded . There was no dot to be settled in these nuptials ; indeed , the bridegroom 's only possessions were his skins , his knife , and his lamp . His qualifications were his skill as a good hunter or fisherman ; the bride on her part did the hundred and one things expected of a woman in these parts , except that occasionally she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take another wife . There was little difficulty in obtaining a divorce ; the man had merely to give his spouse a peevish look , pack up her clothes , and return her to her friends , where she would conduct herself with such exceeding modesty as would bring her husband into great illrepute . Cutting off the hair was a serious barrier to matrimony , the lack of hair being regarded as a great disgrace . Wives seldom bore more than three or four children , and any symptom of fecundity was regarded with disapproval , as showing a certain measure of wantonness . Names were more or less hereditary , but nicknames were acquired through any peculiarity . Should a man of a sincilar name die , it was customary for a man to assume another name , in any case until the memory of the deceased had considerably waned . Parents were never known to strike it child , and children were stated to be devoid of any form of viciousness ; moreover , in the communal manner in which these people lived , lying to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , both by heredity and by force of circumstance , strictly honest and truthful amongst each other . As soon as a boy was able to handle such things , he used a bow and arrows , and was never without a toy knife . When he was about ten years old , he was given a canoe ( Kajak ) in which he learnt to fish ; at his first success in Northern Regions and Greenland 14I seal and walrus fishing he was acclaimed by all the women , and declared a man . A man 's part in the affairs of life was doing all the needful hunting and fishing , but it was beneath his dignity either to carry or to skin his captures ? this was woman 's work . A great number of things were women 's work : amongst others making clothes , building huts , and cooking food . Indeed , from the day she was married until the day of her death , the life , of a woman was made up of incessant labour ? sometimes , indeed , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strenuous life of exposure in all weathers , men seldom lived beyond fifty ; women lived longer , and so , with such a superfluity of women , polygamy obviously followed . These people had a definite season for purposes of barter ; the Southerners had no whales , the Northerners no wood , and the mart was perhaps 400 miles midway . When these expeditions were undertaken , each party made the journey accompanied by their whole family , taking with them all their worldly possessions . And here entered a very important factor regarding all emigrations ; for if , wind and weather-bound , any group were isolated or marooned , they might amalgamate or form another separate tribe in new lands . Among themselves it was well known , that after or during these yearly ventures , some might return after long periods of voyaging , others had gone for ever . It is curious to hear that the most valued article of barter between the natives and Europeans was snuff ? a man would sell all the clothing on his back for a small quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being apparently to enable them to endure pain , was to hammer at one another , in turns , on the back , with clenched fists . He who endured this hammering the longest was the con142 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies queror ; even then his endurance was put to a further test with a new competitor ? until he succumbed ; thus , in course of time , each one was knocked out . In their most stormy quarrels the dispute was settled by a systematic wrangling debate , each having a number of supporters listening to , and enjoying the mutual recriminations , and unconstrained ridicule of satire and raillery . Yet in spite of this exhibition of mutual disdainful scorn , no violent adjectives were used ; and the duel of words being ended , all was harmony once more . The people of the Arctic Regions were obviously Sun Worshippers , for that orb meant everything to them ; at the winter solstice they contorted their bodies and danced frantically , keeping up the revel for several days until they were completely exhausted . There were certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fishing , or what was cast up on the shore ; for example , anyone finding wood of any kind , or parts of a wreck , was , on bringing it to the land , considered the legal owner of that prize , and no one would think of removing the stone he placed on it . In the case of fishing , so long as the harpoon with the rope attached still stuck into the fish , it was the property of the owner of the harpoon , although the fish may have got away with the weapon ; but if the rope became detached from the harpoon , the fish became the property of the one who caught it , but he returned the harpoon to its owner . Should a whale be washed up on the shore , it became common property , one and all slashing pieces out of it . The communal customs relating to all possible cases seemed so fair and just , that Mr. Cranty , the Moravian missionary , in 1733 , was reluctant in disturbing these inoffensive people by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him from Europe . They had , he said , learnt too well the most // callous acts of Nature ; like the animals none would assist another , drowning , or starving , or in distress ; Nature was manifestly unsympathetic , inadequate , often unnecessarily cruel ; the battle of life always favoured the strong ; men ruled over women ; women over children ; children over birds . The cult of Metamorphosis was a source of great consolation to these people . If a father chanced to lose his son , a widow persuaded him that the soul of his son had passed into one of her children lately born ; in this case the man adopted both the widow and her offspring as his own . A Greenlander 's Paradise was at the bottom of the sea , where , from the bowels of the earth , it supported all the water above them . Here was an eternal summer with perpetual daylight ; the waters were always clean , and there abounded unlimited game and fish , which , without the effort of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was only those who had performed their service in this world , who entered this Elysium . To reach this Paradise the soul glided for five days over rugged rocks which were covered in blood ; it may be that this last function of the soul had been derived from some idea of a Purgatory , that was grafted into their minds many centuries before by some European travellers . In addition to this tenet , they also believed that the soul itself in its perilous journey through Purgatory , ran the risk of annihilation ; it was especially for this reason , that the deceased 's parents abstained for five days from certain foods , and did not raise their voices beyond a whisper during their daily work , so as not to distress nor tire the soul in its journey . Others located Paradise in the sky above the clouds ; the soul being able to fly to the stars , its first restingplace was the Moon , where it mingled with other spirits . // The wondrous Northern Lights represented to the Greenlanders the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of a very ancient belief , credited more among the Southerners than the Northerners . They believed in two Spirit Principles : one good , the other evil . It was the Good Principle the diviners consulted in regard-to the future . Some believed he was indefinite , without form ; others , more materialistic , that he was like a gigantic bear ; or that he resembled a man but had only one arm , or that he had more the form of a dove . The Bad Principle was feminine ; this goddess resided in a submerged palace , and by her magic enslaved all the fish and dwellers of the sea . She was guarded by a Cerberus , who never slept . In the case of shortage of sea food , the diviner had to propitiate this malevolent goddess . The female Principle was not favoured by the Greenlanders ; it was a melancholy spirit which attached itself to man . Apart from these Great Principles were a host of minor ones , connected with the success or failure of their undertakings , either encouraging or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairy dwarfs ; and a spirit of fresh water streams ? the first drink from such pure rivulets would drive out any evil spirit of which the drinker might be possessed . It is a peculiar characteristic , a phase in the evolution of all mankind , in all parts of the world , to be so credulous as to believe in the power of charms and amulets . These mascots worn by men , women and children were believed to possess a kind of guardian spirit which preserved the wearer from danger or sickness , and generally brought about good luck : curious pieces of wood , or stones ; a bone , a bird 's feather hanging round the neck ; or bits of hide dangling from the arms , or on the chest , were some of these mascots , // Moreover , the value of the mascot would be enhanced were it a gift ; if given by a European , whether a small strip of their clothing , or even a piece of his boot , through that gift would permeate the spirit of his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him . All kinds of charms were hung from their huts and their canoes , and no fisherman would start out without the special mascot to bring him good luck , and to save him from drowning . At this date ( 1730 ) there was no written language , because the people could not understand ; they were even frightened to carry a written message . Altogether , on many points , the Greenlanders were sorely handicapped . Since there was no sun visible in winter , there was no possible means of recording the time of day ; but by observing the first faint rays of light on the summit of the inland mountains , they had an approximate idea of the time of mid-winter ; when this was recorded they held their New Year 's festival . During the three following moons they prepared to shift out of their winter quarters ; at their fourth moon some small bird visitors began to arrive ; when the walrus or sea horse appeared it was the fifth moon . At this period they partly lost sight of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun . When the moon was not visible they counted the days by the length of the shadows cast by the rocks ; although by the shortest daily shadow they were only able to tell when it was midday or the longest day . The stars , they said , were the spirits of deceased Greenlanders ; shooting stars were souls on their way to visit hell , to discover what was taking place there . Their knowledge of astronomy was used partly as a guide to the seasons , embellished with fable and poetry : for example , the three stars forming what we call Orion 's I0 // Belt , was represented to the Greenlander as three men , who having lost their way after sea-horse fishing , were transported into the sky . The Sun and Moon were represented as brother and sister ; the marks in the Moon were made by her brother 's soiled and greasy fingers , and by these smears he would be able to recognize her . Thunder was produced by two women quarrelling over a seal 's skin ; during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and produced lightning . The use of snuff alleviated many of the eye troubles so prevalent in the land . When a man was buried his canoe , bow and arrows were placed by his side ; when a woman was buried her needles and knife were placed near her body ; and on the grave of a child was placed the head of a dog , for without its assistance the child would have been incapable of finding its way . PERSIA ABOUT 1650 Persia extended from the Caspian Sea to the Indian Ocean , was bordered on the east by the Mongols of China , and on the west by the Euphrates , Ispaham being the capital . Tavernier describes the streets as inconceivably dirty , littered with every form of garbage , and open sewerage ; beasts were slaughtered in the main thoroughfare , others left to die there . Little wonder was it , therefore , that the better classes always travelled on horseback . Cleanliness did not in other respects appeal to the Persians . Morier tells us of a Persian repast , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their feet tucked under them . They placed their chins close to the dishes , and scooped up the food with their three fingers and the thumb of the right hand . On the ground was placed the sofra or the tablecloth , which had been so long in use that its fragrance was remarkably unsavoury ; the Persians were wholly indifferent to this fact , declaring that " changing the sofra brings ill-luck . " Among their amusements they played a game with eggs ; this consisted in butting the ends against each other ; strong eggs were , therefore , a valuable asset ; marionette shows were also very popular . Their dances , writes Edward Stoll Waring , were crudely indecent and disgusting , but their songs were beautiful and pathetic , the usual theme being praise of wine and beauty , and the cruelty of their mistresses . Many of the nobler orders engaged Georgian boys to sing , and play on different instruments . // The Persian considered it part of his religion to be vigilant in guarding both his faith and his wives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbour 's wives ; their jealousy reached such a point that they built a hut over the graves of their women , so that no man might even catch a glimpse of the lifeless remains . They also instilled into the minds of their wives , that not only should they shun the society of the other sex , but that they should avoid even looking at them . They believed that when the faithful are in Paradise , they will have eyes in the crown of their head , to prevent their seeing the houris , or celestial women who belong to others . Neither were married women , unless of a very low class , allowed to see their nephews or their husband 's brothers ; indeed brothers were frequently forbidden to see their sisters . When the women paid visits , a troupe of horsemen rode before them crying Kuruck ! Kuruck ! in order that no man might be in the path ; otherwise he would be beaten with the staves of these out-runners . Should a man be found in the path of the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the route of these ladies becoming known , all the men near the path taken by the harem were obliged to leave their houses . Espoused wives were called Nekaa , four being allowed by the Mahometan law ; but owing to the expense , men seldom have had more than one . " If they can not content themselves , " says Chardin , " with one woman , which is a misfortune that never fails to befall ' em , they make use of their slaves . By that means the Peace of the Family is never disquieted : for the marry 'd wife . . . whether contented or no , her Relations never take any notice . " If , by chance , a person of quality fell in love with a // woman unfitted to be his wife from a social point of view , he hired her for ninety-nine years , so that he made sure of her during his life . Persians were usually married through a half-opened door which separated the bride from her bridegroom ; a priest , or someone possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride elect , saying , " I , authorized proxy for you , marry you to him . You shall be his perpetual wife with such dowry according as you have agreed " ; the same formula was then quoted from the husband 's side . " About an hour after she has been at her husband 's house , the matrons carry her into the bridal chamber , uncloath her to a little waste-coat , and put her to bed . " When the bridegroom entered all the lights were extinguished ; we also hear that " Coyness frequently happens among persons of quality . . . those of the blood royal , more particularly , put their husbands to this trouble , so that it requires whole months to reclaim ' em . " Sometimes the haggling over the dowry took place up to the time of the delivery of the maid to the man ; in such cases , it being a dishonour to return home , the bride 's parents were obliged to accept a reduction . Chardin comments : " We may say in general that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and woman never see one another ; then the women are coveted . " Persians frequently changed their names , either to give them greater dignity , or in hopes of better fortune . In 1667 , the first year of the monarch 's rule had so many misfortunes on account of war and famine , that he was induced to change his name . The prince was therefore crowned afresh under the name of Soliman ; and all the old seals and coins bearing the name of Sefi were destroyed as though he had died . Sir John Chardin says : " The women more frequently change their names than the men , whether owing to a // natural inconsistency , or that they do not agree to the alterations they find in life , being put upon them on account of their beauty , gaiety , their agility in dancing , or fine voice . . . they assume other names which better agree to their changed state . " Kings never allowed malefactors to look at them ; for this reason their faces were always covered when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful horses which were brought from Armenia ; the " crown royal " was set on the head of a horse , as victorious ( triumphant ) chariots were also crowned . The Persian ladies , says Olearius , did not wear their two or three rows of pearls round their necks but on their heads , beginning at the forehead and going down the cheeks , and beneath the chin , giving an appearance as though their faces were set in pearls . From the belief that married people had a particularly happy life in a future state , they used often to hire persons to be espoused to those who had died unwed . When a man desired to find a wife for his son , he went to the house of the damsel he had selected ; should her father have sweetmeats produced , it was taken for a sign that the overtures had been favourably received . The usual presents were then offered by the bridegroom , which , if he was in fairly good circumstances , usually consisted of two suits of fine clothes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of a divorce , and a looking-glass ; the contract was afterwards signed by the Cadi or Magistrate . On the night of the wedding the bride was attired in a dress of red silk , or painted muslin ; the bridegroom then sent for a horse for her to mount ; and one of the bridesmaids held up a looking-glass in front of her , all the way to her husband 's house , in order that she might // see herself for the last time as a maid . A large procession followed , and the marriage festivities lasted eight or ten days . Chardin ( 1684 ) declares that matrimony in Persia was very expensive , so that " Persons of Estates will not venture upon it . " Mahometans took their wives after three methods : ( 1 ) by purchase ; ( 2 ) by hire ; ( 3 ) by marriage ; the children born by any of these three methods were equally legitimate . If a slave had a child by her master , she was freed , and the child was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ispahan the best could be hired for thirty-five pounds a year ; when the time had expired , it could be renewed at pleasure ; but before this was done , the woman had to undergo forty days of purification . Persian women , as other Easterns , wore necklaces suspended from the neck to which was fastened a large box of sweets ; some of these boxes were as large as the hand ; the common ones were made of gold , the others were covered with jewels . All were bored through and filled with black paste , composed of musk and amber , " but of a very strong smell . " It was common belief in this country that the English people lived in ships on the water , and had no possessions of land except in those of other countries . Morier , about 189o , was of the opinion that " Our present Persian seems still to have retained a lingering impression of this sort . " Until a man had grown a respectable beard , he was not considered to be fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed after one , and greased their chins to hasten the growth of the hairs . Yet all Persians had their heads shaved ; and were never seen uncovered unless by accident . There was in Persia a religious sect called Gaures , // apparently an offshoot of the Christian religion especially adapted to the people . The mother of the first Prophet was called Dogdon , who having a vision that she had been visited by an Angel , dazzling as the Sun , she gave birth to the Prophet Ebrahim-zer Ateucht . This Prophet claimed that he had the power of performing miracles , and the king had him cast into prison ; but it came about that his majesty 's favourite horse had his four legs cut off . Upon being consulted in regard to this tragedy , the Prophet offered up four prayers ; after each prayer the horse grew a leg , and so was wholly restored . Only half satisfied , the king tried a further test ; he made a bath of molten silver , into which the Prophet was told to bathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this ordeal ; after this , he was said to have entered Paradise . Then was uttered the prophecy that three more Prophets should be born ; and with the birth of the last , would come the end of the physical world ; all the mountains and metals would be precipitated into hell , fill it up and destroy it . After that all the world would be happy , each having his own mansion , their sole delight being to behold and sing praises to God and Ebrahim . This state of bliss would only , however , be the portion of those who were still alive after the " Third Coming . " There would come a day of resurrection , when the soul would re-unite with the body and appear together before the Judge of Judges ; on the journey to Paradise there would be a bridge , narrower than the sharp edge of a knife , over which all Mussulmen would flit with the lightness of a bird . But the evil-doers and infidels would fall beneath this bridge into fiery furnaces , where thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . // The keeper at the gate of Paradise let all good Persians enter . There , sitting in the side of a great fountain , the Prophet with a long spoon , gave them of the water to drink ; after which they were presented with delicious food , and a number of women ( houris ) , created expressly for this purpose , since no human woman might enter Paradise . The Gaures were allowed five wives , should they be able to support them . If a man had cause to repudiate one , a year must elapse before she could be taken back ; if the woman did not repent , but was willing to acknowledge her misdeed , she was given a further three years to reconsider the matter . After which time , should the pair still desire to live together again , they must be remarried , which consisted of a simple ceremony of sprinkling the face of each with water , accompanied by a few words from the priest . Although is was lawful for a man to have five wives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelled to share her husband 's couch on Fridays and Saturdays . If after seven years she produced no children , her husband might repudiate her . By command of the prophet there was , we are told , one day in the year , in which all the women assembled to kill frogs ; unfortunately , the reason of this , and further details , are lacking . Both men and women Gaures ate pork and drank wine ; both allowed their hair to grow , which it did to great length ; nor did they cast aside their nails unless the necessity arose , when they carried away and buried the parings . They loved bulls , cows , and dogs ; the first and last were not allowed to be killed ; but they had the greatest antipathy to cats , owing , they said , to their resemblance to the devil . Thus no one kept a cat , indeed they killed any that they might find ; should anyone have a // distemper , the source was to be found in cats who , created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These people set their dead up against a walled-in cemetery , and the flocks and crows gathered round ; if a crow picked out the right eye of the deceased , it was a sign of future happiness ; if the left eye , it was a premonition of evil , and everyone was sorrowful . On the death of a prince , it was customary to cast out their physicians and astrologers from court ; firstly because they had not driven away death , secondly because they had failed to predict it . Another very usual custom was that when a man was on the point of death a little dog was placed on his chest ; when the man was in extremis they applied the dog 's muzzle to his mouth to gather his soul into the dog , who would deliver it into the hands of the Angel who is the receiver of souls . In Armenia there is a tradition that Noah planted a vineyard near Erivan ( the capital ) , about two miles from the city , and that Erivan was the most ancient inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they declared , lived there before and after the Deluge ; and that here also was the terrestrial paradise . But Chardin says , " all Lhis is a story . . . reported by persons equally ignorant and vain-glorious . " In the treasury of the famous monastery of the " Three Churches " there are relics of saints : an arm and thigh of St. Caiana , an arm of St. Gregory , a rib of St. James , a finger of St. Peter , and two fingers of St. John the Baptist . Some thirty-five miles to the east of Erivan is the famous mountain in which Noah 's Ark was supposed to have rested ; the Persians and Armenians called it Masis or Macis . In the Scriptures the Ark is said to have rested on the Mountain of Ararat , which is in Armenia . // There is a tradition that the Ark is still in the Mountain of Arcis , but that no one is able to ascend the mountain to verify this statement . It is also said , that in ancient days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antidote against several distempers . We hear a quaint account of an Armenian wedding in 1831 ; the priest joined the hands of the bride and bridegroom together ; the bride was so concealed by drapery that not so much as the tip of a finger was visible , a thick white linen veil being thrown over her head . The only part uncovered was the top of her head ? attached to this was a mass of false hair which frequently rested on a sofa . At the altar the bridegroom was asked : " If she is blind , thou acceptest her ? " " If she is lame , thou acceptest her ? " " If she is hump-backed , thou acceptest her ? " To all of which questions the bridegroom replied , " I accept . " The bride was then asked : " Thou acceptest ? " and she replied , " I accept . " After this the bride 's sumptuous clothing was removed , and her husband , for the first time , beheld his wife . For twelve months after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of her mother-in-law , or her married sister-in-law . Mothers in Armenia arranged marriages without even consulting the fathers or brothers . The ceremony of affiancing was performed by a priest ; children might be betrothed at the early age of two or three ; even before birth arrangements were sometimes made , subject to the arrival of the right sex . The youth was supposed to send his betrothed , every Easter , a dress ; three days before the marriage was celebrated , the young man 's father and mother carried to the maid 's parents all the // necessaries of a feast . Men and women never ate together at a public gathering ; on this occasion also they ate at separate tables . On the eve of the wedding , the bridegroom elect sent a suitably valuable dress to his betrothed , while her mother sent him a costume in return . Then each , on a separate horse , was escorted by a number of young men to the church where the ceremony was performed . When night had closed in , the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stocking ; only after the light had been extinguished , did she remove her veil . Before daybreak she arose and covered herself once again with her veil ; thus , owing to this custom , there were men , who though married for ten years , had never seen the face of their wife . We are given details , by Lady Augusta Hamilton , of another wedding . The procession was started by flute players and dancers , followed by " a group of relations " ; next in the procession was a party of men holding torches of yellow wax . Finally the bride appeared , supported by two of her nearest relatives ; a sack was drawn over her head down to her feet ; a wooden " tea-board " was on her head keeping the sack from her mouth and nostrils ; she was separated from her bridegroom by a party of guests . The bridegroom was a miserable looking object , enveloped in napkins ; his head , which was leaning slightly over his left shoulder , was covered with a silk shawl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgy , which lasted for three days and nights . In Upper Armenia was the famous Temple of Fire called Azev-beyan , where was kept this Fire which Fireworshippers held to be a god . The Guebres , the last that were left of these people , say that the Sacred Fire is still there and can be seen there in the shape of a flame , // which , they add , according to Chardin , " is a sort of pleasant story , that if you make a hole in the ground , and set a pot over it , that same fire will cause it to seethe and boyle all that is in the pot . " On the death of a slave , before his master had liberated him , the hand of the deceased clasped a notice that he was honest , and his liberty was thereby granted ; this was to clear him of the reproach , in the next world , of being a slave . Suicides were not carried out through the door , but through a hole in the wall . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an ordinary mortal , enclosed in a sack ; but , in addition , a note was placed in his hand , on which , quoting Tavernier , was written : " Souvien toy que tu es venu de terre , et que tu retourneras en terre . " PERU ( Ancient Incas ) IT is exceedingly difficult to trace the earliest history of Peru , mixed up as it has been with contradictory accounts and untrustworthy exaggerations . Garcilasso de la Vega , the eminent Inca scholar , considers the following tradition most worthy of belief . Peru was inhabited by peoples divided up into several wild straggling tribes , continuously at war with one another , brutalized by excessive cannibalism , without law , order , or any form of morality . It is related that an offshoot of the ancient tribe of Cocomas had a custom of eating their deceased relatives , finally grinding the bones to mix with a drink of fermented liquid ? for said they , " Is it not better to be inside a friend than be swallowed up by the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Amtis likewise ate human flesh ; they regarded it as sacred food ; and especially relished the flesh of the sacrificed man who had died bravely and without fear , for it endowed the consumer with these desirable qualities . Suddenly , in about the 12th Century A.D. , out of this chaos there arose two individuals , a man and a woman , who , under the legendary names of Manco-Capac and Mama-0ello Huaco , asserted that they were the mystical children of the Sun , destined by this heavenly father to reform and gather mankind under one Empire , and to become its rulers . They also declared they were invested with a gold wedge , with directions that they were to journey until a spot was found where the wedge could be easily // pushed into the ground . Magnetized by their splendid appearance and ancestry , and unconsciously influenced by a superior personality , the wandering tribes united and followed this remarkable pair in their mission to the valley of Cuzco . Nearby , on the ridge of Huanacauti , the wedge sank into the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , in the valley of Cuzco , were laid the foundations of the capital with its stone buildings . Under the influence of the divine wisdom of their new leaders , the tribes submitted to law and order ; the spirit of these brutalized savages became changed , their vigour and energy was guided into new channels . Manco-Capac introduced agriculture and various industries ; while Mama-Oello not only taught the women weaving , dyeing , spinning , etc. , but presented to their minds such virtues as they had never before heard . They were also gradually persuaded , or forced , into the belief of a Supreme Being , whom they named Paclracamac , and who they credited as instilling life into the Universe . His symbol was a large oval flat plate of fine gold . All sacrifices were made with animals and birds . Each province , town , tribe , and family retained their separate gods or totems . Every living creature was venerated for its particular physical virtue ? tigers and bears for strength ; monkeys for agility ; dogs for fidelity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipped for their crystalline transparency and beauty of colour , the emerald being the most adored . To those who lived by the products of the land , Earth was Mother ; those living by the Sea claimed the Sea as their Mother . There is every reason to believe that all their laws were based on a rigorous social system ; there was no 16o Ancient Rites and Ceremonies currency ; everyone , being provided with land and animals , had sufficient means to feed and clothe himself . From the earliest times their first consideration was to work the land assigned to the Sun , the product of this being stored for national purposes . Their next consideration was for the land assigned to widows , orphans , the sick or aged ; following this , the land belonging to absent soldiers was tilled during their absence ; last of all was brought under cultivation the land belonging to the Incas . There were very stringent laws pertaining to extravagance . Thus ends the mixture of fact and fable , covering many earlier centuries of progress and culture ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thence , also , originated the powerful monarchy of the Incas , or children of the Sun . At the Assemblies of these earthly divinities , the higher orders arrived with a " light bundle , " a symbol of authority , while the populace , before entering the street where the royal palace was built , were compelled to uncover their heads and remove their shoes . According to Rivero and Tschudi , the youthful nobility , at the age of sixteen , began making preparations for a ceremony which has been compared to the order of knighthood in the Middle Ages . A grim ordeal it must have been , one at which the reigning Inca presided . Not only had the competitors to be well skilled in wrestling , and other war-like exercises , but mock tournaments were fought in which , although the weapons were without edge , the combatants were always more or less injured , and sometimes killed . Every kind of privation had also to be endured , with the dual object of rendering them fit for battle , yet making them merciful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful competitors // were then introduced to the reigning Inca , who pierced their ears with pins of gold , preparatory to the enormously heavy pendants they might afterwards be honoured with , on account of their services to the Inca . The size of the lobe of their ear was , in fact , the symbol of their status . Some of the laws of the Peruvians were humane in the extreme : all invalids were supported at the expense of the nation . They had also special inns , the " guest houses " of those days , called Corpahacasis , for the assistance of strangers , which were also supported at the public expense . Another of their laws was for the purpose of instilling economy and simplicity , both in regard to food and dress . The Incas , who were also the High Priests , closely cropped their hair , obsidian knives being used for the purpose . When the Spaniards introduced scissors , razors , combs , and looking-glasses , one of the Incas is said to have remarked that the introduction of these precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country . Only the Incas wore turbans of many colours ; those of the people were of black ; to distinguish one tribe from another , the head covering was also of different shapes ; each tribe had , as well , its hair trimmed in a particular manner for the sake of distinction . There were also special rules laid down for their ear ornaments , each tribe having a decoration of its own . The Incas always consulted the Sun and gave him as the authority , before issuing any edict , or creating a new law . At the deathbed of the Inca , Manco-Capac , he desired that all the people he had governed should be known as Incas , and their wives and daughters called Pallas . Their punishments were particularly drastic ; those who cheated were flogged , and occassionally put to death ; severe sentences were also meted out to those II // who removed landmarks and benefited generally by deeds of wilful damage to their neighbour 's property . But the most brutal of all their punishments was inflicted upon those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or buried alive , with their sons , ancestors , servants , neighbours , and cattle . As in Greece and elsewhere , the Peruvians paid deep respect to their dead . In October , after the feast to their memory , they acted tragedies or dramas , in which were commemorated the patriotic virtues of their deceased ancestors . During the months when their War exercises were celebrated , they usually acted comedies , in which the warrior-like deeds of their ancestors were recorded . We learn from Lady Augusta Hamilton and others that there were convents of young girls , chosen before the age of eight , who were dedicated to perpetual virginity as wives for the Sun . The most celebrated was at Cusco ; here only the daughters of the Incas of the blood royal were admitted . They were under the charge of an elderly dame and led a very secluded life , not being even permitted to see their parents . Nor might the King visit their retreat ? only the Queen and her daughters . Other convents were so many seraglios , containing young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were selected the Inca 's concubines . Those who were thus favoured could not afterwards return to their convent , but became ladies in attendance on the Queen at the Palace . When , however , they reached mature age , they were permitted to return to their home and country , and in consequence of having met with such an honour from an Inca , were much prized as wives for the Inca 's favourites , or as a reward for men of distinction ; they were treated with the highest respect and lived in the greatest comfort . // An Inca might have as many concubines as he chose , the daughters of whom were highly honourable brides for courtiers and nobles , but only one wife , called Coya , who was his sister or half-sister : if she brought him no children , he married all his sisters in turn . Should he have no sisters , he espoused his next of kin : one Inca had three hundred direct descendants . This custom of consanguinity among the monarchs was also common in Egypt and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be degrading to one who was considered superhuman to mate with mere mortals ; it also assured the ruling kingdom to the one House . Should the Inca 's wife prove unfaithful , but swore that the Sun was the real father of her child about to be born , she might live until she was delivered , after which she was buried alive ; and according to its sex , the child of this Deity was either destined for the priesthood , or brought up as one of the sacred virgins . Every year or two all the single girl connections of the Incas , between 18 and zo , were collected with single youths of the same status of 24 ? boys not being allowed to be married before this age ? the Inca then taking the hand of each , made them repeat a vow , after which they were considered married . The young couple spent the honeymoon at the home of the bridegroom 's father , and became a charge on certain districts , who were obliged to provide for them . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys and girls of commoners , each being of similar rank and of the same parish . Their nearest relations in each town and district were compelled to supply them with suitable lodging , furniture , and means of existence . Ordinary gentlemen might have several concubines // but only one wife ; if he was unfaithful no punishment would be inflicted were the lady chosen a spinster ; but should she be married he forfeited his life . When women lost their husbands , they had the choice between unsupported widowhood or being buried alive . The people had a habit of washing their heads in mud , the object being to make their hair soft and black . The Peruvians believed strongly in witchcraft and considered that their downfall would arise from these demoniacal practices ; therefore was it commanded , that all who practised it should be burnt , with any objects they might have used for these unholy rites . They moreover declared that these wizards had the power of driving some of the highest in the land mad , by means of certain herbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence fell desperately in love with the lower orders . They believed , too , that the wizards had idols of ' different coloured stones which they consulted ; some of the smaller ones were in the shape of two people embracing . When the wizards were seeking these stones , it was declared that lightning and a thunderbolt indicated where they would be found . These idols were called hcracanqui , and sold at a high price among women , who believed they would bring them love and happiness . The idol was placed in a small new basket , with a number of blue and green feathers from special kinds of birds ; amulets were also placed in the basket , as well as maize flour , some fragrant scented herbs , and cocao leaves . It was kept among the clean clothes , the maize flour being renewed every month . Other objects of witchcraft were also used with the same purpose , such as hairs , saliva , anything emanating from the person of the enquirer ; these were mixed with // some object appertaining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake , wizards frequently used , after midnight , a large quantity of cocao , green tobacco , and cinnamon . They also employed large and hairy spiders as a means of foretelling the future , seeking them in their holes , under stones in walls : having found one , the unlucky insect was either placed on the ground , or on a piece of cloth , the wizard pursuing it with a stick until its feet were broken ; divination was made according to which feet were missing even the kings consulted these magicians and followed their instructions , but only to foretell the results of war and other important national events . On entering a temple , a man would put his hand to his temple , and whether he succeeded in pulling out a hair or no , he blew in the air to the idols such as contained the evil spirit , as if blowing it a kiss . Instead of ordinary letters , the Peruvians used two forms of writing : one , the most ancient , was a species of hieroglyphic ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiios . This is not considered to have originated in Peru , as they are heard of in Mexico and elsewhere . It was a very complicated process , with its various colours and method of intertwining as well as twisting the knots , etc. ; but it is said that the notification became so perfected that main events were recorded and interpreted : such as the list of the army , taxes , enrolment of tribes , a register of the births , deaths , etc. , etc . Architecture was one of the marvels of the Peruvians : Father Acosta speaks of a stone he measured which was 38 feet long and i8 feet wide , but says there were stones of far greater proportion . They had great fear of eclipses of the sun and moon , more especially of the latter , believing that they might explode upon the // earth . To avert their ill effects , they made prodigious noises by playing upon instruments and shouting ; to add still more to the turmoil , they belaboured the dogs to make them howl . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet was sickening . The rainbow was an object of concern ; when seen the mouth should be firmly closed and covered with the hand ; or , if opened ever so slightly , it would be the means of making the teeth rot . Although in a much lesser degree than the Sun , the Moon as both its sister and wife , was an object of great veneration . Thunder , lightning , and thunderbolts were the Sun 's executioners ; and in common with Athens and Rome , she was regarded as the protecting Deity during the period of childbirth . The Peruvians , until the arrival of the Spaniards , also worshipped , in common with the Greeks ? Isis . They believed that man consisted of two parts ? the soul and the body . The one animated by an immortal spirit , the other by Earth . There was an ultimate heaven for the good as a reward for their virtues ; a middle haven for the undistinguishable ; and a hell for the criminal ? which was in the centre of the Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread , into the composition of which the blood of young children had been added . This blood was drawn from between the eyebrows ; the rubbing of this bread over the head , face , stomach , arms and legs was supposed to keep anyone immune from all sickness ; a piece of this same substance , hanging on the outside of the door proclaimed that the people of that particular house had been purified . Every one , from the Inca downwards , was bound to conform to this custom , After this , prayer was offered to // the Sun , begging its protection against all that was harmful . As if in reply to this , four extravagantly disguised couriers of the Sun , rising out of the supposed unknown , from the four quarters of the Earth , by touching the heads of the Incas , acclaimed that they had been commanded to chase away all the sources of ill health . Every one stood at their doors when these messengers passed through the streets , at the same time touching their own heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make themselves immune from disease . The same night , carrying lighted torches , the Sun 's messengers went through the streets ridding the town from any malignant disease ; finally the torches were thrown into the river . The following five or six days were given up to feasting and public rejoicings . They also held a form of harvest thanksgiving , offering up to the Sun a number of tame rabbits ; these were thrown on to a fire made for the purpose . It was customary for every man to possess two drinking cups ; they were either of gold or silver , or even of wood , and were of exactly similar size and shape . At all the feasts there was an all-round mutual invitation to drain the cup ; the custom was for the instigator to fill both cups equally ; then holding one in each hand , if his guest was of superior rank , with compliments he was presented with the cup held in the right hand ; if inferior , he was given the one in the host 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this custom did or did not , at the end of the day , lead to a brawl , or whether it did not usually end in a free fight . A great feast was held every month during the year , the principal ones being always those which related to the Sun ; the most celebrated of all was held in the summer solstice . At this were assembled a vast throng of people from all the countries who were under the // dominion of the Inca ; such as were unable to be present sent their sons and others of importance to represent them . The poorer classes also assembled to witness this huge throng of people , who wore their most magnificent court dresses and jewels and carried their finest arms , while servants held canopies of brightly coloured feathers and cloths above the heads of their lords as an emblem of nobility . They preferred to sacrifice twin-born animals , both because they were a rarity as well as an abnormality . As there would not have been sufficient space in the dwellings , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sent for from the neighbouring country to prepare the food for this vast throng , and especially to knead a sort of cake composed of boiled maize . The virgins of the Sun prepared this repast for the Inca and nobles , as well as other foods which had been prepared the night before . Previous to this feast there had been during the last three days a rigorous fast , when the only food permitted was a small portion of white raw corn and a special kind of herb . In no house was a fire allowed to be lit . The instant the Sun 's first rays fell on the neighbouring hill-top , a great shout arose from the crowd , as they burst into song and played joyous and triumphant airs on their rude instruments . The Inca then arose , and taking two golden vases filled with chichu ( sacred liquid ) , prepared by the chosen virgins , he offered up the one in his right hand to the Sun by pouring it into a receptacle , from which was a tube whence it ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With his left hand he poured a quantity of chichu into the hand of each of his family and pledged to their future prosperity . The Inca then , with his family and the Curacas ( conquered princes ) , went into the temple and offered up Peru ( Ancient Incas ) 16g the two golden vases to the Sun ; the remainder of the people had to offer their gifts through the priests ; after which they all returned to the public square to assist at the sacrifices offered by the High Priest on the table or altar . Llamas were chosen for this purpose , the victim being held by four servants of the priest , with its face towards the east ; its entrails were afterwards examined to see whether the omens were propitious . According to Inca Garcilasso , these sacrifices had been modified . The principal thank-offering to the Sun consisted of lambs , sheep and sterile animals ; also rabbits , birds and even vegetables ; including finelymade clothes , but never a human sacrifice . Many authorities declared that human sacrifices , usually young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that When young children and youths were sacrificed , the idols buried with the mummies lived on human flesh . It was not unusual , especially when comets appeared or epidemics broke out , or as an offering for mercy for a man who was incurably ill on his death-bed , for children from the age of 4 to io to be sacrificed at one time . Every year over 2000 especially prepared men were sacrificed to two renowned gods ; each part of the individual ? ears , tongue , lips and nose were solemnly offered to the gods . Sometimes also young virgins met with the same fate . When an Inca or a great chief died , his wives , concubines and servants were buried with him . Occasionally some of the wives , who shrank from this dreadful ordeal preferred suicide rather than endure the life of contempt , for those who shrank from this sacrifice , they would otherwise be subjected to . In the practice of medicine the Peruvians resorted to bleeding , especially in the case of headaches , when they were bled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of obsidian . They were well aware of the specific values of herbs . The plant that we call tobacco was used principally as snuff . When the Spaniards found out its virtues they named it the " sainted herb . " While the kings were buried in a huge sepulchre made of stones in the form of pyramids covered with sand , and pebbled until it resembled a small hill , their vassals , especially in the south , were found in gold or silver vases in the shape of urns ? their intestines having been removed ? in meadows or forests . Sometimes , also , the places of burial had pavements and vaults . The poorer people were often buried only a few inches below the earth , covered by a sprinkling of sand , or in such narrow fissures in the rocks that it seemed incredible how they could have been wedged in . The ancient Peruvians were buried with their feet drawn up , their faces towards the west ; large stores of provisions in round earthen pots were also placed in the sepulchres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled up in large quantities of cloth , each resembling a large statue , with a round head , two knees , and two large feet . Strong netting of coarse thread was bound over a thick mat of rushes , and in this was wrapped the corpse . When the mat was removed a large roll of cotton was seen , which entirely covered the body , and had kept two or three canes secure at the sides ; occasionally a stick was across the shoulders . Beneath this roll was another roll of red or varied coloured cloth or wool . This completely enveloped the mummy , at the end of which were one or two cloths resembling sheets ; small idols and valued stones , etc. , were at the bottom of all . The position of the mummy was " squatting , " the knees drawn up to the chin , the arms either crossed over // the breast or supporting the chin ; in the mouth was always a small disc of copper or gold to pay for the journey . Although in most cases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the features were disfigured . The hair , which was black , was always in perfect preservation , but the blackness had faded and become russet coloured . It seems never to have been proved whether this embalming was the work of man or of nature ? in other words , due to the extreme dryness of the climate ; yet it is significant that the corpses of the Incas were in a much more perfect state of preservation than those of the plebeian orders of which millions have been found . In rainy districts , however , their corpses have been reduced to mere skeletons . The Incas had their greatest treasures buried with them ; it was in desecrating their tombs that their Spanish conquerors found their booty . In the 6th century , Pope Alexander the Sixth took upon himself to give to Portugal all the dominions in the East ; to Spain he presented all the countries they had discovered in the West . This donation to his Catholic supporters embraced the whole of the South American Continent , and included the Empire of Peru . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose and supported by armed soldiery , slaughtered and took prisoners the reigning Inca of Peru , Huayna Capac , with 5000 of his unarmed and peaceful followers , for the reason that they refused to " yeeld to the Gospell . " Thus have passed out of existence a highly civilized people The ethics for this wholesale slaughter by their invaders is too obvious for comment . PHILIPPINE ISLANDS THE Philippine Islands were discovered by Magellan in 1520 , and named by the Spaniards in honour of their king , Philip II . By the Portuguese they were known as Manille , the ancient name given them by Ptolemy . According to ancient voyagers , their characteristics differed little from those of the Malays , but the inland mountain people had no resemblance to those on the coast . They lived on fruit and roots , and ate monkeys , snakes and rats . There were no universal laws ; each tribe obeyed the patriarch of its own family . Neither had they any specified dwelling-places ? excepting when the rains made this imperative ? sleeping in trees , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jesuits and other missionaries have declared that the natives had tails , five or six inches long . These people had a mortal dread and hatred of the Spaniards ; if by chance they managed to kill a solitary straggler , their delight was to drink out of his skull . When they first saw these deadly foes , with swords dangling from their waists , eating hard biscuits , and puffing smoke out of their mouths , they took them for ferocious monsters with iron tails , eating stones , and belching smoke . At Samar , one of the islands of the group , it is related by the natives that there was another islet inhabited entirely by women ; this was visited periodically by the men of an adjoining island , who removed all male offspring of whom they were the fathers . This islet was named the Isle of Amazon . // Among the wild men of the hills , it was a recognized law that anyone benefiting in any way through another became his slave . A father buying out his son from slavery immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same compliment might be reversed , in which case the father became the slave . If a crime was committed by any individual , his whole family was held responsible and might be sold as slaves . Strangers were looked upon with suspicion ? in other words as enemies . These people had a horror of theft ; a liaison was merely a pastime , an exchange for a present or an excuse for giving one ; for incest the culprits were put into a weighted sack and thrown into the river . Should a man be determined to commit a murder , he first amassed as much money as was possible , so as to settle with his avengers ; this did not prevent his being acclaimed a brave , which carried with it the right to wear a red turban . If a man succeeded in killing seven at divers times , he could wear a turban of varied colours , called baxache . Many of the natives in the island of Suzon were very black , with tangled hair ; not tall , but remarkably strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their neighbours , attacking towns and often murdering the inhabitants . In the province of Zambala the people wore the front part of their hair shaved , and a large lock of loose hair falling over their foreheads . In these islands the people were adepts at manufacturing poisons out of various herbs , some of which , de Morgan declares , would cause death by merely being touched by the hands and feet , or sleeping on them . There were antidotes to these poisons in other herbs , which , should they be known and found in time , would counteract their deadly effects . // In some of the provinces bows and arrows were used , but more usually lances and shields of light wood which completely covered the users . At their waist hung a dagger , four inches wide and nine inches in length ; if they encountered an antagonist , with one hand they seized hold of his hair ; with the other , with one stroke from this dagger they cut off his head , which was , later , hung up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their first law was to honour their parents . A council of the elders settled all disputes ; in criminal cases , if the offender was unable to pay a sufficiently large recompense , his life was then and there forfeited . Payment could be made also as an atonement for murder ; but if again this was not forthcoming , the family of the deceased had the right to retaliate . In case of theft , if the thief was not known , every one who could be suspected was called upon to lay , unseen by the others , some article under a cloth spread out for the purpose ? this being a hint to the thief that , if he quietly returned the missing article , no further consequences would ensue . Did this method of recovery fail , they had recourse to an ordeal . All the accused voluntarily submitted to the trial ; they plunged into a river and were totally immersed : the first one who came to the surface for breath was considered the offender ; it is hardly necessary to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their attempt to prove their innocence , were drowned . Another form of ordeal was to call upon all the suspects to snatch a stone out of a pot of boiling water ; anyone who refused was compelled to pay an equivalent value of the article stolen . Thus , apparently , in these ordeals , someone , whether innocent or guilty , would have to recompense the owner of the stolen property ; // and by this system all property was remarkably safely insured . But they had the worst possible form of profiteering in nuptual fees . The bridegroom was called upon to pay when entering his house , a fee called passava ; for speaking to his wife a toll called patignog ; to eat and drink with her an exactment called passalog ; finally a douceur which was called ghinapuang , the amount of which was in accordance to his means . These marriage levies appear to have been scooped up by the parents of his bride . In cases of infidelity , compensation was given which completely whitewashed the delinquents , removing any temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , it was considered rather a tribute to the charms of the wife . When meeting a superior in the Philippines , the natives bent low and placed both hands on their cheeks , at the same time lifting one foot off the ground with bended knee . When meeting an equal they extended their clasped hands toward each other , bowing at the same time . They named their newly born child from the first article , or herb , they had seen . A man on discovering that his bride was yet a maid was deeply dissatisfied ; he considered that he had chosen an unwanted ? a left over , one whom no one had ever desired nor debauched . Four-footed animals were always sacrificed to their gods , and the first blow of death was given to it by a young girl . The natives never ate alone ; a man , on the loss of his wife , was served for three days during his bereavement by three widowers : a woman , on losing her husband , was looked after for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt each other in the presence // of their relations . The adopted son gave over all he possessed to the one who had adopted him . In return , he was allowed to remain in his house , under his control ; and later , to receive a portion of the inheritance which came to the other sons . Many of these people worshipped the Sun and Moon ; others held in adoration a special bird marked with yellow , which lived in the mountain woods . They had no temples nor places of public worship ; but each in his home worshipped a shrine of his own idols . Neither had they , says de Morgan , any priests , but a few old men and women , who were also reverenced as sorcerers and witches . The poor buried their dead under the floors of their houses , kept their bones for a long time in boxes and worshipped their skulls . The more wealthy used decorated coffins and placed the dead surrounded by palings , side by side with another coffin containing the deceased 's most valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Poland , which told that once there lived three brothers : their names were Lech , Czech , and Rus . These brothers met at a place since called Poynan , which was afterwards the capital of the Polish territory annexed by Germany . After a while these brothers parted , each settling in a country which was named after him . Rus gave the name to Russia , Czech to Bohemia ( now Czecho-slovakia ) , and Lech 's country was called Lechia ? now Poland . One day while Lech was exploring the country , he perceived a nest of white eagles , from which is derived the Polish coat of arms ; on this spot , in course of time , a town was erected called Gniezno , derived from a Polish word signifying nest . The Poles were a curiously superstitious race . In certain localities the people chased death from their villages during the spring ; this custom was associated with a variety of mystical rites , for they had a preconceived belief that winter is the season of death . Thus they connected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this evolved into chasing the evil which was the origin of death . The harvest rites showed many similarities to the spring rites . The soul of a tree was either represented as a young tree , or possibly a person . The spirit , or soul , of corn was usually believed to pass into the last person who cut the sheaf ? possibly the waving of the corn suggested to their minds the attempt of escape , or some birds in that sheaf conveyed the idea of the human form . 72 =78 Ancient Rites and Ceremonies Water was regarded as a powerful factor by these people ; they believed it might even engender life . On their Easter Monday , should anyone pour water over another it was a sign of great good fortune . On the eve of the winter solstice a special ceremony took place . The day itself was held as a fast day , but as soon as the first stars illuminated the heavens supper was served , which consisted usually only of fish , although in some districts there were as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at supper must never be uneven , or it would be courting disaster . A place was always laid for a guest who had not yet arrived ? maybe one from some unknown world . These winter solstice rites are said to have been derived from a mutual origin ? the feasts of Saturnalia , of the Greeks and Romans . When this feast was over the family paid a visit to the animals and the bees : when the orchard was reached the head of the family shook the fruit trees , in order to wake them , at the same time asking whether they would be fruitful . The remainder of the family then gave guarantees that the trees would bear much fruit that year . At this season the Szopka , or Puppet Show of the Nativity , brought hence from other lands , was exhibited in the Churches ; but being considered too secular , they were afterwards taken to the churchyards , and later to the market-places and streets . On New Year 's Eve a ceremony was held of chasing the Old Year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cracking of whips , or in the country by beating the fences with sticks . In Pomerania special cakes were made which were distributed among the household , also to all the domestic animals and to male birds . One of their customs was to fashion an effigy of death // out of straw , place it on a card , and afterwards burn or drown it in the village ; this was done with the idea of exterminating death . These people had a sort of dance , when they would leap or dance with the idea of securing what each most desired : the farmer did so in order to obtain a good harvest of oats and wheat ; his wife for hemp , and the daughters for herbs . The Poles were great believers in good and bad luck ; whether they were born in a fortunate or unfortunate moment played a very important part in the beliefs of these people . If anyone was born in an evil hour he would assuredly either die or lead a life wholly destitute of prosperity : his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn ; and his purchase of cattle would be so unprofitable that he invariably sold it again to another buyer . Witches , too , those who possessed the evil eye , also unpropitious stars , all exerted their mysterious influence on such a person . On the other hand , all that was desirable or profitable would be the portion of one who was born at a lucky moment ; it even affected such matters as borrowing ( or lending ) . In some districts certain articles , as well as clothing , were lent up to mid-day ; in the afternoon the farmer 's wife refused to lend , otherwise her feet would sorely trouble her . When persons returned what was lent or borrowed , it had to be at the same hour . In other districts milk , cheese , butter and eggs were not sold after sunset , otherwise witches would have easier access to the cows and the hens would cease laying . And should there be a baby in the hut , there must be no borrowing of anything , or prosperity would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affected . Indeed , borrowing was prohibited for twelve days after a child was born . Should a death occur in a house , the smallest hospitality would be refused ; also the lending
