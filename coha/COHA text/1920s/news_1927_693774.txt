txt From one point of view . Thursday 's reduction of the Bank of England discount rate from 5 per cent . to 41/2 , after the 5 per cent . rate had been maintained unchanged for sixteen months , merely followed the course of other European money markets . Fall in open-Market money rates and reduction of the official bank rates have been characteristic of the period . The Bank of France had lowered its rate from per cent . to 5 before the Bank of England acted , the German Reichsbank from 7 to 5 ; bank rates have been cut at Vienna from 8 per cent . to 6 , at Prague from 6 to 5. at Brussels from 7 to 6 , FoF - this noteworthy and very general movement there were various visible causes  --  solution of a critical problem of the currency at Paris and Brussels , slackening of trade activity in cities such as Vienna and Prague , inflow of foreign capital to nearly all of the Continental markets . But the essential fact was that , for the first time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly back to the pre-war figure . ' When sweeping changes of the kind previously occurred in Europe , the Bank of England was usually the first to move . That it did not on this occasion , that it bad kept its rate throughout 1926 at the highest level reached in more than five years and 2 per cent , above : . he rate of 1922 and 1923 , was attributable to certain considerations peculiar to Great Britain ? first , uncertainty whether the Bank of England could keep its gold reserve Intact after return to free gold payments in 1925 ; second , greatly increased misgiving which surrounded that question when the labor troubles of 1926 completely deranged the country 's home and foreign trade . The policy of holding the bank rate much higher than the open London market was pursued with the avowed purpose of throwing all possible influence against the outflow of gold from London . Actual results have shown that the precautions may have been unnecessary . Although the strike embargo ' prevailed during more than half of 1926 , and although that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the Board of Trade , the international balance on all accounts combined ran against Great Britain for the first time since the war , there was no disastrous outpour of gold . In the whole of 1926 gold exports were less by ? 22,000,000 than in either 1925 or 1924 . During the year since the strike began , last May , the Bank of England has added ? 7,500.000 to its gold reserve , whereas it lost ? 9,300 , - 000 in the corresponding period a year before . Ten days ago the British Government 's opinion of the situation was expressed by the announcement in the Chancellor 's budget speech that the 8300,000,000 New York " gold credit , " established as a safeguard when gold payments were resufned in April . 1925 , would not be . renewed on its /ration " this month . The lowering of the Bank of England 's rate is further recognition of the success with which the gold-payment policy has been pursued , under what was perhaps the most exacting economic test that could have been incurred .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
