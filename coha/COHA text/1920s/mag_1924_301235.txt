William Dobbie , first Socialist Lord Mayor of the ancient city of York , can not be " kidded . " On certain days the mayoral court is supposed to attend certain services of the Church of England . Mr. Dobbie observed in the past that the attendance at these services was small . He therefore declared that " the members of council are a lot of piffling frauds in regard to recognition of civic Sundays . My time is too valuable to be wasted in walking about the streets with my red coat on . If the members of the corporation have kidded other Lord Mayors into going to church under these circumstances , they wo n't kid me . " <P> At a Birmingham session of the Conference of Christian Politics , Economics and Friendship , the question of birth control was debated with a frankness which made " old taboos regarding ' delicate ' subjects appear obsolete . " <P> " For God 's sake be careful , " warned " Woodbine Willie " ( the Rev. Studdart Kennedy ) . " Do you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in accordance with the law of God ? Is the population of China in accordance with the law of God ? " <P> A resolution was finally passed calling upon the Churches represented in the Conference " to investigate thoroughly , and to consider with the intention of offering definite guidance to perplexed consciences this and other relevant questions regarding marriage and parenthood .
