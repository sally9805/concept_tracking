Anatole Deibler . <P> In all France there is only one current guillotine knife , although there are many scaffolds .

His salary until last week was a paltry $455 . <P> M. de Paris long since wanted a raise . <P> Timidly but often he has essayed the subject to his superior , Minister of Justice Louis Barthou .
