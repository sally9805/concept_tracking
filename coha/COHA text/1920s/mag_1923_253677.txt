She Has Never Written a Failure <P> Mary Roberts Rinehart 's own dramatization of The Breaking Point is now finished . It will soon go into rehearsal . Since December she has written two plays , has made many drafts of each , has discarded one and decided that the other will do . Mrs. Rinehart works swiftly and constantly . Her life has been a succession of amazing successes ; but they have come as a result of a genius for understanding the public mind , an acquired ability to write , an unusual executive sense , and a gift for fortune-luck if you like . This luck of Mrs. Rinehart 's is not a myth . Shooting , she will bring down a bird on the wing-to her own surprise ; fishing , she will be the only one to make a catch . <P> Forced to earn her own living when she was very young , Mrs. Rinehart became a nurse . In the hospital she met Dr. Rinehart ; she was married at nineteen . It was not until after her three sons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's poems , which , she tells you , were exceedingly bad . Then she wrote short stories with some success . Her first novel , The Circular Staircase , which later became The Bat , was a great success , and from that time her progress has been steady . She has never written a failure . That is largely because she respects and knows her tremendous public . Of all our women writers , her attitude toward the war was the sanest , and her Kings , Queens and Pawns is a magnificent piece of reporting . Her work for the Department of Justice was secret , brave and successful . It is characteristic of her that she hates trains , that she arrives from a rail-road journey a nervous wreck ; but that she can ride a horse steadily for weeks through the most dangerous western passes . <P> To meet Mrs. Rinehart in her Washington home is to see a hostess of charm , and to hear a raconteuse of ability . Like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , she has the rare gift of dramatizing fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dark , faultlessly dressed , with graceful nervous hands and the deep eyes that are at once penetrating and sympathetic , she is a beautiful and a forceful woman . <P> What a contrast to step into her study ! Piles of mail ; manuscripts ; a sheaf of speeches for a play here ; the beginning of an article there ; a pile of invitations on the corner of the desk . Never satisfied , never stopping , Mrs. Rinehart is the indefatigable woman of action . <P> J. F.
