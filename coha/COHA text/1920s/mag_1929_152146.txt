Capt . Rt . Hon. Edward Algernon Fitzroy , M. P. , diligent soldier , former Page of Honor to Queen Victoria , now a grizzled , crop-lipped campaigner with 25 years ' service in the Conservative ranks , was led last week to the Chair of the House of Commons . Solemnly following the ritual , Capt . Fitzroy made " formal gestures of protest , ' ' shook his head , thrust out his arms pleadingly . Then , still in ritual , he abandoned formal gestures , sat upon the chair , and became for the second time and by unanimous vote , Speaker of the House of Commons , First Commoner of the Realm . As such he must wear periwig and gown at all meetings of Parliament , listen to debates , rule tactfully on parliamentary procedure . In return he has a stone palace overlooking the Thames to live in ( a wing of the Houses of Parliament ) , a salary of $25,000 a year , a further allowance for " costumes and effects " of $5,000 , and an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Majesty 's Master of the Buckhounds . <P> The evening after Speaker Fitzroy was installed on his Chair , " Beefeaters " ( Yeomen of the Guard ) from the Tower of London marched through the cellars of Parliament . Carrying halberds and horn lanterns they poked in crannies , peered in corners . The purpose of this search was to look for Guy Fawkes , a gentleman who , one Nov. 4 , tried to blow up Parliament , but who , to the comfort of present-day " Beefeaters , " has been dead since 1606 . <P> Satisfied that Guy Fawkes was not in the cellar , Parliament proceeded to open . For the first time since 1900 , the Sovereign did not appear . <P> Among the first to arrive at the Members ' Entrance was pepper-tongued Lady Nancy Astor , Virginia Conservative . Springing from her car before it had stopped she dashed into the building closely followed by Lt. Col. Sir Frederick Hall , a fellow Conservative . Both were intent on obtaining a certain comfortable corner seat on the Opposition benches . The instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other early arrivals . Lady Astor paused for an instant to take a card from an attendant with which to stake her seat . It was a fatal pause . Sir Frederick Hall kept going , got there first , plumped his panting form down upon the coveted seat and tried to look as though he had not been rude at all . <P> Soon the Commoners were summoned to the House of Lords to hear the Speech from the Throne . Seated on a bench before the empty throne were five noble representatives of the King in ermine and scarlet , like end men at a minstrel show . In their middle , was the Lord Chancellor , Sir John Sankey . Perhaps 50 Peers in ordinary morning clothes sat comfortably on their benches . Crowded behind the Bar of the Lords stood the Commoners . Thus once a year do the Lords of Britain put the Commoners in their places . <P> The five commissioners stared fixedly at the Commoners . In unison they slowly raised their black tricorn hats three times in greeting . Then Lord Chancellor Sankey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows is not written by the King at all but by the Prime Minister , a speech supposed to give the policies and promises of the new Government . <P> Short , MacDonald-George V speech was notably unexciting . Salient points :
