America , Listen to Your Own " MERICA has no ? tradition . She has no .. n ? . culture-history . " Therefore , she is damned . Europe invariably arrives at this self-congratulatory conclusion , usually from the same stock starting-point , the same phrase about tradition and culture . Moreover it usually gets Americans in the eye , for they really have n't anything more venerable than the White House , or more primitive than Whistler . Which they ought to be thankful for , boldly proclaiming this thankfulness. - Americans in Italy , however , are very humble and deprecating , They know their nakedness , and beg to be forgiven . They prostrate themselves with admiration , they knock their foreheads in front of our elegant fetishes . Poor , void America , crude , barbaric America , the Cinquescents knew her not . How thankful she ought be I She does n't know when she is well off . Italy consists of just one big arrangment of things to be admired . Every step you take , you get a church or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , on your knees in admiration . Down go the Americans , till Italy fairly trembles with the shock of their dropping knees . It is a pity . It is a pity that Americans are always so wonderstruck by our ? note the possessive adjective ? cultural monuments . Why they are any more mine than yours , I do n't know ? except that I have a British passport to validify my existence , and you have an American . However .. . After all , a heap of stone is only a heap of stone ? even if it is Milan Cathedral . And who knows that it is n't a horrid bristly burden on the face of the earth ? So why should the Corriere della Sera remark with such sniffy amusement : " Of course they were duly impressed , and showed themselves overcome with admiration " ? they being the Knights of Columbus , Cavaliere di Colombo . The Knights of Columbus were confessedly temny in Milan . But once more , why not ? The 0-ear , delicate-nosed , supercilious Anna Comnena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Constantinople long ago . And well-nurtured Romans never ceased to be amused by the gaping admiration of Goths and Scythians inside some forum or outside some temple , until the hairy barbarians stopped gaping and started to pull the wonder to pieces . Of course , Goths and Scythians and Tancred and Bohemund had no tradition behind them . Luckily for them , for they would never have got so far with such impedimenta . As a matter of fact , once they had a tradition they were fairly harnessed . And if Rome could only have harnessed them in time , she might have made them pull her ponder-ous uncouth Empire across a few more centuries . However , men with such good names as Alaric and Attila were not going to open their mouths so easily to take the bit of Roman tradition . You might ' as well sneer at a lad for not having a gray beard as jibe at a young people for not having a tradition . A tradition , like a bald head , comes with years , fast enough . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle for a jaded race . A thing of beauty is a joy forever . Let us live in hopes . But it is n't the end of all joys . There are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it : quite as good as that prickly sea-urchin of Milan Cathedral , 0 Knights of Columbus ! As for the sea ? la mer , c'est moi . La mer , c'est aussi vous , o Chevaliers de Col'ombe . Which is to say , there are quite as many wonders enfathomed in the human spirit as everhave come out of it : be theyMilan Cathedral or the Coliseum or the Bridge of Sighs . And in the strange and undrawn waters of the Knights of Columbus , what wonders of beauty , etc. , do not swim unrevealed ? A fig for the spiny cathedral of Milan . Whence all this prostration before it ? A thing of beauty is a joy forever . But there 's more than one old joy . It is n't the limit . Do you expect me to gasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit , and there 's no more to be done ? You ca n't fix a high-water mark to human activity : not till you start to die . Here is Europe swimming in the stagnation of the ebb , and congratulating itself on the long line of Cathedrals , Coliseums , Ghirlandaios which mark the horizon of the old high water : people swarming like the little crabs in the lagoons of Venice , in seas gone dead , and scuttling and gaping and pluming themselves conceitedly on the vision of St. Mark 's and San Giorgio , looming up magic on the sky-andwater line beyond . Alas for a people when its tradition is establish . ed , and its limit of beauty defined . Alas for a race which has an exhibition of modern paintings such as the one in the Gardens at Venice , in this year of Grace 192o . What else is left but to look back to Tintoret ? Let it look back then . Let the beauty ' of Venice be a sort of zenith to us , beyond which there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest heaven , like an eagle at our pitch of flight . We can do no more . We have reached our limits of beauty . But these are not the limits of all beauty . They are not the limit of all things : only ' of us . Therefore St. Mark 's need be no reproach to an American . It is n't his St. Mark 's . It is ours . And we like crabs ramble in the slack waters and gape at the excess of our own glory . Behold our golden Venice , our Lincoln cathedral like a dark bird in ? the sky at twilight . And think of our yesterdays ! What would you not give , 0 America , for our yesterdays ? Far more than they are worth , I assure you . What would not I give for Your tomorrows I One begins to understand the barbarian against the great monuments of civilization . beyond that , if you can , " we say to the American , Pointing to Venice among the waters . And the American humbly admits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to Attila , years gone by . " Get beyond Aquileia , get beyond Padua , you barbarian ! " Attila promptly kicked Aquileia and Padua to Smithereens , and walked past . Hence Venice . If Attila or some other barbaric villain had n't squashed the cities of the Adriatic head , we should have had no Venice . Shall we bewail Aquileia or praise our Venice ? Is Attila a reprehensible savage , or a creator in wrath ? Of course it is simple for America . Venice is n't really in her way , as Aquileia was in the way of Attila , or Rome in the way of the Goths . Attila and the Goths had to do some kicking . The Amer. leans can merely leave us to our monuments . There are limits . But there are no limits to the human race . The human race has no limits . The Milanese fished that prickly seabear of a Cathedral out of the deeps of their own soul , and have never been able to get away from it . But the Knights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation which has n't got a tradition and which la7cks cultural monuments . How gay Greece must have been , while Egypt was sneering at her for an uneducated young nobody , and what a good time Rome was having , whilst Hellas was looking down a cultured and supercilious nose at her . There 's as fine fish in the sea as ever came out of it . - America , therefore , should leave off being quite So Prostrate with admiration . Beauty is beauty , and must have its wistful time-hallowed dues . But the human soul is father and mother of all man-created beauty . An old race , like ' an old parent , its watching the golden past . But the golden glor-. les of the old are only fallen leaves about the feet of the young . It is an insult to life itself to be too abject , too prostrate , beforr ' Milan Cathedral or a Ghirlandaio . What is Milan Cathedral but a Prickly , empty burr dropped off the tree of life The nut was eaten even in Sforza days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of culture monuments . It wants an in-spiration . And you ca n't acquire an inspiration as You can a culture or a tradition , by going to school and by growing old . ' 17011 must first have faith . Not rowdy and tubthumping , but steady and deathless , faith in your own unrevealed , unknown destiny . The future is not a finished product , like the past . The future is a strange , urgent , poignant responsibility , something which urges inside a young race like sap , or like pregnancy , urging towards fulfillment . This urge you must never betray and never deny . It is more than all tradition , more than all law , more than all standards or monuments . Let the old world and the old way have been what they may , this is something other . Abide by that which is coming , not by that which has come . And turn for the support and the confirmation not to the perfected past , that which is set in perfection as monuments of human passage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans turn to America , and to that very America which has been rejected and almost annihilated . Do they want to draw sustenance for the future ? They will never draw it from the lovely monuments of our European past . These have an almost fatal narcotic , dream-luxurious effect upon the soul . America must turn again to catch the spirit of her own dark , aboriginal continent . That which was abhorrent to the Pilgrim Fathers and to the Spaniards , that which was called the Devil , the black Demon of savage America , this great aboriginal spirit the Americans must recognize again , recognize and embrace . The devil and anathema of our forefathers hides the Godhead which we seek . Americans must take up life where the Red Indian , the Aztec , the Maya , the Incas left it off . They must pick up the life-thread where the mysterious Red race let it fall . They must catch the pulse of the life which Cortes and ' Columbus murdered . There lies the real continuity not between Europe and the new States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . The President should not look back to wards Gladstone or Cromwell or Hildebrand , but towards Montezuma . A great and lovely life-form , unperfected , fell with Montezuma . The responsibility for the producing and the perfecting of this life-form devolves upon the new American . It is time he accepted the full responsibility . It means a surpassing of the old European life-form . It means a departure from the old European morality , ethic . It means even a departure from the old range of emotions and sensibilities . The old emotions are crystallized forever among the European monuments of beauty . There we can leave them , along with the old creeds and the old ethical laws outside of life . Montezuma had other emotions , such as we have not known or admitted . We must start from Montezuma , not from St. Francis or St. Bernard . As Venice wedded the Adriatic , let America embrace the great dusky continent of the Red . Man . It is a mysterious , delicate process , no theme for tub-thumping and shouts of Expositions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have touched and touched again , uncannily , unconsciously , blindfold as it were . Whitman was almost conscious ; only the political democracy issue confused him . Now is the day when Americans must become fully self-reliantly conscious of their own inner responsibility . They must be ready for a new act , a new extension of life . They must pass the bounds . To your tents , 0 America . Listen to your own , do n't listen to Europe .
