txt // and by the action of acetic bacteria on dilute solutions of alcohol , especially in low-strength alcoholic beverages such as clarets , Burgundy , Rhine and Moselle wines ( all of which contain less than twelve per cent . of spirit ) , ales and beer , cider and perry , etc . The alcohol produced in dough by fermentation is oxi dised to acetic acid , the smell of which may be recognised in the steam that issues from the oven during the baking of bread . The malt vinegar industry depends on the power of the various acetic acid groups of bacteria to oxidise alcohol to acetic acid . The reaction is somewhat complicated , but may be represented by the equations : The purest and strongest form is the glacial acetic acid , a very pungent , acrid-smelling liquid , which produces white blisters if allowed to touch the skin . The liquid boils at 244.4 ? F. ( 118 ? C. ) and has a sp. gr. of 1.080 . It readily mixes with water , alcohol , and ether in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many substances that are insoluble in water . The ordinary acid of commerce contains about thirt2 three per cent . of acetic acid . Such an acid is used in making royal icing , acetic acid flavouring essences , and for many other purposes . The amount of this acid in vinegars rarely exceeds six or seven per cent. , which is the strength obtained by the various vinegar processes . The salts of the acid are the acetates , and these are of considerable importance in a number of industries . Verdi gris , a basic copper acetate , is formed by allowing thin copper sheets to stand in vinegar , or when copper vessels used in jam-making or for sugar-boiling are allowed to remain dirty after use in contact with air and moisture . The verdigris forms as a greenish or greenish-blue deposit on the copper or brass vessels . This copper salt is a strong // poison and therefore ought not to be allowed to come into contact with foods . Butyric acids ( C4H802 ) . - The more important of the two butyric acids is the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and combined state in nature . Thus , wherever organic nitrogenous matter and filth are allowed to collect , bacterial fermentation takes place resulting in the formation of butyric acid . This is the case especially during moist , hot weather in dirty , untidily kept bakeries , and it leads to the presence of string mould and other diseases in bread . Butyric acid in combination with glycerin is the important volatile fat in butter . When from any cause this glyceride decomposes , the butter is said to have become rancid , because of the nauseous odour of the free acid . This same acid exists in clothing used in bakeries and left unwashed for a few days . Stale perspiration on the person smells equally disagreeably owing to the formation of butyric acid . The free acid is a thick liquid , of nauseous odour , which boils at about 325 ? F. ( 162.8 ? C. ) . The liquid mixes readily with water and confers on the mixture its unpleasant smell . Its salts are the butyrates , the ethereal salts or esters being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed acidity ' or lactic acid of food-stuffs ( CII3.CIIOH.COOH ) , is formed by the action of the many different groups of lactic ferments on carbohydrates in the presence of nitrogenous matter ; hence it exists in all carbohydrate food-stuffs and beverages , and in milk . In the free state , it is a thick , sticky , soursmelling liquid usually of a brownish colour , although when pure it is colourless . If dough has been allowed to over-ferment , and also over-prove , the characteristic odour of this acid may be observed . It is a common smell in bakeries where the place and utensils are not kept scrupulously clean . The organisms which give rise to lactic acid can be seen if milk is kept for a day or two in a F // warm place and then a drop of the watery liquid examined under a microscope . The lactic acid is spoken of as fixed acidity ' since , if distilled with steam , it is not volatile but begins to decompose , whereas acetic acid or volatile acidity ' readily passes over quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the lactates , of which the best known are the lactates of lime and zinc . CH2.COOH Suecinic acid , I . ? This is the third member of CH2.COOH the series of di-carboxylic acids . Its chief interest to the baker lies in the fact that it is formed by the action of yeast in the dough during fermentation . It is a white solid body obtained by distilling amber . The salts are the succinates . CH2.COOH Malie acid , 1 . ? Malic is an important fruit CHOH.000H acid , which exists in the free state , and also as its potassium acid salt in unripe , sharp-tasting , sweet fruits like the apple ( Latin malum , from which it takes its name ) , rowan or mountain ash berries , gooseberries , raspberries , blackberries , grapes , bananas , pineapples , etc. , where it is frequently associated with both citric and tartaric acids . The free acid is a pleasant tasting compound crystallising in white , deliquescent , nodular lumps or needles which easily dissolve in water . Its salts are the malates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of little importance . CHOII.COOH Tartaric acid , I . ? Tartaric acid occurs very CfIOH.COOH widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom both in the free state and as its acid salts ? the tartrates ? being generally associated with mal.ic and citric acids . Its chief source , however , is the deposit of argot that takes place in the fermentation of grape-juice or must . The argot is purified and decolgrised , yielding the cream of tartar of // commerce . From this the lime tartrate is obtained by precipitating the solution with a soluble lime salt . The lime tartrate is now decomposed with sulphuric acid , the calcium sulphate separated out , and the clear liquors evaporated to crystallising point . As the work is carried out in lead-lined vessels , the crystals of tartaric acid always contain traces of lead . When required for food purposes , the crystals must be purified and freed from lead . The crystals are monoclinic prisms which melt at 275 ? F. ( 135 ? C. ) . When heated strongly they decompose , forming a number of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charring stage . They possess a very strong acid taste and are some-what poisonous when taken in quantity . The acid is readily soluble in hot and cold water , yielding solutions which possess optical properties and turn the plane of polarisation to the right hand . Tartaric acid is used in calico printing and dyeing , in medicine , and in the preparation of self-raising powders and effervescing drinks . Its most important salt is the bitartrate of potassium or cream of tartar . This when pure forms hard rhombic crystals , which are only moder ately soluble in water . The best form for aeration purposes is the powder , the highest quality of which contains ninety-eight per cent . of real cream of tartar . When brought into contact with bicarbonate of soda and water , Rochelle salt and carbon dioxide are formed . The pro-portions are approximately two parts by weight of cream of tartar to one of bicarbonate of soda . // good example of a tricarboxylic body , yielding three series of salts somewhat like ordinary phosphoric acid . Citric occurs widely distributed in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts . It is prepared by processes very similar to those used for tartaric acid . The starting point is the juice from lemons , which is heated to boiling with chalk and the lime citrate decom posed , etc . The acid crystallises with one molecule of water in hard rhombic prisms . These readily dissolve in water and alcohol . The solution possesses a pleasant acid taste not so harsh as tartaric , and moreover it is not liable to give convulsions in the stomach as is tartaric when taken internally in quantity . It is therefore much more suitable for the pre paration of aerated beverages . Its salts are the citrates . THE FATS The oils or fats , which are so widely distributed through the vegetable and animal kingdoms , are organic salts composed of the base glycerin combined with a fatty acid . They are of two different classes : the volatile fats which confer flavour and smell on the substances in which they exist , as , for example , butyrin , one of the chief volatile constituents of butter ; and the fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or solids . These latter possess neither flavour nor aroma except to a very limited extent , as in the case of the three common fats that are found in all the cereal oils , lard and margarine , viz. , olein , a yellowish oily liquid , the chief constituent of olive oil ; palmitin , a white pasty solid found in palm oil and human fat , and stearin , a white hard solid forming the bulk of kitchen grease or tallow . Glycerin is a trihydric alcohol of the composition // When strongly heated it loses two molecules of water and forms acrolein , an aldehyde characterised by possessing the odour of burnt fat : // , OH ? 2 H2O=CH2 : CH.CHO Glycerin Water Acrolein A similar reaction takes place in the cooking of flesh-meats , puff-paste goods , etc. , if the temperature of the oven is too high . Acrolein has an exceedingly pungent and disagree-able odour . The more important common fats are butyrin , lauristin , myristin , olefin , palmitin , and stearin . These are com-pounds or glycerides composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gives its name to the salt ; thus butyrin , the chief volatile glyceride in butter , is composed of glycerin combined with three molecules of butyric acid ( CHCOOH ) The other triglycerides are similarly composed . If these or any other triglycerides are heated with water at a pressure , i.e. really superheated steam ? they are decom-posed into glycerin and the corresponding free fatty acid . Exampleof palmitin or tripalmitin Similar decompositions may be obtained by boiling with water and a small quantity of sulphuric acid . When any of these natural fats are boiled with caustic alkalies like caustic soda or potash , or lead hydrate , the glycerides are broken up into glycerin and the corresponding salt of the fatty acids ; these latter being known // as soaps . The ordinary hard or soda soaps are manufac tured by boiling mixtures of molten fats first with weak and then with stronger solutions of caustic soda or soda-lye . Let X stand for fatty acid , then the reaction may be expressed by the equationFrom this it will be seen that the soaps are metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pointed out that the three glycerides , olein , palmitin , and stearin , are common to both ven able and animal fats ; these occur then in the fats used for food purposes such as butter , lard , nut or vegetable butter , margarine , neutral or cotton-seed oil preparations , and others . The chief point of difference between vegetable and animal fats is that all vegetable fats contain small quantities of the solid alcohol phytosterol , while animal fats contain cholesterol . These may be detected by preparing their acetates and examining the crystals with the help of a microscope . Fats are used in breadmaking as an improver . A small quantity , two to three ozs . per fourteen lbs . of flour , improves the flavour and texture , makes the crust short , and helps to keep the crumb of the loaf moist . If too large quantities be employed , it tends to spoil both colour and flavour , whilst at the same time unduly increasing the cost . The natural fat or oil in the cereals exists for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellowish buttery appearance ; it also saves the germ from being broken up in the milling process . Wheat oil contains a small quantity of volatile fat , which readily decomposes and tends to give the flour a rancid flavour . This is one of the reasons why millers take out the germ . The chief part of wheat fat , // however , consists of the fixed non-volatile glycerides  - -  olein , palmitin , myristin , stearin , and minute quantities of others . The oil itself when refined is a dark yellowish liquid possessing the characteristic flavour and sutell of the cereal oils . The quantity in wheat varies somewhat with the different sources ; thus different wheats contain from 0.00 to 2.71 per cent. , English averaging about 1.65 . Whole meal contains from 1.52 to 1.87 per cent . ; standard meal about 2.03 , and patent flours from 0.61 to 1.48 per cent . Wheat germs contain from 6.56 to 10.31 per cent . of fat . It is scarcely necessary to point out that the mineral oils and fats are for the most part hydrocarbons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield soap and glycerin when boiled up with a caustic alkali . THE NITROGENOUS CONSTITUENTS OF WHEAT AND FLOUR These form one of the most difficult subjects of study , as , unfortunately , very little of a definite character is known of these bodies . Most of them , especially the proteids and gluten , are of unknown composition and constitution . They are of a colloidal nature , readily coagulated by heat or very dilute acid ; they combine with resins and tannins forming compounds , which are somewhat soluble in sugar solutions but easily thrown out of solution . The majority of them , in fact all except the nucleins , are composed Of the elements carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , and sulphur . The nucleins contain the five before-mentioned elements and , in addition , phosphorus and iron . The nitrogenous bodies may be divided into : ? the proteids or albuminoids , including the special proteid or mixture of proteids known as gluten , which occurs only in wheat and rye , rendering the meals from these two cereals fit for breadmaking ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuclei of plants and animals ; // and the soluble ferments or enzymes . These latter bodies will be considered in their proper place in connection with fermentation . The proteids are a group of nitrogenous compounds or mixtures of compounds which are very widely distributed in plant life , and which when absorbed and assimilated by animals , act as flesh-forming constituents . They are or form one of the proximate food principles . Their mode of formation by plants is to a very large extent a matter of conjecture . They may be produced by the combination of either carbohydrate or fatty compounds , or even the higher alcohols , with simple forms of nitrogenous compounds absorbed from the soil or air by the plants . When formed the proteids are stored away , often with the starches as in the case of the cereals , to act as rr , rve food supplies for the embryo during the early stages of germination . At the proper time , they are degraded by the action of the proteolytie enzymes into compounds of a comparatively simple constitution which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass by the processes of osmosis ( see p. 125 ) through the cell-like structure of the cotyledon into the growing embryo . The more important proteins of wheat are : ? leucosin , an albumin , two or more insoluble proteins , a globulin , gluten , and possibly proteoses , which latter are decomposition products . In the case of the wheat berry , a considerable amount of the nitrogenous content is found in the aleurone cells . These form a covering , a single cell in thickness , next to the starch-containing cells all over the berry , with the exception of the space occupied by the embryo . This helps to account for the well-known fact that the lower grades of flour , which are taken from the wheat berry near to the bran , contain rather more nitrogen than the patents . The gluten , or matter which goes to form it , is distributed throughout the whole of the endosperm probably in the spaces between the starch-containing cells . If a fine section of a wheat endosperm be stained first with iodine // solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution , the spaces between the starchcontaining cells will be of a dark pink shade , showing the presence of nitrogenous matter , and as all flours contain gluten in fairly regular proportions from the same wheats , the inference is that the pink to red colour is due to gluten . At the present time gluten is considered to be a mixture of two proteids , viz. , glutenin and gliadin . The glutenin is the constituent which gives strength and toughness to gluten ; therefore a flour that contains a gluten in which there is a high proportion of glutenin to gliadin is a strong flour capable of yielding a loaf of large volume with little or no flavour . Gliadin is vegetable gelatin , a soft sticky body which tones down the strong , harsh glutenin . ' Flours made from English wheats contain only a small quantity of gluten , but this has a relatively high proportion of gliadin ; hence the small volume of loaf obtained from English wheaten flours . Such a flour is suitable for blending with a strong spring wheaten flour , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being composed of a proteid and an amino-acid.e As far back as 1859 , Kiihne , Meissner , and others of the same school of thought showed that the proteids may be broken down by a series of steps into compounds becoming less complex at each step , and that the process closely resembles that of the hydrolysis of starch ; that dilute acids behaved very much like pepsin or papain in that the proteids were hydrolysed by these to peptones , and that the action of alkalies resembled that of trypsin , in which the proteids were degraded much lower , even to the form of amides . In more recent times , Osborne , Chittenden , and other American workers have carried out a large number of researches on the subject of the cereal proteids and their derived products . The amides as a group are soluble , crystallisable , and diffusible compounds which contain the amino group ? CH.NH2 . The most interesting of these is asparagin , // which may be obtained as large , colourless crystals contain-ing one molecule of water The nucleins are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixtures of nitrogenous bodies contain ; ng , amongst other things , phosphorised fat . Their hydrolytic products form excellent food for plants and animals . Asparain exists in asparagus sprouts and in cereal rootlets . It forms an excellent nitrogenous yeast food . Most of the proteids and their derived products have a percentage composition varying between ? Table The nucleins are much more complex than any of the proteids , and are mixtures of nitrogenous bodies containing , amongst aotehr things , phosphorised fat . Their hyrdrolytic products form excellent food for plants and animals . CHAPTER VII THE CEREALS AND THEIR COMPOSITION THE cereals or grain-producing plants belong to the great sub-class Glumaceae of the Monocotyledons . This subclass takes its name from the fact that its members have their flowers arranged inside scaly bracts or glumes , ' kinds of husks which protect these minute and delicate blooms . The sub-class is further divided into a number of natural orders or families , and each of these into a genus . The natural order of the Gramineae or grasses is characterised by possessing hollow stems , ligules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plants are : ? the giant bamboo , sugar cane , sorghum cane , the cereals including wheat , barley , maize , oats , rye , and rice , and all the meadow and wayside grasses . All of these members possess a number of points in common with one another . The chief parts of a grass plant are ( Fig. 19 ) : The tufted roots from which spring a number of hollow stems , clothed with split leaf-sheaths that are bound to the stems with a strap or ligule ; the stems divided into sections by contractions or nodes , and at the head of the stem a spindle on which is developed first the flower and finally the ear of corn ( Fig. 20 ) . Each little berry is botanically known as a caryopsis ? a dry , one-sided fruit in which the pericarp ' and testa ' are fused together into one membrane , the bran . The seed is also albuminous . The family name for the wheat plant is Triticum , and if the plants of this genus be examined they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . Again if a wheat 91 // flower be carefully observed with a strong pocket lens , the resemblance to the flowers of other grasses is very close ( Fig. 21 ) . Both the male and female parts are arranged in one flower which consists of three stamens growing from // below the base of the ovary , hence the flower is hypogenous . These stamens or male organs are built up of a long hollow membrane or filament on the top of which is the anther or hollow box containing the pollen grains . The female parts are composed of an ovary , the upper portion of which forms the pistil , this latter being developed into two feathery stigmas which collect the pollen grains to fertilise the ovary . The whole of the flower is enveloped inside the protecting scaly bracts or glumes . A wheat flower in England may // best be examined in June and July as in September the harvest begins . Classification of wheats. ? Perhaps the best recent classification of wheats is that of Professor Dr. Otto Stapf , who read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Winnipeg meeting of the British Association in 1909 . A summary of this paper is given in an article on wheats by Dr. Edward J. Russell in No. 1S of Science Progress , from which the following excerpts are taken . Wheats are divided into four groups : ( 1 ) Einkorn ( Triticum monococcum ) ; this has one grain very compact and bearded on each spikelet . It is the oldest known wheat and was recently found by Schliemann in the ruins of Troy ; also in neolithic remains in Switzerland and Hungary , and it was known to the Greeks . It is exceptionally resistant to rust , ' and is still grown in Spain , France , Switzerland , Germany , and the Balkan States . Stapf found it in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia , and points out that the only obvious change between it and Tr. oegilopioides , a wild form , is the much fewer long white hairs of the spindle as compared with their number in the wild forms . Other domestic wheats have altered in the same way . ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very distinct : ( a ) The hard or macaroni wheats ( Tr. durum ) . ( b ) Emmer ( Tr. dicoccum ) . ( c ) The English or Rivet wheats ( Tr. turgidum ) . ( d ) Polish wheats ( Tr. polonicum ) . Macaroni wheat has three or four flowers per spikelet , long bearded ears and hard pointed grains . It is grown in most of the European countries round the Mediterranean Sea . Its chief uses are for the manufacture of macaroni , and for blending with softer wheats in milling . Emmer is a bearded wheat with two grains per spikelet . It is cultivated in South Germany , Spain , Italy , // Servia , Switzerland , India , Abyssinia , Canada , and the United States of America . The English or Rivet wheat is another of the cereals of ancient Egypt . The grains are large in size and plump , and there may be as many as five per spikelet . Although of poor quality it yields good crops and is the commonest bearded wheat in England . Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . It is a mutation from Tr. durum . It gives a poor yield and is grown only in a few districts other than Italy , Spain , and Abyssinia , ( 3 ) The third group is economically of great importance , including as it does all the common ordinary wheats , bearded and otherwise , grown for breadmaking . All these are grouped under the term Tr. vulgare . The bearded varieties usually grow best in hot , dry countries , and the beardless ones in cooler climates. ( 4 ) The fourth group consists of the Spelt wheats . As in the case of Einkorn , the grains do not readily detach themselves from the chaff , and hence do not thresh out like Tr. vulgare . On the northern shores of the Black Sea there still flourishes a species , Tr. cylindricum , which seems to have been the original form of the Spelts . Many of the above classified species and varieties of wheats are cultivated in the more temperate zones of the earth , but in England the Trilicum turyidugn is perhaps the commonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mixing purposes , and the varied mutations known as Tr. vulgare , which include the red and white Fife wheats and some of the newer and stronger varieties of the improved french wheats , are also grown . The strong spring wheats are little grown in England , as the yields of grain and straw are poor compared with the turyidum variety , which is a soft one containing a low proportion of a weak gluten . This latter variety yields plenty of straw for farm use , whilst the flour from it gives bread of good flavour . Both spring and winter-sown wheats are largely grown // on the American continent . Other wheats are the Triticun2 muticum , also known as Bohemian , Italian , or white wheat , and Tr. spelta , or the ordinary thin Spelt wheat of France , South Germany , etc . Tr. durum or hard wheat is largely grown in Italy owing to the quantity of gluten it contains ? approximately 17.0 per cent. ? and its suitability for making macaroni , a favourite Italian food . The chief wheat-growing countries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , Persia , Hungary , and parts of Austria , Canada , the United States of America , Argentina , the southern or cooler portions of Australia , and New Zealand . Spring wheats of the Minnesota type yield strong flours containing much gluten of a tough , elastic kind . Russian , Indian , and Persian wheats are very hard and dry , with a fair proportion of gluten . Winter-sown wheats are generally soft with not too much gluten ; Argentina and the southern hemisphere wheats belong to this class . English wheats are about a quarter of an inch long and one-half that length in diameter . A bushel varies between 58 and 63 lbs . in weight with an average of 60 lbs . Other wheats than English vary much more in weight ; thus the heaviest and best European reaches 67 lbs . per bushel and the lightest 55 lbs . Hungarian wheats for export , by government regulation , must not fall below 60.75 lbs . The structure of the wheat berry. ? If examined externally the following points may be noticed ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top is a tuft of hairs ? the beard ; at the lower end or point of attachment to the spindle on the dorsal or outer side is a small peculiar-shaped protuberance which indicates the position of the germ beneath the bran ; on the opposite , inner , or ventral side is a deep furrow running the whole length of the grain . This is the crease which harbours a quantity of dust and micro-organisms , giving rise to difficulties in the cleaning preparatory to milling the wheat . In continuance of the examination a section is cut across // the grain , viz. a transverse section , so as to permit of an internal examination of the berry . Beginning from the outside inwards , if the eye is assisted by a strong pocketlens or reading glass , the following parts may be seen : ? the outer skins ? pericarp and testa ? forming the bran ; a single layer of rectangular cells full of minute grains of nitrogenous matter ; these are the aleurone or cereallin cells , the function of which is to supply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starch-containing cells packed full of starch granules of varying size . The spaces between the cell-walls are probably filled with the substance known as ' gluten . ' If a longitudinal section ( Figs. 22 , 24 , and 25 ) , that is one cut from the top to the bottom of the berry through the embryo and creasebe examinedthe following will be seen : // the interior of the berry consists of two uneven parts the major portion or endosperm or albumen , and the small part at one side near the bottom , which is the germ or embryo . The germ is protected from injury by a covering of light wood cells the scutellam ; lying between this and the endosperm is a row of deep rectangular cells ? the absorptive epithelial layer ( Fig. 26 ) . In these will be found the enzymes , which afterwards during germination act oil the constituents of the endosperm , converting them into foods suitable for the embryonic plant , until it is able to obtain its sustenance from the air and soil . In Fig. 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and c the pericarp ; the empty starch cells are shown at d , while at e are a few starch granules that still remain . In Fig. 25 the lower part shows the aleurone cells highly magnified . In Fig. 26 , a is the acrospire , b the plumule , c , d , and e the root-sheath , rootlet , and root-cap respectively . At f are starch granules , g are the absorptive epithelial cells , h the cotyledon , and i the scutellum . If sections be cut off other cereals , the general arrangement will be seen to conform to that of the wheat berry as above described . There are , however , sundry points of difference . For example , wheat and rye have a single row of aleurone granules , barley has usually three though occasionally only two . Wheat possesses a number of fine hairs at the top of the berry , barley has none , but in most cases the outer husk or dorsal pale is prolonged into an awn . When the cereals are ground between hard French burr-stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the endosperm or starchy matter , mixed up with hairs , bits of bran , aleurone granules , germ , epidermal cells , etc . The chemical composition of the cereals. ? The cereals contain the chief proximate principles of food-stuffs , viz. carbohydrates , fats , proteins , and mineral salts with water , but not in the proportions to form a perfect food . This is not of much importance , as they are not relied oil // alone as foods but are always eaten with other food . Bread is generally taken as bread and butter ; rice with milk ; oatmeals in various forms with both sugars and milk ; hence the deficiency in certain of these proximate principles is made up by the addition of others . As a matter of fact , the Biblical statement is absolutely true : Man does not live by bread alone . ' If wheat and other cereals are chemically examined , their composition , although generally similar , differs considerably in the quantities in which the constituents are present . But the same cereals , for example they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus two important constituents , the proteins and carbohydrates , vary enormously . Dammer in his composition Af fur-wheats as distinct from those used in feeding ? cat* ' and fowls , gives the following figures : // The amount of sugars as sucrose in wheats varies between 0.82 and 2.75 per cent . The composition of cereals other thaw wheats . The chemical constituents of the mineral salts. ? The constituents of the ash or mineral salts of wheat differ considerably with the varieties and the soils on which they are grown . The chief salts are the primary phosphates of potassium , magnesium , and calcium , there being little more than traces of other substances . The subjoined analyses of wheat and barley ash give the student an idea of their composition : The natural acidity of the wheat berry is due chiefly to the primary phosphates of the type KH2PO4 . It is // also in some measure due to the presence of organic acids , especially lactic acid , CH3 CHOH ? COOH . The germ or embryo of the wheat berry. ? The germ ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of swelling or excrescence at the lower end of the dorsal or outer side of the wheat berry . With care it may be excised from its position , brought on to flannel over a bowl of water , so arranged that the flannel is kept moist by touching the water . Given light and warmth the little embryo , which occupies about a sixtieth of the whole wheat berry , begins to grow . If examined frequently at the early stages of growth , much information may be obtained of the germ . It is somewhat triangular in shape and of a yellowish but tery appearance . The germ is rich in nitrogenous matter , fats , and mineral salts , especially phosphates of potash . Several groups of enzymes are closely associated with the germ , the object of these being to prepare the proper foods for the little plant when germination begins . CHAPTER VIII MILLING , MEALS , FLOURS , AND MALTS UNDER the heading milling ' it is intended to include not only the actual process of reducing wheat to the state of finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the cleaning and conditioning of the wheats . The cleaning consists in removing all kinds of foreign matters such as oats , barley , rye , chaff , large and small cockle , seeds , stones , string , straw , pieces of metal and other bodies . Still more is it important to wash or scour off the dust , beard , and micro-organisms , and the dirt or soil adhering especially to wheats from hot countries like India , Persia , the Malay Peninsula , etc . The conditioning softens the dry , hard , brittle wheats arid . brings them into a state suitable for milling . The usual mode of procedure in a flour mill is to weigh all grain as it comes in , pass it through a preliminary screening machine or separator ( Fig. 27 ) , and elevate it into the silos or store bins of the granary . When required , the wheat is drawn off from the bottom of the silos on to an endless belt , elevated to the top storey of the cleaning department , gradually passed from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing and stoning stage , it has reached the ground floor . The different types of wheat are cleaned separately , so that each shall receive the proper treatment in both cleansing and conditioning . The cleaning processes may be summarised somewhat as follows The first machine , a separator , consists of a series of sieves so as to remove large and small bodies from the wheat . 102 // which are carried off in a special channel . The foreign seeds , about the same size as the wheat berry , are taken out by means of cockle cylinders . These are rotating cylinders of special construction ( Figs. 28 and 29 ) . From these the wheat passes into the scourer , which is a kind of revolving drum fitted with a beater . This by its rapid revolutions causes the grains to be beaten the one against the others , and thus hairs , beard , loose husk , soil , and dust are removed . Each of the machines is arranged with an aspirating current of air to carry off dust . The wheat now reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further cleansed and wetted . The very hard wheats require a good deal of soaking , whilst the medium and soft ones need much less . During the washing , small stones about the size of the wheat berry are removed by making use of the difference in specific gravity between the heavy stones and the // comparatively light wheat . The wheats next go to the centrifugals or whizzers , where surplus moisture is removed , then down the conditioners to be further dried , and into the store bins for cleaned wheats where the conditioning is completed . In a short time the different kinds of wheats are ready for blending to make up the particular grist of the mill . Before actually passing into the break rolls it is necessary to give a dry brushing to remove loose particles and then a slight steaming . The wheat , after all this preliminary treatment , is then in a fit state to be milled . This very complete cleansing of the wheat is an absolute necessity , not only to prevent speckled and dirty flours , but also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisms . The author has shown by several researches that , in spite of all this extensive cleaning , // certain classes of lightly-baked breads are liable to disease from internal sources , especially when made from low-grade flours obtained from that portion of the wheat berry near to the bran . . The-plant actually employed in milling proper comprises break machines for tearing open the endosperm and liberating the starchy particles ' ; purifiers to separate the starchy particles from the bran , germ , and offals generally ; the reduction rolls which crush the starchy particles or semolinas into flour ; the silks or flour-dressing machines to grade and purify the flour ; the bleaching plant ; the possers for weighing and bagging the finished flour ; and the various conveyors , elevators , and aspirating plants required for carrying off dust and keeping the various machines cool . Mr. A. E. Humphries , in a paper read recently before the Association of Millers , laid down the following as the necessary factors that wheats should possess in order to be suitable for milling into present-day flours : ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread from a given weight of flour , and for producing large finetextured loaves , of good flavour , with a colour in both crust and crumb that should be bright in appearance . The first set of machines in a roller mill ( Fig. 31 ) are the break rolls . These carry out the operation of breaking up the endosperm of the berry by a succession of stages varying from four to seven . The rolls , which are made of steel and fluted , tear open the berry at its crease , so that in the first machine the central contents are set at liberty . The products of this first break , consisting of small angular pieces from the centre of the endosperm ? the semolinas ? break flour , dust , particles of husk and the remainder of the berry , are separated by adjustments in the machine , the fractions passing off in special receptacles , whilst the remnants of the berry pass into the next break machine where similar // operations are conducted , and so on through the whole series of machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the berry , until ultimately the bran is scraped almost entirely free from starchy matter . Any flour produced in the breaks is separated from the semolinas and middlings on account of the dust , mainly from the crease in the berry . The semolinas , middlings , and dunst , containing branny particles , dust , light feathery refuse or beeswing , etc. , are passed into the various purifiers so that , as far as possible , all particles , except the angular starchy pieces , are taken out . The purified throughs ' are then graded into coarse and fine , and each of these is reduced into flour separately . The reduction or grinding rolls ( Fig. 32 ) are quite smooth and set close , thus working at a pressure . The germ at this stage becomes flattened by these rolls by reason of its content of fatty matter and so can readily be removed . The flour is then dressed by passing through the silk sieves , which are usually arranged in a kind of revolving cylinder . Various grades of silk are used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls again . Where no bleaching plant is employed , the finished flour , after dressing , is weighed and packed by the power possers , and taken to the flour stores to mature . The offals are also graded , dressed , and packed by suitable machinery. , The bleaching plant used in flour mills is of two types : ? the chemical and the electrical . The chemical bleaching plant consists of the proper arrangement for producing oxides of nitrogen . These gases are conducted into a kind of enclosed trough through which the flour is passed by worm and other conveyors . A few seconds ' treatment is sufficient for the purpose , and great care is necessary to give just the exact length of time in contact with the gas , since if the flour becomes overbleached it is practically useless . The electrical method requires even more care than the chemical , for the air which has been exposed to the fiery blast ' // contains both ozone and oxides of nitrogen . With some flours even four seconds is too long . The bleaching of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturing , as well as rendering the flours a dead white . The highest grades of flour are not improved by this treatment , and therefore are rarely bleached . MEALS AND FLOIIRS Meal is the name given to the product obtained by grinding a cereal between pairs of rolls without separating // the offal from the flour . Flour , on the other hand , is the finely-dressed product in which the separation is as effective as possible . Flour so prepared is a complex mixture of chemical compounds consisting of carbohydrates , nitrogenous bodies , fats , vegetable acids , mineral salts , and water . Meals contain all the foregoing compounds , and in addition the bran which includes much more cellulose or woody fibre , fats from the germ , mineral salts , and extractive matters . Meals are usually classed as whole , wheat , germ , malted , and proprietary . For the preparation of the various meals ; specially selected wheats are necessary , and they are best ground between French burr-stones ( Fig. 33 ) , although the cattle food meals are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grit rocks around Hathersage in Derbyshire and other places . A genuine wholemeal contains the whole of the materials of the wheat berry ; frequently , however , the coarsest bran is removed . The result then is certainly a finer meal that yields a more palatable and digestible loaf , without a serious loss of the mineral salts . Wheat meals differ from the wholemeal in not containing the whole of the products of the wheat berry . They are prepared either by separating the germ and some of the offal , or by mixing together a low-grade white flour with a certain proportion of offal . These latter may often be distinguished by the insipid , flavourless bread they yield ; such a result is largely due to the fact that they are not ground from selected , suitable wheats of the English type . Germ meals are prepared in various ways , but one of the best , and well known in the trade , is made of 75 per cent . of a good , white flour mixed with 25 per cent . of cooked germ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt for the making of the bread , and passed by means of worm conveyors through a steam-heated long cylinder , which effectually cooks and sterilises the germ . This cooking aids in the keeping properties of the meal , and at the same time prevents all enzymic action . The malted and other meals are so numerous that it would be impossible to describe them all in the limited space of a small book . Excellent malted bread may be manufactured from a good grade of wheat meal thoroughly mixed with two to three ounces of a diastatic malt flour for every seven lbs . of wheat meal , the result being what is to all intents and purposes a malted meal . White flours are classified differently in different parts of the country . The following classification is a common one and will be readily understood : Fancy patents made from first break semolinas . Of these each miller has practically his own speciality , and it would be invidious to give names of a few of I12 CHEMISTRY OF BREADMAKING the more largely advertised , seeing that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best grade of flours used in making the best bread . Second patents and superfines , which go for the manufacture of medium qualities of bread . XX , used for common bread alone . Single X is a mixture of the break flour and the last scrapings from the bran . Such a flour is too woolly and dirty for breadmaking , but is largely employed in the finishing of calicoes and cotton goods generally . The subjoined table gives the chemical composition of some flours and meals : THE PROPERTIES OF FLOURS The properties of flour , and it is here intended to apply the name flour only to the silk-dressed product so as to distinguish it from the various meals , differ very largely owing to differences in the formation of grists , the mode of preparation , and the milling . The most important point is in the formation of the grist . Each miller selects the wheats from different sources so as to form a blend or grist which will yield flours suitable for his trade . The most important properties of flours are : ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colour of flour is a question of the refraction and // reflection of light . Some flours are a dead white , others a greyish white , a brownish grey , a yellowish brown , or a fine creamy yellow shade of colour with a marked bloom . The latter is the typical colour of a high grade of flour which frequently has a granular feel to the hand . The different species and varieties of wheats influence colour . Starchy and weak wheats like English , and also winter sorts , yield white flours . Highly glutinous , durum , and strong wheats generally yield yellowish to dark yellow flours . The very white or dead-white flours are generally produced by the action of bleaching . This may be brought about by exposing a dull grey-looking flour to the chemical activity of oxides of nitrogen and ozone for a few seconds ; but the dull appearance of the flour remains unaffected . The colour of several flours may be compared either by means of the well-known Pekar test or by Lovibond 's tintometer . The Pekar test is carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a piece of very smooth wood about four inches wide by twelve in length is required , together with an ivory or steel flour spatula . A small quantity of one of the flours is brought on to the plate , pressed tightly to exclude air-bubbles , brought to one end and the edge trimmed with the spatula . Another flour is treated similarly , then brought close to the first sample and the two carefully pressed and trimmed . Other samples may be dealt with in like manner . The colours are now com pared with the help of diffused daylight , and the various shades noted . The plate containing the flours is now brought obliquely into a tank of clean water , passed through the water in a continuous sweep or curve and allowed to dry in a cool , airy place . The colours are again compared , and marked differences in the shades of colour will be noticed . With a little practice in this work a student can readily compare the colours of flours . For night-work a patent Royal Daylight electric lamp should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tintometer , the shades of colour are determined separately by comparison with glasses of standard colour , the flour being pressed tightly into small boxes specially provided for determining the colours of powders . The strength of a flour is one of its most important properties , but up to the present time the various factors which govern strength are not altogether understood . W. B. Hardy , F.R.S. , has shown that the strength of a flour is partly dependent on the presence of electrolytes such as salts , which confer cohesion on the gluten . Dilute acids and alkalies all tend , to break up the gluten into fine particles ; hence electrolytes confer on glutens its mechanical properties , e.g. its power of holding water ; and these electrolytes similarly influence the water-holding power of any other colloid substances present . Some time ago , the author was able to show that ammonia-free water very readily disintegrates the gluten , but if alkaline salts are added the action is at once stopped . Distilled water partially dissolves gluten , while some is left in a semifluid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colloid bodies like moist gluten possess a sponge-like structure , and that solid particles decrease the strength of the network structure of gluten by internal friction , hence washed-out gluten is not quite the same as gluten in a dough . The gluten in some flours is strong , tough , and harsh , as in the case of spring wheats , whilst in others it is weak , soft , and rather elastic , as in the typical English wheaten flours . The former type of gluten can much more readily withstand the friction produced by the starch granules , especially when the granules are rather small , and is much more resistant than that in soft wheats . The soft , weak , and rather elastic form of gluten is one of the causes of the small loaf produced by English wheaten flours . Flavour is apparently associated with the gluten , for although the loaf is small and often of a poor , greyish colour , the flavour // is of the nutty character and excellent . Spring wheaten flour yields a large bold loaf , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing it will be seen that one of the important factors influencing strength is the quality rather than the quantity of gluten . In the section of Chap . XIII . on the nitrogenous constituents of wheat and flour it is pointed out that hot , strong alcohol dissolves out the vegetable gelatine or gliadin portion of the gluten , leaving the glutenin in a coagulated insoluble state , so that the quantity of each may be determined . If much gliadin is present it tends to make the gluten become more elastic and softer , but the relation existing between the glutenin and gliadin does not settle the question of strength . According to the Local Government Board Report of April 1911 , the strength ' of a flour is defined as the measure of the capacity of flour for producing a bold , large-volumed , well-risen loaf . Bakers use it to indicate the amount of bread which a given amount of flour is capable of yielding . The water-absorbing and retaining power of a flour , These factors , which are intimately associated with the strength ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gluten , the dryness of the flour , and the nature and condition of the starch . A strong , tough , harsh gluten is , as already stated , a good absorber , or assists in the absorption of water , but there is something over and above this . For example , many of the best , high-milled , Austrian flours possess great absorbing and retaining powers . This is not due to the harsh character of the gluten since Austrian flours possess quite a different character , yet their absorbing power is greater than that milled from a spring wheat . This is due to one of those inherent properties of such a flour which is not yet fully understood . There is a well-known axiom amongst bakers and millers that a strong flour can not be milled from a weak wheat . ' What this implies is certainly not completely understood . // The dryness of a flour has an important bearing on this point . As flours are received into the bakery they contain from 11 to 14 per cent . of moisture . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water than it will nor retain it , ' is quite true , yet if the flour be stored for a few weeks in a dry , warm atmosphere , its absorbing and retaining powers are considerably increased . The explanation of this is that the excess of moisture is more than the flour can carry , or in other words , the quantity of water in excess of the natural moisture of the flour has been driven off . This maturing of the constituents of the flour materially assists its water-retaining power . The blending of the right flours together also acts in the same direction . It would be both useful and interesting to a baker regularly to weigh his flours when they arrive at the bakery , and also after storing for a week or two . In this way important and valuable information regarding the various marks ' of flour would be obtained . A writer on this subject in the early years of the nineteenth century states that the better and older the flour , when properly stored , the more water it absorbs and retains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its weight of water , and the worst flour one-half ; whilst the loss in baking should only be one-tenth . ' Stability. ? Closely connected with the strength , waterabsorbing , and retaining power of a flour is its stability . Flours yielding doughs that fall away quickly and drop or collapse are by no means stable . This factor , stability , is evidently dependent partly on the gluten and partly on the material present which can be used as yeast food . Where there is much of this latter the yeast will be able to generate large volumes of carbon dioxide gas ; if now the gluten is strong , tough , and elastic , so that the gas may be retained and diffused throughout the dough , there will be little fear of a falling away and collapse . Although much work has been done in this direction , very much more is required to enable the // miller and baker to come to definite conclusions on the subject of strength and other factors connected with it . There is yet another point bearing on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flours are not suitably stored , it has been found that the organic acidity increases . As this change progresses , the gluten and other flour constituents are degraded and the flours weakened and deteriorated , which very materially affects the baking properties of such flours . The purity of a flour , that is , its freedom from adulterants of all kinds , is nowadays almost beyond suspicion . Very rarely indeed are flours found to contain any kind of foreign starch or other impurity . A few years ago some French milled flour , containing a fair percentage of talc or French chalk , was shipped from Marseilles to various ports in England , and gave rise to a mild scare for a few days . This flour belonged to the single X grade , and was to be used for making finish , size , and dextrins for the calicoprinting industry . Apart from similar exceptional instances , flours to all intents and purposes are practically pure ; in fact , never since the roller-milling industry became general have our flours been so white , clean , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confectionery purposes flours are classed as weak , medium , and strong . In quick-bread processes , strong flours are blended with weak or medium ones , so as to tone down the undesirable properties of the first-named group of flours ; otherwise ungainly , flavourless bread is the result . Strong flours may be used alone in the setting of sponges and ferments where the process is to be a long one , as time is required to mellow and break down the strong , In the confectionery department , strong flours are necessary in the manufacture of nearly all varieties of buns , scones , and gateaux , for puff-paste of all kinds , tea , girdle , and barm cakes , etc . Medium flours are more suitable for intermediate types of smalls , sponge goods , cheap Madeira // cakes , and the like . Soft flours are employed for the best classes of goods of all kinds , especially slab cakes , Christmas , Easter , Russian , tennis and similar cakes , short paste , short sweet paste , open and notched tarts , shortbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other highclass goods . MALTING , MALT FLOUR , AND EXTRACTS In the early nineties , malt extracts were introduced into the bakery trade by the French firm , Leconte et Cie , probably on account of the more general use of American spring wheat flours in the baking industry . When harms were commonly used the baker was obliged to know something of malt , but in these days of progress it is necessary for him to understand also the process of malting and the nature of malt products . Barley , ripe and mature , sound and sweet , is the startingpoint in malting . After being thoroughly cleaned by dry processes , similar to those employed in preparing wheat for milling , it is steeped in cold , hard water at temperatures about 52 ? F. for 54 to 72 hours , according to the condition of the barley . When steeping is complete , the softened grain is allowed , o drain , after which it is thrown into long shallow heaps to become slightly heated so as to start germination . Phe couch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rain spread out on the growing-floor to form the first piece . ' It is turned several times to aerate and equalise ) oth moisture and temperature . During the growing the parley is worked down the length of the floor so as to enable other pieces to be worked in regular succession lown the floors . Many changes take place in the grain as t slowly germinates . The rootlets are developed to about vice the length of the barleycorn ; the plumule or acro ; pire gradually pushes its way up the back of the corn ) eneath the pale or chaff which acts as a protection during ; he twelve or more turnings . At the same time , the various nzymes ( p. 125 ) , which exist in minute quantities in the // cells adjacent to the endosperm , are developed and work their way upwards towards the opposite end of the corn , opening up and modifying the interior contents of the endosperm , or in other words converting it into malt . For bakery purposes the acrospire should be grown fully up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Growing or flooring usually occupies eight or nine days , after which the green malt ' is thoroughly withered to check further growth and dissipate some of the excess moisture of the grain . The green malt is now loaded on to the kiln , where it is slowly and completely dried . If any of the operations are rushed , the malt suffers in a marked way and becomes unfitted for use . Kilning requires special care , and in no case is the temperature raised more than about twenty-five to thirty degrees in twenty-four hours , until all the moisture has been expelled . When this stage is reached the draughts of the kiln are closed to prevent the introduc-tion of fresh air , and the temperature is raised to the curing point in order to render the malt friable and to give it the peculiar empyreumatic flavour and aroma . The cured malt is thrown off the kiln , heaped up , allowed to cool , passed through the cleaning machinery to take off the dried rootlets or culms , and then stored for several weeks to mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or diastatic malt flour is prepared by crushing the malt between fluted rolls and passing it through sieves to take out the husky or cellulose matter . The malt being very dry , the husk breaks up into fine and coarse particles , the latter only can be removed by the sieves , hence malt flour always possesses a brownish grey shade of colour . Malt flour freshly prepared is a very hygroscopic substance , which rapidly absorbs moisture from the air and soon loses its character-istic flavour and smell . It ought to be sent out in air-tight drums instead of in the canvas bags used at present . Brewers , who are aware of these facts , are careful to keep whole malt in dry , warm stores until required for use , and only // crush the malt a few hours before brewing. , Bakers who stock malt flour in any quantity would be wise to follow the example of the brewers in this way , as they would then preserve the fine flavour of the malt and run less risk of the excess acidity which is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malt extracts and diastase pastes. ? The principal point of difference between these substances is that in the malt extracts the diastase has been already used to prepare the extracts and is therefore present only in small proportions and weakened ; whereas in diastase paste it is fresh , vigorous , and active . The extracts are prepared by hot-water mashing , whilst the pastes are cold-water extractives . In the manufacture of malt extracts the malt is crushed between fluted rolls and then mixed with water of such a temperature that the resultant temperature of the mixture will be about 145 ? F. , which is the point of maximum activity for diastase . Every quarter of malt ( 336 lbs. ) requires about eleven to twelve hundred pounds weight of water . The mixture , which has a consistency of thin porridge , is allowed to stand in the mash-tub for about three hours so as to ensure the conversion of the starch of the malt into maltose and dextrins , and to modify suitably the nitrogenous bodies . This wort ' or sugar solution is run off into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are washed out by sparging . After settling for a short time the wort is passed through a filter press , and from this into another small settler adjoining the vacuum pan . From this , after some time , the thin liquors pass by suction into the pan and are boiled down to the proper consistency at a reduced pressure such that the temperature is between 132 ? - 135 ? F. The thick treacly syrup is now ready to be run off into the drums in which it is sent out into commerce . The value of a malt extract depends on the quantities of malt sugar or maltose , soluble nitrogenous compounds and mineral salts present . Its chief value lies in its stimulative effect on the yeast in fermentation. // Diastase pastes , as previously stated , are cold-water extracts of malt . The malt is crushed and made into a thin porridge with cool water , so that the temperature of the mixture is about 70 ? F. This mash is allowed to stand in the mash-tub for five hours , so that as much soluble matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the liquor is run off , and both this and the grains passed through a filter-press . The liquors are settled and then boiled down in the vacuum pans as described in the preparation of malt extracts . Some slight modifications are necessary so that different strengths of diastase paste may be obtained . Cheap , low-grade pastes are prepared from inferior bar-leys and malts ; whilst for the highest grade only the best barleys , English and foreign , after careful malting , can be employed . Diastase pastes depend for their value not only on the carbohydrates and soluble nitrogenous constituents , but on the quantity and activity of the diastatic enzymes . Other soluble ferments or enzymes are present , but they are of less importance than the diastase . Yet even these should not be overlooked as they have considerable effect on the gluten and possibly other substances , resulting altogether in shortening the time in which the dough is ready for the oven . Diastase can only act on gelatinised or soluble starch , therefore the wheaten starch granules are unaffected by it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at once acted upon and converted . Wheaten starch granules in presence of moisture burst , or are said to be gelatinised at about 170 ? F. Diastase action is stopped in the moist state at 176 ? F. , so that it will be seen there is little opportunity for diastatic action 8 after the dough is in the oven . It is enougn , however , to have a marked effect on the finished loaf . Of the three malt products described , diastase pastes are the best and most useful . The quantities employed vary from a half to a pound and a half per sack of flour . // These quantities , however , may be increased with advantage to from two to three pounds per sack , especially with strong flours and short processes , without causing extra difficulties in manipulation . The author found that almost all grades of bread were very much improved by using rather higher proportions . Practically all the points of a loaf were much enhanced . The only question to be considered is the extra cost to the baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diastase pastes may be summed up as follows : Externally , the bloom , crust , volume , and the general appearance of a loaf are all improved . Internally , the flavour ? a kind of sweetness is imparted ? the appearance of the crumb , and the moisture after several days ' keeping , are all benefited by diastase pastes . If examined for food value , a malted loaf will be found to possess many heat-calories more than the ordinary unmalted bread ; further , such bread is much more readily digested . Malt flour , which is more easily handled , can not be introduced in larger quantities than about a pound to a pound and a half per sack without spoiling both the external appearance and the crumb of a loaf . All three classes of malt products increase the volume and give more spring to the loaf in the oven . A high-class , friable malt will yield about 67 per cent . of extract ; or , in other words , a quarter of malt weighing three hundredweights should give two hundredweights of extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flour , feeds the yeast , and so quickens fermentation . In the long bread processes it is better to use a diastase paste in the earlier stages of fermentation and a malt extract in the later stages . With strong harsh flours both are invaluable , as they mellow and tone down the gluten . Weak flours , which contain a fair proportion of food for the yeast , do not require these extraneous aids , and , moreMILLING , // over , such flours will only be rendered weaker by them . If they are used the quantity should not exceed four ounces per sack of flour . The fluid malt products must be kept in cool places , otherwise they readily ferment , lose their diastatic power and maltose , and gradually increase in acidity until they become sour . The subjoined analytical results show the difference in chemical composition of these substances . CHAPTER IX FERMENTS , YEASTS , MOULDS , BACTERIA UNTIL just recently ferments have been divided into the soluble or unorganised ferments or enzymes , and the organised ones including yeasts , moulds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published recent research , can no longer be held , because it has been clearly demonstrated that the so-called organised ferments can only bring about fermentation by means of the enzymes contained within the cell-walls . To understand the subject thoroughly , it is necessary to possess a knowledge of the behaviour of crystalline and colloidal substances in regard to vegetable membranes such as the cell-walls , which enclose the interior contents of any of the micro-organisms ( organised ferments ) . As mentioned in Chap . VI . it is only the crystalline bodies like sugars , amides , and mineral salts that are soluble in water , which possess the power of readily passing through vegetable membranes . The process is known as osmosis , and only soluble , crystalline compounds can pass into the interior of the cell ( endosmosis ) , or pass out from the cell ( exosmosis ) . The foods , then , for the organised ferments must be of this character ; thus the natural sugars of wheat and flour can so pass into the yeast in dough-making and bring about the phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the proteids possess a colloidal structure and therefore can not undergo osmosis . This accounts for the yeast being unable to attack and break up the starch of the flour in bread-making . The very intense colloid , starch , must first be gelatinised to form starch paste ( scalded flour ) , then hydrolysed by means of the 126 // enzyme diastase into maltose ( malt sugar ) , dextrins , and other bodies . This maltose is soluble , crystalline , and dif fusible . It readily undergoes endosmosis , passing into the in terior of the yeast-cell where it is acted upon by the enzymes and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide , the latter doing the work of aeration or causing the dough to rise . The organised ferments or micro-organisms belong to the great sub-kingdom known as the Cryptogamia . The members of this division of plants do not reproduce by the flowering process , hence the name , which means literally hidden marriage . ' The cryptogams , comprising all non ? flowering plants , are divided into three chief sections and seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class I. , need be considered here . The thallous plants are devoid of all the parts of a true plant , viz. leaves , stems , roots , and vascular bundles . Class I. of the thal lous plants includes the microscopic fungi , i.e. the micro-organisms or organised ferments . These are devoid also of the green or brown colouring matter of plants , the chlorophyll granules . The micro-organisms for purposes of study may be divided into the branching fungi and the fission fungi or bacteria . The former , designated the Eumycetes , include moulds , mucors , mildews ( oidium ) , yeasts , torula , and mycoderms ; whilst the latter group , comprising the whole of the bacteria , is known as the Schizomycetes . Bacteria are the smallest of all known living things . They are unicellular , the cell-wall being composed of fungi-cellulose ? a form insoluble in Schweitzer 's 1 reagent ? which encloses a mass of fluid protoplasm . Three shapes of bacteria are recognised : Spherical or billiard-ball shape ? e.g. a coccus . Rod or . ruler-shaped ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? e.g. a spirillum . Under favourable circumstances all bacteria reproduce by fission or splitting off , the two parts either separating , // or hanging together in chains or clusters . The spherical forms are the only bacteria capable of splitting up in more than one direction . A considerable number form spores inside the parent cell ? endogenous spores ? which possess great refractive properties and hence they glisten brightly when viewed under a high-power microscope . Bacilli frequently spore , but cocci forms do so only very rarely . Another mode of reproduction is by the continuous development of the rod lengths , after which fission ensues . Chemically , bacteria are composed of a covering or cellwall of fungi cellulose and internally of an aqueous solution of a very complex body or mixture of compounds known as protoplasm ' or plasma . ' According to Von Mohl ( 1844 ) protoplasm is a viscous , tough , elastic , transparent , and frequently granular , highly active nitrogenous body built up of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , and sulphur . It is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as can be ascertained , the ultimate basis or unit of all organic life ; it was defined by the late Professor T. H. Huxley , F.R.S. , as the physical basis of life . ' Cellulose , on the other hand , is what is termed a carbohydrate containing carbon and the elements of water . It is closely related to cotton and other fibres , paper and similar substances , but in a number of cases the cell-wall contains very little true cellulose . Many of the groups of bacteria either contain or generate a colouring matter , the pigment Bacterio-purpurin . They exist very frequently in the many food-stuffs and hence are of considerable interest to every one taking part in the manufacture of our daily food . Some groups possess the power of locomotion , as may be seen by carefully observing a slide made from ahnost any distillery yeast , when as little points of light they may be seen moving rapidly across the field of view . This motion of the Bacteria is brought about by means of extremely fine hairs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // flagella that they can only be detected when suitably stained . The cocci or spherical forms as a rule are non-mobile . Irregular forms occur commonly in old cultures , and render it difficult* to recognise the different bacteria by appearance alone . This irregularity is caused by the deterioration of the cells : such are the involution forms . In size bacteria vary enormously , but all are microscopic . Those occurring in the food-stuffs range between 0.15 lc and 6 p , in diameter . The symbol p ( the Greek letter mu ' ) , used as the standard of measurement in the study of micro-organisms , is a thousandth ( , 0 , , 0 ) of a millimetre and is known as a micron . As the number of bacteria in nature is practically infinite , it is necessary for the purposes of study to have some kind of classification other than their shape or form , which is not by any means an unchanging factor . A simple and useful classification is that based on the bacterial action or products formed by their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typhosus , the Comma bacillus , etc. ( 2 ) The Septic or putrefactive ? Example , B. subtilis , termo , proteus groups , etc. ( 3 ) The Zymogenic or fermentative ? Example , Acetic , Butyric , Lactic , and other acid-forming groups , B. Viscosus , etc. ( 4 ) The Chromogenic or pigment-forming ? Example , B. Violaceus , which causes blue watery milk , B. micrococcus , B. prodigiosus , etc . The members of these various groups all occur in our ordinary food supplies . For example , water and milk are carriers of many forms of disease-producing bacteria , as witness the cholera epidemic in Hamburg nearly twenty years ago . This was traced to the town 's water-supply taken from the River Elbe conFERMENTS , // taminated by an encampment of gipsies on its banks . The outbreak of typhoid in the city of Lincoln quite recently was also traced to the water supply . Numerous cases of epidemics may likewise be traced to a contaminated milk supply . Putrefactive bacteria occur wherever there is filth in warm moist places , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty state . The Zymogenic bacteria are always present in raw cereal and other foods , in which they set up acid fermentation . Suitable media or foods for bacterial growth. ? The most suitable nitrogenous foods are soluble proteid degradation products as peptones , amides , amino-compounds and other organic bodies , ammonium salts and nitrates of other bases , whilst in some few cases bacteria are capable of extracting their nitrogen from the air . The more available sources of carbon are : carbohydrates generally , glycerine , fatty acids and the alkaline salts of many vegetable acids such as malic , tartaric , citric , and other organic acids . The mineral foods requisite include the bases : ? potash , soda , lime , magnesia , and iron , combined with phosphoric , sulphuric , silicic , and hydrochloric acids . Of all these combinations the phosphates are necessary in quantity ; of the remainder scarcely more than traces are required , but all must be in a dilute aqueous solution . Bacteria are either aerobic , anaerobic , or transition forms . Aerobic bacteria are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ; anaerobic groups flourish in the absence of air and also of light . The latter are among the organisms of the septic tank in sewage purification . The transition forms develop during one portion of their exist ence in air , and during another portion in the absence of air . Acids as a rule act injuriously , and either kill or check the development of bacteria . B. typhosus , the organism which is the cause of enteric or typhoid fever , is an exception to thissince it is capable of converting acid into alkaline // media . On the other hand , alkalies and alkaline compounds in weak solution act as stimulants to many bacterial groups . Light has a similar action to that of acids , and has a powerful effect in killing or checking bacteria , especially the pathogenic varieties . The members of the Schizomycetes group of organisms require a much higher temperature for their well-being and to enable them to carry on their life functions , than do the members of the Rumycetes . These latter can flourish at temperatures nearly down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the temperature is much below 50 ? F. ; hence if milk and such other fluids as sugar syrups , preserves , etc. , are kept cool , they will remain fit for consumption for considerable periods . Most of the bakery bacteria develop between 60 ? and 85 ? F. Many of the pathogenic germs thrive exceedingly well about blood-heat , 98.4 ? F. The temperatures suitable for spore formation vary considerably with the different species , and moreover , many bacteria require a plentiful supply of oxygen during the sporulation period . Electricity and pressure apparently affect the Schizomycetes only very slightly , if at all . A great variety of products is formed during the life action of these organisms . Amongst them are hydrogen , nitrogen , carbonic acid , marsh gas , sulphuretted hydrogen , arsine , alcohols , acids , alkalies , and such deadly nitrogenous bases as the ptomaines . The processes by which these products are formed vary greatly ; some are the result of fermentation and others of hydrolytic reactions , whilst some are re-combination bodies . In order to distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) The most suitable media or food supplies . ( b ) The stages of development and appearance at each stage . ( c ) The products of decomposition . ( d ) Their behaviour towards free oxygen . // ( e ) The modes and rapidity of multiplication . ( f ) The influence of light and temperature . ( q ) The action of antiseptics and other re-agents. ( h ) Their motility or non-motility . Bacteria , when grown on the surface of fluid media , frequently become united , forming a tough gelatinous mass . In this , the outer mucilaginous coatings of the organisms become much swollen and ultimately fuse together , the bacteria being retained in the mass in quite a regular manner . Such a condition is known as a Zooglcea or the Zoogleeal state . All the bacteria found in a bakery must be looked upon as harmful and disease-producing , and of all none are so dangerous as the septic or filth groups . Every measure should be adopted to keep them in check , otherwise serious consequences may ensue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep every part of the bakehouse scrupulously clean . Plenty of boiling water or steam in all cracks or other places where organisms may be harboured will , under ordinary circumstances , be effectual . In the summer time , or when there is a damp moist heat , the boiling water may be supplemented by the addition of an antiseptic such as bisulphite of lime , or Lustril ' which also acts as a cleansing agent . These remedies may be still further improved by using a good system of ventilation . Let all parts of the bakery as far as possible be light and airy . For additional information on this subject the following books may be consulted : Bacteria , by Conn ; Our Secret Friends and Foes , by Professor Percy Frankland , F.R.S . ; and the works of Pasteur , Schutzenberger , Dr. Sims Woodhead , Professor Franz Lafar , and other writers . THE HYPHOMYCETES Hyphomycetes is the name given to a very numerous group of somewhat highly organised fungi of a parasitic character that infect and attack both living and dead bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oidium , moulds , and mucors ; the first-named are comparatively simple , while the last group are highly complex . In each of these groups are smaller groups or orders , and these again are subdivided into genera , species , and varieties . One interesting order , the Mucedines , containing the genus Peronospora , which genus includes the rusts , smuts , brands , and mildews that attack most grain-bearing plants , is perhaps the best known . The mycelial or fine hair-like threads are branching , thus enabling the members of the Peronospora genus to develop and penetrate plants and other food sources in all directions . The spores are of two kinds , the one carried on the tips of the mycelial threads and the other kind , which are much larger and globular in form , borne on the creeping mycelium . The botanical name for these microscopic plants comes from a Greek word meaning mildew ; thus the Erysiphe and Oidium groups are plants exceedingly troublesome to the farmer , owing to their attacks on such of his crops as the cereals , roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moulds , also a numerous group and more highly developed than the oidium . Many of the members possess the power of inducing fermentation , owing to the enzymes which they secrete , but from this point of view they are unimportant . The containing cell-wall of the mycelial threads is of fungicellulose which yields no coloration with iodine solution ; the protoplasm that fills the cells is free from nuclei , and contains neither chlorophyll nor starch granules . The growth takes place by elongation of the cells forming the hyphae , which latter are subdivided by transverse diaphragms of cellulose known as septa . The whole of the mycelium , aerial hyphae or spore-bearing organs and conidia give rise from a single spore to aggregations botanioally designated as a thallus . ' Moulds can flourish on very concentrated media that would readily check the development of yeasts and bacteria ; for example , preserves made with to little sugar are very // liable to ferment and suffer attacks from the moulds . Some of them can grow in alkaline solutions , most in neutral foods , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they require only minute traces of free oxygen , the absence of which induces an alternation of generation or polymorphism . The ordinary foods containing carbohydrates , mineral salts as in the ash of cereals , and nitrogen from soluble albuminous compounds , peptones , amides , amino acids , ammonium salts , and even from nitrates , are suitable for moulds . Various workers in the study of mycology have shown that differences in food supply cause differences in the chemical composition of moulds . The modes of reproduction : ( a ) One of the simplest is by a continuous budding and dividing off ? a process closely allied to the budding of yeasts and their fission . The members of the genus Oidium reproduce in this way , in fact it is commonly spoken of as the oidium formation . ( b ) By the formation of naked spores or conidia at the ends of the aerial hyphae or conidia bearers . The Penicillium group , the Earotiums and subdivisions of these as the Aspergilli , the Dematiums , the Cladosporia and Botrytis groups , are all excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mucors , which are more highly organised than the moulds but which in many ways they very much resemble , reproduce in two ways : ( c ) by the formation of spores in a special receptacle or sporangium , ' the walls of which burst when the spores are ripe and allow the contents to escape and be dispersed in all directions . In some of the mucors these spores are furnished with cilia or hair-like appendages which greatly assist in their distribution . The abovementioned three modes of reproduction are recognised as vegetative or asexual processes . The mucors , however , can also reproduce ( d ) by sexual conjugation . Two threads or hyphae join one another ( copulation ) and give rise to a large spore or fruit-like body // known as a zygospore , ' from which mycelial threads grow at a later period after the zygospore has dropped from the parent mycelium . The spores produced by any of the foregoing methods are very resistant to desiccation or drying and to large variations of temperature . They frequently remain dry for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once begin to develop . All the three groups are well represented by their various members on our foods or any substances that contain the necessary food principles . The four commonest are : ? the ordinary blue mould ? Penicillium glaucum ( Fig. 34 ) , the sage-green mould ? Aspergillus glaucus , Mucor mucedo , and the Oidium lactis . These induce in our food supplies acidity , decomposition , and mouldy or musty smells . Damp clothing under similar conditions also becomes musty and unpleasant-smelling . YEASTS AND BARMS The yeasts or Mycomycetes are the botanical names given to a group of saprophytic fungi ? so-called because // they live on prepared foods ? which play a very important part in all the fermentation industries , including baking , brewing , and the manufacture of wines and spirits . The yeast plant ( Fig. 35 ) consists of a single cell , round or oval in shape , ranging from five to eleven microns in diameter with an average of between seven and eight , or from four- to three-thousandths of an inch in diameter . This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn exactly an inch in length , then from three to four thousand of these minute organisms could be placed on such a line . Each cell is an individual plant surrounded by a thin transparent dual cell-wall of cellulose and filled internally with protoplasm . If a cell-wall be ruptured by pressing // with a cover-glass or knife blade , the plasma can be readily stained with a weak solution of methylene blue . Live protoplasm resists staining in a high degree , but the dead mass rapidly absorbs this dye . Use is made of this reaction to detect the presence of dead cells in the yeast employed by the baker . A slide of the yeast is made in the usual way , carefully examined by the aid of a compound microscope , then a small drop of the dye solution is brought to the edge of the cover-glass . In a short time the coloured liquid becomes dispersed through the cells by the process of capillarity . This dye has a toxic effect on the yeast cells , so that the examination for dead and weak cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Most yeast cells ( Fig. 36 ) develop vacuoles , and inside of these a nucleus containing that very complex mixture of compounds , the nucleins . The nucleus is a minute rounded body which appears to control the activities of a cell in a manner not yet fully understood . The young and vigorous cells are filled with a foamy , highly refractive form of protoplasm , whilst old cells contain dull-looking , granular protoplasm which readily separates from the cell wall . Within recent years , varieties of Saccharomycetes have been discovered that possess the power of forming true hyphae , the slender threads of which do not interlace like those of moulds , hence the yeasts are less complex than the // Hyphomycetes . These threads must not be confused with the film forms or pseudo-mycelia of yeasts obtained when the latter is grown on the surface of a liquid in the presence of air . Under normal conditions the yeasts reproduce by the process of gemmation or budding . The bud is primarily formed inside the cell itself ; the cell-wall is probably weakened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to push its way through , after which it rapidly develops . Janssens has shown that both in gemmation and sporulation there is first a division of the nucleus , followed by that of the protoplasm . The bud thus formed is partially separated from the parent cell by a cellulosic diaphragm through which the food supply to the young cell passes . When the bud has become fully developed it generally separates itself , but occasionally it adheres , giving rise to a chain of yeast cells ? the strepto-formation ? which often happens in the case of bakery yeasts , or clusters ? the staphylo-form . Some yeasts also reproduce by an abnormal or starvation process known as sporulation ( Fig. 37 ) . This may be brought about in the laboratory by growing yeasts // in sterile water on a gypsum block or on a sterilised slice of potato . The spores formed in this way are highly resistant to adverse circumstances , giving the yeast a chance to tide over periods of stress ; for example , in the wine industry during the greater part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in this state in the ground , withstanding the cold and wet of the winter and spring ; later the dry winds raise clouds of dust and so carry the yeast spores into the air to settle on the newly-formed grapes . This statement is not a fanciful one , but a truth backed up by the splendid researches of the late Professor E. C. Hansen of Copenhagen and the late Professor Louis Pasteur of Paris . The spores are enclosed within the sac or mother-cell , hence they obtain the name ascospores . Hansen made use of sporulation to differentiate true yeasts from all others . There are large numbers of other organisms which closely resemble the yeasts , as , for example , the torula , organisms taking the form of groups of minute , spherical , yeast-like cells . These occur abundantly in all places where sugars , worts , and musts are prepared , and generally are the cause of disease . The Saccharomyces apiculatus is a lemonshaped yeast which exists in the bloom on fruits ; S. niger , S. rosaceus , and S. albus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to these many other varieties exist , but as none of them sporulate they can not be regarded as true yeasts . Sporulation may take place between the temperatures 34 ? and 98 ? F. The film formation previously mentioned is most successful between 46 ? and 51 ? F. Suitable media for yeasts. ? Yeasts can take the carbon they require from the sugars and other carbohydrates , but the solutions should not exceed 15 per cent . strength . The nitrogen is taken chiefly from organic sources as the peptones , amides , amino compounds and others , whilst ammonium compounds , with the exception of the nitrates , are also available . The mineral salts required can be // ascertained on reference to an analysis of the ash . The following figures are those of Mitscherlich Nitrous acid and all of its compounds , the nitrites , which are soluble in water or sugar solution , act as direct poisons to yeasts . Nitrates and albumenoid ammonia cause rapid weakening and deterioration , especially in the absence of free oxygen . Air or free oxygen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the study of yeasts , viz. , Hansen , Lintner , Naegeli , and Pasteur , agree that a small quantity of free oxygen with 12 per cent . strength of sugar solutions , are the best mixtures for a vigorous fermentation with maximum growth and multiplication of yeast cells . With excess air there is a greater reproduction of cells , but less fermentation work is carried out . A trace of acidity , especially that due to organic and phosphoric acids , assists the yeast cells , and also somewhat protects them from bacterial competition . Light , except bright sunlight , electricity and pressure appear to exert but little influence on yeasts . During the fermentation of liquids as distinct from doughs , three different periods may be observed :  - -  (1) The period of rest , during which there is an absorption of oxygen and a development of the vegetative functions . ( 2 ) The period of activity , during which the sugars are broken down or hydrolysed , and then fermented to alcohols and carbon dioxide , with the production of new yeast cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yeast is carried to the surface of the fermented liquid . The classification of yeasts and fermentation. ? Yeasts // are classified as the culture yeasts and the wild or diseaseproducing ones . The culture yeasts are those employed in the bakery , brewery , distillery , and other fermentation industries . They may be distinguished from the wild yeasts by the length of time required in sporulation , by the large size of the dull-looking spores , and by the less highly refractive nature of the aqueous protoplasm of the spores . The wild yeasts are abundant in the vegetable kingdom , on the skins of the fruits , and in the atmosphere generally , during the summer and autumn . The spores of these yeasts are small and more highly refractive than those of the culture yeasts . Some of the apparatus used in connection with pure yeast culture is illustrated in Fig. 38 . Yeasts may be distinguished from one another as follows : ( 1 ) By shape and appearance ; yet the shape of a cell is dependent on the culture medium , the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culture employed , and on the presence or absence of air . ( 2 ) By differences in the mode of culture ; thus colonies of yeasts in wort-gelatine are , in many cases , for the first few days , perfect spheres , but afterwards they become fringed . ( 3 ) By differences in fermentation , in the fermentation products and in their behaviour towards media . ( 4 ) By differences in the time and methods of sporulation and film-forming . A very large number of different species and varieties of yeasts have been isolated , their properties , characteristics , and other factors studied , but up to the present no satisfactory classification has been drawn up . For the purposes of our own industry they may very well be divided into the top fermentation yeasts and the bottom fermentation yeasts of the culture group . Both belong to the same genus , Sacc/aaromyces Cerevisiae , but it has been found impossible to transform the one variety into the other . The bottom yeasts vary considerably in size and appearance , in their behaviour towards worts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ferment worts best at low temperatures , viz. , between 38 ? and 52 ? F. Their chief use is in the fermentation of decoction worts brewed for the preparation of lager beers . Such temperatures are much too low for the yeasts to be of any great use in bakery processes . The top yeasts are therefore the only ones suitable for general bakehouse work . This group belongs to Saceharo myces Cerevisiae I. The word Saccharomyces ' comes from two foreign words , the first part referring to sugar or // saccharine bodies , and the latter part to the fungus which ferments the sugar solutions . The word Cerevisiae ' is derived from Ceres , ' the goddess of corn and wine , here referring to the sources of the sugars . A strong , healthy top yeast should possess the following characteristics : Uniformity of shape and size , sharpness of the cell-wall outline , presence of one or two vacuoles with the nucleus not too distinct , and the absence of foreign matters and bacteria . The name top yeast comes from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fermenting liquid ; the bottom yeasts , on the other hand , sink to the bottom of the containing fermenting vessel . Of the top yeasts , three kinds from different industries are employed in baking , viz. , vinegar , brewery , and distillery yeasts . Each of these has its own particular influence on the finished loaf . The vinegar yeasts always carry with them not only the aroma of vinegar but also some of the acetic and other bacteria with which they are associated . In colour , general appearance and fracture , they are satisfactory , but as regards flavour and speed of work , vinegar yeasts do not give the best of results . Brewery yeasts carry with them their origin . The hop flavour and aroma is very persistent , even after repeated washings . The colour is much darker than that of distillery yeast , and influences the bread by rendering the crumb darker and dulling the bloom . Further , English brewery yeasts are accustomed to ferment at temperatures varying between 57 ? and 75 ? F. and at a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is smaller in volume , darker in colour , faintly bitter in flavour , and with a somewhat dull bloom compared with a loaf from a good distillery yeast , but it is rarely sour . Distillery yeasts are generally more irregular in shape and size than brewery yeasts , lighter in colour , possess a pleasant but different aroma , and are accustomed to rapid fermentaFERMENTS , // tion at high temperatures ; they are thus in almost every way the typical yeast for the baker . The chief drawbacks to the British distillery yeasts are that they contain too high a percentage of dead cells and far too many bacteria , whilst many of them are much too variable in their characteristics and properties . These faults are mainly due to the fact that spirit is the primary object in the distillery , and yeast is only a by-product . Again , far too large a proportion of raw grain to malt is employed , thus depriving the yeast of its proper nutritious food supply . Often the production of a somewhat inferior yeast is possibly due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of our large distilleries . The advantages of a good type of distiller 's yeast may be summed up as follows : It is the best all-round type of yeast to use because it works evenly and is quick , and gives good colour , flavour , bloom , texture , and volume ; whilst the two chief disadvantages are that it is rather more costly and , with careless working , there is the risk of acidity and loss of flavour . The culture of yeast for bakery use. ? Yeast for the food industries is either grown in bulk for the yield of yeast itself , or it is a kind of by-product in the production of spirit ? chiefly whisky . Abroad , one large factory produces over two hundred tons of yeast ( Fig. 39 ) per week as its chief product , the spirit being of secondary consideration . The writer has only heard of one British firm , with works near Derby , which devotes itself to yeast manufacture as its main product . British distilleries 9 produce spirit , while the yeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete with the Continental product with any degree of real success . Moreover , British brewery yeasts occupy a similar position in this respect . Again , brewery yeasts are slow for dough fermentation , since they are accustomed to develop and work at considerably lower temperatures than those employed in a bakery . An account of the production of yeast also involves that // of the manufacture of spirit . The proper quantities of diastatic barley malt and crushed raw grain are intimately mixed in the proportions of one part of ground malt with from three to eight parts by weight of the raw cereals , together with hot water at such a temperature that that of the mash is about 146 ? F. During the stand on ' of two or more hours , the enzymes present convert the starches and other raw materials into wort constituents , such as maltose , dextrins , peptones , amides , and the like . The sweet wort is run off from the grains ; all remaining constitu ents are washed out by sparging ; the mixture of the two is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through a filter , run into the large wort becks , and pitched with yeast from a previous brew . It is very important that the pitching yeast shall be strong , fresh , vigorous , young cells free from all forms of contamination . The fermentation goes on rapidly , as shown by the increase in temperature and the ' ERIVIENTS , BACTERIA , MOULDS , YEASTS 145 attenuation of the wort . In thirty-six hours the highest temperature of about 82 ? F. will have been attained ; then , as the fermentation gradually lessens , the temperature also falls until a point lower than that of pitching is reached in , say , another thirty or more hours . During the period of active fermentation where a large yield of yeast is required , aeration must be frequent ; at the same time there is a loss of spirit , hence in British distilleries aeration is not largely adopted , whilst the temperature is not allowed to go beyond 82 ? F. on account of the excessive evaporation of spirit . During fermentation various heads are thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty head , since it is full of particles composed of little yeast , but much bacteria and other organisms . . This head is skimmed off and rejected , while the yeast from the succeeding heads is collected , mixed , pressed , washed , and packed for the use of the baker . The alcoholic liquid from the fermentation is wash , ' which must be filtered , settled , and got into the wash stills ' for distillation as quickly as possible in order to prevent acetous fermentation by bacteria and consequent loss of spirit . The wash ' has a sp. gr. of about 1002 from a 1042 wort , and contains from 10 to 13 per cent . of proof spirit by volume . A well-known general rule in distilleries is : Prepare thin mashes resulting in maltosic worts and ferment with quick top yeasts to the sp. gr. of water . BARMS Barms are of two classes , the virgin and others , which latter are variously named as Parisian , compound , etc . The active fermenting principle in all of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other bodies , most of which exert an influence on the finished bread . The effect in the case of the virgin harms is more marked than in the others , owing to the fact that in the former there are infinitely larger quantities of acid-forming bacteria in proportion to the yeast cells than in the latter . At once it can be seen that harms are suitable only for long processes . // Bread prepared by the aid of barms is generally of poor volume and colour , rather liable to be holey , with dull bloom and texture somewhat variable , but the flavour as a rule is good . Barms are suitable for working strong , harsh flours by long , slow processes . Owing to the large quantity of bacteria in barms it is customary to use considerably larger quantities of salt ; thus from four to seven pounds per sack of flour are not unusual . More than four pounds can be distinctly tasted ; again , as salt is both an antiseptic and germicide , too large quantities check the fermentation . The making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making up barms are somewhat as , follows : Malt is crushed or ground and mixed with a large volume of water at about 158 ? to 165 ? F. so as to give a thin mash at 145 ? to 150 ? . The object is to obtain malt sugar and the proper type of nitrogenous bodies to act as yeast foods . Whilst this is proceeding , a few ounces of hops , generally three or four per gallon of water , are infused in boiling water with stirring so as to extract the various constituents , viz. , the essential oils for flavour , the resins and tannins for flavouring and antiseptic purposes , and the other bodies as yeast foods . With many barms scalded flour is added to the mash to increase the quantity of sugars . The quantity of a soft flour is made into a fine batter with either cold water or some of the wort already prepared , and then the starch of the flour is gelatinised by pouring in boiling water or wort , gradually and with stirring . This scalded flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mash with stirring , or it is added cautiously with continuous stirring so as not to raise the temperature of the mash high enough to stop diastatic action . If not above 160 ? F. there is little risk . Some bakers use the hop extract for this purpose . All the ingredients are mixed together and stirred well , then left for two or three hours to enable saccharification , or the conversion of the starch into sugar , // to take place . The sweet-tasting fluid mass is strained and rapidly cooled to 70 ? or 80 ? F. In the case of a virgin barm , some salt and sugar are stirred in and the wort left in a cool place for twenty to thirty hours . In other kinds some harm from a previous brew , or some distillers ' or brewers ' yeast , is added to set up fermentation . During the time such harms are preparing the tubs should be protected with a loose-fitting cover . These barms are ready for use in about twenty-four hours . There are many modifications in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the same , viz. , the saccharifying of starch , the addition of hop extract , and the growing of yeast in the wort prepared . The alcoholic liquid containing the yeast is then used for setting sponges and other long processes of fermenting doughs . According to the many authorities on this branch of breadmaking , the following is the comparative value of the different ferments : Twelve ounces of distillers ' compressed yeast , sixteen ounces of brewers ' compressed yeast , about four fluid pints of brewers ' liquid yeast , twelve pounds of compound harm , twenty to twenty-four pounds of Parisian barm , or about thirty pounds of virgin harm are required for each sack of flour . THE THEORY OF ALCOHOLIC FERMENTATION From remote ages it has been known that when sugar solutions , such as the expressed Juices of sweet fruits , were exposed to the air , the sweetness was gradually lost , and the liquid took on a spirituous flavour and properties . During this change it was observed that bubbles were produced and passed off into the air . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the bubbling or boiling up ? hence the name fermentation from the Latin fervere , ' to boil ? was discovered . At this period , Antony van Leeuwenhoek of Delft was working with one of the first-made compound microscopes and noticed that small // spherical bodies were always present in liquids that bubbled up ' when cold . From that time onwards many theories were advanced to explain fermentation , but none were absolutely success ful . The modern or enzyme theory took its rise in the last half of the nineteenth century from the work of M. Traube . Even yet very much remains to be done to satisfy every part of this theory . The following are the names of the theories displaced by the enzyme or soluble ferment theory :  --  - the mechanical or dead mass theory of Stahl , Willis , and Liebig ; the amorphous form or catalytic theory of Berzelius ; the vitalistic theory of Cagniard de Latour , Sohwann , and Kutzing , and the physico-molecular theory of Naegeli . Fermentation is the name given to the process , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the carbohydrates , especially the sugars , are de-composed mainly into carbon dioxide and alcohol , with traces of higher alcohols , acids , and other substances . Although Cavendish and Lavoisier were the first to attempt an explanation of fermentation , M. Gay-Lussac was the first tthtibti In this equation no account is taken of the higher alcohols or fusel oils , glycerine , succinic acid , and traces of other bodies . Yeasts are said to produce alcoholic fer mentation whilst bacteria produce the acid fermentation of carbohydrates , with the formation of such acids as acetic , propionic , butyric , lactic , and others . Putrefaction is the decomposition of nitrogenous matter by bacterial agency accompanied by the production of noxious gases such as ammonia , sulphuretted hydrogen , etc . Decay is the slow process by which dry , and also moist , organic substances are gradually decomposed by the agency of micro-organisms growing and feeding upon them . Recent research goes to prove that all the processes of decomposition may be referred to the action of enzymes , // and that they are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equation of Gay-Lussac was considered , until within the last few years , to represent approximately what actually took place during fermentation ; but when Edward Buchner in 1897-8 published his researches on yeast-juice and the discovery of the enzyme zymase , all the previous ideas regarding fermentation were shown to be wrong . Still later research , dating to May in the present year ( 1911 ) , carries the work of the brothers Buchner much farther . Zymase itself is not sufficient to induce fermentation of sugar solutions . Dr. Arthur Harden in his monograph on Alcoholic Fermentation ( 1911 ) conclusively proves that another enzyme , spoken of as a co-enzyme , and alkaline phosphates are absolutely essential . The following reactions take place when a sugar is fermented normally by yeast The sugar , if a biose as sucrose or maltose , is hydrolysed by enzyme action into monoses . These during decomposition by zymase and its co-enzyme form alcohol , carbon dioxide , water , other bodies , and a sugar phosphate to which the name hexose-phosphate has been given . This compound is hydrolysed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once fermented . The alkaline phosphate is then ready once again to re-form hexosephosphate , and so the cycle of reactions goes on so long as any sugar remains in solution . In accordance with the enzyme theory of alcoholic fermentation , all decompositions and recombinations are performed inside the yeast cell itself by the various enzymes ; therefore all substances passing into the cell are necessarily of a crystalline and soluble nature , otherwise they could not diffuse through the vegetable membrane that forms the cell-wall . The same is true also for all the excretory products of the yeasts ' metabolism . By metabolism ' is understood the power that the protoplasm of the yeast cell possesses of changing the constituents of its food into other bodies ; whilst the products of this metabolism are said to be excretory. // During the hot season , both the yeast merchant and the baker experience difficulty in keeping yeast for any length of time owing to the auto- or self-fermentation of the yeast . From the work on yeast juice carried out at the Lister Institute , it would appear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also contains a glycogen , similar to the animal starch found in the liver of animals , diastase , and proteolytic enzymes . When yeast is exposed to high temperatures without suitable or sufficient food , the liquefaction and breaking up of the constituents of the cell take place , resulting in the annihilation of the yeast . Yeast may be stored for a considerable period without deterioration provided that the atmosphere is a dry , cool one , with a temperature , however , not so low as to freeze the cells . Recently , a form of desiccated yeast has been placed on the market in sealed tins for carriage into and for use in hot climates . The examination of yeast for bakery purposes. ? A general examination of the yeast is first made to ascertain its colour , taste , smell , appearance , moisture , and the fracture when a quantity of pressed yeast is broken across . It is now subjected to a microscopic examination and the following points noted : ? the general condition of the yeast cells as regards regularity in size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internally , the deterioration or otherwise of the vacuoles , whether in the budding stage and the presence or absence of foreign organisms . For the purpose of this work a small quantity of the yeast is brought into a small clean bottle , shaken up with sterile water , a drop withdrawn and put on a micro-slip , then covered with a very thin cover-glass and examined as above . Several fields on each of two or three slips should be carefully observed and notes made on each . General conclusions may then be drawn from them . The presence of dead and very weak cells can be detected by bringing a small drop of the dye methylene blue to the edge of the cover-glass , allowing it to work in for a few // moments and then counting all the cells per field . Next note all those that are completely stained blue , which are the dead cells ; then those that are slightly or more stained , these are the weak cells in which the protoplasm is granular and the cells shrunken in size . The gas-evolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five grams of the sample of yeast in as finely divided a state as possible are accurately weighed , brought into a glass flask of about two hundred and fifty c.c. capacity , and ten grams of good cane sugar added ; when all the fittings are ready , add one hundred c.c. of water at about blood-heat , 98.4 ? F. , insert the cork through which passes a bent glass tube , the opposite end dipping under a graduated glass tube , which is suspended with its lower end just under water contained in a suitable vessel as shown in the illustration ( Fig. 40 ) . The number of minutes taken for the yeast to begin the evolution of carbon dioxide gas is noted , after which readings of the number of c.c. evolved are taken for four or five consecutive half-hours . The apparatus used for this determination is a double one , so that a fair average of the gas-evolving power of the yeast can be obtained . This determination is usually verified by making a fine batter with weighed quantities of flour , yeast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the size of the containing vessel employed . The time at which the batter is set , the length of time taken to come to the highest point , and the length of time before dropping , are all noted and comparisons made . It should be remembered , that if yeast is old and granular in appearance , if it contains many dead cells and is badly contaminated with motile and non-motile bacteria , then it takes longer to begin its vegetative functions , the volume of gas evolved is low and its evolution slow . Such a yeast is not fitted for the quick dough processes now in general use , especially in the towns . ' Where long-sponge or ferment methods are still in use , a yeast of the type described may be much improved by the addition of a pound to two // pounds per sack of a good diastase paste or malt extract . For the quick processes , a very weak yeast would not recover in time to be of any effective use . CHAPTER X BREAD1VIAKING PROCESSES AND BREADS THE earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was employed ; the leaven itself may be looked upon as a primeval form of virgin harm , since the active constituents of this were derived in the first instance from the atmosphere , like those of the virgin harm . The bread obtained by the help of leaven was a dark-coloured kind of cake possessing the usual sweetish-sour taste . In the present day , two methods of aerating doughs are in common use : the ordinary process in which one of the many varieties of yeast forms the active agent , and the other in which chemical compounds are employed to generate the carbon dioxide that aerates the dough . Of these latter compounds one is a metallic carbonate , usually the bicarbonate of soda an alkaline body ? although the normal carbonate , the sesqui , and crystal carbonates all find use in this direction ; the other compound is either an acid or hydrogen salt of phosphoric acid , or of some organic acid like tartaric and citric , or the free acids themselves ; e.g. cream of tartar or bitartrate of potassium , or the potassium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder most generally used consists of two parts by weight of cream of tartar mixed with one of bicarbonate of soda . When powders are made up in quantity so as to save time , it is advisable to mix in with them a proportion of rice or some similar starch , as otherwise the mixture tends to cake into a hard mass , which gradually gives off its gas and becomes useless . As an alternative , patent or soda flour may be made up by thoroughly mixing two ounces of 153 // cream of tartar ( 98 per cent . strength ) with one ounce of pure bicarbonate of soda , the two quantities being enough to aerate four pounds of a strong flour . Brown and certain special white breads are manufactured on a small scale with powder . The meal or other flour is rubbed with a small quantity of fat to shorten and enrich the finished product , then made into a bay on the working table ; a smaller proportion of salt than when using yeast , well crushed to avoid lumps , is distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or water at the ordinary temperature , say 70 ? F. , is brought ? into the bay , and the whole worked up into a dough of suitable consistency . After clearing , the dough is scaled off at the desired weight , moulded , and allowed to stand for a time to give the powder a chance to work . When ready , the goods are baked in a moderately sharp oven . If the oven is too slow , the goods are dried off rather than baked ; on the other hand , the oven must not be too hot , since the generation of gas should be slow and regular , otherwise the goods are not evenly aerated . The reaction of the chemicals may be expressed by the equation : A smaller quantity of salt is taken than with yeast because of the Rochelle salt left in the bread . This salt has a mild purgative action on the human system . If the alkaline sodium salt is used in excess , the goods are marked with yellowish-brown streaks and taste of soda . When cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid flavour prevalent in the finished goods . All goods made with powder are very liable to become dry , even when carefully stored . A number of mechanical processes have from time to time been devised and patented for the purpose of aerating // dough with carbonic acid gas , CO , Amongst these , that of Dr. Dauglish was the only one to achieve more than a slight success ; yet , even that survived only for a short time . BREADMAKING BY AERATION WITH CARBONIC ACID GAS PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF YEAST There are many different methods of aerating or fermenting dough , but in reality only about three of them are in common use . They are the straight-dough or ' offhand ' process , the ferment and dough and the sponge and dough methods . In country districts in England and Wales , and in most parts of Scotland except one or two of the larger towns , sponge and dough ' processes of long duration are still the order of the day ; but wherever good compressed yeast can be regularly obtained , straight-dough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many districts it is still quite common to find the potato ferment , in spite of its dirt , a usual process of preparing dough . A potato ferment can be made as follows : ? Eight to ten pounds of potatoes of a mealy character are first well cleaned , then boiled , and , after standing to dry for a few minutes , pressed through a brasswire sieve , mashed with about two gallons of water , and cooled down to 0 ' F. Three or four pounds of flour and eight ounces of yeast are broken up and stirred into the mash . After standing to ferment for six or eight hours , it is in a suitable condition for setting a sponge or for making up by the straight-dough process . In the Midlands and some parts of the south of England , a ferment process is employed . This consists in making a kind of thin batter in the following way From one to one and a half pounds of compressed yeast are well broken up in a gallon of water at 90 ? F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be necessary ( it should be noted that yeast is an organism and therefore can not be dissolved ) , and four pounds of flour gradually stirred in to // make a fine batter . This ferment should be covered and put into a warm place until ready , say in about twenty-five to thirty minutes , when it may be used for a two hours ' sponge process , or for a straight-dough method to be made into bread in about four hours . There is also another common way of preparing a ferment by means of scalded flour and malt , as follows : Crush or grind ten pounds of malt and mash with three gallons of water at 160 ? F. In the meantime infuse three ounces of hops with a gallon of boiling water for a short period and cool down the infusion to 145 ? F. After the malt infusion or mash has stood for two hours both this and the hop one are strained together into a harm tub , pressing out as much of the liquor as possible . Next , stir in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick paste or batter and allow to stand for twelve hours . Boiling water is now poured cautiously with continuous stirring into the batter so as to gelatinise the starch . The malt soon liquefies the scalded flour , as may be observed by the gradual thinning down of the batter . Half a gallon of the thin batter is used per sack of two hundred and eighty pounds of flour , for making a sponge ( one-third water ) , which is to stand for eight or ten hours . Generally , from eight to twelve ounces of good distillery yeast will be required with such a batter . The sponge and dough bread process. ? The sponge process is still the prevalent one , though it is fast being superseded by the straight or offhand method . A sponge and dough process is in reality an operation to make dough in two stages , viz. , the setting of the sponge and the doughing up . Several different sponges are used , the quarter , the third , the half , and the three-quarter ; whilst the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anomalous though it may appear , there is less risk of acidity in the finished bread with a long than with a short sponge . In long-period sponges , the temperatures are kept fairly low and a proportion of salt is used , both // conditions being inimical to lactic and other bacteria ; hence long sponge-made bread ? other conditions being equal ? generally eats sweet . Short processes require less salt and a higher temperature , consequently the corresponding risks are greater . One of the chief advantages of a sponge process is that the actual sponge is a thin medium containing all the chief essentials for the growth of yeast , and is of such a consistency that the yeast actually increases in quantity . This permits of the use of a rather less weight of yeast per sack of flour than is required in a straight-dough process , thereby effecting a considerable saving in the course of a year . Sponges were stated to be quarter , third , half , and threequarter ones . By this is meant that in setting the sponge , approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water would be used in this operation , the remainder at the proper temperature being added at the doughing stage of the proceedings . Sponges are also spoken of as twelve hours ' sponge ' or other period down to as short as a ' two hours . ' The time stated is intended to include that occupied for all operations until the dough is ready to be scaled off and available for making up and proving . In bakeries where the one dough follows the others in a regular succession it is necessary that the quantities of the ingredients , their temperatures and the resulting doughs and times of each , should be accurately gauged and strictly followed throughout . Each and every operation must be carried out with the greatest punctuality and regularity . These are two out of four of the essentials in a bakery , the other two being cleanliness and the absence of wastefulness , i.e. economy . To enable the baker to fix the correct times for a succession of doughs he ought to know the following points : ( 1 ) The temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bakehouse. ( 2 ) The characteristics of the yeast or barm to be used . ( 3 ) The approximate composition of any yeast food or // bread improver which it is proposed to add to the yeast and flour . ( 4 ) The character and type of flours to be employed . For example , bread improvers of the mineral sort , containing , say , gypsum or calcium sulphate , act as antiseptics and retard fermentation ; fats when used in excess behave similarly ; malt products , on the other hand , all act as stimulants to the yeast in addition to improving the finished loaf . There are on the market one or two of the mineral improvers based on Pasteur 's method of preparing pure yeast , which , owing partly to the fact that they prevent bacterial competition and partly that they contain phosphates , are actually stimulants to the yeast in addition to being bread improvers . The temperatures of the bakehouse and of the chief ingredients are of the utmost importance . If the temperature of the sponge is low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given consistency . the reactions going on in the sponge will be slow ; if the temperature of the sponge be increased , then the changes will become accelerated and the time shortened . The flour should be stored in a dry , warm atmosphere , as this condition of things causes an improvement in the flour in most cases and also prevents a chilling of the yeast whereby its vital functions are checked . The temperature of the bakehouse can be ascertained by taking a reading of the thermometer hanging in a convenient place in the room . The temperature of the water is not quite so readily obtained . It has been already pointed out that the specific heat or heat capacity of water is slightly more than twice that of flour . The temperature of the liquor to be used may be roughly calculated as follows : Double the given or fixed temperature for the dough and deduct that of the flour . Several slight corrections are necessary. ; for example , one for the temperature of the bakery itself , which ought not to be much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of the room itself . // An example will make this calculation clear . The temperature of the dough is to be 80 ? F. , that of the flour is 68 ? F. Find the temperature of the liquor . Dough temperature= 80 ? ; then 80'X2=160 ' . 160 ? ? 68 ? =92 ? F. , the liquor temperature . Correction ( 1 ) . The bakehouse is very cold , therefore the proper allowance ? depending on several factors ? must be added . If the room is hot , then a deduction should be made . Correction ( 2 ) . The bakehouse is draughty , or the vessels containing the sponges , doughs , etc. , cause a loss of heat , then an increase must be made to allow for these conditions . The characteristics of the yeast and its freedom or otherwise from bacteria , ought to be known to the baker . Where the characteristics of the yeast are constant , as in the case of a few of the more important British , a Dutch , and one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasioned ; but , on the other hand , where the yeasts are being repeatedly changed or the yeasts themselves are not constant in quality , as is frequently the case , trouble is certain to ensue , unless the baker responsible tests the various yeasts day by day . The character and constants of the flour or blends of flour should also be known . Thus if a flour is excessively moist owing to the use of an atomiser ' or special treatment in the milling , or if its gluten has been affected or even degraded , or if it has had the benefit of some artificial strengthening agent , these facts must be known by the baker to enable him to obtain the best possible result from his raw materials . Strong flours should be employed for long-sponge or longfermentation processes , so that the various agents acting may have time to mellow down and mature the undesirable constituents in such flours . In this way , spring wheat flours of the Minnesota Patents type may be rendered suitable and useful . For doughing up , winter wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour milled // from soft English wheat imparts a nutty flavour and improves the colour , bloom , and general appearance of the finished loaf . For the short processes , including straight doughs , port and country millers prepare from a suitably selected grist the flours required for the trade in their own and other districts . Flours of this kind are very useful to the baker and save him from holding large stocks of several varieties of flour , as was necessary in the days of long processes when bakers blended to a far greater extent than they do in modern times . Furthermore , the high quality of the bread may be more readily maintained . Having considered the fundamentals , the baker may now proceed to set his sponge and carry out all the required operations . For a long-sponge process , say , for example , one of ten hours ' duration , the following quantities of materials will be necessary , assuming the bakery plant in this case to be a two-sack one : Flour , two sacks or five hundred and sixty pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half to seven pounds . Yeast food , say , malt flour , two pounds . Water , fifteen to sixteen gallons per sack , as determined . The sponge is known as a half sponge . ' For the setting of this , use : Flour , two hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty pounds . Yeast , sixteen ounces . Salt , a pound to one and a half pounds according to the season . Water , fifteen gallons . In many bakeries the sponge is prepared in the oldfashioned sponging machine , consisting of a tub fitted with a stirrer or beater . In more modern establishments a dough-mixer is used for a similar purpose . It will be noticed that the ratio of water to flour is roughly one // gallon to sixteen pounds . This gives a moderately stiff sponge , therefore if it is to stand for a long period the temperature must be fairly low , say about 72 ? F. When ready , dough up with the remaining materials . It is important to note that the yeast must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell . In the case of straight doughs this mixing of the yeast with water so as to leave no lumps is much more necessary than in sponging . The salt should be dissolved completely in some of the liquor before using , as also should any sugar or malt extract which is to be used . The temperature of the water for breaking up yeast must on no account exceed 104 ? F. , or the fermentative pro perties of the yeast may be very seriously impaired . This and all other operations must be carefully checked or con-trolled by the use of thermometers . The fingers are not by any means sensitive enough to be employed as thermometers . The liquor temperature for doughing depends on a number of factors , hence no statement of a hard and fast character can be given . When once the dough has been made up it should not be exposed to rough handling , and as fermentation proceeds this becomes increasingly important . On the other hand , it should be borne in mind that the texture and other points of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doughs ought not to be cut back too frequently as it entails too great a loss of the carbonic acid gas . For an eight hours ' sponge , about a third more yeast should be employed , at the rate of twelve ounces per sack . For a good many years bread was prepared for our military forces by sponge processes and patent hop yeast . The , barm was manufactured from three pounds of ground malt , which was mixed with soft water into a thin mash and gently heated to temperatures varying between 145 ' and 168 ? F. according to the season . The mash was then well-stirred together and left to stand for about one and a half hours . Simultaneously , two ounces of hops // were infused in four gallons of water and maintained at 200 ? F. for the same period as the mash . The hop infusion was then cooled down to 160 ? F. and strained into the malt mash , the mixture being well stirred , covered , and allowed to stand for ten hours . It was now strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces of sugar and half a gallon of yeast from a previous brew mixed with it . After again stirring , fermentation was continued for ten hours . The froth and dirty brown head was skimmed off and the yeast was ready for use . Three kinds of sponges were used , viz. the quarter , half , and three-quarters . The quantity of yeast employed amounted to nearly a gallon per sack of flour . After dropping twice , salt at the rate of four pounds per sack and the rest of the water were added and the whole worked up into a rather stiff dough . For two-pound loaves the dough was scaled at thirty-five and a half ounces , moulded , proved , and baked at 550 ? F. in side-flue ovens . The straight dough process.10-The straight dough or off-hand ' process is one in which the whole of the ingredients are brought together and made into a dough at one operation . This involves a number of considerations , some of which have already been discussed . For example , all types of flours are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harsh flour would produce large , ungainly loaves more or less devoid of flavour and of poor colour . If a weak type of flour is used , then the volume and colour are poor , but the compensation for these deficiencies is an excellent flavour in the bread . To overcome these difficulties the baker had to keep large stocks of flour for blending purposes in order to obtain the bread suitable for his trade . Perhaps the greatest difficulty was with the yeast . Until the days of quick-working , pressed , distillery yeast , the baker had to rely on harms or brewers ' yeast . When doughs are made up and worked parallel as far as possible , one with brewers ' and the other // with distillers ' yeast , all the advantages , with one exception , viz. that of risk from sourness , are on the side of the latter . Owing to the antiseptic properties of the hop constituents bacteria are very largely held in check , and this obviates the above risk where brewers ' yeasts are employed . The quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Flour , a sack of two hundred and eighty pounds . Yeast , twelve to fourteen ounces . Yeast food , eight to ten ounces of a mixture consisting of six parts of good malt flour , four of sugar , and one of potassium phosphate . Salt , three and a half pounds . Water , fourteen to fifteen gallons according to the strength of the flour , and of such a temperature that the dough shall be between 73 ? and 74 ? F. As a rule much shorter processes than eight hours are advisable for straight doughs , viz. , from two to three hours in the dough , or from four to five hours from start to finish . To carry out the shortest useful process , i.e. four hours from flour to bread , the following modifications are necessary : Yeast , two and a half to three pounds per sack . Yeast food , one pound of a diastase paste or the above mixture . Salt , three pounds . Water , the same volume at such a temperature that that of the resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working is somewhat as follows : First thoroughly break up the yeast in a gallon of water at 90 ? F. , then stir in with it the whole of the yeast food . Next , pass the flour , after having ascertained its temperature , through the sifter , so as to open out and get rid of lumps and foreign particles , into the dough-mixing machine , and set the arms revolving to lighten and aerate the flour . While this is proceeding dissolve the salt completely in a portion of the liquor from the attemperating tank , the temperature of the water in which has already been ar164 CHEMISTRY OF BREADMAKING ranged . The required quantity of water is run into the mixer with the salt and the yeast , which latter should be in a state of active fermentation or ' krausen ' by this time . The mixer ( Fig. 41 ) is now closed , and the mixing operation carried out until the dough is thoroughly made and cleared . The time for this operation varies slightly with the different designs of machines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : dough is turned out into a trough , covered up and allowed to ferment . The temperature of the dough should be taken as soon as it is collected in the trough and at intervals during the fermentation . These temperatures ought to be entered in a book kept for the purpose to enable the foreman to control all operations properly as in other fermentation industries . At the right time the dough should be cut back , ' brought on to the working tables and thoroughly kneaded but not too roughly handled . In a quick process this is most important if the texture , colour , volume , and flavour are to be at their best . The handling of the dough during the fermentation stage assists the flavour and texture especially , by expelling the waste gases and incorporating fresh air in their place ; this revives the vital activity of the yeast and enables it to complete its work in the dough constituents . Then if the gases ( including air ) are evenly distributed through the dough , the reticulation and vesiculation of the crumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture good . Moreover , the handling has a toughening effect on the gluten and // assists its elasticity . Instead of bringing the dough on to the working tables for the purposes explained above it may be carried out , though not so effectually , in the dough troughs by systematically working from one end to the other . According to Professor Wood of Cambridge , the volume of a loaf depends on the amount of carbonic acid gas evolved during the fermentation stage , and the power of the flour to hold the gas ; and a quick evolution distends the dough much more than a slow evolution . ' But , as already shown , the volume depends on the mechanical structure , i.e. its vesiculation , as well as on the strength of the little sacs of gluten which contain the mixture of gases . For commercial bread , a similar treatment is given to the dough just before it is ready for scaling ; but for exhibition loaves an additional handing up will improve all the points of a loaf previously mentioned . Scaling may best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rough treatment of the dough seems to deaden it , or in the words of the baker to knock the life out of it . ' Machines known as dividers have been designed for the purpose , but so far they are not quite free from this defect . Some are worse than others in this way , and produce with the same flour a rather smaller volume loaf . Great care ought to be exercised before scaling off to prevent over-fermentation , ' which is largely the cause of sourness and crumbliness in the finished loaf . When the dough is brought into the oven , it takes some time for the heat to check the yeast action near the centre of the loaf , hence the necessity of avoiding such a state of things . Overproof will also help to render bread crumbly . After scaling , the dough is roughly moulded and placed close on the tables , to prevent chilling and the streaks it causes in the bread , and allowed to recover somewhat before making up . In all the succeeding operations after fermentation increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good loaves are spoiled in their appearance both externally and internally in this way . Moulding for different classes of bread is a process that // differs considerably and can be better understood by actually working at the moulding than by any amount of description . The moulded dough is now allowed to prove ' until it is at the precise point when baking is required . The proving apparatus should be of such a form that all draughts are avoided , so that there is no risk of causing a thick skin on the surface of the dough which spoils the appearance of the finished loaf . Where skinning does occur , the surface of the dough should be lightly washed with warm water a few minutes before being brought into the oven . This treatment assists but does not altogether do away with the disfigurement . The mode of setting bread in an oven is described in Chap . XII . on ovens . It is only necessary here to emphasise the statement already made that the dough must not be roughly treated . In setting in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peel or oven-plate at this stage instead of lightly placing them in position . The dough should be evenly baked at the temperature most suitable for the particular class of bread . If the oven is too slow the dough is dried rather than baked , and if too hot the crust is over-caramelised before the interior or crumb is effectually cooked . In both cases also the volume of the loaf is generally smaller than it should be . In a slow oven the bread , especially cottage , is inclined to drop before the heat can fix the gluten , whereas in the scorching oven the outside crust is fixed and rendered impervious before the interior gases have properly expanded . This also very often leads to bursts in the side and to ugly loaves . Practically , whatever may be the baking temperature of the ovens , that of the interior of a loaf only slightly exceeds that of boiling water . The author in 1905 carried through a large number of experiments on this subject , using specially constructed maximum thermometers for the purpose . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near to the centre of the loaves as possible . Different baking temperaBREADMAKING // Lures were employed , short and long baking periods , and different classes of breads were subjected to these tests . After cooling down the loaves containing the instruments were cut open and the thermometers read , but in no single case was 2160 F. exceeded . The changes proceeding in the dough during the baking may be summed up as follows . The surplus moisture is expelled together with the alcohol and the volatile acidity ( acetic acid ) formed at the expense of the alcohol . The little sacs or cells of gluten and starch gradually expand , causing the vesiculated appearance of the crumb of the loaf ; after a time the gluten and certain other nitrogenous compounds are coagulated ; the moistened starch of the dough is then gelatinised and becomes fit for food purposes . The yeast and bacteria are killed by the moist heat and thus the bread is sterilised . Externally , the starchy matters become somewhat caramelised , forming dextrin-like and other more complex carbohydrate compounds , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugars . Wet , naked steam , which is always present in the ovens both from the cooking dough and also when introduced either by means of small , narrow water-tanks , or by wet low-pressure steam , assists the latter changes , and also forms a larger proportion of dextrins , thus covering the crust of the loaves with a glaze . Wet steam in addition tends to counteract the fierce flash-heat of many of the modern ovens and thus partially preserves the goods from burning . As soon as completely baked , the bread is drawn and stored in bread-racks in a suitable place for cooling down . The bread at this stage requires careful handling , or the loaves will be shaken and several of their characteristics spoiled . After cooling , the bread should be weighed , and where it is considered advisable , made up in clean paper wrappers to preserve it from dust and all contact with dirty or soiled surfaces . A strong pronouncement in favour of this procedure was made at the Plymouth Conference in July 1911 by the retiring president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantage of keeping the bread from contact with dirty clothes and hands during the distribution to customers . As far back as the time of Pliny the Elder it was known that bread should weigh one-third more than the flour from which it is produced ; a sack of good-quality flour ought to yield from three hundred and seventy to three hundred and eighty-four pounds of bread . The loss of the dough in baking averages just slightly more than a tenth of the weight of dough from which the bread is made , but these figures are frequently exceeded , greatly to the detriment of both the bread and the baker . The short , straight dough process for making bread just described is only possible where high quality yeast and a regular supply of it can be obtained . These short processes entail the use of higher temperatures , which tend to cause sourness , i.e. acidity , and poor flavour ; hence there must be more skill and attention on the part of the baker , in order to produce a good-coloured crumb and a line bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of factors , amongst which are : ? the quality of the flour , the quantity of water employed , the method and thoroughness of working so that everything is kept strictly to its proper time and place , and the perfection of the aeration . Any slight deviation from these factors will more or less seriously affect the colour and other properties of the loaf . Incidentally , the colour is also influenced by the use of improvers . For example , fat of various kinds when rubbed into the flour assists the shortness of the bread , especially the crust , and improves the flavour and keeping qualities , but if used in much larger quantities than three pounds per sack , it not only spoils the colour but makes the dough runny . ' Other improvers 11 act somewhat similarly . The processes and quantities already given are those employed on a large scale , and with slight modifications are applicable to all the common classes of bread . For special breads or the fancy breads of commerce there are nearly as // many recipes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crusty breads are the more useful and saleable ; examples , Coburgs , Brunswicks , large and small Viennas , etc . Most of these contain fats or milk and sugar or other improver in addition to the fancy patent flour . They may best be made by a quick straight dough process . The following quantities will be found useful for small batches of any of the above goods : Flour , fancy patent , or a strong high-class blended with a proportion of Hungarian flour , sixteen pounds . Yeast , four to five ounces . Yeast food , three to four ounces . Salt , three ounces . Fats , about three ounces to keep the crust short . Liquor , seven pints ( half milk and half water ) . Temperature of the dough to be about 84 ? or 85 ? F. Hand up twice and scale off in two hours . Mould up in the desired shapes , prove for a time in steam , complete in the absence of steam . Cut batons , Coburgs and Brunswicks deeply . Wash with warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaze ; take off the covers and finish . For Vienna smalls , baking trays similar to those used for petits choux will be found suitable . For brown breads of all varieties it will be found that straight dough processes give the best results , and , for many , the time from flour to finished loaf should not exceed two and a quarter to two and a half hours . This does not apply to malt and certain proprietary breads for which a longer time is necessary owing to the extended baking period . The following quantities are suitable for whole and wheat meals : Meal , sixteen pounds . Yeast , six ounces . Salt , four ounces . Sugar , two or three ounces . Water , one gallon , or a portion of this replaced by milk . l70 CHEMISTRY OF BREADM.AKINQ The temperature of the dough to be about 82 ? to 83 ? F. Allow to ferment until ready , then hand up and scale off at weights to suit the trade of the district , but not exceeding thirty-five and a half ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common use . Set in the oven slightly underproof . It is important to note that the temperature of a dough must never be allowed to drop if good results are to be secured , and this is particularly the case with all forms of brown breads . Another note of caution may be useful in making brown bread . During the making into dough a fine texture may be secured by rubbing the batter on the table until it has been fined down , but bread prepared in this way is usually devoid of flavour and the characteristic colour of the particular bread . The chemical composition of bread. ? The composition varies somewhat with the process employed in the manufacture and with the ingredients used ; thus scalded flour , potatoes , and such like bodies , yield a moister loaf . The subjoined analytical figures will enable the reader to gain some idea of the quantities of the constituents present .

Breadmaking machinery. ? A well-equipped , up-to-date machinery bakery ought to contain an installation so complete as to render it unnecessary to handle the dough except to set it in the ovens . The important machines include : A hoist of the vertical or horizontal type fixed in the highest part of the building , and in such a convenient position as to be useful for all the required purposes . An automatic weighing and self-registering machine . A combined blender and sifter fixed over the hopper of the dough mixer . The dough mixer , which should be one of an approved type , either on the Adair rotary or other principle . In close proximity to the mixer , a properly constructed attemperating tank with all the necessary fittings .

A sackcleaning machine to recover flour from the sacks ; various provers , setting and other racks , scales and sundry utensils as necessary . Wherever possible the motive power should be electricity on account of its cleanliness , ease of manipulation , and its being always ready for use.12 CHAPTER XI ANTISEPTICS AND BAKEHOUSE HYGIENE ANTISEPTICS , as the name denotes , are substances used for the prevention of putrefaction and decay . In a bakery or other place in which food is prepared scrupulous cleanliness must be observed in every possible way . Particles of sugar , flour , bread , and pieces of dough should never be allowed to remain on the floor to be trodden about the place , nor should they be merely swept up to a corner or side of the room where they act as breeding-places for all kinds of noxious germs . All tables , troughs , scales , machinery , and other utensils must be thoroughly cleaned as soon as possible . Where boiling water can be employed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and articles both clean and sterile . Soda and soaps are useful detergents , but they are of little value for sterilising purposes . Many groups of bacteria are aided by the presence of very weak solutions of alkalies , hence the use of one or more of the antiseptics sold for the killing of these germs and maintaining everything as sterile as possible is desirable . The more common antiseptics are :  --  - sulphurous acid gas and its solution , the acid- or bi-sulphites especially those of soda and lime , borax , boric or boracic acid , salicylic acid , fluorides of the alkalies , lustril , fluosilicates , formaline , a 40 per cent . solution of formaldehyde in methyl alcohol , benzoic acid , and carbolic acid or phenol when in a strong solution . Phenol , thymol , and certain other chemical reagents are also classified as antiseptics , yet their action is somewhat restricted ; for example , strong solutions of phenol hinder both fermentation and 172 // putrefaction , but a stiff solution of gelatin containing phenol is a recognised medium for the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with and stops the peptonising action of pepsin , but it apparently does not influence diastatic action in any way . Thymol , the chief constituent of oil of thyme , prevents the work of yeast , moulds , and other ferments , especially diastase , but it has no effect on pepsin . Use is made of these different reactions of the two antiseptics in detecting the one enzyme group in the presence of the other . The three common fruit acids , viz. malic , tartaric , and citric acids , and their potassium acid salts , when in weak solution , prevent all diastatic action , but have no effect on the alcoholic fermentation , which , it should be remembered , is known to be caused by enzymes . The difference in behaviour of antiseptics in some eases is probably due to the fact that certain of the enzymes have the protection of a cell-wall as with yeast . The late Professor Dr. Louis Pasteur based his method for the preparation of pure yeast on the inhibitive action of the three acids mentioned , and also on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of weak solutions of the four acids , whilst the growth of most bacterial groups is absolutely prevented by them . The action of moist heat , that is , boiling water and steam , has already been discussed . The bactericidal action of light is of great importance . Pathogenic and septic or putrefactive bacteria are all inhibited by the action of plenty of sunlight . As far back as 1877 a paper of some interest was read before the Royal Society dealing with the preventive action of light on bacteria . A few years later Dr. Richardson explained the bactericidal action of light as a possible case of low temperature oxidation , because water vapour induces the formation of hydrogen peroxide which is undoubtedly an antiseptic . At the Paris Exhibition in 1900 the powerful effect of light was very forcefully illustrated by cultures of pathogenic bacteria in glass bottles in gelatin ; portions of the bottles // were covered with dark paper , the bottles incubated at suitable temperatures in bright sunlight and the contents afterwards completely sterilised . Wherever the dark . paper had prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whilst in the exposed parts the nutrient gelatin remained perfectly clear . The lesson for the baker is that all parts of the bakery in which individuals are engaged and food prepared must be freely exposed to light and fresh air . It is owing to these two desiderata that the Health Authorities in towns and urban districts have to a very large extent done away with the underground and cellar bakehouse . The great Greek philosopher 's statement that Light is God 's shadow ' is particularly applicable to any building in which our daily food is being prepared . An account of the mode of preparation and properties of the antiseptics named in this chapter may be found in any good book on chemistry . As sulphurous acid and its salts , the bisulphites , are the commonest and most useful of antiseptics for a bakery , it may not be out of place to state that these compounds are prepared on a large scale for many manufacturing processes in the following way . Crude sulphur or disulphides or other sulphur ores of metals are roasted and burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sulphur dioxide ( SO2 , ) formed is passed through purifiers and then into water to be absorbed , or into solutions or milks of the alkalies and earthy metals to form the bisulphites of them . For example , bisulphite of soda ? a liquid ? is obtained by passing the SO2 gas into a moderately strong solution of caustic soda until the soda is saturated . The bisulphite of lime , the most useful of these antiseptics , is prepared by treating milk of lime in a similar way . All wooden and earthenware vessels that have contained dough , sugar solutions , yeast , milk , or other substances which are suitable materials for the growth of moulds and bacteria , if not already sterile , may quickly be rendered so by washing with a weak solution of this latter antiseptic , // allowing it to remain on the vessel for a short time and then washing off with boiling water . In order to assist in keeping everything sterile , the walls of a bakery ought to be thoroughly cleaned , scraped , and lime-washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white glazed tiles or bricks should be employed in the construction of the important rooms of the bakery , because they not only make the place lighter but more readily lend themselves to cleanliness . Further , glazed surfaces prevent deposits of dust and bacteria on the walls . VENTILATION By ventilating is understood the exposing of something freely to the action of the atmospheric air ; thus the name of the process ? ventilation ? is derived from the Latin word ventilo , to toss in the air ' ( ventus=wind ) . The original idea of ventilation consisted in causing draughts to exist in all parts of the ventilated structure , thereby carrying out the exposure to little winds ' and in addition creating much discomfort and even pain to the persons working in the place . Natural ventilation depends upon two well-known phenomena : convection currents , and the diffusion of gases . All openings into a room or workshop permit of the entrance of air currents , as also to some extent do the walls , which are slightly porous . This fresh air mixes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes heated it rises to the highest point , thus setting up convection currents ; the polluted air escapes through any openings it may find , as , for example , by way of the chimney or the upper part of the door casement , or other opening . In this way the air of the room is being continuously changed . The English system of heating by means of open fires , hence by radiation , though wasteful and extravagant , is healthful , as it is of considerable assistance to the natural ventilation . That the door is an aid to ventilation may readily be demonstrated by partially opening it . and holding a taper or candle at three different points . // At the top the flame from the candle will be blown outwards by the outrush of the heated air ; at the bottom of the door the flame will be blown inwards by the incoming currents of air . Midway between the top and bottom of the door there is neither outward nor inward current . In the winter-time and other cool periods of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in temperature , the same effects as does the flame , namely , that the warm air is rushing out at the top and the cooler air coming in at the bottom . When rooms are heated with stoves one or more openings should be constructed at the upper portion of the rooms so as to assist in ventilating them ; at the same time stoves are liable to render the atmosphere of the rooms excessively dry by raising the temperature too much above the dewpoint , and thus they cause much inconvenience and unpleasantness to those inhabiting the rooms . It is advisable in all such cases to keep a vessel full of water on the stove in order to prevent this dryness . Several systems of artificial ventilation are comparatively common in large buildings in the more important towns . Up to the present none of these systems are perfect , though some are more full of imperfections than others . One of these systems , best known as the Plenum System , ' passes the outside air through a kind of purifying and attemperating plant and then distributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cool purified air into rooms at will . This treated air is not by any means the same as the air from the outside , as may be perceived by its effect on different individuals . At the best it is only a system of dilution , which changes the atmosphere in rooms fairly quickly without creating too strong draughts , save in the winter-time when the outside temperature is low ; the draughts from windows and other openings to the outer air are then apt to be excessive . The necessity for ventilation. ? In these days when the elements of hygiene are taught in every primary school , // it is scarcely necessary to discuss this part of the subject . That ventilation is desirable is sufficiently proved by comparing vital statistics concerning bakeries of thirty years ago with those of the present day . Since the Medical Officers of Health have enforced the observance of more cleanly habits of working , of better arrangements in bakeries , of more regular living amongst the working bakers , and of better means of ventilation , the health , general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baker have all enormously improved . There still remains much to be done to improve further the health of the worker and consequently to lessen the risks of disease being spread from this source . In order to keep in good health at least three thousand feet of air are required for every adult person even when doing nothing , hence when at work more than this will be necessary . To obtain such a quantity , the atmosphere must be frequently changed in the rooms ; to do this efficiently , the dimensions of the rooms must be ample , say , not less than six hundred cubic feet of space per worker , and the ceiling never less than ten or twelve feet in height from the floor . Added to this there should be plenty of window space for the admis sion of light ; separate rooms for feeding and resting ; scrupulous cleanliness both in person , clothing , and in the rooms . Then the life of the worker would be more wholesome than it is in many cases at present . CHAPTER XII FUELS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material that can be used to feed a fire so as to generate heat ; fuels therefore may occur in each of the three states of matter ? gas , liquid , and solid . Hydrogen , carbon , carbon monoxide , marsh gas , ethylene , acetylene , and benzene , when treated or combined with oxygen , all generate much heat ; when the combustion takes place with air , the nitrogen present acts as a diluent and considerably lowers the resultant temperature . Hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water ; carbon with oxygen to form , first , carbon monoxide and then carbon dioxide ; in all these cases much heat is developed that can be put to practical use . All the other bodies mentioned contain carbon combined with hydrogen ; the products of combustion with oxygen will be carbon dioxide and water . These two compounds are the ultimate products of combustion when hydrocarbons and carbohydrates are burned in oxygen or air . It should be the aim in all cases of burning to generate heat , to burn the common fuels completely to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excessive quantity of air ; otherwise the air acts as a diluent and causes cooling . All matter not completely burned before the chimney is reached means a loss of heat ; hence all carbon in the form of soot , hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide and other unburnt bodies , points to considerable waste and loss of heat if allowed to pass into the outer atmosphere . Chimney gases ought to consist of nothing but carbon dioxide , water , nitrogen , and 178 // the small excess of air used . Instead of which very large proportions of carbon and carbon monoxide exist in all chimney gases , together with the volatile products from the impurities in the fuel , e.g. sulphur dioxide from sulphur bodies like brasses , ammonium compounds from the nitrogen constituents , etc . The chief gaseous fuels in common use are : ? water gas , ordinary coal gas , carburetted coal gas , oil gas , Mond gas , regenerator gas , and natural earth gases from the neighbourhood of oil wells . The chief constituents of these gases are enumerated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three elements , carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen ; therefore to obtain the maximum heating effect , all other conditions being equal , nothing but carbon dioxide and water with the excess air should pass into the chimney . Liquid fuels include shale oils , petroleum oils , denatured alcohol , and some few other liquids . All liquid fuels before combustion are converted into gases and therefore act similarly to gaseous fuels . In using the shale and petroleum oils , care must be exercised in keeping the burner or carburetter clean , or else loss ensues and noxious vapours will be emitted . The common fuels are the solid ones , and these include various classes of coals and cokes , wood , charcoal , and peat . The particular form of fuel to be used must in a measure depend on the type of oven , hot plate or other baking plant . Thus for side-flue , wagon ovens , and similar types of internally heated ovens , a fuel that gives flame is necessary ; but with hot-air and steam-pipe ovens coke is more suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars clean and free from clinker , and when fuel is required , to push the red-hot cinders towards the back of the furnace and spread a thin layer of fresh fuel near the front of the fire . A kind of distillation of the new fuel then takes place . in which the gases formed pass over the bright part of the fire and are burnt , giving rise to a maximum amount of
