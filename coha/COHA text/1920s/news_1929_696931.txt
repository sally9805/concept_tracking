txt Proposal by the Standard Oil Export Corp . to acquire the Anglo-American Oil Co .. Ltd. has aroused considerable interest here and in England . where Anglo operates , by reason of the international flavor attached to the trade There is also an important investment angle to the proposal because Standard Oil Export . wholly owned by four subsidiaries of the Stand . ard Oil Co . ( N. J. ) . offers to exchange for Anglo ' shares its $5 cumulative preferred stock . This latter is unusual for it is in essence a guaranteed Standard on stock , with its dividends guaranteed severally and jointly by the four companies which own Standard Oil Export.These are Standard Oil Co. of N. J. ( Del . ) ? Humble Oil , Standard Oil of Louisiana and Car ' ter Oil Co . The exchange offer , recently made , has brought in deposits of Anglo stock in volume which is reported satisfactory . Assents have been received from a number of large holders representing a considerable percentage of Angle stock . Acceptance by holders of two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 ' , . IS deposited by January 31 an extension to February 2S. 1930 is provided . Exchange basis is one share of Standard Oil Export 's preferred . callable at 110 , for 5 5-9th shares of Anglo . Considering the r ? eferred at par this puts a price basis of $38 a share on Anglo : that is the price which Standard Oil Export will pay for fractional Anglo shares . Anglo 's Earnings Irregular From the standpoint of earnings , Anglo has shown considerable irregularity in recent years . This has been occasioned by the highly cornThis petitive condition of the gasoline market in the United Kingdom , induced by the fight to keep Russian gasoline out of England , and by Anglo 's ' physical make up . The company is solely a marketing organization , with operations limited to one market and with no bulwark of refineries or crude oil production . Anglo 's chief source of supply of refined products for years has been the American market . The latter was not affected in price to the extent the British retail market was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Kingdom . Thus . Anglo was buying products at prices based on a world parity when the British market was 4 to 6 cents a gallon less than the world panty , ocean freight considered . This ' condition was relieved to considerable degree early this year when Anglo made a trading and purchase arrangement with the Soviet Naphtha - Syndicate and prices of products in the United Kingdom were restored to a world parity . The experience . however , showed that an oil company isolated to one market was at an extreme disadvantage contrasted with oil units which . physically and geographically , were thoroughly integrated . Dividend Record . in Contrast The Anglo American 's earnings show the effect of the trade war in England . They went from just short of $7.000.000 in 1925. and about $8.000.000 in 1926. to a mere $1.000,000 in 1927 rising to about $2,000.000 in 192S . Dividends , likewise , were affected considerably , dropping from $6,413,000 in 1926. the largest dividend year of the four , to $1,015,127 in 1928 ; payment of $4.235,632 in dividends in 1927 resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividend payments are larger , amounting to slightly more than $3,100,000 , but this is the only indication so far of 1929 earnings . In the four years . 1925 to 3928. inclusive . Anglo reported aggregate profits for the ordinary shares of $17,870.886 ? representing an annual average of $4.467.721 . In the same four years cash dividends totaled 814.754,376 , an annual average of $3.688,594 . These dividends represented close to 83 ' , of the net income reported as available for distribution to ordinary shares . It is interesting to contrast this dividend record with the liability assumed by the Standard Oil Export Co. for payment of dividends on the preferred offered for exchange . Full exchange of Anglo for Standard Oil Export preferred would result in the issuance of approximately 768,000 shares of 5. -i ? preferred . Annual dividend payments on these would call for a yearly outlay of $3,840.000. or something more than the average annual disbursement by Anglo in the four years , but less than average profits . What Stockholders Will Get By the exchange . Anglo holders would be giving up equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strong guarantee as to principal and dividends . Each 5 5-9ths share of Anglo exchanged for one share of Export preferred would get dividends equivalent to 90 cents a share a year on Anglo American stock ; this contrasts with 73 cents a share paid by Anglo this year and 241z. cents a share paid in 1928 . For American holders of Anglo American the dividend return , therefore , would be larger than in the past several years ; for English holders the question of income tax , about 20. , on the Export company 's preferred dividend. , would be a factor , as Anglo 's dividends are paid , tax free . Even paying this tax , there would remain equivalent of 72 cents a share on Anglo , I or a net return larger than Anglo 's tax free dividend payments the past few years . Aside from financial considerations , the opinion is strong that Anglo American would be a greatly strengthened oil entity and in far better shape to move forward to cope with world oil conditions by reason of the proposed alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , as set forth by F. E. Powell , chairman , in his letter to Anglo American shareholders stating : " Your company 's activities are entirely confined to the marketing side of the business and your directors have in mind that under existing conditions a purely marketing company is at a considerable disadvantage . Your directors , therefore , consider that it would be to the stockholders ' interest to exchange their Anglo shares for guaranteed shares in a company closely associated with powerful producers and refiners and have no hesitation in strongly recommending them to accept this offer .
