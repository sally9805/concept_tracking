This rest riction holds not only in Ecuador hut also in the adjoining Republic of Peru . A recent extensive tour through these countries revealed sonic very strihing incidents resulting ( ruin the revenue-producing measure . Sailors and tourists were fined fur using American matches or automatic lighters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : REVENUE ACT DANGERS . Two Sections of the New Measure Called Radical and Pernicious . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have been surprised that there has not been more public attention given in the press to Sections 611 and 612 of the Revenue act of 1928 as it recently passed the House of Representatives . The fact that these paragraphs in a very voluminous bill are very brief and couched in language to make them look innocuous perhaps accounts for the lack of attention that they have had . However , I think they contain the most radical and pernicious proposals that have ever been introduced in Congress . If they become law , it would be equivalent in effect to the referendum and recall , not of Judges but of Supreme Court and other United States court decisions , which would be nullified . Section 612 by proposing to repeal Section 1,106 ( a ) of the Revenue act of 1926 as of Feb. 26 , 1926 , the date on which it passed , is an attempt by Congress to say that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years never was law . If Congress can relive the past and do this , it would seem to establish a precedent that all succeeding Congresses could follow , and that a tax liability would never be finally settled , but would be at the will of Congress in perpetuity . Section 1,106 ( a ) in the act of 1926 declared that the statute of limitations in all the previous revenue acts not only barred the remedy but extinguished the liability . The passage of Section 612 repealing 1,106 ( a ) would , therefore , seek to revive liabilities declared extinguished under the previous act . This would appear to be entirely unconstitutional in the light of United States Supreme Court decision ( 268 U. S. 633 ) , in which case the Court stated that where not only the remedy but the liability has been specifically extinguished by law a later act can not revive the liability , as it would be depriving a person of property without due process of law . Section 611 would nullify the decision of the Supreme Court rendered Feb. 21 , 1927 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company and proposes to retroactively extend the statute of limitations in all acts from 1916-17 down to date to a period one year after the passage of the proposed 1928 act . If these sections should pass , the gravest injustices and inequities would ensue and hundreds of taxpayers would be forced to go into litigation up to the Supreme Court of the United States to protect their rights . Hundreds of others would have to submit to being mulcted because the amounts involved would not be large enough to justify the expense of such litigation . Unless the taxpayers of the country wake up to appreciate what this means and to make their protests heard through their Senators at Washington , these sections , which passed the House without comment , may also pass the Senate and not only put a disgraceful record on our statute books , but cause unforeseeable trouble and expense to taxpayers generally and . congest the courts for years to come . EUGENE H. OUTERBRIDGE . New York , Jan. 31 , 1928 . ECONOMY IN COURT HOUSES . City Could Save Money by Utilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times : Nearly a year ago our Supreme Court vacated the old so-called Tweed Court House on the Chambers Street side of the City Hall Park , and took possession of the new court house  --  the product of nearly fifteen years of effort and expenditure of $25,000,000 . Lawyers and Judges have not found this new court house altogether satisfactory , and recall some merits in the building vacated . Upon such change propaganda was immediately started for a new building for our City Court . This was perfectly natural for the reason that the so-called brownstone building occupied by that court was too small , inconvenient and altogether unfit for it ; was in fact an eyesore which deserved to be utterly destroyed . If a new structure for the City Court is erected , the city will , of course , be shouldered with a huge bill for construction . Without any adequate expression of informed public opinion it has been assumed that the Tweed Court House should be demolished , largely because of the prejudice against it arising from its original great expense and its association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To thus throw away this structure , I submit , would be a gross waste of public property . That the city was robbed of vast sums of money in the erection of the Tweed Court House is true , but obviously that loss can not be restored by the proposed destruction . I am familiar with the appearance and architecture of the various public buildings in our city and I assert that at least the external architecture of the Tweed Court House is superior to that of most of our public buildings , if not actually unsurpassed in classic beauty . With the expenditure on reconstruction of the interior of not over one-tenth , or at most one-fifth , of the amount probably required for a new building for the City Court the Tweed Court House could be made not merely fit for the purpose , but a source of pride to our city . The location is far more convenient than any other that could be suggested . With the removal of the unsightly brownstone building , the beauty of the Tweed Court House would be a revelation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall would not mar the beauty of the latter , though , of course , the style of architecture is quite different . Why not thus utilize this building ? We have already paid for it many years ago , and marked the cost off our books . Tweed is dead , but the building itself erected with taxes we have contributed still lives . Why not forget Tweed and consider the intrinsic worth of the building itself for the purpose indicated and make the best of it ? I ! GILBERT D. LAMB , No% York , Feb. 1 , 192S.
