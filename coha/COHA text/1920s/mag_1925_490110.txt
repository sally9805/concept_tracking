TO bring an old joke up to date  --  we gather that the telephone number of one of our better families is being changed to Rhinelander o 000 . THE worries of Jimmy Walker , recently elected Mayor of our city , are over for the time being . It is now the public 's turn to be worried . In this age of Dream Stories Magazine , Physical Culture Magazine , Tabloid Newspapers , Harold Bell Wright , and the New Republic , a man who has n't been able to read anything but faces since he was a boy , certainly deserves the highest honor in the land . But will he keep the pledges that have elected him ? Can he maintain his high standard of illiteracy ? Publishers and authors have money to burn , these days . There is always the danger of bribery . Do not betray the confidence the people of New York have placed in you , Jimmy Walker ! BEING an American who was brought up in the European tradition , we observe two things with astonishment . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and Fifth Avenue is not going to be unworthy of the beautiful Bush Terminal towards which it faces from afar ; the other is that the modern and entirely French taste now running riot over the exterior of the Brevoort House is very very bad . Perhaps , we shall not Shave to go to Paris to die after all . TILL the old lady in black lace persists in driving through Forty-fourth Street in her brougham . For five decades she has been doing it . We recollect a few decades ago the scorn of her coachman for the chauffeur . Of late , however , the eyes of this jehu have been harried and his demeanor has been that of one who is losing his grip . He carries his whip jauntily still ; yet his shoulders are the shoulders of a broken man . The battle has been won . There is still a little mopping up to do  --  hut not much . IT is only natural that the friends of Red Grange should publish their intention of putting him in Congress . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least resistance , be an adept at side stepping , and if necessary achieve his goal by climbing on the backs of his fellows . The thing against Grange 's candidacy is that he offers a stiff arm when running . THE Fifth Avenue busses , after a long and dignified career , have come out with signs on their respectable exteriors as follows : Service with a Smile and Polite Transportation . It looks as if the bus kings had been sold at last by a go-getter . Prob-ably it 's a good thing . Our only feel-ing is that if they had come to us , we could have thought up something much less flat than either of their slo-gans . We would have charged nothing .

Perth Amboy police list one thousand THE NEW YORKER Geniis J ' HE E chef to M. Ignace Paderewski receives almost as much publicity en tow- as does the pianist ; partly because he is a good chef , and partly because be insists that the world be made aware of his genius . To this his master assents . Anything for peace and shelter from the run of table food of the railroad diner . More , M. Paderewski makes a point of complimenting his chef frequently . " Tell the chef , " he said , lately , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous , the roast superb , and the ice cream unsurpassable . " The waiter relayed the message and returned , duly , with the answer . " The chef says , " he told M. Paderewski , " that the soup was excellent , too . " Mechanics AI3ORATORIES of late have I been very active producing music . Witness the Victor Orthophone , the John Hays Hammond Jr . piano pedal , and the Brunswick Panatrope . Orthophone and Panatrope , when the smoke clears away , mean Phonograph ? or , more justly , Better Phonograph We mentioned some time ago having heard the Orthophone , and now we mention hearing the Panatrope and a description of the Panatrope 's inwards by a very glib tongued head of the sales department . It did not give us that feeling of being back in the room where the instruments were being played that we got when listening to the Victor . But we learned that the vibrations of the needle , instead of being reduced to sound by the diaphram in a sound box , are sublimated through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio will understand this at once . There is also a dial which regulates the volume of sound . One 's phonograph , then , will bellow or whisper at a touch from now on . MR . HAMMOND , in the mean- time steps in with a fourth pedal for the piano , which may be good news for Paderewski , but is no help to those who ca n't use three . The new mechanism consists of a battery of shutters , precisely like those on the front of some automobile radiators , on the upper and under side of a sound-proof box in which the piano wires are built . The sound , or music , is theoretically contained in the box until wanted , and then is liberated by stepping on th , pedal which opens the slats . A note can be hit and the slats opened to that it grows louder , instead of softer , and the great defect of the piano , which is that it is not like an organ , can thus be remedied . One critic who does n't sec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than like a banjo , says the instrument sounds as if someone were playing an ordinary piano , in the closet and opening and shutting the door . Another man ? Olin Downes of the Times  --  refuses to commit himself . Lester Donahue , who plays it , says it is wonderful . We agree with Mr. Downes . The invention belongs so far to Mr. Hammond , who had it built into his piano in Gloucester , where he does most of his inventing . Paint THE husband of Miss H ope Hampton , the eminent Jules Bralatour , film maker , to mark the coming season , presented his wife with a new automobile . The film world , one is privileged to observe , has never been conservative in the matter of automobiles ; and the car in question was noticeably upholstered and painted in robin 's egg blue . It appears that one of the first trips out of the garage included a stop at Tiffany 's . After duly purchasing , Miss Hampton summoned her chauffeur with an imperious gesture of her gloved hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped forward , and Miss Hampton made as if to get in . But a firm hand detained her . " Stand back , young lady , " said an Amazonian person severely , " I hailed this cab first . " There is a rumor that Mr. Brulatour will receive a bill covering cost of repainting . Color dark blue . Library ACROSS from my chair in the " American History Wing of the Public Library , I found Mr. James Boyd , author , engaged in research for the novel to succeed " Drums " , which was hailed last season as the first honest fictional limning of the American Revolutionary scene . And he , too , I observed , was forced periodically to abandon his labors , descend from the top floor of the building into the chill of Fifth Avenue , and take his sustaining whiff of tobacco . After watching these frequent interruptions and suffering all too many myself , I summoned all my crusading pluck and called at the Director 's office . We , who have found the library an inspiriting and comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to smoke over the reading tables . Nor is the demand for a cushioned lounge . Just a hare room , would be good enough . Withered by the bold announceeral other persons in an East Side apartment , where the hostess tactfully entertained the callers with a piano rendition of one of Beethoven 's works . " Did you write that , Mr. Kern ? " inquired a fair young thing . " No , " interposed a gentleman who knew his Whistler , " not yet . " Death Watch THIS'the least promising of thea- trical Seasons in the opinions of the prophets of August , has produced an unusual number of successes thus far . Producers with plays and musical comedies ready , they hope , for Broadway presentations are being forced to keep them wandering about the provinces , meantime watching with eager eyes for the first sign of failure that will release a playhouse for another trial . Not , of course , that everything that has trod the boards of Broadway has been an instantaneous success . Far from such . More than sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least half of them have wilted and drooped away . But nearly fifty per cent of its enterprises on a paying basis before mid-November is indeed unusual in the annals of the theatre . And the successes are real successes . Not the most blase of the treasurers but feels a thrill when he surveys the expanse of figures at the foot of his financial statement . There are musical comedies in town which approach weekly gross receipts of fifty thousand dollars . They do not quite reach this sum , but they come close enough to permit its acceptance . And there are dramas luring very nearly twenty-five thousand dollars each week . These , let it be said , mean obese profits . From ten to fifteen thousand dollars weekly . And , if you care to carry this on for a forty-week run , you will see why those companies which are marking time in the hinterland are tittering loud , frantic wails . This summary , naturally , does not take into account the perennial " Abie 's Irish Rose " . Previous seasons did not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are not the persons to depart from precedent . Clarity WHAT with one thing and another  --  mostly another ? Herr Carl Laemmle , the genial Teutonic impressario of Universal Pictures , is in a fair way of becoming a legend . One of his Super-Jewels was run off for his judgment . The story was approved ; the photography termed excellent ; the direction came in for a word of praise . But the title- " Othe Pin-nacle ! ' " grunted Herr Laemmle . " Wot in hell is a Pinnacle ! Nobody knows . Call it ' Blind Husbands . ' " And it was so called . Last Rites yes , Princeton beats Harvard , V and then beats Yale , but be it not forgotten that Harvard and Yale have ment that at least one New Yorker would make the matter a life work , and never cease hammering upon the matter until Lady Nicotine was re-ceived at court , the Director gave ground to the extent of promising to think it over . The result of his medi-tations will be heralded in due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ler 's influence is still strong in the world of chit-chat . The latest victim of his transcribed wit was Mr. Jerome Kern . Mr. Kern fore-gathered with sev " Well , I 'm glad you finally got yourself a mu ffler ! " still to play . On one day a year , the Grand Central abandons its jolly cosmopolitan air , dons its Oxford hags , its Dobbs hat , its Dunhill pipe , and becomes one of the old grads . Limousines and taxicabs splutter , choke , and swear at each other in Vanderbilt Avenue ; youths with glowing noses , girls with bright eyes ; couples on the dog trot from snatching food in the Commodore and Biltmore , bachelors from the Yale and Harvard Clubs ; millionaires from everywhere . " Flop down here , Marge , we 'll stay here till we get put out anyway . " This is in the Pullman . " Everything 's all balled up to-day ; always is . " From Drawing Room A , come staccato rings for the porter . " Hey George ( George Ade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George " attend ) bring us some ice and some White Rock  --  and a corkscrew ! " Hours and more hours ; inexplicable delays in outlandish countrysides  --  but who cares ? ? . . And then the porter , brush in hand : " Next stop Back Bay . Yassuh. jes ' follow the crowd suh ; kai n't go wrong . " The caballers of football chew their nails in attics , poets starve , the Pigmy woman pounds her grain in Africa ; but do n't forget that once a year Yale plays Harvard . Revision n NE  --  particularly this one  --  hopes that the repertory theatre at Number 66 Fifth Avenue will open its doors and settle down to the innocuous desuetude of success . For it has developed that this department 's nomination for an opening play , " Ragged Edge " , of Czecho-Slovakian origin , has been shoved back into fourth place , and that Number 66 is to get under way December 8 with a " satire on brittle people " by , of all persons , Mr. Gilbert Seldes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. George Cronyn , who is not unknown among little theatres , is to be director , and our candidate , Mr. Jacob Ben-Ami , will not be seen until after Mr. Seldes 's play has moved to Broadway , and been followed by two weeks of Carolinian folk-plays . Then will come Mr. Ben-Ami , starring in Ibsen 's " Ghost " . OUR further good faith is evidenced in a last attempt to get the title of Mr. Deems Taylor 's composition for Paul Whiteman into print in the singular . Last week we wrote a sparkling story merely to prove that it was " Circus Day " , instead of " Circus Days " , as formerly quoted . And our conscientiousness was only equalled by that of our proof-reader who meticulously reinserted an abominable and ungracious " 5 " . Democratic Aristocracy Q UCH is the secrecy of present day LI incognito that the recent visit of the Japanese Prince and Princess Asaka afforded hardly a column a day in the metropolitan press . And Mr. Oscar Tschirky , of the Waldorf , lending a discreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after their departure , it was announced that he was to be , henceforth , free of the encumberance of routine restaurant management , free to devote his time to the recognizing and handshaking of celebrities ... that and writing a book on recollections of New York restaurants . The Prince and Princess were notably democratic , the aim of all visiting nobility , as it is the anathema of less genuine celebrities . They bowed to their subjects and shook hands with Oscar and with Secret Service officials every morning . They lunched on American dishes , and played golf , and were rather sweetly patient of the attentions of the press . It is pleasantly interesting to note democracy in America , even if we must import aristocracy to demonstrate it . Commerce IT will he a good art year , dealers I say . Their predictions are based on the early interest in the first important exhibits , Degas sculpture , Vlaminck and Utrillo . Dudensing sold , in Paris , a Degas for $80,000 to a Western man , and later his two large Stellas . Dudensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price in a year . The famous collection sold at Fearon 's last Autumn went for prices that seem silly now . A small Matisse offered last Spring for $800 with no takers , is being brought back for $/200 . Montross opened a show of water colors by Robert Hallowell , and by mid-week had sold fifty of them . Water colors , by the way , sell rapidly to owners of modern apartments . They blend well with any sort of decorator 's scheme . Abuse THE din of denunciation echoes , these days , in the ears of the cinema magnates . It was a great surprise to me to find an executive of the Hollywood industries devouring such a hearty lunch in Pierres the other day . But his appetite , it developed in conversation , was something forced , unnatural . " Bah , " he told me , " what a picture I could make of the soul-consuming Simon Legree of the movies . I would picture the bloated millionaire of the movies as he is to-day , cowering behind his desk . Over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying , do you think I can exist on five thousand dollars a week ! I am only a young girl still and I ca n't throw away my life . ' And behind her stands a supercilious young author . ' Fifty thousand , for that novel . I tell you , you are a common bandit . ' The mob of the picture , a real Parisian , cobblestone tearing mob , presses in behind them , theatre owners , hookers , critics , exacting public . " That is the real I , as I am to-day . If the press could only see that picture of me ! Why , " he paused to allow the waiter to serve his asparagus , " I am the most harried , wretched . . . " But the tears came to my eyes and I could bear it no longer . Further Query NEW YORK 'S edition of " Ham-let " in modern raiment has most pleasantly answered this department 's queries concerning the treatment of mooted points . Hamlet is 71-IE NEW YORKER disclosed in a Tuxedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver , the means to the end of Polonius ; Miss Helen Chandler is an Ophelia in simple , girlish frocks . But it has aroused as many questions again . Why , for instance , does what by every indication should be a trick performance , turn out to seem so extraordinarily natural ? Does contemporary dress , as one critic explained , make the actors forget they are in " Hamlet " and allow them to be themselves ? Or is it that the audience of to-day has not the imagination to " feel " a play in costume , but must have the actors dressed as they in order to emotionally react . For certainly there was emotional reaction in the cheering first nighters , and , as the gentleman behind me explained : " That 's the first time I 've ever understood Shakespearian English . " With something of a personal interest , there came to this performance , the gentleman who advises theatre program readers what the well dressed man will wear , doing this under the pseudonym of Beau Nash . For a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attire , " he mused . " I do hope that some day someone will do as much for an audience . " Wet  --  and Yet ASSUMING , G , as we have always as- I sumed , that Mr. Buckner 's ambition is to be governor , his denial of even that one phrase in the interview with him in last week 's NEW YORKER it something for his friends and political advisers to deplore . The bold , and also the shrewd , attitude for him , was to stand beligerently behind the reasonably intelligent statements he made , rather than allow Mr. Wayne Wheeler to stampede him into halfhearted retreat . Holding manfully to some such position as Mr. Buckner outlined , a candidate might discern , betimes , cohorts strolling towards his standards . IN this harassed moment , we have I but to flee to the current issue of Harpers , beckoning for Mr. Wheeler to join us if , perchance , he wants something again to put his hair on end .
