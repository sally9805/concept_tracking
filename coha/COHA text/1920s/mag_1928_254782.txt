William Randolph Hearst has built another house . It is a squarish house , stolid , concrete , spotted with wide windows , utilitarian . It cost $3,000,000 . The money was mostly spent for speed . <P> From this house will each day issue the myriad copies of Hearst 's New York Journal ( evening ) and American ( morning ) . It is alive with rollers , chutes , conveyors to carry copy , proof , type to contact points in the process of rushing news to newsboy . In the " fudge " room stand three linotype machines next to telegraph instruments where telegraphic flashes tell sudden death , discovery , disaster . From the machines , conveyors carry the type galley directly to the presses . News , newspapers think , should be gobbled hot . The American and Journal have every known device to sell it smoking . <P> In such a strictly business plant there is little room for luxury . Only Arthur Brisbane is pampered . The famed concoctor of editorial paragraphs has a private library , dressing room , shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tall Ritz Tower . But even in his spacious suite the desks , where work is done , are made of metal . No New Year 's work was done on them ; Mr. Brisbane far from Manhattan as he often is , wrote paragraphs from a desert in California .
