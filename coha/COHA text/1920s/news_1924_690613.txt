txt It is rather strange that Nickel Plate common sells off so far from its market value based on the - prices of the three stocks that do or will go to make up this value . The only explanation is to be found in the doubt of the plan 's final acceptance . The statement has been made frequently that Nickel Plate held free from pledge its 155,000 share- of Chesapeake &; Ohio and 120,000 shares of Pere Marquette , and there has been no denial , although there has been some quibbling over the manner in which payment was rustle . As the old Nickel Plate wail become a holding compans- , the price of its common stock should come some : where near the sum of the prices of its treasury holdings , as they exist or will be . With new Nickel Plate common selling at 74 , Chesapeake at 85 and Pere  --  Marquette at 61 , the equivalent price of old Nickel Plate should be 141 , sahereas the market is around 117 , or a spread of 24 points . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of price relationships . The issue in the Jersey courts between Wilson &; Co. on the one hand , and stockholder Klein ' and State Banking Commissioner Maxson , on the other , is one squarely of - common sense . Lawyer Harris , as counsel for Klein , claims to be trying to protect the interests of common stockholders ( whom he calls " small " stockholders as differentiated from holders of preferred stock and bonds , for whom protective committees have been formed ) . For that purpose of protection , he has attempted to move the insolvency proceedings against Wilson d Co. back to the Chancery court , from which they had been transferred to a Federal court upon the accepted claim of the company that ' the state court could have no jurisdiction in the matter of an organization incorporated in another state . ( in this case New York ) . except as to property owned within New Jersey , and upon the further claim that Wilson &; Co. technically and legally owns no property and does no business in New Jersey , because it holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New Jersey . In short , Mr. Harris 's method is to confuse the issue and prevent the Jersey proceedings from being dropped as the company asks . Wilson &; Co. has obtained the appointment of friendly receivers in New York and has complete control over its affairs , since the parent organization is incorporated in New York . It would seem that Mr. Maxson , who was appointed receiver in New Jersey on the petition of Klein. can not possibly protect the interests of stockholders of a company over which it is admitted he has no control . whatever may be the merits of Klein 's and Harris ' claim as to his control over property which the company may or may not have in New . Tcrsey . As to Klein 's rights as a stockholder ( it being assumed that he is protecting his own interests as well as those of other stockholders ) it should be remembered as a matter of common justice that he bought his stock this year when information as to the company 's difficulties had already become public and when , consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Of course , the increase , satisfactory as it is , does not , yet indicate more than modes ate buying . The steel tion is improved . but it is still spotty , the heaviest demand coming from the Chicago district .

Number of opportunities for arbitraging 171 the Van Sweringen stocks that appear to be going begging has given rise to considerable surprise , but all of them contain elements of risk . On the one side will he an absolute commitment and on the other a contingent commitment . Chesapeake &; Ohio preferred is selling 7 or R points above its exchange value , but an arbitrage here would Involve a long commitment in new Nickel Plate preferred and a short sale of C. &; 0 preferred .

A situation just the reverse exists with respect to Erie prefer red stocks . They are selling below 3S and their exchange ? nlue , based on the price of new Nickel Plate preferred , is hsi.ween 41 and 42 . The risk here is that the short committer* in Nickel Plate preferred might he cancelled , with a possible loss of 10 points in the Erie preferred issues if the deal fell through .
