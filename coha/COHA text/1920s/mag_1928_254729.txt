Anecdote <P> Last week Secretary Andrew William Mellon furnished Funnyman Harry Lauder with an anecdote than which Sir Harry and some 240,000 others had seldom heard a better . The anecdote : It seems that the U. S. Treasury Department and U. S. taxpayers had , between them , made many a mistake in the amounts of taxes payable for fiscal years from 1927 back to 1925 and beyond . These mistakes netted the U. S. a total overpayment of $103,858,687.78 . Last week Secretary Mellon sent Congress the names-numbering some 240,000 and taking up 12,133 typed pages- of the taxpayers who had overpaid and were owed specified refunds . Among the names was Sir Harry Lauder 's . He was to get back $5,403.62 as soon as Congress should authorize Secretary Mellon 's list. * <P> Other names , other refunds : <P> Aline T.
