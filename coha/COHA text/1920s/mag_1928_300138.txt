Fast Life . Better had this piece been called Slow Death . It is another from fecund Playsmith Samuel Shipman . The male party to a companionate marriage is accused of murdering a friend . It turned out that the real murderer was the son of the Governor , but this development was not permitted to have any effect until the unjustly accused was seated in the electric chair , a hood over his head . <P> By Request . Bill Abbott ( Elliott Nugent ) is a tanktown newsman summering in Manhattan for business reasons . Claudia Wynn ( Verree Teasdale ) , a blandishing literary agent , wants to cut capers with him at Bar Harbor . Just then Mrs. Abbott ( Norma Lee ) comes bringing her fetching navet from the plains and salvages her husband in two acts of dubious psychology . But if the psychology is brittle , Mr. Nugent 's comic gaucherie is quite successful . He elicits considerable amusement despite a trite plot and an uneven script . Furthermore , Miss Teasdale is as lush a blonde as one is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. C. ) and son ( Elliott ) Nugent wrote the play . Father , son and son 's wife ( Norma Lee ) all appeared in it . <P> Chee-Chee . Such is the babyish title of an Eastern and elaborate musical comedy whose plot depends , not upon romance and cotton-wool , but upon the hero 's efforts to avoid castration . The hero is the son , born in early wedlock , of the Grand Eunuch . Not wishing to be his father 's successor , he flees the royal city in company with his wife , Chee-Chee . On the road , they are beset by Tartars , monks and brigands who beat the hero and take Chee-Chee off-stage for purposes which can be guessed . Finally the Grand Eunuch catches up with his son and prepares to have him fitted for high office ; but a friend of Chee-Chee , Li-Li-Wee , persuades her husband to kidnap and impersonate the surgeon . Li-Li-Wee 's husband then plays dominoes with the son of the Grand Eunuch instead of operating on him ; thus providing the most extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It must be admitted that Chee-Chee , though sometimes cute and always dirty , is not consistently amusing . Herbert Fields deduced the book from Charles Petit 's novel . Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart managed to engender " Better Be Good to Me " and " I Must Love You , " but they were neither lyrically nor musically up to standards of their Garrick Gaieties or A Connecticut Yankee . Helen Ford as Chee-Chee and Betty Starbuck as Li-Li-Wee were respectively arch and charming . George Hassell squealed and grunted in cagey fashion as the Grand Eunuch . Chee-Chee would be funnier if it did not so faithfully preserve its " you 're mine and I love you " attitude toward the slimy joke of compulsory castration . The critics were shocked , and the decent public , eager doubtless to see the sumptuous settings , crawled , in surreptitious droves , to see Chee-Chee . <P>
