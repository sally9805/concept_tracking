This Monday , while oil-drilling " wildcatters " were digesting the significance of President Hoover 's oil conservation policy ( see p. 16 ) , Thomas B. Slick , the king of all " wildcatters , " credited with being the largest individual oil operator in the world , completed the sale of all his producing lands to the Prairie Oil &; Gas Co . These properties-cream of the Seminole , Kay , Kansas , and North Texas fields-yield 34,000 barrels a day , and will bring Prairie 's gross daily production up to about 105,000 barrels . They put into Producer Slick 's pocket between $50,000 and $60,000 per day . Reports from Tulsa put the sale price at $40,000,000 ; but Prairie Chairman-of-the-Board W. S. Fitzpatrick said it was less , while refusing to give actual figures . <P> As a youth Tom Slick went West to seek his fortune . Starting in the oil fields of Southern Illinois , he followed the derricks as roustabout , mule-skinner , tool-dresser , driller . With dollars accumulated from purchase and sale of oil leases during boom years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More dollars ; another dry hole . Again he drilled . Oil . Fortune . He sold his first holdings for $2,500,000 , and took a flier in rails , in utilities . But oil paid better . He returned to the fields , making more money to buy rail holdings . Fortune turned to vast fortune . He built a railroad ; he became a power in transit . Oil gushed for him steadily through the years . <P> Today , at about 46 , he is " a mass of nerves and a bundle of nerve . " He wants a good rest . But acres of undeveloped land , undrilled , remain his . They may beckon .
