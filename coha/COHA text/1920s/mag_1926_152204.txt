ARMY &; NAVY <P> Last week , in two hours one afternoon and with comparatively little ado , the House of Representatives passed a bill that is the chief net outcome of the great excitement created last fall by Colonel William Mitchell 's sensational attack on the Army Air Service ( TIME , Sept. 14 et seq . ) . <P> It authorizes* the expenditure of $150,000,000 over a period of five years . At the end of that period 2,200 first-class fighting planes are to have been provided , and 1,650 regular flying officers and 550 reserve officers are to be on active duty . There will also be 15,000 enlisted men in the service , 500 of whom are flying cadets . <P> The provisions of the bill are so framed that ultimately every man in the Air Service will be a flyer , that at least a fifth of the pilots shall be enlisted men , that there will be an equitable promotion list for air officers , that there will be some eight instead of three flying officers on the General Staff ( composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Service must be an actual flying officer . <P> There was so little objection to the bill that the " ayes " and " noes " were not even taken . <P> <P> * Not to be confused with an actual appropriation . Before the money is spent , the Budget Bureau will have to approve the expenditure which it is desired to make from time to time , and Congress must actually appropriate the money out of the Treasury .
