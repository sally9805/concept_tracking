The Work of the Friends DURING the period in which the rulers of the civilized world elected to accomplish by war the high purposes which animated them all , the position of the Friends was one of extreme embarrassment . They did not yield to any other sect in love of country . They did not disclaim their share of responsibility for the tragedy in which all peoples were involved . Least of all did they desire to adopt a merely negative or obstructionist attitude . They felt keenly their inability to share the emotion which animated their fellow-countrymen , and which for a moment seemed actually capable of being translated into the victory for humanity which would justify the war . And yet " they were inwardly pledged to a way of life , which , if extended through the world , would eliminate the seeds of war . . . . They could not of a sudden change the faith of a life-time and substitute the methods of war for the slower forces of love and cooperation . " The war was a challenge to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from without and an urge from within that the American Friends Service Committee was formed , April 30 , 1917 , " to assist all Friends in America in making an adequate contribution to the needs of the hour , " and to fulfill " the present mission that is ours in expressing in a world so sadly bent upon destruction , the constructive Gospel of Goodwill . " It is one heartening fact that the Friends have been able to make of their position , so exposed to assault both by government and public opinion as to promise little beyond mere survival , a strategic base for the operation of those forces which represent the only constructive element in the world today . Their work is one unflawed and entirely inspiring product , of these troubled years . In a war which it is now a commonplace to say that none of the combatants won , the victory remains with the peace makers . The Friends are among the smallest of Christian denominations , only 150,000 of them in the world . Of these the English Friends number 20,000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first year of the World War the American Friends supported their English brethren in their War Victims Relief Committee , and sent volunteers to their ambulance unit . When the United States entered the war this cooperation assumed larger proportions , though it is with a smile that one reads in Bulletin Number One of the American Friends Service Committee that " the work already undertaken at home and abroad will require a monthly budget of $20,000 . " This work as outlined in the bulletin of June 15 , 1917 , anticipated support in connection with the English friends of reconstruction work in France , Russia and Serbia . Naturally the work in France assumed first importance . Themodest personnel of seven workers in June , 1917 , had grown to 6os by June , 1919 . The total budget of the American Friends had expanded from $511,542.21 in 1917-18 , to $3,178,015.48 in 1919-20 . The end of the war opened to the Friends a larger field . The populations of the enemy countries had suffered , on the whole , far more during the war than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocious policy of starvation enforced by the blockade until the spring of 1919 , prolonged this suffering . To the sense of responsibility for this needless aggravation of the misery of the enemy peoples was added the sense of opportunity to give practical form to that good will toward them of which they had been so repeatedly assured by Mr. Wilson . In May , 1919 , the Friends began relief work in Austria , and by July the number of persons fed at their stations had reached 632,300 . In July , 1919 , Miss Jane Addams , Doctor Alice Hamilton and Miss Carolena Wood visited Germany and Austria on behalf of the Friends , and issued their memorable report . They found 70 percent of German children , a total of 10,000,000 , undernourished . In February , 192o , Mr. Hoover addressed a special communication to the Friends , asking for their assistance in feeding the people of Central Europe , and for this purpose turned over to them certain funds of the American Relief Administration . The Amerikanische Kinderhelfsmission was opened in Berlin in January , 1920 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stations was 3,392 , and the number of children fed , 632 , - 000 . The German government itself supplied flour and sugar to the amount of between five and six million dollars , paid costs of insurance and transportation , and furnished subordinate workers . On July 31 , 1922 , in accordance with their fixed policy of withdrawing from a country when its own resources seem sufficient , the Friends turned over their establishments for the feeding of children in Germany to the German Central Committee . The work of the Friends in Russia during 1921-22 is fresh in all minds . At the present time the feeding of children in the institutions of Russia continues and programs for the rehabilitation of agriculture and for medical relief are being carried forward . In Austria , a three year campaign against tuberculosis is being waged . In Poland , the effort of the Friends is directed toward rebuilding in the devastated regions . But the chief undertaking before the American Friends is the resumption of relief in Germany , control of which has been transferred back to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desperate phase of the situation in that country . The scope of this undertaking may be realized when it is considered that during the last summer some 500,000 children were fed each day one meal of Soo calories at a cost per meal of two cents . For this there were operated 1,700 kitchens , 2,5oo feeding stations and 300 warehouses . About 20,000 helpers , mostly volunteers , were employed in the preparation and distribution of food . With the resumption of control by the Friends , however , it is found that 2,000,000 children are already designated by physicians as in immediate need of food . In the report of Mr. W. K. Thomas , Executive Secretary of the Service Committee , occur the fateful words " Food must be supplied at once if their lives are to be saved . " The winter feeding period from November 5 to April i6 , includes 141 feeding days , and at the rate of $. o194 for each meal , one meal a day , the total sum needed is $5,489,320 . But it must be remembered that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows by leaps and bounds . Mr. Arthur Fisher , in the New York Evening Post for November 13 refers to a survey by the experts of the United States Departments of Agriculture and Commerce , in cooperation with German and foreign relief agencies , which puts the number of persons dependent upon charity at 9,000,000 . Since this survey was made the continuing breakdown of the central government places the entire industrial population of 30,000,000 in jeopardy . In view of these figures Mr. Thomas 's statement seems a modest one We believe it will be necessary to raise at least $10000,000 in the United States . This must be regarded as a minimum amount for it may be necessary to increase that figure by many millions of dollars . Adults as well as children may have to be fed before this winter , which promises to be the worst in Germany 's history , has passed . The German government proposes to continue to supply a large part of the food stuffs , but with the resources of that government uncertain , and its very existence in doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? responsibility in their history . In carrying it out they have the assistance of an All American Committee , headed by Major General Henry T. Allen and including Messrs . Bernard M. Baruch , Paul D. Cravath , Charles W. Eliot , Miss Jane Addams and Miss Julia C. Lathrop . They should have the support and approval of all Americans . For the case of Germany is without precedent among nations . De Quincey 's description of the horrors of the Flight of a Tartar Tribe comes to Mind as the nearest parallel . The Tartars , men , women and children , were driven across Asia by Pursuing cavalry , but at least they had the relief that comes from physical flight . The Germans are tortured by the more complicated processes of Civilization , and they must stand still in their places and watch the weaker among them , especially thechildren , already dwarfed and stunted by years of undernourishment , at last die . The fact indicated by mortality tables that Germany has been able by scientific methods to keep so large a part of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony and accumulates the horror . There can be no doubt as to the actual shortage of food in Germany . The consumption has fallen to seventy-three percent of prewar figures . Even before the war Germany was obliged to import food , paying for it with the manufactured products which came from , or depended upon , the Ruhr and Upper Silesia . With these industrial provinces cut off it is difficult to see how Germany herself can finance this importation . The New York Times talks about there being enough food in Germany to last until next April , and implies that it is the fault of the Germans themselves that they do not distribute this food evenly and keep the people alive until then ? as if the system of private property could be expected suddenly to change its nature , and private capital to turn communist . Even the system of control by rationing established during the war is beyond the strength of the present German government to enforce . A dictatorship might accomplish it , but a dictatorship either of the monarchists or the communists is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government which the victorious nations prescribed for them , and which those nations have done everything possible to weaken and discredit . The failure of the German Republic in this crisis is attributable to the policy of the victors , and the responsibility for the death of the people rests upon them . Only secondary to the actual material relief extended must be placed the value of the spiritual service of these Friends of Humanity at the crisis of a situation which affects the entire world . The Friends have not lost faith in constructive good will as a means of international healing . Since the invasion of the Ruhr they have had workers in that region , helping the German direction of child-feeding and visiting victims of the occupation in prison . It is encouraging to be able to record that they found the cooperation of the French authorities excellent . They had no difficulty in securing passes . When they reported unbelievable mismanagement in prisons , as for example the case of 127 persons confined in one room without toilet facilities , General Degoutte himself took their findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Friends propose to work even through the medium of the Ruhr invasion to bring French and Germans together , to take the ground , even in that exacerbated situation , that political and social differences must not be allowed to develop an enmity which is fatal to the human race . If they can confront that problem with equanimity they may feel something like optimism in re gard to the task of bringing the people of the United States back-to their old mind toward the people of Germany . In 1920 Professor Rufus Jones wrote of " the strong and deep-seated prejudice in the public mind against doing anything to relieve suffering in Germany , even to save the lives of children . " Never was national hatred more needlessly aroused or more wantonly maintained . It is the mission of the Friends to war against this hate , to bring us to the mind in which we will throw the mantle of charity over the sins of the Germans . Let it be broad enough to cover our own sins toward them . We can not make good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered in November , 1918 . We dare not address to our former associates the mildest remonstrance against their continuation of the war in order that Germany may be dismembered and destroyed . The least thing that we can do is in the utmost measure to make good General Allen 's words : " America has never made war upon children . "
