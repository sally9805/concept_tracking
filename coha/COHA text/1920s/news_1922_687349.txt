txt Geraldine Farrar 's refusal to sign a contract with the Metropolitan Opera Company for next year was followed yesterday by the announcement by Giulio Gatti-Casazza , director of the company , that he had engaged Maria Jeritza , the Viennese singer , whose sue ' cess has been the sensation of the pros1 ent season , for many seasons to come . The signing of a contract by Miss Jeritza , who has scored her greatest success here as Tosca in the opera of that name , one of Miss Farrar 's most popular roles , is looked upon as GattiCasazza 's answer to Miss Farrar 's decision to remain away from the Metro- ' politan next year . Miss Jeritza 's first appearance in " Tosca " was marked by an extraordinary demonstration . When the audience stood up and cheered it was realized that a new star destined to . great popularity had arisen in American opera . From Chicago came the news that Lucien Muratore , French  --  tenor , of the Chicago Opera , would leave the company at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden . His wife , Lina Cavalieri , is also involved in the temperamental rumpus . The appearance of Miss Jeritza and her immediate conquest of her audience are thought to have been one of the reasons why Miss Farrar decided to stay cut of opera for at least one season . The success of the Viennese singer , who is possessed of great personal charm and beauty , and whose acting is vivacious and appealing to all who have seen her , was the greatest in many years . Net even Miss Farrar herself gained a more Immeotate triumph when she first appeared fifteen years ago . It was comparable this year only to the first appearance of Chaliapin in " Boris . " ? Miss Jcritza 's new contract calls for several seasons of fifty performances a year , and will , it is said , be renewed , so she will actually take the place of Miss Farrar , whose contract , as offered to her by Gatti-Casazza for next season , called for only three months , or half the season . It is thought that Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer the greatest woman singer so far as the terms of the contract went , and that she then decided to remain away until her great personal following should assert itself , and she would be able to come back at least on a par with any one in the company . War Kept Iler Away . It was only because of the war that Miss Jeritza did not appear at the Metropolitan some time ago . She was engaged to appear at the Metropolitan in 1913 , but when the war began it was impossible to bring her here , and so her appearance was postponed until this , season . She has so far sung the part of Tosca in the opera of that name three times ; the part of Marietta in " Die Tote , Stadt " five times : the part of Sieglinde in " Die Walkuere " six times : the part of Elsa in " Lohengrin " twice , and the part of Santauzza in " Cavalleria " , once . She lives at the St. Regis with her husband , Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sang here years ago in concert and was known for her perfect style , and a grandson of Mathilde Marchesi , the famous Paris teacher , who numbered Melba and many other famous singers among her pupils . Miss Farrar denied herself to all yesterday who sought to talk with her on her retirement from the Metropolitan . Her reasons , aside from the formal statement issued in her behalf on Tuesday night , were kept to nerself , and no one could be found who would talk for her . Mr. Gatti-Casazza , gave out a short statement yesterday in which he threw a little light on what had led up to M40 Fairar 's decision , by disclosing that the contract offered to her called for only three months next year . " I have offered a contract to Miss Farrar for three months next year , " he said . " In making this offer for only three months I was simply following a procedure which is a matter of policy with me  --  to give as much variety as possible in a season in artists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrar will return to the Metropolitan for the season of 1923-24 . The contract was offered at the same fee which we were paying her this year . It is not a matter of price that caused her to determine on the concert tour . " That statement was followed later in the evening by the one regarding Miss afternoon Miss Jeritza appeared again as Tosca and filled the Metropolitan to the doors , hundreds of persons being turned away . It was conceded , however , that Miss Farrar would make much more money on tour than In opera , and those who had been in close touch with her thought that there were aso other reasons why Miss Farrar might deliberately have chosen to leave the scene of her greatest triumphs for a time of gain a change of scene and new activities . Those who had watched her this season thought that she seemed to be greatly affected by something which caused her to lose interest in her many rOles . After the rift between herself and Lou Tellegen , the union which she had often said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to have shown less fervor in her acting . There was some surprise . however , that Miss Farrar had not agdeed to appear for at least a month next season , which she could have done without seriously affecting her tour . It was also announced last night that Chaliapin , the Russian singer , whose success in " Boris Crodunoff " has been a feature of the season , would return next year to appear in opera and concerts . IVIURATORE TO QUIT THE CHICAGO OPERA His Last Season , Says Tenor , and Blames " Capricious " Mary Garden  --  Caualieri , Too . Special to The New York CHICAGO , Jan. ** he can not sing under the direction of Mary Garden . Lucien Muratore , French-tenor , declared today that he will not be with the Chicago Grand Opera Company next season. ? He made the statement that it is impossible for a woman to properly conduct a great opera . " It is impossible to be a singer and a director at the same time , " he said . " Either artistic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenor and " Directa " Garden developed over the number of rOles ho was to sing . Professional jealousy between Miss Garden and Lina Cavalieri , Muratore 's wife , also entered into the misunderstanding . Cavalieri , although engaged for the opera , has been silent during the season , and Miss Garden has appeared on the boards in favorite rOles several times . To get Muratore for the Chicago organization , it was necessary for Miss Garden also to sign a contract with his wife . Muratore denied that this had anything to do with his break with the " directs , " and blamed it on the capriciousness of women . " I do not like the way she spoke to me , " said Muratore referring to the " Directa . " " Miss Garden is too capricious . One day she is nice . Next day she will not even say good morning . Just heavy looks . That jars my nerves . " She changes her mind too often . But that is women 's right . And I am not the only one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am only speaking for myself . They , perhaps , will have volumes to say . " Shrugs and upturned hands punctuated the interview . Muratore had a lot on his mind , but lacked-words to express it . Muratore said he had three offers for next season . It was reported that on Jan. 9 he had signed a contract to appear with the metropolitan Company in New York , of which Galli Curd is now the star . In the office of Clark Shaw , Business Manager of the company , surprise was expressed at Mr. Muratore 's announcement and denial that any reason was known for it . About the auditorium , however , the rumor has been drifting for several clays that in the readjustment of the company for the next sea- . son the Finance Committee and Mr. Muratore have been differing as to his legitimate bills . When Muratore submitted his statement it was reported among items in addition to his contracted salary were hotel bills for himself , his wife and his valet . In cutting expenses for next year , the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French artist that in the future his pay from the Chicago company would cover only flat salary . Muratore objected . Another story , emanating from a source close to the footlights , revealed The document gives Muratore a lien on every tenor rOle in the repertoire . By its provisions Director Garden is compelled to give him first chance to accept or refuse every opera which demands fine tenor singing . Muratore and Cavaliers leave for New York tomorrow for the opening of the New York season of the Chicago company , which begins Monday night , with Muratore singing opposite Marguerite D. Alvarez in " Sampson and Delilah , " the vehcile with which they opened their Chicago season Nov. 14 . The Chicago season closes Saturday night . At the New York office of the Chicago Grand Opera Association , at 33 West Forty-second Street , it was said yesterday afternoon that nothing was known there of Muratore 's leaving other than the newspaper reports . Rufus Dewey , publicity manager , thought that if a difference had occurred between the tenor and Miss Garden it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think Muratore is likely to break his contract because he is getting $2,800 a performance from the . Chicago Grand Opera AssociaXion , the largest salary paid anywheft in the world to a grand opera star . It is 8300 more a performance than Caruso received from the Metropolitan .
