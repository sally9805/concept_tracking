At Daytona Beach , Fla. , in front of a crowd kept in safety by marshals , some newsreel photographers pointed their cameras last week at the snouted White Triplex car roaring toward them at 202 m. p. h. over the hard sand . The car swerved . Driver Lee Bible lost control . The car somersaulted prodigiously toward the cameras . When it lay still , Driver Bible , thrown far away , and one of the photographers , a big fellow named Charles Traub , crushed by three tons of pitchpoling steel , were dead . The film of the accident , complete in Traub 's camera , went out at once to Pathe exhibitors . <P> Once the staid recorders of fires , parades , baby-shows and ship launchings , newsreel photographers are now famed for the risks they take . Three weeks before his death , Newsreeler Traub went down in the submarine 54 . In a bathing suit , with water up to his neck , with his camera mounted near the engineroom ceiling , he photographed the crew escaping one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The device was a success , but not for Traub . He stayed where he was until the U. S. S. Mallard on the surface pumped the submarine full of air at high pressure , bringing her up but making Traub deaf for a while . <P> Other photographers who have suffered or barely escaped violent fates : <P> Karl W. Fasold ( Pathe ) .

Neither his camera nor his body were ever found . <P> Louis Hutt ( Paramount ) did not drop his camera when the propeller of a plane on the wing of which he was riding cut off part of his hand . <P> Russell Muth ( Fox ) turned the crank though volcanic gas dizzied him and the woman pilot who was steering his plane round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree near the rim of the crater , he saved his pictures by throwing the camera into some brushwood . <P> Thomas Baltzell ( Pathe ) . Marooned on a wrecked plane for twelve hours when his flight from Manhattan to Rio de Janeiro was interrupted , he got pictures of the wreck . <P> E. J. Kaho ( Fox ) took a film of Mexican Guerilla Pancho Villa . Villa demanded the picture or Kaho 's life . Kaho gave him raw film , escaped with the real one . <P> C. T.
