Figuratively speaking , Fascist Rome fulminated , last week , at Socialist Vienna . The quarrel started last fortnight when the Chancellor of Austria , Monsignor Ignaz Seipel encouraged deputies in the Austrian Parliament to flay the alleged oppressive Italian administration now existing in the formerly Austrian province of Lower Tyrol ( TIME , March 5 ) . Last week Signor Benito Mussolini hurled back a reply from the Italian Chamber of Deputies . Cried he : <P> " This is the last time that I shall speak upon this theme . In the future I shall make actions do the talking . . . . The fact is that Pan-Germanism is crying out because it sees that in the face of the cold will and systematic tenacity of Fascist Italy its game is up . " <P> Alluding scornfully to the present puny strength of Austria , Il Duce rapped : " We are not anxious about our northern frontier . Hannibal is not at our gates . Neither is Monsignor Seipel . " <P> Picking up a sheaf of reports , Signor Mussolini then quietly settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the former Lower Tyrol , now called by Italians the Higher Adige . Declaring that 15 German language newspapers are still printed in the Higher Adige , Il Duce asked rhetorically : " Is this Fascist barbarity ? " <P> Finally Signor Mussolini delivered a very suave but unmistakable warning to the Austrian Parliament . " A State which respects itself , " he said , " can not tolerate foreign interference . Mr. Fuller , the Governor of Massachusetts , has supplied us with a striking example on that subject . " <P> Thus Il Duce weaseled in a reminder that Italians Sacco &; Vanzetti were executed despite protests from almost every European nation . That Italy would follow in the independent lead of the U. S. in administering her internal affairs was his clear &; clever implication . <P> Next day , two leading Viennese newspapers sounded the irrepressible retort of small Austria . The conservative Neues Wiener Tageblatt rapped : " The arguments of Il Duce are the arguments of the strong , but not strong arguments . " The liberal Neue Freie Presse exclaimed rhetorically : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you consider yourself strong and us weak . . . . Then why refuse us the only right which the weak have-namely , the right to complain ? " <P> Generally the speech of Il Duce was deemed " mild " in Austria where public opinion had been most uneasy .
