The Army is strong on soubriquets , and nowhere does the bearer of an historic nickname fare better than at West Point . Henry E. ( " Light Horse Harry " * ) Wilson , Army football captain last year and Army football crackerjack the past four years , took both the Edgerton Sabre ( for being football captain ) and the Army Athletic Association Sabre ( for being best all round athlete ) at last week 's West Point ceremonies . It was the first time that a cadet had won both swords . Some people said that the nickname hypnotized the judges . This was most unjust , for Cadet Wilson outstood in baseball and lacrosse as well as football . <P> What made the Wilson awards remarkable , especially in the opinion of men who have sported against West Point , was the supremacy of any one " Pointer " over all his fellows in all-round ability . West Pointers must be fit to get in , to stay in . Their life is rigorous , their sports many . That " Light Horse Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was , after all , less remarkable than the fact that in all West Point history ( the Academy was founded in 1802 ) no previous captain of " the manliest sport " has clearly outmanned all his contemporaries in other directions . <P> The Army 's current " Light Horse Harry " is going into the Air Corps . <P> <P> *After " Light Horse Harry " Lee , Revolutionary cavalry general , father of Civil War General Robert E. Lee and no relation to Cadet Wilson .
