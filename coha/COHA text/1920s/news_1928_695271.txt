txt CATHOLIC CHURCH PRACTICE Editor Corrects Some Statements Regarding Clergy and Obedience . To the Editor of The New York Times : Russell Marshall in a letter to THE TIIuIES misrepresents the Catholic Church and under the banner of " fair comment . " May I make three corrections in order to clear the air ? Mr. Marshall states : " The priest is appointed by a distant Bishop , who , in his turn , is appointed by a more distant Pope . " The priest is appointed by a " home " Bishop who lives near all his priests , who is known by all of them and who has usually served and lived with them . The Bishop is invariably chosen by priests in his diocese . The consultors and irremovable pastors meet , select those whom they consider the best equipped for the Bishopric , send the names to Rome and the Pope invariably chooses one from the list prepared here . His 0 . K. , to say the least , makes for system , harmony , unity and progress : ' Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute obedience to their superiors , and the Pope , the final superior , is God 's Viceregent . " This is absolutely untrue . Catholics owe only a spiritual or religious allegiance . Thus if the Pope or Bishop orders prayers for afflicted plague victims we follow . But Pope or Bishop never tells a Catholic he is un-American because he likes , or takes , a glass of beer , or calls him immoral for playing cards . Moreover , they never order or even advise Catholics how to vote . Neither do they endorse this or that candidate or urge politics be brought into the pulpit . And if they did no Catholic would owe them " absolute obedience . " The Pope and Bishops very infrequently order Catholics  --  not once in a year  --  and then only on religious matters . Mr. Marshall states : . " Let Methodist organizations order their leaders to speak for them , but never let leaders appointed from abroad direct American citizens in political matters . " This reply has been answered above , but may I add to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read by perhaps 200,000 people a week . Never have I received an order on politics from any Bishop or other ecclesiastic . And likewise never have I advised , ordered or suggested how a reader should vote . If I did I would , metaphorically speaking , get a deserved trouncing , not only from the Catholic laity but the clergy . Again , I read over a hundred Catholic publications a week . Not one of them is in the *political business . Not one endorses candidates for office . Not one orders or suggests how their readers should vote . Not . one nullifies much of the Constitution ' by demanding enforcemen of a part of it . Still again I have yet to find one Catholic Bishop or priest or pulpit or lay organization or clerical meeting endorsing , or speaking for , political candidates . Christ crucified is the proper subject for the Catholic Church ; politics is not . PATRICK F. SCANLON , Managing Editor The Tablet . Brooklyn , Aug. 2 , 1928 . Car Signs on the Elevated . To the Flditor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to have the elevated road adopt and take heed of the following ? Put the designated signs in the racks so that passengers can tell whether they are riding on a Sixth or Ninth Avenue train and whether they are destined for Rector Street or South Ferry and have the same in its entirety when going uptown . Some time ago reference was made to the oft-repeated manner of the trains passing the downtown station at Nighty-first Street and Col bus Avenue without stniminz . If anything , it Is worse than before . S. S. New York , Aug. 2 , 1028 . A Prize for Mr. White . To Mc Editor of The New York Times : There ought to be some Pulitzer prize to give adequate recognition to the unique talent of William Allen White . None of the rest of us can put so Much poison into a libel as he manages to leave in a retrartion . ELMER DAVIS .. New York , Aug. 2 , 1028.                   @ @
