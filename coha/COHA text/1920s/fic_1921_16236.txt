CLOSEUP ON MR . BERESFORD TITLE : Mr. Beresford , honest and God-fearing . This is all of the title that shows but now the rest comes into the scene  --   --  3  --  TITLE : also an impatient advocate of the creed " Men and their Sons first . " A very careful study of Beresford as he sits gazing at the letter . It is from his son , of whom he is inordinately proud ; Mr. Beresford is about fifty years old , he has spent all his life in the village of Flint Hill , and has grown as hard and self-centered as the rocks on his farm ; in his way he is just and upright , also impatient of the opinions of others and used to having his own way ; he insists upon being the only court of appeal in his own home , and up to the present time has never met the slightest opposition . He goes to church regularly , and finds a grim pleasure in those passages of the Bible which tell of the torturing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer , but is rather well dressed in a slightly old fashioned way ; a man of much dignity . 9 . CLOSEUP ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE Mrs. Beresford is piling some dishes together preparatory to carrying them to the kitchen ; she is a faded little woman of about her husband 's age , but while he still shows the virile strength of the New England farmer , she seems to have been worn out by the long struggle of the life , at no time easy ; she accepts her husband 's word on all matters without question , subscribing meekly to the code of the New England hills , that the man shall be the lord and master .  --  INSERT  --  Mrs. Beresford , who believes whatever her husband tells her to believe . She picks up the dishes she has arranged and exits off the scene with them .  --  4  --  12 . CLOSEUP ON JUDITH 'S FACE THRU WINDOW , SOFT EDGED CIRCLE A very pretty shot of her here and one which goes further than being merely pretty ; it must catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better things which are a part of the girl 's nature  --  INSERT  --  The daughter , Judith  --  withdrawn from High School after the second year to " help her mother with the house , " and to patiently await " woman 's greatest honor " - someone willing to marry her . She still stands gazing at the sky , straining her eyes as she seeks to follow the final fusion of color . 19 . CLOSEUP ON SEAT IN MOVING PULLMAN COACH It is dark outside and nothing shows ; David Beresford sits next to the window of the coach staring out into the darkness ; an open book is lying in his lap but he  --  5  --  has forgotten it , and now turns and gazes rather uneasily into the camera . David is about twenty ; he is a year or so younger than Judith , a good looking boy , but taking after his mother rather than his father , of whom he stands in great awe .  --  INSERT  --  The son , David , a freshman in Theological school , homeward bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less evident that David is not the type intended for the ministry ; in the first place he has too much imagination ; he has been forced into this calling by his father 's bigoted ambition to have a man of God in the family .  --  INSERT  --  Preparing for the ministry against his own wishes , because his father has commanded it . David continues to gaze abstractedly into the camera ; he seems depressed and also somewhat worried ; the cause of this worry does not appear until later . Section Details 20 . BERESFORD KITCHEN Judith and her Mother are getting under way with the dish washing now , when Beresford enters ; he still has the letter which seems to afford him immense satisfaction ; he says proudly  --  INSERT  --  " The boy writes a fine letter . He is going to be a Power in the service of the Lord . " This statement has a curiously contrasting effect on the two women ; Mrs. Beresford nods her head with a faded reproduction of her husband 's manner , naturally she is proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark  --  6  --  arouses a bitter hopeless rebellion ; she gazes rather accusingly at her father as she answers  --  INSERT  --  " He ought to be thankful he is n't a woman . " This statement irritates Beresford , it is evidently an old and sore point between them , and he answers Judith sternly  --  INSERT  --  " A woman 's place is in her home  --  looking after her children  --  Section Details 28 . CLOSEUP OF JOE A careful study of him as with the light bounding humor of the ox , he gazes off the scene at Judith ; he is convinced he is quite a cut-up. 46 . CLOSEUP ON WYNDHAM GRAY The flame from the match and the glowing cigar illuminate his face ; Gray is a man of perhaps forty-five ; he  --  7  --  is in every sense a man of the world , perhaps with a little too much experience so far as women are concerned ; he is a successful writer , with a deep knowledge of humanity ; he has an unfailing and delightful sense of humor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good companion for anyone if he happens to be in the mood  --  INSERT  --  Wyndham Gray , a playwright seeking inspiration in the hill country . Gray leisurely makes sure that his cigar is well lighted and strolls out of the scene , frankly enjoying the beauty of the night . 48 . CLOSEUP ON THE GROUP Gray is frankly interested in Judith ; he has her sized up for almost what she is , a pretty , small-town girl ; the only mistake he has made so far is that he has underestimated her brain-power and personality . He is perhaps more than willing to amuse himself with her should the chance arise and now seems to be very nice to her . Joe instinctively jealous , relapses into a rather surly attitude . Gray asks them both pleasantly  --  INSERT  --  " Going to the dance ? " Before Judith can answer , Joe , who thoroly dislikes the stranger , answers sullenly  --  INSERT  --  " No , we 're old-fashioned enough to consider choir practice more important . " Gray , secretly amused , turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he says gravely  --  INSERT  --  " I heard the choir Sunday and it reminded me of an ancient and very true saying . " Gray continues to regard Joe gravely as he makes this statement ; there is a second of silence , and then Joe  --  8  --  asks sullenly : " What is it ? " Without smiling , Gray answers  --  INSERT  --  " Silence is golden . " A half flash of a smile twists about Judith 's lips ; Joe for a moment does not get the statement , but as it gradually dawns on him , he answers angrily  --  " Oh , I guess we 're not so bad . " Gray steals a glance at Judith . Section Details 83 . CLOSEUP OF NAN UNDER TREE She is looking off the scene , both eagerly and timidly , she sees David , although he has not yet seen her , and through her natural lack of confidence in herself , and a certain apparently uncalled for worriment , her love for David is very apparent ; it is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON NAN AND DAVID . PLATFORM The nervousness of both of them is increasing . David realizes his mother and father and some of the other  --  9  --  people are watching him and he places a far too great importance upon it ; he is becoming more embarrassed as he does not know what to say to Nan , who gazes up at him with a childlike trustful appeal , which highly disconcerts him . She seems quite content when he is with her , but is unquestionably waiting for him to say something which he does not say ; the truth is that they have been secretly married , but he has placed her under a pledge of secrecy , owing to his fear of his father . David 's one idea is to get away now as gracefully as possible ; he extends his hand as he says with an attempt at light good nature : " Will see you later . " Almost before she realizes he is going he has left the scene ; she does not follow him , but a surprised look which changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she droops slightly forward and remains that way , unconscious of the fact . 116 . CLOSEUP OF THE COUCH A strongly dramatic scene here as Nan 's stepfather sees that she has regained consciousness ; the last qualm of alarm vanishes , in his fury reaching down he seizes her roughly by the shoulder and jerks her savagely to a sitting position ; as he exclaims : " So that 's what 's the matter with you ! Is it ? " For a moment she does not understand him , as a matter of fact , she hardly knows herself ; he shakes her cruelly as he says " Answer me ! " 131 . CLOSEUP ON THE ENTIRE GROUP Nan 's stepfather is still pointing at David as the scene goes on ; the others of the family are beginning to gather an inkling now as to what is the matter , and they all look in consternation at David who , unable to meet their gaze , looks apprehensively at Nan 's stepfather . Mrs. Beresford 's face takes on a look of acute distress , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true situation ; she only knows that there is something terribly wrong and that her brother is in some way mixed up in it . 146 . CLOSEUP OF BERESFORD AND NAN 'S STEPFATHER Continuing the action with Beresford still holding the check ; he notices the effect upon Nan 's stepfather and now observes impressively  --  INSERT  --  " It 's a lot of money . " Nan 's stepfather unconsciously nods his head ; he makes a last weak show of refusal , but his eyes never leave the bit of paper , and now Beresford , seeing the psychological moment , puts it into his hands ; he does not resist , his own hand closes over it , then as a last sop to the self-respect which he never had , he protests a bit weakly , saying , " There ai n't another man in the United States could make me take this . " Mr. Beresford gravely agrees with him .  --  11  --  156 . CLOSEUP ON THE GROUP The main action continuing as David 's good resolution again dies away . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Beresford gazes at her husband a bit gratefully ; it would have been a terrible thing for David to have had to marry Nan ; the effect on Judith , however , is utterly different ; her heart has gone out to the broken little girl who has just left , the one whom they all treated as tho she were a criminal and the one who is the least to blame ; she turns hotly on her father as she demands  --  INSERT  --  " Why should she go away ? " Mr. Beresford meets her gaze coldly ; the bargain , perhaps unpleasant to him but necessary to the family honor , is over and he is again the narrow , righteous man with a New England conscience . There is a glow of righteous anger in his eyes as he answers impressively  --  INSERT  --  " Because a scarlet woman has no place where decent folks abide . " The answer half stuns Judith for a moment and unconsciously her lips repeat it ; then her eyes flare hotly and she turns and looks deliberately at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father has said . He seems about to answer in defense of Nan , but his father 's cold eyes again bare his inherent weakness and he averts his gaze from Judith . The bitter injustice of the whole proceeding rankles in Judith 's heart , and pointing at her brother , she demands of Mr. Beresford  --  INSERT  --  " What about David ? " Mrs. Beresford starts nervously to interfere , saying , " Judith , this is no kind of matter for you to discuss . " But Mr. Beresford for once seems willing to answer his daughter and his voice is as cold as steel as he replies  --  12  --   --  INSERT  --  " The painted woman ever lies in wait for the young and innocent . " He is undoubtedly sincere in this statement , but David feels the mockery of it as well as Judith ; that her father could deliberately say a thing like this to her incenses her beyond measure . " Innocent ! " she exclaims wildly . Her father gravely nods his head and now the last straw utterly broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wildly  --  INSERT  --  " What if it had been me ? " Mrs. Beresford utters a gasp of dismay at this question , which also gets a decided rise out of Mr. Beresford ; his face is distorted by an instantaneous anger that Judith thus dare to speak to him , and he turns on her threateningly as he says  --  INSERT  --  " Shame !  --  I forbid you to say another word ! " The command has no effect upon Judith , however , who in her anger and sympathy for Nan completely loses her grip on her feelings : she denounces her father hotly as she tells him he is the one to be ashamed , and fiercely branding her brother as a coward , a charge which he does not deny , exits blindly into the kitchen . Mrs. Beresford , deeply distressed , follows , leaving the two men alone ; there is a moment of silence in which David avoids his father 's gaze , and then the old man , as tho suddenly tired , drops heavily into the nearest chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ; Nan is still eagerly watching her stepfather , who still stares at the certificate . He finally looks up at her , and the pathetic , half-timid smile , the desire for his comfort and support which for  --  13  --  a moment appears on her face , quickly fades out as she reads the hatred in his eyes . Her stepfather is beside himself with fury ; he crumples the marriage certificate into a ball as he steps up to Nan and shaking the whip under her nose , tells her harshly  --  INSERT  --  " It 's a fake ! It 's no good and you know it ! " For a moment she is stunned at what he has told her and then exclaims in desperate hysteria , " It is n't a fake ! It is absolutely true ! " She reaches forward to take the certificate from him , but he savagely thrusts her away and , crossing to the stove , lifts off one of the covers ; with a quick movement he thrusts it into the fire . It flames up immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action arouses Nan to desperation ; she rushes on him as tho to prevent the burning of the certificate , but he hurls her so violently from him that she staggers back against the table , which alone prevents her from falling . 180 . RAILROAD STATION AND TRACKS . NIGHT A passenger train is just starting out of the station as Nan hurries into the scene ; the porter of one of the cars notices her and helps her aboard as the train pulls out ; there are one or two loafers about the platform , but they pay little attention to what is going on .  --  14  --  Section Details 248 . EXTERIOR GRAY 'S WINDOW Joe sneaks into the scene ; he listens a moment and then peers cautiously thru the window . 249 . INTERIOR GRAY 'S CABIN This to be shot thru the window . It discloses the table on which some of the candles are still burning ; also Judith and Gray standing ( seated in final action ) near the fireplace as they laugh and talk in a very friendly fashion . 261 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still holding Judith as he glares at her savagely ; her first fright vanishes as she fully recognizes him and her own eyes grow defiant as she says , " What do you mean by this ? " He answers  --  INSERT  --  " What have you been doing in his cabin all this time ? "  --  15  --  Judith realizes that Joe has been spying on her ; she also understands what interpretation he has placed on his observation ; an expression of great loathing and disgust comes over her and with a sharp jerk she frees herself and tells him contemptuously  --  INSERT  --  " Nothing you would understand . " Joe sneers at her as he says mockingly , " No ? Maybe I know how to make love to ladies who are n't particular , myself . " This statement stings her deeply ; her temper flares and , raising her hand , she slaps him sharply across the mouth as she tells him , " Do n't you ever dare to speak that way to me again . " As he steps back in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . For a moment Joe seems about to pursue her , intent on doing her bodily harm , but he overcomes the impulse and stands growling after her . 283 . THE DINING ROOM The main action again , as Judith gets over the subtitle ; the change in her manner , her contemptuous and , to him , brazen attitude , for a moment silences Mr. Beresford ; he gazes at her blindly , but she goes on in the same tone  --  INSERT  --  " Perhaps this man will buy you off as you did Nan 's father . " As Judith says this , Mrs. Beresford raises her face from her hands , gazing with shocked , startled eyes at her daughter ; David 's face hardens ; the effect on Mr. Beresford is terrific . It is bad enough that his daughter should have disgraced their name , but that she should stand glorying brazenly in it is too much ; he advances toward her with uplifted fist as tho to strike her down and then by a superhuman effort restrains his impulse ; he stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16  --  her in a passion-choked voice  --  INSERT  --  " I never want to see you again , and this is the last night you shall remain in my house . " He waits as tho expecting her to further defy him , and there is a deep silence throughout the room ; it is broken by a distressed cry from Mrs. Beresford , who lifts her face from her hands and starts toward her husband as tho to appeal to him to be more merciful ; he thrusts her angrily aside . Judith looks at her father and mother , who has again started to cry ; she turns slightly now and looks at David , who looks back at her with an expression distinctly cold and unsympathetic ; he is weakly human enough perhaps to be rather pleased that she has found herself in a situation somewhat similar to his own . She did not spare him and he determines now not to spare her . ( An added closeup , used in final production , but not in original scenario. )  --  17  --  Section Details 304 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN ON THE TITLE : One of the pitiful , too-many who have gone down in the unequal struggle . The scene FADES IN . This set , which is the epitome of poverty , will be described later . Nan is standing beside the bed , gazing down at her baby , which however does not show in this scene ; the bed itself , what part of it shows , should get over the idea of want and misery ; Nan , clad in worn out pitifully exaggerated finery , is motionless as she looks down off the scene . The afternoon is already beginning to wane and the light from the one dingy window is none too bright ; on the girl 's white , tired face , is an exhausted , hopeless look , it is the day before Christmas and she is flat broke . Also , she is unable to fight off a feeling of exhaustion with her former success ; lack of proper nourishment , exposure and the hard life she is leading are taking their toll ; although she does not know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A feeble spark bewilderingly clinging to Life in that final fitful glow which precedes the Eternal Dark . She stands there a moment longer , the haunted , dazed expression still in her eyes ; but now as she glances again at the baby , a broken tender smile twists across her face . 305 . CLOSEUP ON THE BABY . ON BED There is practically no heat in the room and the baby is so bundled up that he looks like a little ball of rags ; I would most earnestly suggest securing the baby used by Mr. Niblo in " Mother . " He is supposed to be about a  --  18  --  year old , and as he sits there he smiles flirtatiously up at his mother ; two much-patched stockings protrude from the general bundle ; the main idea being to show that he has no shoes  --  INSERT  --  " David " 314 . CLOSEUP ON NAN AND MAN . EXTERIOR POOL ROOM The man is regarding her a bit quizzically ; also brazenly as he sees no use of using finesse with her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says to her " How about having a little party ? " Nan 's gaze meets his own a moment ; this is part of her life , but something way down in her rebels , perhaps it is the Christmas atmosphere which carries her back to her happier days ; in all events a flush of shame overspreads her face and with averted gaze she slips by the man and passes on ; he is frankly surprised and smiles sarcastically as he watches her , wondering if she expects him to flirt with her .  --  19  --  316 . CLOSEUP ON NAN 'S FACE THROUGH WINDOW . SOFT EDGED CIRCLE At first her expression is one of dull exhaustion , and then as something in the window attracts her attention , her eyes brighten a moment , then her whole face becomes pitifully wistful. 317 . CLOSEUP ON A PAIR OF BABY 'S SHOES IN WINDOW They are hanging from a red ribbon and are pretty baby shoes with red tassels on them . Section Details 326 . CLOSEUP ON BABY 'S FEET . SOFT EDGED CIRCLE IRIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Night of the Nativity . The scene FADES IN , disclosing the feet of little David which are now clad in the shoes we last saw in the store  --  20  --  window ; he moves his feet about as though admiring them ; and nothing more than the shoes shows here . 342 . CLOSEUP ON NAN 'S BED A very carefully handled scene here ; thru both girls ' minds comes the remembrance of their last meeting ; and as Nan gazes at Judith , not understanding how she happens to be there , she says dully . " I did n't think you 'd ever want to see me again . Her white , tired face arouses a feeling of deep pity in Judith 's heart ; she tries to hide this as she says with feigned cheerfulness : " Of course I want to see you ; why should n't I ? " Nan does not answer , merely gazing up at her , and now Judith 's eyes go to the baby which sits playing on the bed ; there is a deep silence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nan again ; another silence and then Nan falters apologetically  --  INSERT  --  " I  --  I named him David . " She seems to think that Judith will blame her for this . In a flash Judith realizes what this statement means  --  that before her is her brother 's baby ; she fights back a choking sensation as she again places her hand on Nan 's shoulder and says rather uncertainly : " I 'm awfully glad you did . " Nan smiles wanly a smile of gratitude . A pretty scene as the two girls look at each other and then into Nan 's tired face there comes an expression of child-like pride ; she still knows that she has done nothing to be ashamed of and as she looks up at Judith , she says  --  INSERT  --  " I thought I had the right to name him that , because David and I were married . " She says this simply as tho it were a matter of common knowledge , but Judith is stunned by what she has heard ; her breath comes sharply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Married ? " Nan nods , but immediately the childish expression of pride fades away ; the tired look comes back , a look both hopeless and bewildered , as she says dejectedly  --  INSERT  --  " But maybe we were n't  --  my father said my marriage certificate was a fraud  --  he burned it . " As the memory of this great injustice returns to Nan , the tired spirit breaks completely and she cries hopelessly ; Judith , her own eyes filled with tears , bends over her , comforting her as best she can ; gradually Nan is quieted . Judith looks at her strangely , holding Nan 's gaze by the compelling question in her eyes ; she wants to know more about the marriage Nan has told her of . She says  --  INSERT  --  " But why  --  " Nan understands what she means ; she hesitates a moment as tho not wishing to hurt David 's sister , and then says , rather apologetically  --  INSERT  --  " David made me promise not to tell  --  perhaps he knew the marriage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her ; as she leans forward limply , no longer looking at Judith . Judith is not looking at her , either ; she has straightened up and as she stares bitterly into the camera , she realizes fully the truth ; as the full sacrifice of the broken girl before her comes into her mind , she finds herself hating her brother . The whole thing seems so bitterly unfair , so bitterly unnecessary ; a sob from Nan recalls her to herself , and fighting back the tears , she again bends over the other girl , trying to comfort her as she says  --  INSERT  --  " Your marriage is real  --  I am sure of that . " Nan looks at her in pathetic gratitude , leaning her head against Judith as the latter stands beside her ; it is almost as tho Judith were her mother .  --  22  --  350 . CLOSEUP ON NAN 'S CHAIR AT BED Judith and Nan are as we left them ; Nan has finished talking now and as tho the reaction were too great for her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she seems to have fainted , but with an effort to recover herself , she looks up at Judith , who is bending anxiously over her ; for a moment the two girls gaze at each other and then Nan says simply  --  INSERT  --  " I think I am going to die . " This statement naturally frightens Judith ; she says hastily , " Of course you are not , but I am going to get you a doctor , anyway . " Her idea is to leave at once for a doctor , but Nan who with a patient smile detains her , shakes her head as she answers  --  INSERT  --  " A doctor could n't do me any good , and I do n't mind  --  now that you 're here . " As Nan says this she smiles trustfully in Judith 's face , and then looks off the scene at the baby ; the inference is clear and as Judith also looks off the scene where the baby is playing she understands what the other girl means . Section Details 353 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ READING TABLE David and his mother sit watching Mr. Beresford , who as the scene goes on is opening the large family Bible ; they are a religious family ; and something of the holy spirit of the Christmas has touched them ; Mr. Beresford  --  23  --  is about to read a chapter dealing with the birth of Christ . David and his mother wait in subdued silence . 375 . CLOSEUP ON JUDITH AT TABLE . CITY ROOM Her face is very earnest , as she is writing slowly and carefully to her father . She stops a moment to read what she has written  --  INSERT a portion of the letter  --  and I want you to know that this is David 's baby , and that David was really married to poor little Nan . If you doubt it  --  ask him . I shall keep the baby until I hear from you .

This in turn lap-fades into the following scene : &nbsp; pp. 25-33 415 . ANGLE OF COMMITTEE ROOM David and his father wait here ; the old man proudly ; the boy rather mildly and uncertainly , reflecting his father 's attitude . Mrs. Stuart now smilingly enters the scene ; David 's name has just been placed upon the committee list as a missionary and they now start to talk about it . Mrs. Stuart looks at David half questioningly , half sympathetically , as she thinks of the far-away place to which he has been assigned . Curiously she does not ask him but asks his father , whose manner absolutely overshadows that of the boy , the following question  --  INSERT  --  " Will your son care to accept this station in the interior of China ? " Without a moment 's hesitation , without giving David a chance to answer , Mr. Beresford replies decisively  --  INSERT  --  " He 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David as she says , " Will you ? " He hesitates a moment and then nods ; he strikes Mrs. Stuart as rather a bashful boy ; she is inclined to like him and she sincerely admires Mr. Beresford , whose rugged earnestness can not be mistaken . She looks them both over and then says  --  INSERT  --  " Wo n't you both have dinner with us this evening ? We have so much to talk over . " David , as is his custom , waits for his father to answer . Mr. Beresford is pleased at the invitation and accepts it . As Mrs. Stuart gives them her address the scene FADES OUT .  --  25  --  428 . ANGLE OF STUART LIVING ROOM Continuing the main action as before . Mrs. Stuart , now convinced that something unpleasant is about to happen , turns to speak to Judith , whom she knows best , and starts to say " What is it ? " but even as she speaks , Mr. Beresford , who seems to have forgotten everything else but his daughter 's presence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  INSERT  --  " What are you doing here ? " The question and his manner startle Mrs. Stuart ; they also arouse Dick 's immediate anger , and he swings angrily toward Mr. Beresford as he demands , " What do you mean by a question like that ? " For a moment Mr. Beresford removes his gaze from Judith 's white face as he turns half to Dick , half to Mrs. Stuart , and says in a stern , harsh manner  --  INSERT  --  " This woman is my daughter  --  Both Mrs. Stuart and Dick are astounded by this statement , but as they look from Mr. Beresford to Judith they realize it is true ; Judith still remains silent , her eyes fixed on her father , whose anger is now working into a white heat ; again facing Mrs. Stuart , he adds bitterly  --  INSERT  --   --  whose name is never mentioned in my home .

Judith winces , despite herself ; David shifts his position uneasily ; Mrs. Stuart is openly frightened and distressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great dislike to Mr. Beresford and he now advances toward him threateningly as he says  --  INSERT  --  " You may be her father , but I wo n't allow you to insult her .

Mr. Beresford gazes at Dick in amazement at this statement , and Mrs. Stuart shows that she is both surprised and upset ; it is the first she has heard of the engagement . Dick , as he makes this explanation , crosses to Judith 's side and stands by her protectingly . She flashes him a glance of gratitude . For the moment Mr. Beresford seems uncertain as to what to do , then he looks at Dick with an expression of unmistakable pity ; again his glance goes to Judith and his eyes harden ; turning again to Dick , he tells him bluntly  --  INSERT  --  " Ask her why she was forced to leave my house .

CLOSEUP ON JUDITH AND LITTLE DAVID She is still holding him tightly ; and a great transition is taking place in her ; she has stood for abuse and injustice from her own family ; has been branded a liar by her father ; all this has she stood , because it affected only her ; but now that it includes the truthful little chap standing in front of her , her affairs are different . She is determined they shall not cheat him ; the tiger in her is aroused ; she is going to fight ; her eyes shine fiercely and her face hardens . Little David notices this and is a bit frightened ; even more is he frightened by her strange , fierce manner , as she holds him tightly by the shoulders and tells him  --  INSERT  --  " They sha' n't disown you ! They sha' n't brand you with shame !

ANGLE OF BERESFORD LIVING ROOM , NEAR STAIRS Judith and Mrs. Beresford , still locked in each other 's arms ; but they now finish their embrace and stand back gazing at each other , their eyes wet with tears ; then for the first time Mrs. Beresford seems really conscious of the presence of little David . A carefully handled scene here as she glances at him and then looks at her daughter . She does n't say anything , but in her eyes there is a worried , half-fearful questioning . Judith reads the glance ; she calls little David to her and as she puts her arm about him , tells her mother solemnly  --  INSERT  --  " He is David 's lawful son . " This statement astounds Mrs. Beresford , who exclaims in a startled voice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Judith , her manner a mixture of desperation and impressiveness , seizes her mother 's hand with her free one and starts to explain . She says : " This is little David , and Nan was his mother . " As Mrs. Beresford looks at her incredulously Judith adds  --  INSERT  --  " They were married secretly . " There is no question but that Judith knows what she is talking about , and Mrs. Beresford , despite her amazement and alarm is impressed by the ring of her daughter 's words ; she again looks at little David , this time with a suggestion of tenderness in her eyes , then she asks Judith , " But , why did n't she say something ? " Judith tells her , " Because David would n't let her . "  --  28  --  477 . BERESFORD LIVING ROOM .

Mrs. Beresford is just telling her that she need not worry about little David , when the exterior door opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room he sees Judith and the little boy . He stops abruptly as tho some one had shot him , and with his eyes still fixed on his daughter 's face , automatically closes the door behind him . Then , his hands knotting themselves convulsively , he comes slowly down into the room , never removing his eyes from Judith 's face . She meets his gaze unflinchingly . Mrs. Beresford 's face whitens ; she is frightened , but also she is determined to stand by her daughter . Ignoring his wife , Mr. Beresford stops in front of Judith and one hand trembling with rage , points to the door as he says , " Get out ! " Judith hesitates , her glance going to little David . Mr. Beresford repeats his command in a thundering voice , but at this Mrs. Beresford , her eyes blazing fiercely , steps in between Mr. Beresford and Judith ; she looks her husband squarely in the face with an expression he has never seen before , as she tells him , defiantly  --  INSERT  --  " She shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Beresford almost forgets his anger in his amazement in his wife 's statement , but the amazement soon passes and a cold fury again takes possession of him ; he will not permit himself to fight with his wife . He returns her gaze ominously , and now , completely ignoring Judith and little David , tells Mrs. Beresford  --  INSERT  --  " This is my house  --  when I return I do not want to find her here . " In spite of her righteous cause and her determination to fight for little David , her father 's words cut Judith 's  --  29  --  heart ; in spite of herself , she droops slightly , but the fighting spirit of her mother is now burning with a white heat and she answers Mr. Beresford in a voice which rings with decision  --  INSERT  --  " If she goes , I go with her . " In spite of himself , Mr. Beresford starts at this statement . 502 .

CLOSEUP ON PART OF CONGREGATION AND PULPIT PLATFORM Shooting toward the platform and including among other pews that of the Beresford pew ; David stands on the platform with little David beside him . He is still denouncing himself in unmeasured terms , and now says  --  INSERT  --  " I wonder that even a merciful God does not strike me down as I stand before His altar  --  a liar  --  a cheat . " There is a strained silence as they all stare at him ; he waits a moment and then goes on , saying  --  INSERT  --  " The blind can not lead the blind , and I now resign from the Church I have disgraced .

Little David now tiptoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and then deciding to take a chance , says  --  INSERT  --  " Boo ! I 'm a little brown bear .

Little David advances still nearer , not quite certain of himself , however , and then as he looks into Mr. Beresford 's face , he seems to read reassurance , for he suddenly takes a flying leap into Mr. Beresford 's  --  31  --  lap . The old man gathers David to him , and the little chap nestles down contentedly . A pretty scene ; Mr. Beresford 's white head bowed in humility over that of little David . 566 . LIVING ROOM The Beresford family is in the foreground . Mr. Beresford still holds Judith in his arms ; David stands nearby watching them ; Mrs. Beresford , still sitting , has attracted little David 's attention ; as Mr. Beresford releases Judith , David crosses over to him and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed you , but I was n't what you thought me .

" David starts to disagree with this , saying , " No , it is my own fault . I should have told you . " But Mr.  --  32  --  Beresford will not hear of this . He shakes his head as he says  --  INSERT  --  " I have grievously sinned and the Lord has struck me down . " He seems so broken and unhappy as he stands gazing at them apologetically , a warm rush of love and tenderness sweeps over Mrs. Beresford , who instantly rises and , going to Mr. Beresford , puts her arm about him as she urges him not to think too badly of himself ; she finally induces him to sit down . Judith , who has been watching this action , now that her father is seated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under the circumstances , starts slowly toward the stairs .

BERESFORD , DAVID AND LITTLE DAVID , BERESFORD LIVING ROOM Another very pretty little scene . Mr. and Mrs. Beresford and David are listening with flattering attention to a fairy story which little David is telling them . The little boy is quite excited himself at the importance of what he has to divulge and now tells them with much impressiveness  --  INSERT  --  " So ' ittle Boy Blue blowed on his horn , and the giant did n't hurt him ' cause all giants like pretty tunes . "  --  33  --  He looks at them as tho he half expected them to doubt such a marvelous happening , but they all seemed not only convinced but delighted at what he has to tell them ; he smiles at them bewitchingly and continues his story . pp. 1-24 &nbsp;        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
