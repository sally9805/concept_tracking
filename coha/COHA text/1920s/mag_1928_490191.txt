DRIVEN from his apartment , which was being redecorated , a friend of ours decided to move temporarily into a newly-completed hotel around the corner and instructed his valet to that effect . The servant said he was sorry but he had never seen any new hotel around the corner . " Well , I 'm quite certain I saw them building one there , " his master replied . " I 'm afraid not , sir , " insisted the valet . To make sure , they put on their hats and walked round to find out . There it was , twenty-two stories high . We record this unimportant and wearisome little incident merely because it could have happened in no other city in the world nor at any other period in history . WITH calm , regretful eyes we have watched our colleges and universities become overcrowded to the point of embarrassment . Columbia recently reported a total registration of thirty-six thousand " despite all efforts to keep down the number of those admitted . " ( We sometimes wonder if Columbia regards as among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Sunday papers . ) Virtually every seat of higher learning has been pushed toward a policy of expansion  --  freshmen storming the portals , football keeping the alumni amused , endowment committees keeping the public informed as to the increasing monetary needs of alma mater . At regular intervals assurance is broadcast that the quality of alma mater 's product has not deteriorated . Our belief is that it has n't ; but we also look forward to an entirely new kind of college in this country  --  for which there is already a place . The large and Grand-Central-Terminal kind of institution , with its immense laboratories , dormitories , stadia , and money-raising committees , is adequate for the specialized training of engineers , doctors , and chemists . We doubt if it is ideal for the enlightenment of Arts students , who depend for their improvement upon the inspiration of their teachers . It all sounds Utopian , but we believe there will soon be small schools bathed in a sort of Greek serenity , devoid of examinations , degrees , three-year eligibility rules  --  schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever comes to the classroom at the appointed hour and sits down . Why , if one such school were founded , it would be overcrowded within a week . WE were watching the wearers of the Green parade up the Avenue last Saturday , musing on the pleasant fact that there are fewer parades in New York now than in the old days , when we met an old acquaintance . He was from New England , a stern and rockbound person , true son of the Pilgrims . The Irish celebrants seemed to affect him unpleasantly . " Do you know what day this is ? " he said . " Yes , " we replied , happily , as the green banners floated past , " today is St. Patrick 's Day . " " Fah ! " grunted our friend ( or Pooh , or some such expletive ) , " today is the anniversary of the British evacuation of Boston . " He turned and walked sadly away toward New England . ASIGHTSEEING bus still takes people through the Holland Tunnel , leaving from the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the wonders of the world , " the sign says . Although the tunnel opened months ago , the sightseeing business is still good , apparently . For all we know , it will be good indefinitely , such is the Aux of humanity in this seaport , and the tunnel may become as standard an attraction as Chinatown . The fact is , we have never been quite sure that a bus company could n't make money by running trips " across the world-famed Brooklyn Bridge , where Steve Brodie made his leap . " The bridge is much more exciting than the tunnel and , after all , is only some forty years old and has been crossed by only a handful of people , comparatively . We will guarantee to find a dozen people on almost any street corner who have not crossed it in five years  --  but whu would like to , now that they think of it . 111 here. ? to Go IT was after dark and the chauffeur drew up beside what seemed to him the right canopy on Park Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car revealing a smartly attired gentleman who half rose in his seat . " Pierre 's ? " he said . " Nope , " said the doorman , genially , " Sherry 's , but come on in , we have swell eats . " Trader Horn WHEN Alfred Aloysius Smith , of Africa , learned that the newspaper reporters were coming round in the morning to interview him , he asked his literary agent what they would ask him . " Oh , " said the latter , " they 'll ask you what you think of New York ! ' This evidently made a profound impression on Trader Horn , for he was up bright and early next day , walking round the town , so he could tell his interviewers what he really thought . To our knowledge this is the first time that ever happened . The old gentleman 's childlike simplicity in the midst of exploitation was lovely . Nobody quite like him ever visited these shores a fabulous man , only half real , a sort of ancient mariner . We met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wedged in between Zona Gale and Elinor cameras clicking , caterers catering , book circulation mounting ; but withal he was rather enjoying it , his long life among cannibals and animals having fitted him to withstand booksy folk and cameramen . He enjoys being picturesque , and does it gracefully and without offence . He thinks well of American reporters ? thinks they write ridicu-lous things and sublime things . When a Graphic man asked him what he thought of the American flapper as compared to the Queen of Sheba , he replied : " That is a juvenile question . " His friends say he is not at all fussy . He smokes anything offered him , eats large quantities of food , and likes a hit of brandy now and again . He has a suite in the Fifth Avenue Hotel and sleeps in his underwear by preference  --  a habit he formed when his home was a flop-house in Johannesburg . He dearly loves to autograph his book , and is apt to inscribe it " in memory of a pleasant evening " unless you catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , and he has certain expressions which he uses over and over , fondly . He describes himself as a " rogue elephant . " His ambition is to go back to Africa and make a motor trip from Cairo to the Cape in company with about three friends , or , as he calls them , convivials . He thinks it can be done because of his knowledge of native dialects . His riches are not new to him  --  he once had large sums of money before , when he was in this country . At that time he bought large sloop , rigged her with sails from the Shamrock I , wrecked her at the start of a filibustering expedition , presented her as a gift to the fishermen who pulled him out of the water , and spent a time recovering in the hospital in Trenton , N. J. Even his publishers seemed vaguely surprised that he was flesh and blood , and went out of their way to convince everybody that they had nothing up their sleeve . If you get to be a convivial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , you are privileged to call him Zambezi Jack . He told us at dinner the evening after the party that he once almost acquired possession of the original Ark of the Covenant and the Ten Commandments . He knows where they are and is considering going back one day and dickering again with the Arab chief who has them in hiding . His evening clothes are a harp ) mixture of day and night conventions . He wore a smartly cut dinner jacket and braided trousers , black silk socks and patent leather pumps . His shirt was white and flannelly with a soft collar , his necktie a beautiful gray four-in-hand . Freedom of Speech TN the crowded noon hour , within our hearing a man struck another for saying , in the presence of the former 's wife , " Aw fer blankety blank ! " The profane gentleman , thus chastised , called a mounted policeman . Several persons , including the insulted wife , tried to explain to the officer the outrageous epithet that had been used . " Aw fer blankets blank , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up a minute ? " Salle a Manger THERE is a great swaggering building under the Ninth Avenue " L " at the corner of Little West Twelfth Street , filled with quartered and dressed beef and veal . The name is given in the phone book as Otunan &; Co Inc btchrs 2 9th av , and that is exactly what it is except for the rambling second floor which becomes every now and then a restaurant as famous , among certain wise men of the town , as was Mouquin 's or any of the others . The Ottmans have been butchers here for several generations . A great part of their product goes down Little West Twelfth Street to where the black and red funnels of the Cunard Line stand against the Jersey sky , for the company has supplied steamship lines with meats for years  --  and hotels too . Thus Mr. Ottman the First came to know a number of eminent gentlemen who like the best of steaks . He used to give steak dinners for his friends . In this way the tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for the floor as a setting for parties of their own . It was frequently given and still is , but no one can pay for it  --  it is not for rent . So the long raftered room that glistens with beeves in the daytime is lined now and then with chairs and tables at night . WE attended last week the annual party given here by Mr. Benjamin Winter , the real estate man . The present Mr. Ottman personally presided over the stove as was the custom of the Ottmans before him . The walls bear the mural decorations of a dozen of the city 's more eminent cartoonists , and the list of those who , within the past quarter century , have attended steak dinners here includes the names of several mayors and senators and a great mixture of playwrights and novelists , manufacturers and bankers and these have been entertained , at some time or other , by many of the noted performers on Broadway . One of the entertainers at Mr. Winter 's banquet played the part of a Western Union messenger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems that the manager of the party and the wearer of the suit both had to swear or affirm that no dishonor would be brought upon it , that it would be kept neat and well-pressed , worn only with shoes brightly shined and that , should tips be offered the entertainer , he would accept them courteously and graciously . ? THIRD AVENUE iS a good place to see things . The other morning a sad man was leading a sad horse hitched to a junk cart . Tucked under a strap to protect the horse 's back was a dainty pink boudoir pillow . Portrait of a Gentleman Q0 stable has the liquor profession become apparently , that its hardships and perils are no longer serious . Speakeasy proprietors no longer worry their heads over the police agents  --  they have met the situation and have it well in hand . Our observation is , however , that a new danger has arisen , one more or less common in older lines of industry . We have in mind particularly the case of a man who built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devotion and Italian cunning  --  a former waiter , we understand . He prospered . For several years his place became growingly important . His patronage included stage people , artists , writers , the fabled intelligentsia ; long ago he began turning away the lesser fry attracted by the Great . No business man in town , we would have said , stood on a firmer foundation . After a time , however , the environment began to take effect ; the proprietor felt the urge to keep up socially with the customers he had come to know so closely . Several nights a week he was called upon to go to a theatrical opening to see the performance of an actor friend or the opening of a show written by a playwright customer . It became his habit to appear jovially at his place of business at about 11:30 P.m. , and then to sit around at his own tables and be served by his own waiters . Eventually he discoursed freely on the arts , politics and other subjects , and he stood his round of drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were not surprised to learn yesterday that he had failed ? through no fault of the United States Government . Roxy was just a voice , a cigarette-gleam in the dark . A microphone enlarged him until he was an electric and dissatisfied ghost , haunting every nook of the house . He sat at a desk in the tenth row orchestra , blowing a police whistle , tireless in his complaining . Sometimes he jumped up and hurried to the stage , his sarcasm running on ahead ; sometimes he beat the back of a seat with his hand , like a peevish child on the verge of tears . Before him were the assembled marvels of his henchmen of the ballet ? the dancers , the colored lights , the music , all awaiting coordination . And in order to get what he wanted , Roxy made his own changes in the score , ? sang ocan-tidd ) - oomp to the orchestra , showed dancers how to dance , and chastened the men who worked the lights . When we got there , the set was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing candles descended the long steep stairways through the proscenium boxes . Two choirs chanted and the orchestra played religious music . In the darkness below us was the cigarette . As the first of the descending figures reached the stage , the music welled up in a crescendo of such beauty that we were quite lost in the illusion . Suddenly there came three shrill impious blasts of the police whistle , the orchestra ? Rehearsal ARoxy show is put together on Saturday morning . Roxy does it himself , yelling . Not knowing how else to celebrate the first anniversary of the opening of his theatre , we paid it a clandestine visit last Saturday morning and , crouching alone in the balcony , looked clown on the Rothafellian mysteries . ceased playing , the votaries halted in their tracks , the choir notes trailed away , and the harsh electrical voice shouted : " Leon ! " It was as though someone had punctured heaven with a carving knife . " Yes , Mr. Rothafel , " said the ballet master . " Why do n't they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reply , Roxy followed up the complaint by dashing to the stage and making minor adjustments in the pose of a maiden prone at the feet of the Madonna  --  an adjustment the aesthetic ballet master thought was terrible , if the way he ran his hand through his hair meant anything . . In another number , a soprano , perched high in one of the boxes , was singing quite lustily when Mr. Rape ; directing the orchestra in his shirt sleeves , signalled his men to stop . " What 's the matter now , Erno " howled Roxy . " I ca n't see her mouth , " said Erno ( who belongs to the union and does n't call Mr. Rothafel " sir " ) . " If you could just get her mouth out of those flowers so I could see it ! " " I suppose she 's to sing just for you , heh ? I suppose we should forget the audience ! Never mind the audience , sing for Mr. Raped ! " It was that way all through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his almost childish pettishness , Roxy had a clear notion of what he wanted and how to get it . When a birthday cake number came on , his employees clapped  --  but the sentiment was short-lived : Roxy thought the number wasawful , and said so . We saw him pull it all to pieces and by changing the lighting and the arrangement , improve its looks  --  all to the consternation of the frightened and artistic gentlemen who had designed it . At twelve o'clock , after much bloodshed , the work was done . After a news reel had shown a caption to the effect that the Roxy Theatre had grossed $5,500,000 the first year , Roxy put his hand to his forehead and walked away , alone . The doors of the theatre were thrown open and a long line of people who had been waiting outside marched solemnly in and sat down  --  next year 's millions . Revenge EVERY Sunday night a certain weekly magazine broadcasts at nine o'clock some of its editorials and the like to the world . In that world exists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine has repeatedly spurned . He has a radio . Every Sunday promptly at nine he tunes in on the magazine , listens for approximately thirty seconds , smiles wickedly and then , by the simple expedient of twisting a little knob , rejects the whole business . ? Yellow Lights ROADWAY , as it everyone knows , has become brightly sprinkled with the names of Chin and Lee and Yoeng picked out in electric lights . Indeed , there is the story of the usually acute man in the Street who saw the sign for the movie " Chang " and observed that the chop suey places were beginning to take over even the theatres . A better informed gentleman who has been interested in the growth of these places has told us something of them . They are controlled , he says , by syndicates of Chinese importers and bankers , and their success is due to several factors . In the first place , larger floor space and popular prices . Again , the trick of supplying a dance band and all the trimmings at an approximate price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not perishable , there is a minimum of wastage , and costs are cheap . Our informant has figured that a bowl of chow mein retailing for $1.50 costs the kitchen only twenty-one cents . The kitchen , in fact , is where the Chinese syndicates first got their hold . Last year the frequent openings of new night clubs were for a time largely the result of Chinese financing . The syndicates bought up the kitchen concessions in many of the " white " clubs . They paid a handsome sum in advance and large royalties on the gross intake , so that the actual proprietors were able to open and keep going the first few weeks on this money . Many of the Occidentals opened and closed so rapidly that the ventures did n't pay anyone , but where the clubs continued the profits to the kitchen men were great . The purely Chinese places , however , have flourished , with only one exception . That was a place in the basement at Forty-seventh and Broadway . The Chinese had got people to walk up one flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they could n't get them to walk down . The first real stronghold on Broadway was won when tire Palais Royal of expensive memory became the Palais d'Or . ( The Chinese proprietor goes by the name of Mr. D'Or . ) Then the Chinese took hold of the old Rector 's at Broadway and Forty-eighth Street , and made it go where countless others had failed . It had been , for brief periods , the Boardwalk , the Cinderella Ballroom , Paul White-man 's club and the New Yorker . Now there are half a dozen Chinese places of the night club type in the Forties , and they are beginning to spot Brooklyn , Harlem , and the Bronx . Secret ALITTLE secret about Governor Smith has just got out , after many months . Last summer he was called upon to assist the governors of several states and a distinguished group of other persons in dedicating the battlefield memorial at Saratoga . The ceremonies were to begin at 12:30 P.M. At one o'clock Mr. Smith had not put in his appearance . The others laughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their laughter and chatting had quieted a little , the Governor of New York not being in sight and there being no bulletins about him . Finally he showed up , genial , smiling , expressing regrets , and murmuring something about important business . The real facts , one of our secret agents now advises , were these : during the long wait for the Governor someone decided to look in at the quarters of his daughter-in-law , Mrs. John Warner . The Governor was there . He was on all fours in the drawing-room playing " This little pig went to market " with his fourmonths-old granddaughter . He had forgotten all about the battlefield.
