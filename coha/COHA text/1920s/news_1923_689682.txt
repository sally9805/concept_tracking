txt The twins are now more than a year and a half old and still doing very well indeed . It will be remembered that they were a month old at the close of the first performance of " Abie 's Irish Rose , " which took place a year ago last May . If the New York critics had been right in their unanimous opinion , those two babies would have been dead two weeks from that evening , when they made their first appearance in theatrical circles . Instead of that , they have been on view every evening since , except Sundays , and at regular matinees besides , In contradiction of the law of nature governing the human birth-rate , four more pairs of twins have been added to the family in the period mentioned . This apparent miracle in the Levy family is explained by the fact that there are four other companies playing " Abie 's Irish Rose " in cities outside of New York . Chicago will have its first glimpse at this remarkable play next Sunday midnight , the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twenty thousand dollars . The experience of " Abie 's Irish Rose " has made the theatrical magnates gasp and some of there swear . None of them has had a finger in this fine financial pie . It eitme unobtrusively to the Republic Theatre without giving up a booking fee to either of the syndicates . It has been playing to capacity ever since . Emboldened by the New York success , a road company was organized to tour the country . It dropped into Washington for a week 's stay and remained fourteen .

Then Pittsburgh for bigger houses and a still longer stay . Erie , Pennsylvania , usually a one-night stand , yielded four weeks of highly profitable revenue . This meant ' the organization of more companies if the country was to be covered inside the present century . There are now five of them and as yet only the surface of profit has been scratched . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post hoc ergo propter hoc explanation for this phenomenal success . The piece deals with familiar types faithfully drawn except when slightly exaggerated for fun-making purposes . It may be low comedy , but it is real comedy which touches every grade of intellect . Now its fun gets over easily because of its widespread reputation for being funny . Its audiences come prepared to laugh and some of the spectators laugh where no laugh is intended , but there are many places where there is no doubt of the genuineness of the laughter of low-brow and high-brow alike . Its theme is racial antipathy , but Miss Nichols has handled this delicate subject with wonderful expertness in bringing out its humor and avoiding offence . When the Irish are scored on , the Irish laugh as heartily as any one and when Jewish traits are good-naturedly ridiculed there is no Jewish resentment . Both races have heard of the play and flock to it . Those who are of neither race enjoy the fun impartially and on its merits .
