txt The Harriman interests , according to report , paid $4,900,000 to certain individuals connected with the Kerr Navigation Corporation for 49,000 shares of the capital stock of that ' company . The payment was made in cash , and , still according to published report , this sum of $4,900,000 was seized and impounded by the Federal Government , which alleged that the stock had formerly been worth but $10 a share and the profits of the vendors , therefore , were $90 a share and subject to the excess profits tax , which , the Government believed , there had been an attempt to evade . Without assuming the truth or the falsity of these reports and passing  --  no judgment upon the procedure of the parties to the transaction , it may be Pointed out that this case , as reported , forcibly illustrates the vice of the excess profits tax . That tax is obstructive of the operations of business and is a penalty imposed upon industry , capacity and success . A man who , let us say , organized a small corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way by 1913 , and thereafter , by the diligent labor and sagacity of himself and his associates , developed , broadened and extended it into a great and profitable business , would find himself now , in 1920 , forbidden to reap the fruits of his toil by disposing of his interest in the concern because , if he should sell , the Government would take from him much the greater part of all the increment in value over what the shares were worth seven years ago . A man in that position might want to retire from business and invest his capital in interest-bearing securities ; he might want to put his capital into some new undertaking ; he might be in urgent need of a large sum of money to prevent great losses and to protect his investment in other industries ; he might have a dozen good and sufficient reasons for selling out . But he can sell only at such a tremendous sacrifice of his capital through the operation of the excess profits tax that selling is practically prohibited . The same rule of prohibition applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which has largely increased in recent years . This tax not only notoriously absorbs the investment fund of the country , and so obstructs industrial dervelopment , but in such cases as we have cited it operates to prevent the sale and transfer of property interests . Mr. MIMING in his answer to Mr. CRAWFORD 'S questions , published in THE TIMES of yesterday , says that he has frequently found the " excess " profits tax unfair . I think it un " just , and probably unnecessary from this time on . Moreover , it is not " only a discouragement to business , " but it is one of the sources of the " high cost of living . We shall work " out its early repeal . " Why have " we " not already worked out its repeal ? The Republican Party has had control of Federal expenditures for sixteen months . There is no visible reason why it should not have decreed a radical reduction in Government costs and have made an actual fact that repeal of the excess profits tax of which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague promise for the future .
