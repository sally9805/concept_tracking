txt For the first time since the Sixty-seventh Congress convened in extra session the Harding Administration Was under a concerted fire from the Democratic side of the Senate today . The basis of the attack was an editorial in The Washington Post of last Monday in which , under the caption " The Path of Progress , " the achievements claimed for the Administration were listed . The onslaught was directed by Senator Pat Harrison of Mississippi , his chief subordinates being Senators , Wolcott , Gerry and King . The Republican Senators sat in silence during the attack and when Senator Harrison concluded none of them replied . It was one of the liveliest hours of the present session , Senator Tom Watson of Georgia describing it as " a mosaic " of some of the best minds on the Democratic aide of the chamber . The Senate was convulsed at times , even many of the Republicans showing their enjoyment of some of the witticisms launched against them by Senator Harrison and his aids . The achievements of the Administration listed by The Post were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Passage of the immigration bin . 3 . Passage of appropriation bills that failed in the Sixty-sixth Congress .. 4 . Pending peace resolution to re-establish peace . 6 . Drafting of a permanent tariff bin in the House . 6 . Progress towards tax revision . 7 . Initiation by President of movement to reduce armaments . ft Plans for funding publics debt . IL Plans to put transportation on a satisfactory basin . 10 . Government assistance in industrial readjustments , 11 . Improvement in hospitalization and rehabilitation of invalided soldiers . 12 . Appointment of a new Shipping Board . Asks for Examena ? of Benefit . Referring to the Passage of the Emergency Tariff act , Senator Harrison asked these Republican Senators who had supported the measure to give the Senate one instance of benefit that had come to the farmers as a result of the passage of the measure , " There is not a Senator on that side of the Chamber , " he said , " who can cite such an instance , and this bill is listed as one of the achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island interrupted to state that the Deficiency Appropriation bill recently passed contained a provision for a bookkeeping arrangemdnt intended to mislead the people as to Republican economies . Senator added that the bill provided over 1500,000 for additional Government clerks , although the Republicans were seeking to deceive the people . he said , into believing that unnecessary clerks were being discharged . Administration claims that consderation by Congress of the peace resolution constituted an achievement led ' Senator Harrison to say : " You promised to establish peace right off the reel , yet this simple little resolution has not passed yet . " . " I ani wondering , " Senator Harrison continued , " what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts , Mr. Lodge , and the Senator from Pennsylvania , Mr. Knox , ' now think of their baby . It was demolished over in the House . They offered an insult to you Republican Senators . Yet , if- reports be true , they had the co-operation of the President . I am wondering what you will do with that resolution when it comes back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President to change the convictions of distinguished Republican Senators on the Colombian treaty , does not the Senator from Mississippi believe that when this new peace resolution comes to the Senate that Republican Senators will accept it ? " inquired Senator Wolcott of Delaware . Predicts an " Acrobatic Performance . " ? " I have no doubt , " Senator Harrison replied , " that we will see another acrobatic performance such as the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts performed on the League of Nations . That is in keeping with a good many changes by Republican Senators . They changed over night . on the disarmament proposition . The Senator from Washington , Mr. Poindexter , acting Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs ; stood adamant against the ** disarmament amendment and his colleagues over there were with him .. They would not stand for it . The President would not stand for it , so the newspapers said . Then suddenly , like a thunderclap out of a clear sky , the whole crowd changed and-switched to the supPert of Senator 1 ; nrah . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution and stand behind the one that bears the name of Mr. Porter . " When Senator Harrison referred to the assertion that . the preparation of a permanent bA .. was claimed as an Administration achievement , he pointed out that the Republicans began tariff hearings last Fall and still were considering the Tariff bill . " Yes , they are claiming an unborn child as an adult heir , " interjected Senator Williams : . Senator Wolcott-remarked that the Republican Party recalled to him Ben Franklin 's comment on the picture of King George on a tavern sign ? " always on horseback , but never getting anywhere . " The point , " said Senator Harrison , " is well taken . And in this connection I should like to have the country know that , for the first time in the history of Congress : a member of the other House , backed by the leaders of the - majority in that House . proposes to pass a resolution to have the rates imposed by this unborn baby go into effect immediately it is reported to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Longworth resolution .. Ridicules Disarmament claim . " Another achievement which is claimed , " he continued , " is that the President has initiated a movement looking to a confeernce of the great powers with a view to a reduction of armament . I wonder what the distinguished Senator from Idaho thinks about that proposition . The country will laugh at the suggestion that this was an achievement of the present Administration . Every one knows , and it was no secret , that the President was against any resolution touching the disarmament proposition . " When you Republicans killed the League of Nations you- killed the best plan . ever offered for disarmament , and the disarmament amendment now In the Naval bill would not now be there if it had not been for the . untiring efforts of Senator Borah and the Democratic membership of this body . The President , from his actions , though I do not know what his utterances have been , has- no sympathy with the movement for disarmament in this country . The Secretary of War is even talking to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying we should not ' proceed until all the nations start together . " And here is another assertion , which is that plans for funding the public debt are in hand and that a comprehensive program will be announced before long . It will be announced just a little before the next election , so that you Can hoodwink some people , and yet this is counted as an achievement of the present Administration . " Another achievement is that the Administration has taken up the subject of getting the transportation system upon a satisfactory basis , with a view to reducing rates . What they claimed as a great achievement last year  --  the Cumrhins-Esch bill  --  they now announce they are going to change . That is an achievement . " Still another achievement , " interrupted Senator Wolcott , " is that they are at work on the tariff bill . but they do not know yet what it will be . " " Do not worry ; the best minds will get together , " replied Mr. Harrison . It is keeping up the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing very quickly on every proposition and being just as clear as mud on everything . The people of the . country gradually are waking up to this fact . " ' This seems to be , " remarked Senator Watson of Georgia , " a mosaic speech of the ' best minds ' on this side of the chamber . " Senator Harrison ridiculed the claim that legislation for better hospitals and for the rehabilitation of sick and Wounded soldiers was a Republican achievement . He asserted that appropriations for these purposes , urged by the Democrats , were cut by the Republicans .. . Sees No Cut in Taxes . In response to an inquiry as to what the Republicans had done toward reduce ing taxes , Senator Harrison said : " That is one of the things that has been promised , but has not yet come about . A conference was held at the White House at a big dinner some two weeks ago , where that very important question was discussed of how we are going to revise the taxes and finances of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present  --  the biggest bankers , including J. P. Morgan . They would not let a little fellow in on that occasion . Only the men Worth millions and millions and who control the policies of Wall Street could appear and get a place at that festive board . " " One of the promises on which the Republican campaign managers put the greatest stress was that they would reduce taxation , " interjected . Senator Gerry , " and I would like to quote from the hearings held by the Senate Finance Committee on the question of reducing taxes . One of the Republican leaders , Senator Smoot of Utah , inquired of a You ' do not believe for a moment witness : that taxes are going to be less than they are this year for many years to come ? ' " Then answered his own inquiry by saying. : ' . Let me say frankly that I think they will ? be increased . ' That seems to indicate we are not to have the reduction in taxes . " " But ' the Senator from Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican Party would be unable to reduce taxes , " Senator Harrison answered . . " He promised they were going to lower the cost of living ; that they were going to cut down the expense of the Government ; that they were going to reduce taxes . Now , however , the folks are waking up : They can see that taxes are not being reduced ; that the cost of living is not " diminished : ' that they are in the hands of the biggest gang of reactionaries  --  I . will not sa.y pirates  --  of profiteers In the country . " " Is it not parallel with the pledge of the Republican Party in 1008 to reduce the tariff and after ' they got in power they said they had not promised to revise It downward , but they revised It upward ? " inquired Senator Gerry . ' Yes , and the very first time the people got a chance at them they threw them out of office , " Mr. Harrison            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
