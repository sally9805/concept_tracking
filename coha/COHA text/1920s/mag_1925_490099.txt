Notes and Comment THE society of American Teachers of Dancing has been hard at the work of prophecy , and comes forward with the statement that a modified Charleston will be the popular Winter dance , with " revivals " of the tango and waltz . Perhaps . But to anyone who can properly exhibit the Charleston , three steps of the tango , or one turn of the waltz on the postage stamp space provided in most of our restaurants and night clubs THE NEW YORKER will offer a silver-mounted copy of " The Survival of the Fittest " with a photograph of the author . THE new and gigantic skyscraper which is soon to be built in order to bring back to New York the credit of having the biggest office building in the world , according to the newspaper statements , is going to have its first seven stories underground . We are indifferent to this . It is the old story of locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen .

At least we do n't think it 's a crisis . But the authorities think otherwise ; for they have issued new bands to the duly initiated body  --  blue with two small stripes instead of one fat one . This means that those who have been deliberately fraudulent must make another trip to the hatband weaver 's . I comes as a surprise to hear that A Pullman porters have organized a union , and will demand a raise in pay - to cdaR because of reduction in tips . It is true that the old time " Thank you , Sir " with a smile , has not been readily forthcoming in response to tips for some time . But then , the awkward talk goes that one may expect thanks only when one has overtipped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps one has been undertipping without knowing it . How is one to tell ?

Return ON this , his second visit to the United States , Mr. Michael Arlen is the guest of Mr. Charles Dillingham , being at the moment deeply engaged in his host 's forthcoming presentation of Mr. Cyril Maude in " These Charming People . " And , between times , casting watchful eyes on " The Green Hat , " whose New York premiere next week conies just in the nick of time to save many of Mr. Arlen 's admirers from collapses fomented by anguished anticipation . Mr. Arlen , one learns , will be with us quite some of the time in the future . He has sold off his bothersome library , subleased his London flat and presented to his mother that superbly appointed Rolls-Royce which was the talk of feminine Mayfair ( it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in " These Charming People , " is nicer than that ? ) . ? He has , in other words , struck off the shackles which bound him to a particular spot , and is free to roam the globe , henceforth , a " one-trunk man , " as he puts it himself , or , again , " an Armenian with a rug over his shoulder . " It was on Mr. Arlen 's last visit that , at one of the dinners given for him , a guest remarked , " First Armenian I ever met who did n't try to sell me a rug . " Which mot was duly reported to its victim , who , mildly amused , observed that he used to laugh heartily at the quip until perhaps fifteen years ago . Many engagements press upon Mr. Arlen during this stay . There awaits the jaunt to Hollywood promised for next month and the one , or two , movies he must produce there , depending on how well he likes the ways and works of the Hon. Will Hays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joys of Broadway royalties until such time as he feels the urge to be off to Palm Beach . He may even take a flyer in Florida realty , for Mayfair 's laureate does not permit his appreciation of London 's culture to carry him off in a financial way . Most of his fortune is invested in American securities . This disloyalty to consols is as nothing compared to Mr. Arlen 's purchase of a Rolls Royce . Iris March , who drove through heavens knows how many editions in an Hispano-Suiza , may well turn over in her grave at the news . Li on WHAT with Mr. Arlen 's endeavors , and those of the newly-anointed Mr. Noel Coward , this theatrical season will have a distinctly British flavor . This seems only fair when one recalls the Budapests of other years and the state of London at the moment , where the hoards groan beneath the treads of so many creatures of American dramatists . Despite Mr. Lonsdale 's and Mr. Arlen 's superb efforts , this youthful Mr. Coward , whom New York knows thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has a White Ear . of lyrics for Chariot 's Revue , is the rage of the London dramatic season . Not since the sunflower days of Oscar Wilde has a British dramatist enjoyed at home such prosperous distinction  --  as he  --  four plays running at once , whilst the best the Wiidian vogue produced was three . And Mr. Coward is to have two more in New York soon : " The Vortex , " and " Hay Fever , " with even a third in the offing , if Mr. Charles Dillingham can persuade Miss Jane Cowl that " Easy Virtue " would be just the right vehicle to follow a triumph as Juliet Mr. Coward is still a youngster in years , being in his twenty-sixth , but he is old in the theatre . Behind him lie sixteen years of endeavor , for he was , in an earlier day , one of those fearsome ancients , a child actor . He has seen New York before , twice , and to his sorrow . He roamed his Broadway at nineteen and , again , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , occasionally hungry . Hungry or not , each time he returned to London , having convinced none here of his ability , save a few loyal friends , among them his compatriot , Miss Lynn Fontaine , who gave him precious artistic faith in the times when belief was denied by all others of Broadway . The characters of his comedies are limned with little mercy , and with less regard for weak-souled audiences . They are the younger Londoners of to-day , decadent and fiercely-indolent in the pursuit of unchastened pleasures . And yet the same pen which drew them dipped itself into a far pleasanter ink to produce the lyric with which Miss Beatrice Lillie convulsed the town not long ago , " There 's Life in the Old Girl Yet . " Holiday AND now the town faces Labor Day and the unwritten commandment to go forth to view woodland and beach for a last time , before the red and golds of Autumn make them glorious . Tradition decrees a crowded exodus and an even more crowded return over that week-end holiday which lowers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , for travel is never so laborious as then . Never , as on Labor Day , do the bridges , depots , tubes , ferries , and THE NEW YORKER other agencies of egress dernonstate so thoroughly their charming , new-world inadequacy ; never is that apartment in the Pennsylvania Depot which is set aside for the use of the Long Island Railway more full of people and carbon dioxide . But these dangers the public will face . If all goes well , between the flights of Friday and Monday , there will pass through that single whimsical subcellar alone something better than a million pounds of human flesh seeking pleasure on the beaches , swayed now by hope , and now harried by despair . And while they strain to get on , elsewhere the bridges will be groaning and the ferries will be reeling under frightful burdens ; the roads will be black with motors for fifty miles around , and a million people will be breathing the exhaust of the cars in front . Oceans of pop will be drunk ; tons of chewing gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampton may have their house parties at this time , but they will be fin du raison affairs ; society by now is jaded by three months of verdure and surfeited with ozone . Labor Day is for the many , not the few . The many will go and they will return . And when they have sunk back into their flats , jaded at Summer 's end , Fall will dip its brush in magic colors and smear them across the countryside . But never will one member of the Labor Day crowds gaze on those glories . For them , there will be no country until Memorial Day shall hid them go forth once more . Generosity EMPLOYEES of the hotel in St. Louis from which Mr. George Herman Ruth of the Yankees Baseball Team left in disgrace for New York , minus a $5,000 fine imposed by Manager Huggins , reported the Home Run King departing in the best of humor . Mr. Ruth is an easy-going Sultan , and perhaps these same employees remember a hot week earlier in the Summer when the batsman made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding himself a trifle short in wearing apparel , strolled to a haberdasher 's and YOUNG COMPOSER : "  - -  anci are you familiar with my compositions ? " GUEST : " Yes , I knew most of them before yoi4 were born . " bought some twenty , bright silk shirts . These he wore throughout the team 's stay , at the rate of three a day ; and when the Yankees moved on he left them , strewn about his room . " They 're yours , " said Mr. Ruth to a conscientious bell boy who ran after him with the collected garments . Reconnaissance N odd occasions through the Sum-11/4-1 mer , one of our industrial generalissimos is to be noticed combining the needs of travel with the opportunity it affords for keeping the common touch . He is Mr. James A. Farrell , the president of the U. S. Steel Corporation , who commutes on the New York , New Haven &; Hartford , scorning the club car in favor of the day coach . There is much method in his apparent madness . Mr. Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and before the train has swerved across the Harlem River Bridge , the steel chieftain has his unsuspecting companion delivering himself of his views about matters of daily concern . By this method , I presume , Mr. Farrell keeps more accurate fingers on the common pulse than do his com-Lyric IT is not altogether just to tag Senator James J. Walker so prominently with that dolorous lyric which won him early fame . " Will You r Love Me in December as You Do in May ? " was written in a sentimental age , when beery tears rolled down many a bloated cheek upon its rendition by throaty singing waiters . It was only a few years behind the bathetic " Just Break the News to Mother , " and it preceeded by approximately the same interval Mr. frying Berlin 's too-tragic , " When I Lost You . " The days which produced such songs are dead days , and , some say , dear ones . Senator Walker knows better . One of a group , being a bit maudlin , recited one night Miss Millay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot we find what we are seeking , Is idle , biologically speaking . " I would rather have written that , " said Senator Walker , " than be the Governor of this state . " He meant it , then . The Celt 's soul was ascendant . But the next morning , when the mind was in control again , he would have scorned the idea . The Governor of this State is a force , as Senator Walker so well realizes A poem , after all , is only an idea . Celebrity IT may be that by this time , Mr. Charles Chaplin is on his way to Canada , to get the month 's sleep he so ardently craves , and to forget , for a time , that he is a motion picture producer with a motion picture payroll to be met each week . But , at the moment of writing , he was still at the Ritz , his telephone disconnected as protection against the invitations which , despite a stay of several weeks , flooded upon him . He has almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been ogled once or twice by the dancers at Montmarte and by audiences in a few theatres . Such attention annoys the comedian . He prefers being ignored ; and 4 THE NEW YORKER this preference was granted him one night lately , when he held a reunion with Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt , jr. , newspaper publisher in Mr. Chaplin 's own Los Angeles , and here on the business of his new air freight line . Presently the pair set forth for the Bowery , clad appropriately . Mr. Chaplin , by the way , always has had an ambition to own a newspaper . It was their Harun-al-Rashidian whim , this evening , to fall in beside some Bowery lounger and invite him to coffee . Thereafter , when their guest had been warmed to conversation , they would lean forward , one on either side , and say : " You know who I am ? I 'm Charlie Chaplin . " " And do you know who I am ? I 'm Cornelius Vanderbilt , jr . " At first there would be appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would persist , as part of their sport , in making further statements so incredible that ultimately their derelict guest would flee , his worldly wisdom deeming it best to be away from there when the keepers arrived to reclaim their strayed lunatics . They tried their game many times , and always their guests left hurriedly . The Bowery is no place for gullibility . THE remnants of our tenderloin districts hold a fascination for Mr. Chaplin , and he is at his happiest far from the enforced appreciation of his genius . Many times has he slipped away from the Ritz , on one occasion when seventy-five diners were seated , waiting to honor him . Cinema friends , missing him on Broadway , have been wont to infer intellectualism and snobbery , but they have been a little off the track . Even in his shopping habits , Mr. Chaplin is anything but a snob , for he will not patronize exclusive tailors and has been buying his clothes ready-made around the corner from the Ritz . Bridge BRIDGE and radio  --  those twin 1- ) destroyers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do their labors together this Fall and Winter . Every ten days a rubber played by experts will be broadcast from a Cincinnati station and rebroadcast by so many others that the country can not miss it , or escape it  --  as you please . The gentlemen who will play these interesting games are the Messrs . Work , Whitehead , Lenz , and Sher-wood , the last better known in Chi-sago than he is here . It may seem strange that Mr. Foster is not included among the experts , hut , as is frequently the case in other games , he is a much better instructor than he is a player . The hands to be played will not be those which come from the chance of the deal , but carefully prepared ones , selected because they exemplify difficult problems of bridge . Radio and bridge , however , have gained their popularity in differing fields . Where bridge is played incessantly , radio receiving sets are not always found . Perhaps the Fall and Winter are to bring rapprochement . Shadows THE whisper worship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " still stirs at the Century and those who took seats to the opening of the German cinema " Siegfried , " spent the first moments of their tenancy in shaking off the filmy fingers of medieval ghosts . The vast , Corinthian interior seemed somehow tawdry . The auditorium had passed from the shadow of the cathedral to the gilt lamplight of present . Then the house darkened , and the dignity of other ages returned to the majestic hum of Wagner 's music . ' his Wagnerian score demands more musicians , by the way , at union rates , than Mr. Lee Shubert ever dreamed of . So many more that , before the opening , he approached Mr. F. Wynne-Jones , UFA 's American representative , to ask if he did n't think an organ might do just as well as an orchestra . " Wagner never wrote music for the organ , Mr. Shubert , " replied Mr. Wynne-Jones , coldl y . " It was Bach ! " So the orchestra was agreed to , and M. Zuro was summoned to wield the baton over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riesenfeld with reminiscences , after the opening , of the time when the Herr Doctor was M. Zuro 's concertmeister , Remodelling VISITING French , English , and V Armenians might reproach New Yorkers because our hotels had no atmosphere beyond luxury , because no building ever was allowed to mature into mellowness , but there was always the Brevoort . A citizen was able to take the visitor to the spot where Fifth Avenue sprouts from the lush root of Washington Square , and indicate the delicate facade of that hotel . The mere indication was usually crushing . If not , the attention-caller emphasized the funny high steps which formed so logical an egress to still waiting fiacres , so perfect an entrance to a lobby that was a mere vestibule to a dining salon reminiscent of days when food was food . But where to silence the visitor now ? No later than last week the Brevoort was seen to be having its face lifted . Trussed to the operating table by scaffolding , the high steps were being removed , perhaps as innocent violators of some sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level entrance of glistening apartment-house white , a marble arch over which the windows drooped tired , Victorian eyelids . The same will lead to a new lobby , much larger than the cubby that made it necessary to buy a French book at the bookstand , so juxtaposed were you if you had long to wait . The shaking grille of the elevator is being replaced by stalwart mirrored security with pearl buttons . The new architectural costume is by no means complete , so one may only hope , bravely , that it will not develop into a stylish stout . Deduction NE of the guests in Mr. jascha Heifetz 's Narraganset home on the occasion of the thirty thousand dollar jewel robbery has returned with an epilogue to the comedy drama which escaped the correspondents . The police , of course , were called in after the robbery , and they were in doubt again , of course  --  as to whether a burglar had entered or the robbery had been done by someone within the household . They debated long over this problem . Was it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes of concentrated thought , announced , Eureka-toned , " I 'll find out . " He went to his own suite and placed what money he had on his person ? eighty-five dollars  --  in the bureau drawer from which a jewel case had been stolen . Then he went off to a bridge . Upon his return , Mr. Heifetz found that the eighty-five dollars also had vanished , He telephoned the police at once . " Well , that was an inside job , at any rate , " they informed him , with their customary shrewd deduction from the facts .
