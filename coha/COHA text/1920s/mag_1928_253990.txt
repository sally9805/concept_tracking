Even in Italy there is one harsh voice which caws and carps at Fascismo and its Duce-the voice of The Black Bird . <P> How this most virulent of anti-Fascist news organs is distributed throughout Italy was revealed last week at Baltimore , U. S. A. , by its editor , spruce Dr. Vincenzo Nitti , son of the exiled onetime Prime Minister Francesco Nitti who now resides in Paris . <P> The Black Bird , explained visiting Editor Nitti , is printed at Paris in editions of 12,000 on thinnest India paper . Once in an envelope an issue of this news organ can no more be detected in the mail than a sheet of common note paper . Thus the entire edition of 12,000 copies is mailed into Italy , despite the ban on anti-Fascist literature . As an added precaution , each edition is mailed outside of Paris , from a city which changes from week to week . <P> Commenting generally , Dr. Nitti said : " The wealthy class in America . . . approve of Fascismo because , in their opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . They do not look further . "
