txt While it is correct to say that the first stage of Commander BYRD 'S Voyage to the Bay of Whales In Ross Sea was completed when lie arrived at Wellington on Nov. 5 , the great adventure will not really begin until the departure for the Antarctic Continent . New Zealand is the main base , whether the start be made from Wellington , on North Island , or Dunedin , on . South Island . The latter is the great whaling port , and nearer . Ross Sea . Time . just now , is not important , except to make the final preparations . A month should suffice to reach the Barrier from New Zealand . There is of course a hazard in any voyage to the Antarctic base , as SHACKLETON learned in 1914 , for the . Endurance was caught in the pack ice , drifted north for a thousand miles or so , and was in the end crushed and abandoned . In his expedition of 1907-1909 , the purpose of which was to march to the South Pole , SHACKLETON had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sailing from Lyttleton on New Year 's Day , 1905 , the Nimrod arrived off the Barrier in Sound on Jan. .29 . On Feb. 22 , after stores and equipment were landed and work was begun to make the party comfortable in the Long Night , the Nimrod sailed back to New Zealand . Commander BYRD will probably allow himself more than four weeks for the voyage to the Barrier . In the City of New York ( the ex-Samson ) he seems to have a stouter ship than the : Nimrod . Whether the City of New York is faster may be doubted . But she is better suited for the rough work to be done , and her hull is so heavily timbered that she should perform well in pack ice . Taking into account the hazards of Ross Sea , Commander BYRD may decide to make an earlier start for the Antarctic than SHACKLETON did . His base will be in the Bay of Whales , and the margin in his favor might well be a week or ten days . The expedition will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters , a mess hall , bunk houses and a machine shop . The first will contain Commander BYRD 's office , quarters for the scientists and doctors and a radio plant . lu addition , there will be a weather station and radio towers . The airplanes will have to be protected from the rigors of the worst climate in , the world . Well has Dr. MAwsatv , the Australian explorer , called the Antarctic the " Home of the Blizzard . " The Byrd party Will be more elaborately housed than any previous expedition . Not a great deal may be heard from it during the stay in New Zealand , but once that base is left behind , its adventures sailing south to the ice pack , as described by radio every day , will be of absorbing interest . When the Barrier is reached in the Antarctic Summer there will be a. story to tell every twenty-four hours , and readers of THE TIMES will have it at the breakfast table .               @ @ @ @ @ @
