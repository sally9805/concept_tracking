Harvard Can not Legislate Race Problems Out of Existence <P> The Board of Overseers of Harvard University unanimously adopted a unanimous report of a faculty committee advising against any form of racial or religious discrimination . And the press is unanimous in hailing that decision as " a victory for free thought , " a triumph of tolerance , - and , incidentally , a sound reproof to President Lowell for daring to mention the race problem in the first place . There is a great deal of editorial gesturing over " the democracy of letters " and " the old Harvard tradition of liberalism " and everyone from editor-in-chief to proofreader professes to be exceedingly relieved . <P> And , of course , all this declamation is as silly as it can very well be . No one denies the nobility of such sentiments . No one in his senses could fail to approve the action of committee and Board . And , parenthetically , no sane member of either body could very well have reached a different conclusion . But , nevertheless , the incident is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free thought . On the contrary it is a magnificent example of the power of platitudes . <P> Harvard has a race problem . She had a race problem when President Lowell first refused to concede to its existence and he was one now that the Overseers have tried to legislate it out of existence . And she will go on having a race problem for some generations to come . There are groups at Harvard , as at Columbia and Chicago and-to a less extent-at Yale and Princeton which are not harmonious . The result is friction and ill feeling which can not help but have unfortunate effects <P> It may not be true that the best way to solve difficulties created by the animosities of groups and classes is to let them alone . But it can not be true that the best way to think about them is to pretend that they do n't exist .
