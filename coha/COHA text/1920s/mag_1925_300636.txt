To George Bernard Shaw , famed sophisticate , from Grigori Zinoviev , Chief of the Third Internationale , went an answer to the former 's sneering criticism of the Bolshevik regime . Said M. Zinoviev : " Shaw , flower of the petty bourgeoisie , considers himself above Karl Marx . But if we compare both , Shaw appears as a scarcely visible dust speck . <P> " Shaw and Wells ( who does not like Karl Marx 's beard ) think we made an idol of Marx . They forget that the teachings of Marx have conquered a sixth part of the world , and disregard the probability that the masses will eventually take over world power , cutting off many ruling heads . <P> " I hope Shaw will live long enough to see the new epoch . <P> " Shaw ridicules the Third Internationale , disregarding historic processes . In this respect , the dramatist is as dull as Lord Curzon . Like other petty bourgeoisie , the Socialist Shaw favors Marxism in Russia but not in England , thereby proving ignorance of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
