Having denied last fortnight the New York Graphic 's statement that he had resigned as its editor and publisher so he could " retire and rest " ( TIME , July 22 ) , Emile Henry Gauvreau last week told what he was going to do . <P> Said he : " I 've accepted a job as associate editor of the New York Mirror tabloid Graphic rival . My main job will be to conduct a daily column called ' Now ' dealing with world affairs . It will be much on the order of Arthur Brisbane 's ' Today ' except that I hope to make it more satirical and intimate . My new salary will be much larger than what I received from the Graphic . " <P> Observers , recalling that only last month Walter Winchell , gossip-columnist , had broken his Graphic contract to go with the Mirror ( TIME , June 17 ) , thought they saw in the new Gauvreau job an explanation of the ease with which the Winchell contract had been broken .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
