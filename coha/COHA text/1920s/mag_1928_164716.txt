With $500,000 surplus cash to put aside until it is needed , a corporation usually does one of two things . It may bury the money , either in gilt-edged securities , yielding from 3 to 4% , or in its bank account , where it draws 2% as a commercial deposit . Or it may ask the bank to lend the money out on call , at interest rates ranging from 5 to 10% . As the bank asks only a small commission for this service and generally assumes all the risk , the conversion of surpluses into call loans has become a popular feature of corporation financing . In the last year , the total of such loans has risen from $906,144,000 to $1,808,645,000 . To the corporations , this practice seems both obvious and admirable . But to the paternal superbankers , guarding the money market , it appears highly hazardous , deeply disturbing . Last week , the issue became acute , the crucial phase of the war of the bankers and the speculators . Clear were the battle-lines . Corporations contended simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 ) that the money market will never be stable , settled , with such a staggering amount of money on call , likely to be withdrawn at any moment when the corporations may need it ; and 2 ) that too much money is diverted to speculation , too little to the economic needs of the U. S. Councils of war followed . Bankers considered increasing the charge made for placing the loans , fixing a minimum amount to be lent . Corporations countered by throwing an additional $36,913,000 on the call loan heap . Cried Charles Edwin Mitchell , president of the National City Bank : " It is a dangerous and unhealthy trend . " Said able Vice President Francis Hinckley Sisson of the Guaranty Trust Co : " This is one of the by-products of prosperity with which we have not learned to dal . " Warned the wise Cleveland Trust Co. : " Clearly a reform is needed in New York banking practice . " Screamed the financial writers , sensationally : " Boot leg Loans ! Outlaw Banking ! " Depressed , discouraged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new low . But the stockmarket , still optimistic , held its own , advanced a little .
