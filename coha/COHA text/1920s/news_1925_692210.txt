txt Finance Minister Loucheur must start all over again . Twice today in the Finance Commission his proposals were defeated and sent back for consideration in terms which , while the ; avoid an immediate crisis , create a. most delicate situation . In normal times any Finance Minister so treated would resign , but this evening 1 . ' . Loucheur , after a long conversation with Premier Briand , decided to . make another effort and promised to , bring him a new set of proposals . Whether these will have any better fortune than the first ones it is impossible to say . F r there is this in the situation which must be counted , that the lack of confidence shown by today 's vote is more generally in the proposer than in the proposals . He is not strong enough to impose his plans , and failing such strong treatment the Finance Commission and the Chamber are so divided that they need never be expected to agree on or with ' anything he proposes . Two Votes by the Commission . Today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auriol demanding that before anything else was done in the way of procuring money for the creation of a sinking fund there should be further economy extension instead ? of an increase of the . income tax , further repression of fraud and a new regime with regard to real estate valuation for taxation purposes . His motion was adopted by 16 to II and amounted thus to rejection of all M. Loucheur 's plans . Then M. Renaudel. apother Socialist . proposed a more definite rejection . His motion read ; " Considering that the projects with regard to new taxes and the sinking fund proposal do not correspond to the necessities of the moment and do not meet as they ought . the charges which the country inustk face , the Finance Commission decides to retain only the projects with regard to the repression of fraud and evasion . Of fiscal obligations and to return the others to the Minister of Finance while continuing work on solutions destined to assure the balancing iof the budget . " , This motion was adopted by a vote of 15 to 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue , as M. Renaudel proposed , ' work at getting the budget proposals pushed through apart from those for the creation of a sinking fund . In this way an opportunity-Is given to M. Loucheur to come back with a new plan , but if hi does he must frame his I plan according to the directions given in Aurioi 's motion  --  that is to say , he ' must incline toward the Socialist theories as . to what must im , done . Not even ' those closest to the Finance Minister can tonight predict ' what he will do . During the last governmental crisis , when he was a candidate . for office , he had a remarkable - and ' dazzling manner of *producing new plans ' every day from his fertile brain. ? May ' peyote Himself toBudget Only . In the present circumstances ; how ' ever , is thought that , perhaps the . best thing he . could do  --  and it will= be , . perhaps , what ' hedo-1S to let things alone- and go ahead , as the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary funds for balancing the , : budget and leave the sinking fund - discussion and plans alone until the budget has been adopted and there is less excitement . That , it seems , was Premier Briand 's advice tonight  --  to get put through what I was possible and leave the rest4111 later . . The Cabinet will tomorrow morning discuss the situation . For tonight , all 51 . Loucheur had to say was : " We are going to consider the - two motions of the Finance Commission , which seem rather contradictory , and after we have considered the general situation we will see what we must do . " That may mean - anything , It may mean the resignation of the Government . It may mean nothing . M. Briand is de ' termined at all costs to hold on constitutionally and ease matters over the present crisis of uncertainty and nervousness and that seems the more likely course . But the general situation can not be considered otherwise than as grave . The franc took a fresh tumble today to 27.67 . There are alarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of a " Committee of Public Safety . " At one Fascist meeting tonight in Paris smoke bombs were thrown and the police and firemen had to ? clear the ball of the angry disputants . A fever of anxiety is beginning to grow and spread Few people know yet Just what they ' want or how to get it . But all are nervous and are making the inevitable contrast that yesterday . while Russian S per cents stood at 36 paper francs . French 5 per cents stood at 41  --  a difference of only 5 paper francs . If there were any clear issue or any great leaders there might be trouble . But so far there are none , and , taking advantage of this disarray . M. Briand may be expected to go slowly and carefully unless his hand is suddenly forced . His aim Is a new election . But before then the budget must be balanced , and there must be a new election law . He can be counted on tomorrow to play for time , but against him as the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quicksand here in which even the surest feet may falter and sink .
