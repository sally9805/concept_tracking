txt George Harvey , former American Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. sees a dubious and gloomy future for Great Britain , according to an article he wrote in the December number The North American Review , which .. s out today . Whether Great Britain will be able to fulfill her financial obligations to the United States and still be . able to maintain her rank as one of the foremost industrial and commercial powers of the world is discussed by Colonel Harvey in detail . In order to do so she will have the longest and hardest pull ahead that she has ever : no-m , Colonel Harvey concludes . Colonel Harvey takes his text from a statement by the British Ambassador , Sir Borne Howard , who said Jr effect that the time might come soon when the United Kingdom would be ma , ' le to meet its debt payments to America . Colonel Harvey says he does : lot believe Sir Esme meant to suggest repudiation . but conceivable default , arising from obvicus incapacity to pay . Analyzing the official statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colonel . Harvey finds that while technically there was a reduction in 1924 from the highest point in 1020 , there was an actual increase of 324,000,000 in 1022-23 to f355,000,000 in 1925-26 , of ? 33,000,000 per annum , despite the exaction of taxes amounting to $86.94 , or 23.2 per cent . upon the national Income of $2,74.74 per capita , the heaviest imposed upon any people . " " There seems , " continues Colonel Harvey . " to be no escape from the conclusion that ever since the war England has been , and is today , existing upon her capital . Says Productive Era Is Over . " England 's period of productivity has passed ; her sole function henceforth can be none else than that of ' middleman ' or manufacturing intermediary between producers of raw materials and consumers of finished articles , working under the competitive disadvantage of huge costs of both fetching and carrying . " The simple truth is that Britain has realized on her natural wealth in iron ; her ore mines are now of little ? value and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost in smelting , has ceased to be a factor . " Coal mining is the one great ? productive industry which has seemed likely to be maintained , although at depths which has made it too costly for any but home consumption . It would now be in a state of utter collapse but for a heavy direct subsidy granted by the Government , in sheer desperation , to provide a few months ' time for study and possible solution of a problem which appears upon its face to be insoluble. ? ' Referring to the fact that a large majority of British ship building yards are closed , or are being closed , Colonel Harvey says : " The chief cause of this partial collapse ilea In the fact that other countries have so.greatly increased their mercantile fleets that the British share in shipping has decreased from 44.5 to less than 33 per cent . But It is a far more ill-boding circumstance that , in recent competitive bidding ; British firms , though offered ? 10,000 more for each ship than a German firm required , were unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected when the full force of German efficiency shall be brought into play . " Colonel Harvey notes that in 1024 the total export and re-export trade was only ? 795.000,000. while Governmental expenses were ? 788,000,000 , " That is to say , " he comments , " the gross exports of a country wholly dependent upon its foreign trade barely exceed the cost of running its Government . Cites Drop in Farm Labor . " Turning to other phases of the situ- ' ation , we find that nearly ? 400,000,000 a year is paid for imported foods , that the number of agricultural workers Is less by 400,000 than it was 50 years ago , and that the wages of farm laborers In Norfolk have just been fixed , subject to confirmation by the Minister of Agriculture , at the starvation sum of 28 shillings a week  --  hardly as much as the like service in this country yields per day , " Emigration designed to reduce by 10,000,000 the present over-population has been tried in vain . Last year , despite the growth of unemployment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 88,883 people left to take up residence in the Dominions and colonies , as contrasted with 223,851 in 1913 . Meanwhile , the population , augmented by 2,000,000 during and since the war , continues to increase steadily at the rate of 6,000 a week . " The new era of commercial rivalry which will be ushered in when , during the forthcoming year , the decks shall be cleared for adtion , will find England facing disadvantages such as have never confronted her before . Her national debt will approximate $40,000,000,000 , calling for annual interest payments of nearly , if not quite , *2,000,000,000 . " No doubt , as we are tole persistently . it is our duty to help ' the world ' ; but even obligations have degrees . Our first duty is to the one great country that has established all Anglo-Saxons , our people no less than hers , as deservedly and unmistakably pre-eminent in financial integrity among the races of the earth . " It has become a cardinal prir - iple of Great Britain , wider the avowed headship of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendliness of , or give offense to , the United States . In honor , no less than in consideration of our own material welfare , we should respond in kind and make fidelity to our race second only to loyalty to our country . "
