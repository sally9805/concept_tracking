When Mrs. Emma Marshall was sent to the penitentiary in Alabama , there to await execution , notions began slowly to revolve inside her head . She had been convicted of murdering her husband , because he , lying on his deathbed , had signed a document asserting that she ( his Christian wife ) had slain him . What possibility was there then that she could escape the law 's severest penalty ? Her husband was an atheist , remembered Mrs. Marshall ; false-swearing by an atheist , even on a deathbed , promises no future punishment . An atheist is therefore considered more likely to be a liar than a man who believes in God . In two states , Arkansas and Maryland , there are provisions by which an atheist 's testimony is non-negotiable in court ; any court would be likely to recognize the logic behind the theory or to be swayed by the prejudice which exists in the minds of God-fearers against those who are infidels . Thus Mrs. Marshall prepared last week an appeal to the Supreme Court based upon the probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appeal be made successfully , it would become impossible for U. S. atheists to expect justice at the hand of the law . It would be theoretically permissible to bait atheists in the streets , to revile or cast filth upon them , to slaughter them in shambles , all with impunity . Such a condition would not be welcomed by U. S. atheists ; hence it became their interest to see that Mrs. Emma Marshall failed in her appeal . Charles Smith , President of the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism , telegraphed to Attorney General Charles McCall of Alabama , asking permission to have his organization represented by lawyers at the trial . Attorney General McCall intimated that he would grant such permission . <P> Just whom the atheists would send to their defence was not quite certain . It did not , however , seem probable that they would lack legal talent . Clarence S. Darrow was of course their loudest trump ; Arthur Garfield Hays was another attorney in their lineup . Probably Charles Smith , a demure and smiling infidel , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the procedure . <P> Atheists are hampered in their activities by the fact that few public personages dare testify to disbelief in God . Sensation seekers crowd their ranks and an atheist fanatic is equalled in insane ferocity only by an inflamed revivalist . Yet leading atheists claim many famous figures as their allies . Such figures are : Sinclair Lewis , Clement Wood , Clarence Darrow , Freeman Hopwood , Theodore Dreiser , John Broadus Watson ( behaviorism ) , E. Haldeman-Julius , A. G. Keller .
