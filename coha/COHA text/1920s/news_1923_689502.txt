txt If one did not know They Cheered that any place of asBut Will semblage in this city Do Nothing . can be ' filled with people willing or eager to applaud any cause or proposal , one could feel surprised that the Manhattan Opera House was crowded Sunday evening with men and women who received with vociferous cheers one of the most unwise speeches ever made and enthusiastically promised to take action the only possible result of which would be disaster . The speaker was Dr. WILLIAM PoPcIrs . President of the United German Societies , his hearers were all , presumably , of German birth or more or less near German descent , and what he told them to do  --  and what they promised to do ? was to set themselves definitely and firmly apart from other American citizens and , by exerting their power as a political unit , to compel the American Government to make effective intervention between France and Germany for the protection of the latter country from further- coercion at the hands of the former . - Now , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin should view with deep grief the present state of Germany and should be desirous that in some way or other peace and prosperity may " be restored to that distracted land . They are not alone in entertaining such feelings , nor are they to be blamed for seeing one side of the Franco-German question more clearly than the other side . It is a different thing , however , when they assume the possibility of coercing other Americans into taking up arms in defense of Germany , for that Is exactly what they must have had in mind when they cheered Dr. POPCSE 'S reminder of their political strength here . Of course , our GerA Reminder man-Americans Some those who were at the Manhattan OpDistant Days . era House no more than the rest of them  --  are not going to follow the extremely bad advice which they received and applauded at that meeting . Much the same sort of talk was heard here at the beginning of the war . It continued right up to the moment of American participation , but not one of the threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried out . When it came to the point , all except a negligible minority found out that they were Americana first , and Germans by a remote second , if at all . Only the negligible minority raised a hand to interfere with our military activities against the Central Empires , and when these few spies and traitors were punished no protests were heard . It will be the same now . There will be no German party in America , as distinguished from the other political parties , and the belief in the existence of " German vote " is an illusion long since abandoned . The Germany of today will get no more help from German-Americans than did the Germany of 1914 or the Germany of 1917 , and nowhere more than in Germany itself is this fact recognized , as all German-Americans must realize who read what the German papers say about them . ing  --  or " Summer time , " as it is better called in England ? as they are in inventing reasons for opposing it . soon the country would enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the war was on . Well illustrating this are some remarks made by Dr. E. Wirms KOBLES of the New York Health Department ' in a report to the Children 's Aid Society on the causes of illness and undernourishment among the young . Solemnly he includes among those causes the advancing of clocks in Summer . He said that he found it harmful because " children feel that they should be on the streets while it is yet daylight , and this . keeps them unduly active , preventing a normal relaxation that should precede bedtime . " Also , " many parents " have told him that " it is impossible to get the child to go to bed before it is dark . " If the second Of these statements is true , then not daylight saving should be attacked , but the ill-advised habit of the sun in setting later in Summer than in Winter . For it-la the sun , and not the manipulation of clock hands , that determines when there shall be darkness and when light . On the other hand . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Children as ingenious in adapting Deprived themselves and their Sleeps acof tivities to daylight say- to make children . go tobed before dark suggests two ' comments . One of them lies in the question , " Why should children , not very ' little go to bed before dark ? " and the second is the inquiry , " Since when have very little children ceased to do what they are told ? " As a- matter of fact , daylight saving does not , or rather it need not , change the bedtime of - children any more than the hour at which the farmer 's hired man goes to work . The city night worker is the only person who has a real grievance against daylight saving , and he , for the most part , makes no moan over a change that is advantageous tv most other people . Another Englishman Losses May is protesting against a Exceed continuance by certain the Profits . other Englishmen of their present activity in supplying American bootleggers with the means of carrying on their vicious and criminal trade . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of History , in the University of London . He admits and brushes aside as irrelevant to ? the main issues , moral and - others , that the exportation of liquor to be sold outside the American three-mile limit to anybody who chooses to buy at a big price violates no British law . None the less , he writes to The London Times , there is peril in it for Great Britain because it constitutes " an extensive conspiracy in this country to defeat , in the interest of filthy lucre , a provision which the American people have in the most solemn and constitutional way made part of the fundamental law of their country and show no disposition to change . " He warns his felibw-countrymen , too , that this traffic has caused deep offense in the United States and in the end may cost EnglancUmore than did the permitted outfitting of the Alabama . , In the case of that vessel , also . British law seemed to be observed , but when the case came before an international tribunal the decision was adverse , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the penalty imposed for her mistake . As Judges always find out a way to do what must be done , in time the British Judges may discover how to stop a form of trade in which , behind the immediate dollar which looms so large to short-sighted eyes , there lurk losses which may be large .
