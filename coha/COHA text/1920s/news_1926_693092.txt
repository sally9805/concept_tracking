txt Amid scenes of highest dramatic interest which marked the great historical signiC icance of the event , Germany took her seat in the League of Nations today . It was fitting that Germany should be welcomed by France . What a picture ! The Governments of two hereditary enemies who had spilled on many battlefields the blood of millions of each other 's best men pledging through their Foreign Ministers before fifty other nations their will and desire to work together for peace and repledging the promises of the Locarno Treaty now coming into effect that never would they fight again . As M. Briand said to Dr. Stresemann , France and Germany could divide up their military glory . They had enough to give the history of both nations sufficient for all time . Briand Calls for . /leroism in Pettee . Now , he said , they would ' try to be as heroic in peace as they had been in war . And twelve years ago they were locked in the battle of the Marne . This was in reply to Dr. Stresemann 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an ardent member of the League of Nations and an ardent worker for peace . " Where , except at the League of Nations . could France arid Germany so talk to one another ? " asked M. Briand . As the supremely eloquent French statesmen ended his appeal for peace along the Rhine . men and women all over the hall wiped tears from their eyes . No one who witnessed that scene can ever forget it . Briand had prepared no speech . Be did not have to . Locarno , . as he Bays , has been his religion and he was full of his subject . But , ever defending France . he went . to the Salle de la Reformation determined to ' answer Dr. Stresemann as he thought Prance should answer Germany whatever Germany might say . League Spirit Moves Stresemann : Dr. Stresemann was no disappointment . The man to whom is due the credit for Germany 's entry into the League brought no discord , no controversy . His was the spirit of the League today . And M. Briand 's task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - One could not escape the impression that no matter what elements of disagreement might exist in their countries  --  and , of course , they do exist ? here you had two men whose nearts were full of sincerity , two statesmen who meant what they said . Dr. Stresemann , in great simplicity , said that Germany now wished to follow a path of subversion of selfish nationalism , to promote International good-will and peace . His country bad taken that policy as its own from the day it proposed the Rhineland treaty with France . Then frankly he said that Germany expected to profit by the restoration of peaceful commerce . hoped to see other nations disarmed as she was and foresaw material and political benefits from being in the League . Ile spoke straight . Briand Hails Turning Point . M. Briand said France welcomed Germany 's collaboration and was as anxious as any country for lasting peace . From the bottom of his heart he cried ; " Away with rifles , machine guns and cannon ! Make way for peace and conciliation ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The German delegation had arrived last night . following the Reich 's election to the League on Wednesday . This morning Dr. Stresemann and his colleagues waited in the anteroom until Credentials Committee had reported favorably , when they were escorted to a place in the front row of the severe-looking seats of the Salle de la Reformation . There was some applause , not a great deal , from the galleries packed to suffocation in the torrid temperature . Then President Nintchitch of the Assembly welcomed the German delegation , whose coming - not only brought the League nearer universality but also brightened its prospects as the world agency fur the prevention of wars . He invited Dr. Stresemann to the tribune . The heavy figure of the German statesman , dressed in a light gray suit , in contrast to the usual black of delegates on State occasions , mounted the tribune . Wiping the perspiration from his brow , he held up his hand for silence and began his carefully prepared address , which he delivered in German . Alter thanking the President of the ; Assembly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Wednesday praising Germany 's adhesion to the League , Dr. Stresemann said : " More than six years have passed Since the foundation of the League of Nations . There was necessary a Certain evolution before the general political situation made . possible the entry of Germany . Even this year great difficulties have had to be smoothed out before the decision on Germany could be met with unanimity on the part of members of the League . I do not wish to harp on the past . ' This generation ought to attend to the present and look to the future . But I insist , if an event like Germany 's entry could only materialize after a long period of germination , that this may be a special guarantee of its permanent and fruitful results . " Today Germany enters the circle of States to some of which she has been attached by untroubled ties of friendship whereas others were allied against her during the Great War . It surely is an event of historical importance that Germany and these latter States are now brought together within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New Economic Unity . The fact which indicates more clearly than words or programs could ever express that the League of Nations may indeed be destined to give a. new direction to the political developments of mankind and civilization , is that Mankind would be exposed to particularly grave dangers at the present time if it were impossible for the nations to obtain guarantees of being able to perform the tasks , which their destiny has assigned to them . in peaceful and untroubled cooperation . " The catastrophic happenings of the terrible war have recalled the conscience of Mankind to the consideration of the tasks which confront the nations . In many countries we witnessed the . ruin of whole classes of the population who were not only worthy but were also intellectually and economically indispensable to the life of the nation . " We behold the birth of new forms of economic life and the disappearance of older ones . We see how economic life leaps over old national boundaries and seeks new forms of international cooperation . " In the old economic situation the world had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This cooperation is based upon the unwritten law of the traditional exchange of goods between continents . The restoration of that exchange must be our task . " If we really desire the undisturbed , economic development of the world , that end will not be attained by erecting barriers between countries , but rather by bridging over the gulfs which hitherto have sepaarted the different national economic systems . Soul of Nations and Divine Will . " But there-is something which far transcends in importance all material considerations , and that is the soul of the nations themselves . " There is just now a mighty stirring of ideas among the nations of the world . There are some who adhere to the principle of self-contained national unity and who reject the international because they do not wish to see all that has been developed on the basis of nationality superseded by the more general conception of humanity . " Now , I hold that no country which belongs to the League of Nations thereby surrenders in any way her national individuality . " The Divine Architect of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made nations of the different races . He has given them their mother tongue as the sanctuary of their souL He has given them countries with different characteristics as their homes . " But it can not be the purpose of a divine world order that men should direct their supreme national energies against one.s.nother , thus ever thrusting back the general progress of civilization . The most durable foundation of things is the policy inspired by mutual understanding and mutual respect between peoples . German People Backing New Ideal . " Germany has already before her entry into the League endeavored to work in the direction of this friendly cooperation . In that respect , the German initiative which led to the compact of Locarno is a proof , and , as further evidence , there are the arbitration treaties which Germany has concluded with almost all of her neighbors . " The German Government has resolved /o persevere unswervingly on this line of policy and it notes with satisfaction that these ideas , which in the beginning encountered lively opposition in Germany , are now becoming more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the German Government may well speak for the great majority of the German race when it declares it will wholeheartedly devote itself to the tasks of the League of Nations , for , during the past six years , the League of Nations has already undertaken a substantial portion of its tasks and has done most valuable work . " As for future accomplishments , I have in mind , above all , the endeavors toward the establishment of an international legal order which has taken ' substantial shape in the foundation of the World Court . Disarmament and the Treaties . " Furthermore , efforts have been made toward disarmament , particularly of importance for the consolidation of a peaceful order among the nations . The complete disarmament of Germany was stipuisted by the Treaty of Versailles as a preliminary to general disarmament . " It is to be hoped that this general disarmament may be advanced by tactful work which at the same time would constitute proof of that force which already resides in the ideals of the League of Nations . " Germany 's relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the possibilities of cooperation in those great general ideals which the League of Nations is now pursuing . " The League of Nations ' is in many respects heir to and executor of the treaties of 1919 . Frem these treaties have resulted in the past , I think I may say frankly , many divergencies between the League of Nations and Germany . I hope that the discussion of these questions will be rendered easier in the future by our cooperation within the League . " In this respect , mutual confidence will , from a political point of view . be found to be a greater creative force than any other method . It would . indeed , be incompatible with the League 's ideals to divide the peoples cooperating in it into nations whose object is sympathy and nations whose object is antipathy toward other members . Need of Brazil and Spain in League . " In this connection , I reject most emphatically the conception according to which the attitude adopted by Germany in matters concerning the League has been dictated by such sympathies or antipathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence with all of the nations represented in the League , or Council , for the League of Nations has not yet attained its ideal , which is to include all of the powers of the world . " Germany 's entry does , it is true , constitute an important step toward the universality of the , League . But we desire at the same time to express our deep regret that Brazil has manifested an intention to withdraw from the League . " These regrets are all the keener because Germany believes the notion of the universality of the League to be inseparable from the consideration that the predominant influence in the League can not be reserved for one continent alone . " Furthermore , we share with the other members ? f the League the firm hope that the valuable cooperation of Spain may be retained for the League . I We are convinced that the appeal addressed to Spain by all of the powers will convince that great country and will convince the Spanish people how detrimental it would be to the high ideals of which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be long absent from Geneva . " Only on the basis of a community which includes all nations , without distinction and on a footing of perfect equality , can mutual assistance and jus-ice become the true guiding stars of the destiny of mankind . It is only upon this foundation that the principle of freedom can be based . " Germany has resolved to base her policy on the foundation of these lofty ideals . May the great destinies of the League of Nations be fulfilled on the basis of lofty conceptions of peace , freedom and unity . " Briand Proclaims Defeat of War . M. Briand expressed his pleasure that to France had been allotted the privilege of replying to Germany . " The presence of France at this tribune at this moment characterizes this day and brings to it great hopes for the future , " he said . " Cynics and detractors of the League of Nations , those who periodically announce its end  --  what would they think if they could attend this meeting ? " Would what is happening today be possible if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting spectacle that only a few years after the most frightful war which ever shook the world , while the battlefields are still almost wet with blood , that the same peoples who met in hard battle meet here to declare their determination to work for universal peace ? " What hope for our youths and our mothers who , when the sun sets today , may cast their eyes on their little ones without feeling in their hearts the constant agony of fear ! " Gentlemen , today means peace . Germany and France are here to say it is finished . The series of bloody wars with which all the pages of our history are stained  --  that is finished . The war ' between Germany and France ? finished . No more wars between us . No more brutal efforts to settle our differences . Era of International Justice . " Henceforth it is the judge who will decide . We are going before the courts to settle our troubles . " Away with rifles , machine guns and cannon ! Makee way for conciliation and arbitration ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become great in history only by the heroism of its sons on the fields of battle . Countries become greater if in the difficult times of stress they can be patient and demand of justice to settle rights and wrongs . " Gentlemen from Germany , our two peoples , from the standpoint of strength and of heroism , have no further proofs to give . Turn the pages of history and you will see that both of us have shown we can be brave in battles . We have reaped enough military glory to do us both for all time . Let us now seek success in other fields . Victory Won Through Faith . " Let me say that Dr. Stresemann and myself have worked long months at our common task . I have had confidence . He has had confidence . And we wish to pay tribute to the loyalty of the British Foreign Minister , who has toiled with us . We worked and we had to be brave at times . " As the crow flies , Locarno M not far from Geneva , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that faith moves mountains , Dr. Stresemann and I are glad that there were not any more mountains between Locarno and Geneva . " But now , after the opposition , after the fights , which were hard , the job is done . ; And if we had not succeeded , new germs of distrust would have come to life between our two countries . " I get a personal triumph from today 's events , but , over and above that , I feel a certainty that tomorrow it will be impossible to bring again the terrible and bloody events which we passed through in the World War . " The French Foreign Minister said that it was true that great efforts and special efforts had to be made , ' and that sometimes the , general spirit of the League of Nations did not prevail , . but he said it was all far the best , seeing that the result was attained . Some smaller nations thought they were left outside of the deliberations , he said , but they must forgive if real Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The fact that you Germans and we French are now here together in this Assembly speaking the same words of optimism does not mean that all of our differences have been removed , " he continued . " Both Dr. Stresemann and myself know what they are . But now we shall confront them in a new spirit which guarantees us against another conflict . ' If . as Dr. Stresemann says , there is a divine ' plan in which war has no place , he must admit that in the past this sometimes has been lost sight of . Let us hope that the divine plan will now be carried out . - " If we come here not only as Germans or as Frenchmen but with higher and larger aims , we can bring the spirit of peace to rule . But there are two ways to come to Geneva . " If we come here to regard the League of Nations as a field for battle between overexcited nationalisms , if we come here as national champions to fight one another , then we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history by the delusive picture of national success ! If we come here to get victories for ourselves or our countries , we come in a spirit which makes wars . " France and Germany Pledged . " I promise you I bring no such spirit and I count on the Germans to come in no such spirit . Our path must be that of peace and progress , and we will gratify our countries in getting to soften their amour propre and in making certain sacrifices for the peace of the world . " Arbitrage  --  that word has now all its prestige and all its force . Treaties of arbitration follow one another . One people after another promises not to fight any more . " That is the spirit which the League of Nations is spreading and that is why peoples should aid and protect the League . " With the League , peace . Without the League , risks of bloody war . " Today should be marked with a white stone on history 's path . The words of conciliation which France and Germany have exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white stone . Never will France seek to change its color ! "
