One morning last week , lessons were proceeding as usual at Oak Park ( Ill . ) High School , when a messenger from Principal M. R. McDaniel 's office entered one of the classrooms and haled Student Sam Givens into the corridor . He was wanted at " the office . " Having lately won a local oratorical contest , Sam flushed with pleasure , thinking to himself : " Ho , ho , this will be something that Mac Principal McDaniel wants to say to me about the national oratorical contest . " <P> The office messenger haled Student Al Adams , football luminary , from his studies . Al headed for the office wondering if they wanted the correct spelling of his name for his diploma , or something . " Buck " Halperin , another footballer , captain for next fall , followed Al and Sam . So did Lawrence ( " Larry " ) Forster , baseball captain ; so did Arthur ( " Art " ) Bramhall , star pitcher ; so did Edwin Fogarty , social light ; Millard Meyers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill and Bud-and many another . It was a veritable procession of Oak Park notables , 51 of the leading boy students . <P> Upon arriving at " the office , " one and all were informed that they were suspended for one year . <P> There is a law in Illinois forbidding the existence of fraternities and secret societies in public high schools . The 51 suspended leaders were all offenders against this law , of which the purpose is to stamp out snobbishness and secret practices , and of which parents are duly apprised by letter upon their sons ' entrance at Oak Park High . All 51 had joined societies-four different Greek-letter brotherhoods that persistently , furtively , hugged their insignia and traditions despite attacks three years ago and in 1916 , when Principal McDaniel was installed at Oak Park to stamp them out . A detective had been employed to " get the goods " on these brotherhoods , and in a session with this sleuth last fortnight the 51 had confessed all , promised to disband . Solemnly , regretfully , the " grip " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time all around . A last time they had whispered their passwords and unguessable secrets . Then , like brave men , they had declared their fraternizing formally at an end and gone their ways in sorrow . They had thought the matter was closed but last week the school board met and voted their suspension . <P> According to the colorful Chicago Tribune , " By noon it was a dreary place , the campus of the high school . Many girls were crying , and some boys . " There was a critical ball game scheduled for that day and virtually the whole Oak Park team was " fired . " Some of the 51 went into legal conference to get a special injunction restraining the school board from taking action until after graduation day . Others went to other schools , tried to enroll and finish their year 's work . Principal Mc-Daniel refused to comment . Board President George Harvey Jones said : " There is nothing sensational about this affair .
