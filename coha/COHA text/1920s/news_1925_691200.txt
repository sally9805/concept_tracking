txt ' The municipal railway ordinance , in volving the purchase of the surface and elevated lines , the digging of sub , ways , building of " L " extensions , laying of more surface tracks , and the buying of several thousand new cars , will pass the city council . Its margin of approval will be substantial , Probably more than thirty votes and possibly thirty-eight out of a total of forty-seven . The ordinance is scheduled for a vote tomorrow afternoon and the election straws of yesterday indicate no determined effort by large number of aldermen to cause a delay . The ' result of the election was a blow to former Mayor William Hale Thompson and a boost for Mayor William E. Dever . Further , the voters appeared to pay no attention to the views of fortner%Mayor Edward F. Dunne . ' People Want Rapid Transit . There was nothing noticeable in the election of organized or widespread opposition to Mayor Dever 's plan for , getting more and better transportation . No outstanding advocate of that program was defeated ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the results indicate that the voters prefer transportation at once rather than a Mayoralty ' cam , POign on the subject again in 1027 . That ' handwrithig on the wall was made so clear that Democratic leaders foaptheir own salvation must insist that Mayor Dever gets real results , if given a chance to go ahead , It Is because of this expression of the electorate that the , passage of the pending ordinance in the city council is certain . One astute observer of council perform . ances predicted last night that " forty or more votes will be cast for the ordinance . " Wallop Thompson Theories . The trend of public sentiment was shown more in the attitude of the voters toward William Hale Thompson 's scheme than towards William E. Dever 's . The former mayor courted a test of his political standing and of his pet political theory . He hopped into the fray with more to lose than to gain , because he and his friends Lthought that a demonstration of his strength would he highly advantageous . He selected certain candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ' them , and otherwise aided their chances . Thompson 's measure of loyalty , with one or two exceptions , was a promise by the candidate to support the " Thompson plan of people 's ownership and operation of street cars at a 5 cent fare . " This old district plan involves a wait for transportation until Mr. Thompson is elected mayor , enabling legislation by the general assembly , litigation testing out that legislation , the levy of millions in taxes and their subsequent collection . Whatever its merits , the plan means delay . Did n't Attract Voters . It did n't " take . " It did not enthuse tile people ; it did n't ' convince the voters ; it did not attract voters. : Neither Mr. Thompson nor Mr. Dunne ' in his chargesvagainst the Dever plan created alarm . They scared no one . Thompson turned loose everything ho had , and those who thought he was a private citizen without political pressure were mistaken . He had . between 400 and 500 Lincoln park jobs distributed in four wards . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many . He had his own personal following , his increasing ability to mix with the boys , his pet traction Issue , his experience in handling political pawns , and his strength to travel around day and night . He had everything he ever had for a political battle except Fred Lundin 's counsel and abit. ity to organize . Small Gives Him Test . It migi.t seem to an outsider that Gov . Len Small gave the former mayor a free hand to use the Lincoln Park patronage that the governor might determine the value of the former mayor as a political leader  --  minus Lundin . Mr. Thompson fell down . What ills future in politics may be remains to be seen , but it is as certain as political happenings can be forecast that he will need an issue more potent than the traction district 5 cent fare plan to make much headway toward the mayor 's office Sn 1927 . The public said plainly they prefer a transit program which means action to one that promises delay .. They said it in the Forty-fourth ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vote on the transit question , but they said they preferred him to Dick Mazer , who proclaimed that , he stood for the Thompson idea . Uses Park Employes. ' rho former mayor talked several times for Mazer. - He trotted out every one of the 152 employees of Lincoln park who live in that ward . . They were told they must deliver or run the risk of losing their jobs . This is Mr. Thompson 's home ward , where his neighbors know him best . Ile imported other good talkers to plead for Mazer . He rounded up all the fish fans of the ward to cast a ballot for Mazer , one of the big fish fans . Yet Loescher received 4,019 votes to 3,027 for Mazer . The third leading candidate , Hobert W. Dunn , who had the support of the Deneen organization , received 2,052 votes . There will be a second election in this ward between Loescher and Mazer , Even if Mr. Thompson retains control of the Lincoln park patronage until April 7 , it . is improbable that-Mazer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay in the Forty-seventh ward . The former mayor 's candidate there was Aid , Kllnke . More than /00 Lincoln park jobs were used in this ward . Klink ? Is personally popular and energetic , and should have won easily yesterday , but he ran less than 600 votes ahea ' of John J. Hoellen . Klinke is looked upon as one of the aldermen who will vote against the Dever plan tomorrow , but he may change his front , because he will have to fight it out with Heellen April 7 . ' Perhaps the friends of Big- Bill will claim " a glo  --  lous victory " for him in the Forty-sixth ward . There Ald. 0 . F. Nelson won . He was supported by the former mayor and was opposed by sundry Democrats . The opponents , of Nelson were unfortunate in picking a candidate . They selected Walter F. Dodd , a scholar , former professor at the University of Chicago , now a lawyer , and always exceedingly gentlemanly . Be was not the type which appealed to the numerous working people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago Federation of labor and had the additional advantage of a large con. stilueney of Scandinaviann . To these influences , rather than to Thompson , can Nelson 's victory be attributed , Albert Cleans Up /lig MI . In addition to these three whom the former mayor aggressively supported , he set out in the Forty third ward to defeat Aid . Arthur Albeit . who publicly announced his opposition to Tompson and his traction scheme . Albert also had the eppositien of the Democratic organization . lie was especially disliked by the former mayor because he uncovered some of the scandals of the last city admlnistra- , Lion . The.opposition to Albert went as close , to the limit as an - unfair political organization ever went in Chicago . In the Twenty-ninth ward . former Aid . John 0 . Horne attneked the Dever plan and advocated the Thompson program . He did not get onetifth its many votes as Aid . Albert J. Horan. in the Forty-fifth ward Edward F. Ortn ? non , who was credited with Thompson support , was snowed'under deep . In favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had registered a veto for the Dever plan in the committee on local transportation . rive of these were winners . Ald .. Tensen in the Fiftieth ward ran far ahead of his nearest contender , but there were a total of ten candidates and it was impossible for Jensen to get a majority of all votes cast . In the Eleventh ward the fight was not against Aid . Timothy Hogan , because he voted for the ordinance . It was a contest between the friends and foes of the late James M. Dailey . The foes won and Hogan ran second . The run-off conies in April . Case of Wiley Mills . Another member of the local transportation committee , Ald. Wiley W. Mills , declined to vote either for or against the ordinance . His friends said last night that that injured him before , the voters of the Thirty-seventh ward . They believe he would have got more votes if he had favored the ordinance , which , it is understood , he will do onl the floor of the city cotncil when a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward . There were a number of candidates for several of whom former . Mayor Thompson spoke during the campaign . Not one of these was elected yesterday . Mayor Dever probably had some influence against the Thompson traction idea . Mr. Dever called it " folly " a number of times . He called it unfair propaganda for political advantage . Monday night he said that no , honest man can favor the propaganda for a 5 cent fare at the present time . He added that it is impossible .
