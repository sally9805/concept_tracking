For some months Alberto Pani , Finance Minister of Mexico , has been scurrying busily about , negotiating in Manhattan and elsewhere with the representatives of great banking houses . Last week he presented an agreement to President Calles and his Cabinet which was promptly ratified by them . According to its terms a group of international bankers agree to aid Mexico to resume payments on her $500,000,000 foreign debt , beginning Jan. 1 , 1926 . It is incidentally provided that the National Railways of Mexico shall be returned to private management .
