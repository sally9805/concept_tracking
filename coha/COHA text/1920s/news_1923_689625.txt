txt Representatives of anthracite - consuming States , meeting here today to consider plans to bring about lower coal prices , received from Governor Pinchot a proposal for regulation of the industry through a joint commission to be formed under a compact of States and , they in turn , called upon the State of Pennsylvania to take the first steps by repeal , of its coal tax and the passage of other remedial legislation . The meeting adjourned without action to meet later at the call of Governor Pinchot after Governor Silzer of New Jersey had denounced the Pennsylvania Executive 's plan and had submitted a series of resolutions calling upon Pennsylvania to take action . Governor Preus of Minnesota . the only other executive present , also opposed the Pinchot plan and proposed that a special session of the Pennsylvania Legislature be called to pass an act declaring the anthracite industry a public business . Eleven States were represented . Besides Minnesota and New Jersey , whose Governors were present , those in attendance included delegates from Vermont . Ohio . Connecticut . Massachusetts . Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Governor Pinchot 's plan centred in the formation of a union of the anthracite-consdming States and an agreement upon the form of regulatitaiihich will best work to the advantage of their people , " together with the establishing of a joint commission to enforce any regulations adopted . Such a commission . he said , by pooling the police powers of the States and co-operating with F , . ? 14 ? : - .41 authority over interstate corn .. . completely regulate the industry . Ile proposed that the Governors use all the powers at their disposal and urged further action by the Federal Government . Governor Silzer led the opposition to Pinchot 's plan . Questioning the powers of the proposed joint commission and its rights to come into Pennsylvania and interfere with the industry , he declared " something has to be done- and asserted it could be clone by the States and the Federal Government without the formation of a compact . " At present . " he asserted . " we are at the mercy of the neglect of the United States and the failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to one to be a buck-passing program . " If the anthracite. industry is a monopoly , subject to regulation by the United States , I can not see why it is not the same thing in Pennsylvania . " He declared the proposed compact of thirty-one anthracite-using States would take ' thirty-one years to complete and then would require approval of Congress . Attacks Pinchot 's Program . Taking up Governor Pinchot 's proposals in detail , he criticized his defense of the anthracite tax and the Miners ' Certification law , and declared action should be started toward reduction of royalties . He said he had been told that the anthracite tax , which Mr. Pinchot said added only from 111// to 12 cents a ton to the cost of coal at the mines , had resulted in an increase of 5u cents a ton . Governor Pinchot declared he had been unable to find any truth in the assertion . " Unless you are willing to do more than has been indicated today , " Gov. , - arnor Silzer. said , " we 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resolutions , ona calling for action by the State and the other for Congressional action . The former called on Pennsylvania to repeal the ' anthracite tax ; to reiieal " laws now upon its statute books wnich limit the I production of coal " ; that it enact laws fixing a standard of quality and size for all coal produced and shipped out commission of the State , creating a ommission to regulate the industry in the State and declaring the , anthracite industry a public business , and asking . Governor Pinchot to call a special session of the Legislature and lay these proposed measures before it . The second get , which contained more than twenty separate resolutions , called upon Congress to enact laws dealing with all phases of the industry and particularly to grant the Interstate Commerce Commission further powers to , regulate transportation , eliminate inequalities in distribution and excess charges for transportation " and any and all other existing evils in the trade I in which the transportation companies are in any way connected or to blame , " Another section ? proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes from corporations engaged in mining coal or coal transportation , Governor Pinchot expressed criticism of the New Jersey Executive 's attitude . which he said was one of " pass the buck to Pennsylvania . " Proposes to Go Ahead . " Pennsylvania , " he added , " does n't propose to arrogate any of its power . We could perfectly well say this is our business ; you 've got to have coal and we 'll soak you what we please . That is not what we propose to do . Pennsylvania is going ahead , anyhow . If you do n't want your State to take part , that 's up to you . We 're going ahead to do what we can , and all we can . " Action on the Silzer resolutions- was put aside in a rush of motions and suggestions , during which Governor Pinchot declared that " as long as New Jersey takes the position it does in these resolutions , it wo n't get very far with Pennsylvania . " Finally , on the motion of E. C. Hultman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was voted to adjourn subject to Governor Pinchot 's call , the Governor in th . meantime to have a complete record of the proposals forwarded to all the executives . Governor Pinchot indicated his intention of calling the next meeting about Dec. 13. - The proposal of Governor Preus of Minnesota received little consideration by the conference , although it will be embodied in the record for consideration by the other Governors . He proposed that the anthracite industry be made a public business in the manner that the grain elevator business was treated in Illinois . New York and North Dakota . Such action , he declared , would permit regulation of the industry and control of prices . During the session the Massachusetts delegate presented a memorandum supported by the representatives of Governors Templeton of - Connecticut and Flynn of Rhode Island , in which he declared jurisdiction over the industry rests with Pennsylvania and outside fi consumers " have no recognized right , except to pay prices demanded , together with what he termed " discrimnatory taxes " levied by St &te; authorities . Pinchot Outlines Problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The anthracite - using people of America are justly entitled to three things . The first is coal . The second is honest coal . The third is honest coal at a decent price . This , in a ' nutshell , is what I have asked you to come and consider : how to get clean ' anthracite to the consumer at a reasonable price . " The settlement of the recent anthracite strike provided coal . But in the nature of things it could not assure relief from the adulteration of anthracite with rock and dirt . Neither could it assure freedom from extortionate prices . SuclL adulteration and such prices existed long before the strike and they exist in worse form today . " The people are angry , and rightly so , over the long continued and steadily increasing exactions of the anthracite monopoly , whose representatives have definitely declined to recommend that the industry shall clean its own house . " The settlement of the strike put the - wages of the miners on an equality . risks considered , with those of other similar trades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it involved was li0 cents a ton . ? But the operators restricted themselves to no such ' increase . The-smallest advance they made was ' 70 rents a ton . Some added 90 cents and a ' few more than a dollar . " Although the margins the operators . took before- the-war- gave .. them , a fair profit . - to ? say . the least , they - have intheir costs have increased . The ten great railroad companies , who produce three-fourths of the coal , exacted a margin of 85 cents a ton in 1921  --  the year of depression . In the - first three months . of the present year these same companies exacted a margin of ** and today the same companies are . taking margins higher still . These figures , when compared with their margin of 33 cents per ton for the three pre-war years , supply clear proof of extortion . Points to " Exorbitant " Profits . " The production and distribution of anthracite is essentially a monopoly . In 1921 , 93 per cent . of all the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . by seventyfour companies . Common financial arrangements are . generally believed to exist between producing companies , railroads , wholesalers , and in many cases retailers as well . I reiterate mY opinion . that the whole combination is a hard- ' boiled monopoly whose prime interest in the public is that it shall consume their coal at their price . " The profits of the operators are often utterly unreasonable . Thus , in the years 1920 , 1921 and ? 1922. one company paid successive dividends of - 59 per cent. , 137 per cent . and 168 per cent. , while another-paid dividends of 70 , 205 and 190 per cent . Such dividends are obviously unfair to the people from whose pockets they.come . The margins and dividends of the anthracite industry of recent years have been far and away larger than those of any other major industry known to me in America . ' " Three - kinds of regulation are proposed . " The first is for State Executives to use the power they have now . Under it they can do much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can ascertain and tell the people what extortions are being practiced and by whom . They can give information as to fuel economy and as to substitutes . They can act jointly , by appeal to the Interstate Commerce Commission . in securing adequate consideration of anthracite freight rates . " As a part of what Pennsylvania can do , it has been urged that she should repeal her tax on anthtacite , repeal the certification law , under which only qualified men can mine anthracite , abolish royalties and prevent the sale of unclean coal . " Pennsylvania has already vigorously attacked the problem of rock and dirt in anthracite and is making public the names of operators who are guilty . The effect has already been strongly felt . Defends Pennsylvania Tax . " The Pennsylvania anthracite tax amounts* to 13 ! , per cent . on the cost of the coal at the mine , or on domestic sizes between 11 and 12 cents per ton . The domestic consumer pays more dollars for his coal tha ; nthe State takes cents for its tax . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the consumer is by Federal action , ' There are certain things the Federal Government can do . Among these are to establish and - enforce in interstate commerce standards for clean coal and for sizes ; to license all who are ? engaged in interstate trade in anthracite ; to ? authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to deny cars to profiteers and . to investigate and publish the facts . " The - best legal opinion does not establish heYond controversy the right of the United States to fix prices , establish uniform accounts , examine hooks or require reports in the anthracite industry . But there is no doubt ' whatever that each : State. - through its police power , can do all of these ? things if it chooses . - Whether the coming ' Congress can or can not , does or does not , give the consumer clean ' anthracite at reasonable , prices , - there is another necessary . remedy . I - refer to the treaty or compact . between the States authorized by the Federal Constitution . " If the anthracite-using . States . will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of regulation which ' will best ' work to the advantage of their people , a compact to establish a- joint commission to enforce it will - be  - -  both - lawful and effective when approved by the Congress of the - United . States . Such a commission , pooling the police powers of the States concerned , could , in - co- operation with Federal authority over interstate commerce , completely regulate the whole industry from - the . mine to the consumer 's bin . We have here a powerful weapon .. altogether ' . capable of securing justice for the ' consumer in - allthe anthracite-using States . ? " In addition to what each State may do-individually and at once for the ' relief of . the. present - situation . I ' desire to lay the following , specific- recommendations before you : ' First , that- a . committee ' be appointed at this : meeting to prepare for the approval of the Governors ? of ? all the-States in which ' anthracite formsan important part of the people 's fuel. , and SubseMiently. lay before : Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gested , ?
