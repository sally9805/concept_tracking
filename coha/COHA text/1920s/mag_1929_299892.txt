The Valiant ( Fox ) . Sentimentality laid many traps for the murderer who wanted to die without letting people know his real name . There might have been heroics in the courtroom , and later , when his mother saw his picture in the paper and sent his sister to find out if this was her boy , everything might have collapsed in glycerine tears ; the murder , perhaps , might have been explained as something necessary , even honorable . But , somehow , Director William K. Howard and Actor Paul Muni , formerly known as Muni Weisenfreund , overcame their difficulties by wise elimination of detail and a powerful dramatic reticence that make the picture one of the best of the year . Best shot : the interview between Muni and his sister in the death house . <P> Eternal Love ( United Artists ) . The Alps and Director Ernst Lubitsch 's talent for spectacles wall in a dull , conventional plot about a mountaineer who got two girls but liked only one . Up and down mountains the little story wanders like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of numberless snowstorms sweeping past John Barrymore 's profile . The picture is silent . Best shot : the avalanche . <P> Gentlemen of the Press ( Paramount ) . An indefinite number of collaborators , all newspapermen , wrote this account of a rewrite man 's hard luck . As a stageplay , it was successful . As cinema , it suffers more definitely from the faults which affect all stories about generalities instead of about characters . As a result , the reporter who is too busy for eight years to go home-too busy to get to the bedside of his dying daughter-but not too busy to get mixed up with sleek-headed , slow-voiced Katherine Francis-is a synthetic fellow whose reality is compromised by the difficulty of making him a type . Best shot : Walter Huston showing how to get rid of a woman . <P> The Pagan ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . When W. S. Van Dyke went to Tahiti to produce White Shadows in the South Seas , it took him a week to make a rubbish-strewn Pacific beach as clean as the scenario prescribed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as the setting for this new picture , which is almost as pretty as the first . The same problems are indolently offered and solved in a way that people find agreeable on summer nights . For here a wise and graceful half-caste youth whose life is spent lying in the sun , making love , swimming , and occasionally singing in an operatic manner a tune called " The Pagan Love Song , " triumphs over an energetic moralist who has come South to make things better . Best shot : Ramon Novarro stealing Dorothy Jam 's away from the church two minutes after she has married Villain Donald Crisp .
