txt Governor BAXTER of Maine has outraged the conventions once more . With the connivance of the Council , which cynics will say he hypnotized , an order has been passed to raise at the State House a memorial tablet to Garry , the Governor 's Irish setter , who departed this life in June , 1923 , mourned by a large circle of friends , including troops of happy children . Thousands of people in the forty-seven other States who did not know Maine had a Governor named BAXTER heard at that time of his fourfooted friend Garry , because for several hours while the obsequies were being held - on an island in Casco Bay the national colors drooped at half-mast on the State House flagpole at Augusta . Garry , in dying , put Maine on the map for Oklahoma and Nevada . It seems that only the Committee on the Correct Usage of the American Flag of the Women 's American Legion was scandalised , for of the thousand letters and telegrams from plain people which Garry 's master received only one Was ' condemnatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like Governor BATER 's remarks about Governor SMITH 'S approval of the bill repealing the Mullan-Gage law . At 4 P. M. of the day of the funeral Governor BAXTER , rather surprised that the G. A. R. post of Augusta objected to the tribute to Garry ( the veterans recanted later ) , ordered Old Glory to the peak . In the Portland office of the Governor you may see on a wall , between the Stars and Stripes and his personal flag , an appeal on a placard , " Be Kind ' to Animals . " Sb it was not surprising that PERCIVAL BAXTER accounted for the act that roused the formalists to protest by saying : I did It , not because Garry was my dog and a member of my famtiy , but to draw the people 's attention to the qualities of the dog which are so often forgotten in human relationships .
