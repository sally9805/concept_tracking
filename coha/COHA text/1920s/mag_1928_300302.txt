A big-eyed bouncing babe of one is Romano Mussolini . Last week the eyes of Romans grew bigger even than Babe Romano 's as he bounced before them in the arms of Benito Mussolini . <P> Papa Benito bounced in turn upon a large white horse . Prancing and bouncing , and cheered by loud Fascist " Ala-ala-ala-las ! " the Prime Minister and his Big-Eyed Babe rode once around Ancient Rome , out the Appian Way a piece , back . <P> So outstanding was the occasion that Donna Rachele Mussolini , meek mother of the Bouncing Babe , was allowed to spend the week in Rome with Il Duce , then took herself and babe off to Milan , her usual residence .
