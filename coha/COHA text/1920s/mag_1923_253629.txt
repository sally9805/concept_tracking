Archaeology deals with the cultural history of Homo Sapiens . Back of that comes paleontology , dealing with human or animal remains which have left their impress in geological strata at varying depths . <P> The American Museum of Natural History is the most fertile source of this sort of research and sends out annually a large number of expeditions . Its third Asiatic expedition has just left Peking under the leadership of Roy Chapman Andrews , the well-known naturalist and explorer . It will prospect for six months the treasures of the Gobi Desert and Inner Mongolia , known to be rich in fossil flora and fauna , including mastodons and mammoths , which are believed to have wandered eastward from their source in central Asia . Popular expectations with regard to the " missing link " of human evolution and the site of the " Garden of Eden " are hardly likely to be realized , however . <P> Other fossil discoveries which are now attracting scientific interest are : <P> 1 ) A human skull claimed to be of the Tertiary period , found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of La Plata Museum . If this claim can be substantiated , ape-men existed on the earth several hundred thousand years earlier than has hitherto been proved . But the circumstances are suspicious . The skull was found in the possession of a white settler who dug it out of Pampas deposits , which may or may not be Tertiary . Scientific men are now on the way to Patagonia ( which has furnished " mare 's nests " before ) to investigate the claim . <P> 2 ) Workmen at St. Ouen , on the Island of Jersey , English Channel , found a prehistoric skull at first claimed to be that of an ape-woman older than Pithecanthropus ( 500,000 years ) , our earliest known near human ancestor . But Sir Arthur Keith and Dr. Smith Woodward , of the British Museum , believe it to be of the Neolithic period ( from 5,000 to 10,000 years old ) . It was found in a burial place of people of that time , where bones and implements are plentiful . <P> 3 ) A deformed female skull , discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ales Hrdlicka , of the United States National Museum . The shape was probably produced by bandaging the infant head , which was a common practice among the Aymaras and other South American Indian tribes . Only two such skulls had previously been found in North America . <P> 4 ) A human skeleton was found near Dallas , Texas , in a fossil bed believed to be of the Pleistocene ( ice ) age ( about 300,000 years ago ) . Many authorities think it belongs to a more modern type . <P> 5 ) Excavation for a new hotel in Washington , D. C. , unearthed a subterranean cypress swamp containing fossil diatoms , minute plants which lived in the Pleistocene age . " Oldest inhabitants " are arguing with the scientists that the swamp existed in their boyhood , but the evidence favors its antiquity . <P> Glyptotherium , a fossil giant armadillo , recovered from the Pliocene deposits of southern Arizona by Dr. J. W. Gidley , of the United States National Museum , has been brought to Washington and mounted . He is seven feet eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell weighs half a ton . Modern armadillos rarely exceed two feet in length .
