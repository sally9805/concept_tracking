It was not much more than a year ago ( TIME , Feb. 25 , Mar. 3 , 1924 , THE CONGRESS ) when Banker Frank A. Vanderlip startled the country with hints of scandal when he spoke of the " strange " circumstance of two " unknown " young men acquiring ownership of The Marion Star from President Harding . The two " unknowns , " Roy D. Moore and Louis H. Brush , sued him for libel . The case was recently settled out of court . <P> Messrs . Moore and Brush have been busily collecting a string of Ohio newspapers . They own , besides The Marion Star , the East Liverpool Tribune &; Review and the Salem News . <P> Last week , they added another historic paper to their collection . They purchased The Steubenville Herald-Star . The Herald part of it was started as a weekly in 1806 , and eight years later was bought by James Wilson , grandfather of Woodrow Wilson . He ran it for 24 years , and his son Robert Wilson ran it for seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening Star ( founded 1889 ) . Now the Wilson paper and the Harding paper are both the property of " two unknown young men . "
