WITH 1929 in the offing , we sit here quietly reviewing our life and times . Many things , not all , seem discouraging . Smoke drifts over from Jersey , shutting out sunlight ; the town is growing darker every year . The town is also becoming noisier , harder on the nerves . The glut of automobiles has made the streets almost impassable , and the rate of travel on Fifth Avenue during rush periods is two miles an hour . Fewer people are getting married . More people are getting divorced . The birth rate is lower . The city costs each citizen fifty-four dollars a year , some of which goes to enforce prohibition , which does not exist . Piper Heidsieck is on sale for ten dollars at club banquets . Home-made wine has been adjudged legal , but the Treasury Department says people are n't very good at making it . There is no war in South America , but Bolivia took thirty wagons and one tractor away from Paraguay , costing the life of Jose Miguel Villanueva Chavarria , a Bolivian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the League of Nations could do no good . If war should come , scientists have invented a gas called cacodyl isocyanide , which is so terrible they hardly dare speak about it . As for the immediate future , Mr. Ford says planes will soon be as common as autos ( we have just seen how common they are ) ; and Professor Voronoff says gland operations will be as common as Ellin g stations . ' Whether in spite of , or because of , some or all of these interesting phenomena , we find life perennially amusing , are occasionally thrilled by the sight of a small patch of sky showing through the smoke and between the buildings , and have every intention of going through with the year 1929 ? now that we 've virtually started . OUR Ho Hum editor , who follows politics at a little distance , tells us that the new Police Commissioner has ordered an improvement in discipline among the patrolmen . There will he no smoking on duty , no engaging in social conversation , and the peaceful citizen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd heard this news , a cop walked right into our office without knocking , and began haranguing us , peaceful citizen though we obviously were . Before he was through he had taken two dollars away from us , for the Fifteenth Annual Entertainment and Reception of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association at Madison Square Garden . If Grover Whalen wants to treat us with the utmost consideration , he will keep his hurly blue men out of our private cell . A policeman 's place is in the speakeasy ! THE best Christmas gift we received was Walter Hampden'swho gave us " Cyrano " on Christmas night . Journeying merrily up to Sixty-second Street to see , for the sixth time , the deathless comedy , we found that our own nose marched on before us by a quarter of an hour , so great was our eagerness . Mr. Hampden comes alive as Cyrano ; it is by all odds his most spirited contribution to the stage , and we thank him for having brought the Cadets of Gascoyne to town again . While they are on Broadway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark though many houses be . NOW that Childs restaurants have taken on atmosphere , something has gone out of our life . The dismal white-tiled sanctuaries of olden days played a distinct part in our emotional life ( certainly we have an emotional life ! ) for they were the places we retreated to when we wished to feel hollow and oppressed . The steady clank , the awful bareness , the mosaic tributes to the purity of the milk , have fed our self-pity on many an occasion when we preferred to regard the world as having turned against us . Now all is changed : the new Childs in Fortieth Street is a quaint reproduction of an old English tavern , and every Alice Square Foote of it reeks with good cheer and the legend of nut-brown ale . Even eating the fifty-cent combination plate ( V-41-420 ) consisting of Ye Old English buttered broccoli , squash , mashed potatoes , nuts , and Quaint Savita Gravy , failed to bring on that old forlorn feeling that used to help us through periods of spiritual debility . Maude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or two ago , there has been another report that she will return to the stage . This time the optimistic manager is Char/es L. Wagner , whose arrangement with the actress seems complicated . Most of her dealings with producers arc like that and most of them , as in the present instance , hinge on Miss Adams first going , to India to direct a film play of Kipling 's " Kim . " She has been dedicated to the making of such a picture for about Eve years . How she became interested in the story is a small mystery . In her life she has read little fiction , having devoted herself largely to Emerson , Plato , Erasmus , and the like , to the study of the sciences and of Latin and French . She became so absorbed in " Kim , " however , that about four years ago she went to the French Riviera to see its author about the movie rights . Negotiations were delayed , first by Kipling 's illness , and then by his aversion to the movies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , and an option for eight years , at a cost , we have heard , of fifty thousand dollars . The author 's stipulations as to how the story must be handled were strict , but they coincided with Miss Adams ' own desires in the matter She proposes to spend a year at least in India , to seek out native types for actors , even going into the Himalayas to search for someone to play the Lama , and to direct the picture herself . These restrictions have discouraged the movie magnates , virtually all of whom have at one time or another essayed to work with Miss Adams on the film , only to give up the project . Mr. Joseph Schenck is said to be the producer interested in the enterprise at the moment . A few years ago , Miss Adams , with the backing of some wealthy men , applied for a charter in Delaware for DE.CEMBER . 2 9 , 1 928 the Maude Adams Company , Inc. , with the idea of making the picture by herself , but nothing came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as France with representatives of a film concern , but that enterprise was also abortive , apparently because the company stipulated that she should act in another movie in return for help with " Kim . " Miss Adams still occasionally visits the General Electric laboratories at Schenectady , where about five years ago , coincidentally with her dedication to " Kim , " she began to experiment in color photography . Reports of what she has achieved have been vague . One rumor was to the effect that others obtained patents on inventions similar to those she was working On . She seems , at any rate , to have perfected plans for making some short reels of a historical nature for use in the schools . Whether these are to be in natural colors or not is unknown . Her love of children forms a background to all phases of her movie ventures . That Miss Adams is happy in her new interests is attested by a story she tells about herself . When she was in Paris on one of her " Kim " expeditions , she overheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French well , and once devoted six months to studying the language in a convent at Tours ) . " I felt like saying to those men that I , too , was interested in important things , " she has said to friends . That was at the height of her absorption in color photography and in " Kim , " both of which she considers far more important than any acting she has ever done . Canvases for Rent THE latest helping hand extended to the modernist artists is an arrangement for renting out their paintings . This is being done by the Downtown Gallery , in West Thirteenth Street . You can go there and obtain a group of Zorachs or Pop Harts for your next Sunday tea party , for example , or to impress the visiting relatives from Des Moines . One must engage a painting for a month at least , and the rental is one per cent per month of the price the artist asks for his work  --  thus one pays five dollars a month on a five-hundred-dollar painting . The gallery aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW YORKER ? not only to private families but to hotels and theatres for lobby displays , and to private schools for educational purposes . This would keep the paintings on view longer than is usual , for ordinarily , after a one-man or group show , the canvases exhibited are relegated to the artist 's studio if they are not sold . The gallery people believe the plan will be adopted by other galleries and perhaps extended to old masterpieces at , say , three thousand dollars a year or some such price . The Royal , and Herman IFyou want to meet East Side ce-lebrities , visit the Cafe Royal at Second Avenue and Twelfth Street with someone who knows its habitues . They are nearly all to be seen there two or three nights a week enjoying something of the spirit of the Continental cafes . People sit around playing cards or discussing philosophy or trade . It is often crowded and garish , but no one ever rushes at the Royal . Leisure is a tradition . The place is open all night and people drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily into the early morning hours . A man new to the place was dining there one night and urged a waiter to hurry , saying : " I have an engagement at eight o'clock . " With a grave little how , the waiter responded , " Then you will be an hour late . " In the summer , chairs and tables and palms arc set init on the sidewalk , and there you may sit for hours and contemplate life and sip tea . Employees remain longer at the Royal than at most restaurants , and waiters leave only when they go to start little restaurants of their own . Herman is a personality that never changes . Herman has been a busboy at the Royal for seventeen years , and for nine years before that he held the same office at the Cafe Monopol , which used to he three blocks down the avenue at Ninth Street . When the Monopnl was torn down , its owner , 0 . Szathmary , established the Royal . It has made him wealthy , and when he drops around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , he finds the employees carrying on faithfully . Herman is always there . As in the old Monripol days , he works sixteen hours a day ; that is , from 10 A.M. till 2 A.M. He is the Royal 's only busboy and performs a little miracle in his single-handed clearing of all the tables . He is reputed to have laid away a fortune , but Herman wo n't commit himself in the matter . He has always had a nice talent , however , for winning pourboires , complaining politely , as he hands a patron his coat , of the state of business and the degree of ingratitude in this world . He is usually tipped well , even by the habitues who know a certain fact about him . The certain fact is that he always carries a thousand dollars in bills in his pocket , with which he cashes cheques for the regular customers  --  a special service he thought up himself . The fee for this is established , ranging from five " You 'd better act quickly , sir  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-dollar cheque to fifty cents for a hundred-dollar one . At any rate , it is known that Herman 's two sons are getting the advantages of the world . One is a cadet at ) . Vest Point and the other is preparing for Harvard and the law . He himself can not read or write . " But , " he says , " if I could read or write , I would be a waiter , and who wants to be a waiter ? " New Twist LATEST version of the old steward- la on-the-ship swindle : A bootlegger phones a gentleman who lives in a hig apartment house and announces himself as John , a former elevator operator in the building . The victim usually remembers an elevator man named John and listens . John confides that he is a fireman on the Montreal run and has brought some excellent Scotch from Canada in his engine . Many sales were made for the Christmas season . The stuff was very bad . Unsung COME time ago SOM revealed that the two men who invented the ice-cream soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought us the story of another neglected inventor who lives here , Mr. Philip Arzherger . He has a shop in East Twenty-second Street , and most people think of him , if they think of him at all , as just a custom s hi rtrnaker . Mr. Arzberger should , however , go down in history as the man who finally figured out how to make a shirt which a man could put on without pulling it over his head . Nowadays we think nothing of the coatshirt  --  it is common and does n't seem especially clever . Yet up to 1884 there had n't been any . In that year an eminent German tragedian , a fellow of irritable temper , asked Mr. Arzberger , who was then learning his trade in a shop in Germany , if he could n't design some sort of blanketyblank shirt that a man could get into without mussing up his blankety-blank hair . Mr. Arzherger thought and thought about it , and at length hit on the idea . He introduced the coat-shirt to America in 1885 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first batch of the novelty was shown to John Forsythe , then blossoming forth as a smart haberdasher in the financial district . He took them all and ordered two hundred more . Soon the new shirts were sold in every corner of the land . Men 's hair looked nicer . 111en 's tempers improved . But for all this great benefit to mankind , Mr. Arzherger got not one cunt because he had no patent on his invention . He did n't even get a commission on his original order . Still , he now has a good business of his own , and is a jovial fellow , who never complains . ? A LADY of a certain age tells of- ten of her close escape from death at sea . It seems that she had signed up for a world cruise but that just two weeks before her ship departed the Vestris sank .

Bugs a Specialty ADARK , moody man confounded several associates in a place in Eighty-second Street the other evening by setting down his stein of beer , solemnly waving his pipe , and propounding this question : " If you had to have five hundred fleas , five hundred cockroaches , and five hundred bedbugs , where would you go to get them ? " It came out that none of the " Pm always vivacious when I 'm in condition ! " others had ever faced such a problem , but the man went on to say that he actually had . He was a scenarist working on a moving picture which the Flit people are getting up for exhibition in India , to demonstrate to the natives there how Flit kills vermin , and the scenario called for the insects . " I sat down and thought and finally decided to go to the Natural History Museum , " explained the scenarist . " I told a man there what I wanted . He smiled and promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer of a card-index cabinet . He gave me the address of a place in Grand Street , to which I went . They raise insects there to sell to research laboratories . " The narrator then told that while he was at the Museum , a shipping firm telephoned to report the discovery of a sort of parasite in a cargo of meat received from South America . The firm wanted tofind out whether the meat was ruined . The Museum promised that as soon as the man who handled matters like that came back from lunch he would be sent right down to the dock . Ordeal by Query OO UT in the midlands , the older VI generation is likely to regard as a lost soul a young man who removes to New York . The city is presumed to destroy a man 's faith and cause him to go about in the market-places mocking the gods . A young fellow from Ohio has lived here several years and in all that time he has not even so much as denounced the system employed by the football coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around breaking icons . When he recently returned home to Elyria for his first visit , however , the general feeling among his female relatives was that he was no longer the same , sweet boy . One aunt , named Emily , marked with uneasiness his trim mustache , his gay laughter , his bright tie , and finally laid her hand solemnly on his knee . With dread and doubt in her eyes she said , " Tell me , have you any admiration for Lindbergh ? " Miniature IN a certain basement on Riverside Drive there is a small boys ' para-dise , we have discovered . Through this basement there runs , in endless confusion , an electric toy railroad ; slow freights , tankers , limited trains toil over brown mountains , race through peaceful valleys , take switches at frightful speed , halt at little stations at which cabs are drawn up . On a platform at one end sits a youthful - Z.mmion ? dispatcher , megaphone in hand , calling instructions and wrecking train after train , immensely happy . A man named Newsom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railway at a profit , by charging the little boys ' mothers . The classes come from private schools in the neighborhood  --  each class pays twenty-five dollars for two hours . To Mr. Newsom , who is thirty-five and likes trains and boys , it is serious business . He makes his living from it , and is stern with his pupils . The day we visited the miraculous basement , a class of beginners was at the controls . The havoc was unutterable . A dozen trains , racing along eight hundred feet of marvellous roadbeds , freights on sidings , locals waiting for the green light on the right-of-way , things going wrong , Mr. Newsom crying commands , the head dispatcher  --  a boy of ten  --  alert but incompetent , directing seven-year-old signalmen who acted a second too late in the crises . Each boy was learning his own set of controls . All were deadly serious . It was their duty to see that the trains got through the zones safely , and signals warned them when tracks were n't clear . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated , dazzled , from the front line of operations and was shyly handing things to his braver comrades . Mr. Newsom has several classes which have advanced to a stage of great proficiency . One crack organization can operate , simultaneously , twenty trains , almost without accident , through tunnels , down branch lines , on and off sidings . By giving the signalmendemerits every time anything goes wrong , Mr. Newsom grades them . Finally the brightest boy attains to the coveted post of chief signalman , he of the megaphone and control board , and enjoys the privilege of shouting at Tommie Straus ( whom he holds in scorn ) : " Start that freight on track number twenty-seven from the mountain division ! " Once a year the chief dispatchers from the different classes meet for a grand tourney , and give the railroad a workout that makes the New York Central look silly . The best man in this contest is elected president of the road . In the early days of his railroad , Mr. Newsom used to let grown-ups run it , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to have his phone taken out . Light-hearted groups used to arrive after parties . They paid twenty-five dollars , but they did n't understand the signals and their reflexes were imperfect . One party of doctors liked the railroad so well they used to come once a week ; but they never fully mastered the signals and Mr. Newsom at last decided that anybody over ten was too headstrong to be a good . customer . A Night of It THE host of a little party the other night suddenly told his guests , in tearful eloquence , that there were a lot of cats in the neighborhood who did n't have any fun , cats who never enjoyed themselves at all . The upshot of his little talk was that the guests went outdoors and began to collect cats , while the host departed for some catnip . This was strewn on the floor , and not fewer than sixteen cats were soon having a swell time The orgy lasted until toward morning when , although the guests had ail left , the cats continued to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do little with them single-handed , being able to eject only about four .
