For long men thought the earth was flat . In the latter part of the 15th Century , the idea began to get about that the earth was a sphere . <P> As early as 1696 , it was shown that the earth is not a true sphere . Various calculations have since been made of the earth 's shape and dimensions . <P> Last week , it was announced that there finally had been an international agreement on this subject . The International Geodetic and Physical Union , meeting at Madrid , Spain , adopted the figures of Director John F. Hayford of the College of Engineering of Northwestern University , noted for his demonstration of the theory of isostasy , fundamental concept of the reciprocal balance of segments of the earth . By investigations made in 1909 and 1910 , he determined that the diameter of the earth at the equator is 7,926,678 miles and 7,889,964 miles through the poles . This establishes that the earth is not a sphere but an ellipsoid , slightly flattened at the poles . The Hayford figures have now been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geodetic authorities of all the nations will use them to coordinate their work . Director Hayford was , at the time of this decision , seriously ill at his home in Evanston . A few days later , he died .
