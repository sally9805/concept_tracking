Again Costes . Round and round a giant 's circle , droning on through the Provence mistral with a log of slowly waning fuel and gradually mounting flying time , last week went the Question Mark , red-painted French Breguet airplane , in search of a new endurance record . Piloted by Dieudonn ( " Doudou " ) Costes and his companion Paul Codos , it made its way over flat-roofed , smelly Marseilles , to time-broken Avignon , to musty Narbonne , and then over the same route again . For 52 hours and 34 minutes the Breguet 's motor snorted along . Then with a last puff and snort , the ship touched ground gently at her starting point , Istres Aerodrome near Marseilles . For 8,026 kilometres ( 4,987 miles ) Costes &; Codos had ridden a closed circuit with one load of fuel . The pleased French Government gave them an $8,000 bonus for breaking the closed-course record , which Ferrarin and Del Prete ( Italians ) held with 4763.7 miles . <P> This flight perhaps made Costes flyer-of-the-year . Three months ago he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellonte from Paris to Tsitsihar , Manchuria , an airline of 4,910 miles made in the same ship with a more powerful motor ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) . <P> The formidable Costes record : shot down 13 enemy fighters during the War ; served conspicuously in other air branches - artillery fire regulation , reconnoitering , day &; night bombardment ; given the Legion of Honor after his sixth plane victory ; made an officer of the Legion and voted the U. S. Distinguished Flying Cross ( with Joseph Lebrix ) in 1928 for a globe-circling adventure which took them from Paris to St. Louis ( Africa ) , to Port Natal ( Brazil ) , all over South America , thence to New Orleans , Washington , San Francisco , then by boat to Tokyo , by air to China , Indo-China , Calcutta , Karachi , Aleppo , Syria , Athens , Marseilles and home to Paris . On his recent flight home from Tsitsihar with Bellonte , Costes went by way of French Indo-China and broke his own record from Hanoi to Paris ( 4 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with Louis-Charles Breguet , designer-manufacturer.
