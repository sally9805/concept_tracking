Last week the Cotton Textile Institute , headed by Walker D. Hines , reported upon a large job well done . During the first five months of 1929 , said Mr. Hines , 427 , - 638,000 yards of cotton were printed , an increase of 28% over 1928 . During the same period , 763,462,000 yards of cotton goods were finished , a 21% increase over 1928 . For three years the Cotton Textile Institute had been working on the problem of building up a cotton-acceptance among U. S. women . Last month , the problem was considered solved . <P> The solution : selling cotton from the style standpoint and forgetting it from the thrift standpoint . U. S. prosperity had made many a woman , once a cotton-buyer , a purchaser of silk . The arrival of rayon , essentially a low-priced near-silk , had completed the defeat of cotton . The cheapness of cotton became not an asset but a liability , for textile trade follows the flag of fashion . <P> So Cotton Textile Institute began selling cotton not to the thrifty but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chic modes . The spice of novelty was introduced through beach pyjamas , overalls , suntan frocks , quilted coats , printed slippers . Well did the cotton man 's calico , gingham , piques , chambrays , gabardines lend themselves to these novelties . During the 1928-29 Palm Beach season cotton was an outstanding success . During the present season cotton fabrics have been conspicuously successful . Once sold to the smart world , it was certain that cotton would be sold to all the world . When sales are made in the Blue Book , the Telephone Book soon follows . <P> Pointing with pride to the past , the Cotton Textile Institute did not forget the future . <P> Said President Hines : " The industry is fully alert to the necessity for maintaining cotton in a prominent position in the high-styled field in order to keep this market in advance of the volume market ... I believe that the industry appreciates the results of these special Institute efforts . . . and will wish to continue and enlarge the program . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
