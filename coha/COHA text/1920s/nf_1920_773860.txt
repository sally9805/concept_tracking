txt // that of the practice of medicine . Boerhaave , who , at that period of time , represented by universal consent the leading medical authority of the world , was the regular professor of medicine in the university ( 1710-1738 ) , and was held in such high esteem as a teacher that students flocked by hundreds from all parts of Europe to benefit from his instruction . Among this number were two young men , Albrecht von Haller , of Berne , Switzerland , and the subject of the present sketch , ? both of whom afterward became celebrated for the important parts which they played in the advancement of medical science . Boerhaave appears to have taken a special liking for the latter and to have entertained great confidence in his ability as a physician . In 1827 , when Boerhaave , by reason of a gouty affection of his legs , began to experience considerable difficulty in attending to his official duties in the university , van Swieten , upon whom the degree of Doctor of Medicine had been conferred only two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to lecture in his place . As the years passed by , and as the pupil showed more and more clearly that he was entirely competent to perform this important duty in behalf of his teacher , van Swieten carne eventually to be accepted as the worthy interpreter of Boerhaave 's teachings . This practice continued for nearly twenty years , and with ever increasing confidence in and affection for the pupil on the part of his distinguished teacher . Boerhaave 's death in 1738 , however , put an end to van Swieten 's substitute professorship . All the available evidence goes to show that Boerhaave hoped that , in the event of his death , van Swieten would be chosen his successor ; but the records of the university fail to show that the latter held at any time an official position in the teaching body . During Boerhaave 's lifetime no opposition of any kind was offered to van Swieten 's continued yet officially unauthorized occupancy of the Chair of Medicine , although it was well known that he was a Roman Catholic ; but , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swieten 's candidacy was immediately organized by his rivals . The claim was made by them that he could not legally be chosen to fill the vacant // chair , by reason of the fact that the university had been founded on a Protestant basis and that consequently it would not be either legal or proper to elect a Roman Catho lic to fill the vacancy . When the personal friends of van Swieten and a large body of the students begged that , despite the legal obstacle , he might be chosen the regular successor of Boerhaave , he himself at once exerted all his authority to stop the movement . Nevertheless , he felt keenly the loss of his position in the University of Leyden , for he loved the work of teaching which he had carried on so successfully during the previous two decades . Van Swieten 's retirement from the duties of a teacher in the university brought with it certain important com pensations . In the first place he was now able to devote himself fully to his private practice which had by this time grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened for him to begin work at once upon his " Commentaries , " ? a book of which he completed the first volume in 1742 , and which contained matter of decided importance in promoting an advance in the science of medicine . Some authorities claim that if one wishes to obtain a clear understanding of Boerhaave 's teachings , he will have to read van Swieten 's elaborate work ; which in its completed state consists of five large volumes . ' Strange as it may appear , a Dutch trans lation of the work has never been published ; from which fact two conclusions are warranted : first , that already as early as 1754 van Swieten must have severed all connection with his native land ; and , second , that the number of phy sicians in Holland who might be tempted to purchase a Dutch version of the work was undoubtedly very small . In November of the year 1744 van Swieten was called to Brussels to see , in consultation with her regular medical attendants , the Archduchess Marianne , wife of Charles Alexander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany . She had recently been confined , // after having been in poor health for several months before this event . It was therefore not surprising that at the delivery , on November 5 , the child was found to be dead . Shortly after the confinement the condition of the Archduchess became rapidly worse , and it was then that Maria Theresa sent her own physician , Dr. Engel , from Vienna to consult with van Swieten and with her sister 's regular medical attendants . It appears that these two leading physicians frequently disagreed as to what was the best treatment to adopt ; but van Swieten was so tactful in his advocacy of the measures which he thought advisable and so courteous in his intercourse with his professional associates that Prince Kaunitz , the Imperial Austrian Chancellor , who happened to be in Brussels at this time , wrote to the Empress in strongly commendatory terms of the impression which van Swieten had made upon him . However , the hope which the latter had held out with regard to the patient 's ultimate recovery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his failure to predict correctly the outcome of the Archduchess ' illness van Swieten had succeeded so completely in impressing all the patient 's immediate friends with his skill as a physician and with a genuine esteem for his personal character that they had only praise to bestow upon the man in their reports to the Empress . Maria Theresa 's mind was now entirely made up as to the wisdom of calling van Swieten to Vienna and entrusting to him the work of reorganizing the hospital management and the university medical teaching in her capital , matters in which she took a very deep interest . As soon as the decision reached by the Empress became generally known in Vienna certain physicians of that city lost no time in taking steps to thwart her plan . Scheming of this sort , however , had to be done very cautiously , for it was not safe openly to oppose the will of the sovereign . The first evidence of the existence of this intrigue to prevent the appointment of van Swieten to a position of such commanding importance in the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , 1745 . After announcing the death of the Archduchess Marianne at // Brussels the article in question added the following remarks : " The fatal issue , it appears , is to be attributed to the unsuccessful treatment that was carried out by the local physicians with whom van Swieten of Leyden was associated as the chief consultant ; it having been predicted from the very first by Dr. Engel , the imperial Austrian physician , that this treatment , if adopted , would terminate badly . " The Empress closed her ears to this and all similar calumnious reports , and wrote to van Swieten that it was her warmest wish that , when he came to Vienna , he might not experience any unpleasantness . " I would rather , " she added , " abandon completely my personal interest in this matter than have you made unhappy by the contemplated visit to Vienna . " While these gracious words from the Empress were greatly appreciated by van Swieten he was not willing to appear in Vienna in the role of a censor or a reformer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take up his residence in the Austrian capital before June 7 , 1745 . VAN SWIETEN 'S WORK AS A MEDICAL REFORMER. ? SO far as the teaching of medicine was concerned van Swieten found everything in the University in a state of confusion ; indeed , nothing worthy the name of medical science existed in Vienna at that period of time . He had left a city in which the teaching of this branch of knowledge had reached a high degree of development and had come to one where the very foundations of such work had yet to be laid . He recognized at the first glance just what steps would have to be taken , and he was much encouraged by the thought that he could count upon the powerful support which Maria Theresa was only too glad to give him . According to Mueller , he realized that the most serious obstacle in his way was sure to be the very great influence wielded by the Jesuits , who had for many years controlled all educational matters in the Austrian Empire . He began his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on Boerliaave 's Principles of Medicine ( " Institutions " ) , and he managed within a comparatively short time to // attract large numbers of auditors , in whose minds was thus created a strong interest in the personality of the lecturer . At the same time van Swieten remained conscious of the fact that many of the members of the Faculty had not ceased to look upon him with keenly jealous eyes . In his memorial to the Empress on the progress which had thus far been made in the study of medicine he wrote : " Although the Faculty have not included my Commentaries ' in the list of books which they recommend to the students , they emphasize by this very act the fact that physicians everywhere ? as shown by the publication of five separate editions and two translations of my book in only six years ? do not agree with these gentlemen in regard to the value of this work . " The continued favor shown to van Swieten by the Empress and the consciousness that he was doing his full share toward advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungenerous spirit which animated his colleagues . REORGANIZATION OF THE VIENNA MEDICAL SCHOOL. - But van Swieten rendered valuable services to the university in other ways than by lecturing , by acting as the Director of the Royal Library , and by serving as the private physician of the Empress , its great patron . For example , it was his duty , after a certain time had elapsed , to select additional professors for the Medical Department , and in this work he also manifested excellent judgment ; but he was not called upon to exercise this particular function until after he had been settled in Vienna for about four years . As the first step in building up the teaching force van Swieten invited Anton de Haen ( 1703-1776 ) , a native of Leyden and one of Boerhaave 's former pupils , to carry on the clinical teaching which he himself had already in some measure organized at the university . Speaking of de Haen 's qualifications for this important office , Hecker , the author of a history of modern medicine and a person entirely competent to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following comments : " Vienna has seen few teachers as well fitted as de Haen for inspiring enthusiasm and for // making clinical teaching effective , and few so capable as he was of showing his auditors with persuasive force how they should study Nature by direct observation , and not from books or lectures . Possessing no inclination whatever to indulge in social pleasures or in amusements of any kind , he found his chief enjoyment in tireless work . Knowledge was the priceless treasure which , by the aid of an unfailing memory and remarkable skill , he sought to win . Possess ing , as he did , a quick temper , he became at times very angry under even slight provocation . Although such outbursts of temper did not conduce to his popularity they enabled him to boast that he had attained his lofty position wholly through merit , and not ? as was in some measure true of van Swieten ? through abstention from self-assertion . " Despite all his faults , adds Hecker , de Haen was a great physician and an extraordinarily clever teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub lished under the title : " Ratio Medendi " ( The Philosophy of Treatment ) . He was a violent opponent of the practice of inoculation . The next six men selected by van Swieten were also dis tinguished teachers , well fitted to uphold the growing celeb rity of the Vienna Medical School . They were : Anton von Stoerck , commonly spoken of as van Swieten 's favorite pupil ; Maximilian Stoll , one of de Haen 's pupils ; Lorenz Gasser ; 2 Heinrich Crantz , another of van Swieten 's talented pupils ; Robert Laugier ; and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin . While the addition of these unquestionably strong names to the list of professors in the medical department of the uni versity was recognized as a move in the right direction , the retention of a few incompetent teachers led to considerable worry on the part of van Swieten . Although he was con vinced that it would be better for the University to get rid of these men he did not dare to act on his own responsibility , fearing the disturbance that was likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom the situation was fully explained , begged him not to hesitate any longer , but to take whatever steps seemed best for the good of the university and the public . Thus encouraged , van Swieten proceeded to remove first one and then another of the men who seriously interfered with his plans for improving the teaching in the Medical School . In 1757 , on the death of Archbishop Trautson , who held the position of " Protector of the Studies in the University , " this office was abolished . Already in the preceding year , at van Swieten 's suggestion , the Rector of the Jesuits was no longer permitted by the Empress to take part in the regular conferences of the Consistory of the University . Gradually other members of the Jesuit Order were excluded from the management of the affairs of the University . Finally , in 1759 , van Swieten accepted the office of Censor of Medical and Philosophical Writings , and up to the day of his death the performed the duties of his office most satisfactorily to all concerned . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Vienna Medical School . While the changes described above were taking place the Empress , under the inspiration given by van Swieten , inaugurated certain improvements in the housing and equipment of the Medical School . In 1752 she gave the necessary orders for constructing a new building that was to contain a fine anatomical theatre , a chemical laboratory , lecture rooms for the different professors , a general assembly hall , etc . This fine structure was completed and formally inaugurated in April , 1756 . Finally , all the hospitals in Vienna were greatly improved during this period of time , not only as regards their accommodations and equipment , but also in respect to their management . INAUGURATION OF CLINICAL TEACHING. - As the sequel showed , Vienna , under the inspiring cooperation of the Empress , continued for a long series of years the Mecca toward which physicians and medical students turned their steps from all parts of Central and Northern Europe and // even from the United States of America and from Canada . It is now universally recognized that this extraordinary popularity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century and has continued almost up to the present time , was chiefly due to the clinical teaching which de Haen inaugurated at van Swieten 's suggestion . Sylvius and , after him , Boerhaave had already given this method a trial at Leyden , but for various reasons it had not proved entirely satisfactory . De Haen 's plan was to let each student , at the bedside of the patient , make his own diagnosis and then whisper it to the professor , who in turn announced it to the remainder of the class . If the diagnosis proved to be correct the professor found it unnecessary to say anything additional on the subject ; but , if it happened to be incorrect , he presented the truth to the class in such a manner as not to give the slightest offence to the student who had committed the error . This plan encouraged his pupils to feel confidence that , whenever they made an erroneous diagnosis , they would not be subjected to ridicule on the part of their classmates . This exercise in diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , whenever it happened that a patient whose case had been studied by the class , subsequently died , a post-mortem examination was conducted in their presence , and appropriate explanatory remarks were made by the instructor . In further explanation of the extraordinary popularity which the clinical teaching at Vienna attained it is interesting to learn that de Haen ( and probably also Stoll , who succeeded him ) was in the habit of rising at an early hour that he might visit the hospital and learn , in advance of the arrival of the students , how the patients in the section set apart for teaching purposes were getting on , how their condition differed from that which they presented at the time of his visit on the preceding day , and what special provision , if any , should be made for the approaching clinical lesson . In short , no pains were spared to make each seance as attractive and as instructive as possible to the students . While I ani here giving to de Haen and Stoll all the credit // that is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they carried out the teaching of medicine at Vienna it must be remembered that van Swieten was the real founder of clinical instruction in the famous university ; de Haen and Stoll having simply put in practice the ideas introduced by him . At this point in my sketch the question may with propriety be asked , Where may one find in history another instance of such beneficent interference on the part of a queen in behalf of a higher standard of medical education ? Certain it is that , without the powerful and sympathetic assistance which Maria Theresa granted him at every stage of his work , van Swieten could not have accomplished in so short a period of time the extraordinary results which I have here briefly recorded . VAN SWIETEN 'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THERAPEUTICS. ? In his treatment of disease van Swieten practiced conservative methods and prescribed remedies with great caution and with strong common sense . In the case of small-pox , for instance , he did not approve of the practice of inoculation as a method of diminishing the mortality of that disease or possibly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently believed the attendant risk to be too great . It was particularly in his treatment of syphilis , however , that he accomplished results of a most beneficial character . In St. Mark 's Hospital , in which patients affected with this disease were lodged , it had been the rule ? previous to the date of van Swieten 's arrival in Vienna ? to subject all the cases , without regard to the severity of the infection , to a course of mercurial salivation . As a natural result of this plan of treatment it happened not infrequently that a patient 's life was severely threatened or that he was left with lifelong sequelae of a lamentable character . The physician under whose management this mode of treatment flourished was dismissed from his position by van Swieten as soon as he was able to overcome the obstacles which stood in his way as he advanced toward the accomplishment of this end . Maximilian Locher , who // was put in charge of the hospital after the dismissal of his predecessor , was instructed to use a solution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came under his care ; and the results that followed were so aston ishingly good that the remedy soon came to be known everywhere as " Swieten 's " liquor . ' For many subsequent years this solution retained its popularity among European physicians . As regards the other remedies which van Swieten was in the habit of employing in his treatment of various maladies it is stated that he clung persistently to those advocated by Boerhaave and enumerated at the end of Vol . V of the Com mentaries , ? remedies which were characterized by their simplicity and by the fewness of the ingredients that entered into their composition . VAN SWIETEN 'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEDICAL LITERATURE . In addition to his famous " Commentaries " van Swieten wrote only one other treatise to which it seems desirable to call the reader 's attention . I refer to the book that bears the title " Constitutiones Epidemicae " and that was first published by Stoll after the author 's death . According to the statement of Mueller " this work is a sort of Physician 's Day-Book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that van Swieten was a very close observer of the different diseases that came under his notice . . . . It con stitutes a valuable supplement to the history of Boerhaave 's therapeutic methods . " Finally , it should be stated , on the authority of Hecker , that van Swieten wrote a small manual for the use of mili tary surgeons . It was published by Johann Thomas Tratt nern , Court Printer and Bookseller , Vienna , Prague and Trieste , 1758 . Van Swieten 's name ? says Hecker ? does not appear anywhere in the volume ; and , furthermore , serious doubts have been expressed as to the correctness of the claim that van Swieten is the author of this little manual . // After van Swieten 's death in 1772 , the bust of this distinguished physician , which already three years earlier the sculptor F. X. Messerschmied had been commissioned by the Empress to prepare , was set up in the auditorium of the Medical School ; and in addition an elaborate monument in his honor was erected in the Ho f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , VAN SWIETEN 'S SUCCESSOR , AND THE PROGRESS OF MEDICAL AFFAIRS AT VIENNA UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF JOSEPH II . After the death of Maria Theresa , in 1780 , her son Joseph , who had previously been associated with his mother in the government of the empire , became the Emperor in the full sense of that term . Fortunately for the best interests of the science and art of medicine he had long been familiar , and fully in sympathy , with the plans and purposes of Maria Theresa ; and he was therefore quite ready to advance the good work which she had begun . One of his first acts was to remove every possible disability from those officers and instructors who were non-Catholics , thus enabling them to gain all the facilities and honors which their Catholic associates had up to that time enjoyed . In their ultimate effect upon the growth and prosperity of the university these special measures undoubtedly were advantageous , but they were carried out with too great rapidity . According to Puschmann the Emperor strove to accomplish in a comparatively short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His efforts met with strong opposition in certain quarters , and before his death in 1790 he had the disheartening experience of witnessing the upsetting of many of his cherished plans . After his death , however , he received full credit for what he had attempted ; the Viennese speaking of him as " the friend of the poor and the miserable , the upholder of justice and the champion of spiritual freedom and of education . " ANTON STOERCK AND THE MANNER OF TEACHING MEDICINE // THE DAWN OF MODERN MEDICINE ten 's successor , was the first to enjoy in large measure the fruits of the latter 's reformation of medical teaching in Vienna . His elder brother , Melchior , had already before this date been appointed Professor of Theoretical Medicine in the University ; and then , in 1760 , Anton himself was elevated to the important position of Court Physician . He gained his chief distinction , however , through his enthusiastic cultivation of experimental pharmacology . In this field , which had previously received very little attention , he was probably the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actual practice could be bridged only by a resort to experimentation . Among the drugs which he tested in this manner were the following : datura stramonium , hyoscyamus Eiger L. , clematis erecta and pulsatilla nigricans L. Van Swieten , so long as his state of health permitted , encouraged Anton to go on with his experimental work ; de Haen , on the other hand , was rather skeptical about the success of his efforts . Ultimately ? after van Swieten 's death ? Anton Stoerck became the leading spirit in the affairs of the Vienna medical world . The instruction in medicine was graded by him , with the Emperor 's consent , in the following manner : The medical students , before they were permitted to begin the course of instruction , were obliged to furnish satisfactory evidence of possessing adequate general scientific knowledge and of having previously attended lectures in natural history and experimental physics . In the next place , they were further obliged to attend the lectures on botany , chemistry , anatomy and physiology , and to pass a satisfactory examination in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of pathology and materia medica . It was only after having passed'a satisfactory examination in these subjects that they were allowed to receive clinical instruction . At the final examination they were called upon to make a report on a few cases of actual disease and to set forth especially the details of the treatment adopted ; to write a certain number of prescriptions ; and , finally , to defend publicly , in the presence of the Rector and the Chancellor of the University , the Deans of the four Faculties , and // one Professor of the Medical School , a thesis on some medical doctrine . After which the formal ceremonial of conferring the degree was carried out in the presence of the same university officials . And here again , the Emperor effected a most marked reformation ; he abolished all those religious ceremonies which it had been customary to observe in connection with the bestowal of the degree of M.D. and the right to practice medicine . He also adopted measures for enlarging the equipment of the University libraries , and among other things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collections of books to the libraries of the university . Recognizing , as he did , the fact that the proper training of medical men who intended to follow the career of surgeons was at that time lamentably inadequate , he instituted , at the earliest moment practicable , such changes in the teaching , in the duration of the course , in the requirements for graduation , etc. , that the surgeons would thereafter be on the same level , with regard to education and practical training , as the physicians . At first ( 1780 ) , the Faculty consisted of nine professors , who gave instruction in the following branches : anatomy , physiology , natural history , chemistry and botany , general pathology and therapeutics ( including pharmaceutics ) , internal medicine and clinical instruction , theoretical surgery , clinical surgery , and obstetrics . In addition to these there were several assistants and a prosector ( demonstrator of anatomy ) . The Emperor Joseph II. , after expressing serious doubts with regard to the " possibility of teaching the theory of surgery , bandaging and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the following scheme should be adopted : FIRST YEAR : Anatomy and physiology , together with chemistry and botany ( for physicians only ) and operative work , bandaging and obstetrics ( for surgeons only ) . SECOND YEAR : ( For physicians ) Materia medica , pathology and clinical medicine . ( For surgeons ) Clinical medicine , clinical surgery , and obstetrics . THIRD YEAR : Entirely given up to practical work at the hospital and the Clinic . // At a later date the course was extended to four years ; and from that time forward , according to Puschmann , surgeons were looked upon with consideration . Hirsch , speaking of the majority of physicians of that period , says that they sought to quiet the demands of the public for satisfactory information about their maladies by employing , in their responses , the meaningless terms of Graeco-Latin terminology ; and he quotes Immanuel Kant , the famous Prussian metaphysician , as having expressed the same idea when he said : " These men thought they were rendering their patients a great service when they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the therapeutic measures which these socalled physicians employed , Hirsch adds : " they generally consisted of pills and plasters , drugs of various kinds , clysters and repeated blood-lettings which at times produced such a degree of exhaustion that only patients with a strong constitution were able to rally from the effects of this loss of blood . . . . The title Doctor of Medicine ' afforded no guarantee that the individual who bore it possessed the requisite degree of medical knowledge . " Fortunately for the public there were at that time in almost every community a few men to whom the description given above does not in the slightest degree apply . I have already mentioned the names of several physicians of this higher stamp , and the number of such honorable representatives of our profession rapidly increases as we approach the nineteenth century . REORGANIZATION OF THE HOSPITAL WORK IN VIENNA TOWARD THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. ? In the preceding sections mention has been made of the important changes effected by the Emperor Joseph II . in the scheme of teaching adopted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to give some account of his reorganization of the Vienna hospitals and of his founding that famous general hospital known as Das Allgemeine KraDkenhaus . That there was need of reorganization in at least some of the hospitals is shown by the following // anecdote which is related of Professor Boer , who held the Chair of Obstetrics . When the authorities who had special charge of the Lying-in Ward complained to him that he prescribed too liberal a diet for this class of patients , he replied somewhat impatiently that he could not feed , " with water , Epsom salts and Arcanum Duplicatum ' a secret remedy that was popularly believed to be efficacious , the women who were already a good deal weakened by their pregnant state as well as by sorrow , anxiety and insufficient nourishment ; for a liberally supplied kitchen and a good wine cellar were more important than drugs . " To furnish a complete and satisfactory description of Das Allgemeine Krankenhaus would require more space than can properly be devoted here to the consideration of this single topic . Those who take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Puschmann 's monograph ( See Bibliography ) ; for the majority of readers the following brief account will probably suffice . The Allgemeine Krankenhans consists of a very large group of three-story buildings in which there are numerous individual spaces large enough to serve as wards , as small lecture rooms , or as reception rooms for ambulant patients ( eye , ear , throat , skin and minor surgical cases ) . The ceilings are usually high and the openings for windows are of such dimensions as to furnish excellent ventilation and liberal daylight illumination . Ample facilities are provided for bathing , for cooking the needed food , and for preparing and dispensing remedies ; and the individual buildings are grouped in such a manner as to afford numerous small parklike spaces in which the patients may obtain outdoor exercise or may enjoy the fresh air and some social intercourse with their fellows . Although in 1784 the buildings were almost ready for occupancy and the park-like surroundings completed , it was only at a much later date that the institution was really prepared for the reception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thoroughly organized that physicians and students came from different parts of the world , and especially from Great Britain and from America , to enjoy fully those extraordinary facilities for // the study of every possible form of disease which were to be obtained only in the city of Vienna . Whereas in London , New York , Philadelphia and Boston , it was necessary at that time for all but a few of the students to waste many precious hours and much physical strength in traveling from one hospital to another in order to acquire by direct observation some familiarity with disease , here in Vienna was provided , in a single group of buildings , ample provision for all the clinical teaching that the most eager and serious student of medicine could possibly desire . NEW METHODS OF DIAGNOSIS , AND FIRST APPEARANCE OF INSTRUCTORS IN SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS OF MEDICINE AT VIENNA. - It was during van Swieten 's lifetime that Auenbrugger 's new invention " for detecting , by means of percussion , the obscure diseases of the chest , " was published for the first time ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was termed by him " Novum Inventum , " was not appreciated by physicians at that time . Even van Swieten and de Haen rather looked down on the method ; and its importance was not fully recognized until Corvisart , the celebrated Paris physician , published a French translation of Auenbrugger 's book in 1808 . This work , in which Corvisart gave his own experience and added many notes and comments , served to popularize Auenbrugger 's method as a valuable aid to diagnosis in affections of the chest . In his preface Corvisart announced that he was well aware of the small glory that came to translators and to those who simply comment on the work of others , but notwithstanding this fact he preferred that the major part of the glory should go to Auenbrugger who had rendered such a great service to the Profession by his invention . Auenbrugger , who died in 1809 at the age of 87 , lived long enough to enjoy the pleasure of this triumph . His private practice grew to be very large , and he performed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of thoracentesis . He was universally loved and respected in Vienna . // One of the first specialties to take root in Vienna toward the end of the eighteenth century was that of ophthalmology , and the physician who first succeeded in bringing it to a high stage of development was GEORGE JOSEPH BEER , who was born at Vienna in 1763 . During his student days and for a short time subsequently he acted as a draughtsman for Joseph Barth , the professor of anatomy and physiology in the Vienna University , and in this way he obtained unusual opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of both the normal and the pathological anatomy of the eye . Already in 1793 he applied for , and was granted , permission to treat , in the Allgemeine Krankenhans , such poor people as were suffering from cataract , and to perform the requisite operations . Each year , during the months of May and June , a suitable room was gotten ready for Beer in the hospital , and here , during this most favorable season of the year , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double appointment of Director of the Eye Clinic and Professor Extraordinary of Ophthalmology ; and from this time forward he rapidly gathered about him a great crowd of pupils , among whom were men who ? like C. F. von Graefe , Philip von Walther , T. W. G. Benedict , F. Jaeger , Rosas , Quadri , J. N. Fischer , Mackenzie , Reisinger , Chelius and others ? were soon to be known in every part of Austria , Germany , Italy and England as the leading eye surgeons of their respective countries . Beer therefore exerted a most decided influence on the development of ophthalmology . Beer 's early writings , the first of which date from the year 1791 , also exerted a great influence . Such , for example , were his " Practical Observations on the Gray Form of Cataract " and on the " Different Eye Diseases which Owe their Origin to Some General Disease " ; and also his " Treatise on Diseases of the Eyes . " The last-named passed through several enlarged and improved editions between 1813 and 1817 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ophthalmological topics which had been published up to the end of 1797 ; and soon afterward he published an account of his method of extracting a gray cataract together // with its capsule . Still other memoirs of decided value were published by him in the following years ; and among them one especially deserves to be mentioned , viz. , that on the affection known as " Pannus , " of which condition he was the first to give a correct explanation . In 1819 Beer was stricken with an illness of a serious nature , and two years later he died . He was succeeded by Anton Rosas , whose death occurred in 1855 . CHAPTER X PROCHASKA , HYRTL AND ROKITANSKY , THREE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED TEACHERS AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF VIENNA DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE NINETEENTH CEN-TURY GEORGE PROCIHASKA , born at Lipsitz , Moravia , in 1749 , was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Ophthalmology at the Prague Medical School in 1778 . Eight years later he was transferred to the Chair of Physiology . In 1791 he received the appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna . In 1819 he resigned this chair , probably owing to poor health ; and his death occurred during the following year . Between 1780 and 1797 he published , in Latin , important monographs on the physiology of man . Later , these were thoroughly revised and then published in German under the title of " Physiology , or the Doctrine of the Nature of Man . " Prochaska was esteemed very highly as an eye surgeon of exceptional skill and wide experience , no fewer than 3000 cataract operations having been performed by him . His greatest achievements , however , belong in the domain of physiology . Already as early as in 1797 he hinted at the possibility that , in the case of the spinal nerves , one of the portions might transmit centripetal and the other centrifugal impulses . It was reserved , however , for the great English physiologist , Sir Charles Bell , to establish firmly , several years later , the law governing these two currents . Prochaska 's ideas with regard to the nature of " vital force " ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? may be inferred from the following quotations : In the performances of the nervous system there occur manifesta80 THE DAWN OF MODERN MEDICINE tions which bear a striking resemblance to the phenomena produced by electricity . . . . In my opinion it is not permissible to conceive of vital force as an independent power , one that depends upon a single and special principle , but rather as an aggregation of all the forces of Nature , representing in one set of instances the cause and in another set the effect of these forces , and combining in this body of ours , by their foreordained harmony , to create what we call life . Therefore , among the powers that are commonly meant when we use the expression " vital power , " there are no specific forces , but only the general forces which exist in Nature ; but at the same time they are combined under a special relationship in fact , they are entangled the one with the other in such an inextricable snarl that it is simply impossible for us to gain a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite remarkable , says Puschmann , how closely Prochaska 's ideas regarding the formation of bone agree with the teachings of our modern authorities . Here is the paragraph in which he formulates these ideas in full detail The business of nutrition is carried on in such a manner that , when new conditions arise , whole organs which for some time previously were performing useful work , are swept out of existence , and new ones , better adapted to the work required of them , are put in their places . As an instance in point we may mention certain cartilages which , for a limited period of time during childhood , take the place of bone structures , and which at the same time play the part of really necessary aids to the growth of the bone . These cartilages gradually become converted into the latter tissue , the process reaching the stage of completion at different times , but yet at a fixed and definite time for each particular bone . Thus , in the case of the long bones , the cartilage becomes completely ossified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of ossification does not consist in a simple hardening or change of the cartilage into bone ; the essential features of the process may more correctly be described as follows : the cartilage , in the depths of whose substance bone-tissue centres are being nourished and are progressively undergoing development , is steadily being crowded to one side and ultimately destroyed . At the same time there appear here and there in the cartilage a few bloodvessels which , so far as one is able to judge , spring , in the majority of instances , from the neighboring fully-formed bone substance . // And , as a further stage in the process of growth , there appear alongside the new blood-vessels centres of ossification , which in due time become foci of genuine bone tissue . Then , as these foci increase in size , the surrounding cartilage steadily dwindles in quantity until nothing remains but a few scattered cavities or hollows , which persist for only a short time before they disappear altogether . Prochaska 's discoveries in regard to the growth of bone excited the admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved prolonged investigations with the aid of the microscope and much close and careful thinking . It is safe to say that at this early date ( end of the eighteenth century ) original investigations like the one just described must have been very few indeed in Austria . CARL ROKITANSKY , who was born at Koeniggratz , Bohemia , in 1804 , received his medical training at the universities of Prague and Vienna . For several years after he had been given the degree of Doctor of Medicine he served as an Assistant in the Pathologico-Anatomical Institute , and in 1832 , after the death of Johann Wagner , the Custodian of the Museum that formed a part of the Institute , he was appointed his successor , not only in this particular office but also in those which were closely related to it ? viz. , the office of Prosector of the Allgemeine Krankenhaus and that of Judicial Anatomist for the City of Vienna . The duties which he had to perform in connection with these offices and as an Instructor in the Medical Faculty of the University left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition was , not merely to do well the work which these different official positions entailed upon him , but also to build up , so far as in his power lay , a systematized knowledge of the relationship that subsists between the different pathological conditions revealed at the post-mortem examination and the clinical phenomena manifested during the patient 's lifetime . Therefore he was accustomed to insist that a reasonably full history of the case shouldbe submitted with every corpse on which he was asked to make a postmortem examination . This afterward became a firmly fixed // practice at the hospital . After he had read these casehistories and had compared them with the facts revealed by the corresponding autopsies he prepared , at proper intervals , a report on the diseases which were then prevalent at the hospital . This method of procedure , it will easily be seen , constituted an important advance beyond the practice of simply studying and then recording the various pathological lesions which develop in the different organs of the body . It established a connecting link between these lesions and the lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way in which the medical practitioner at the bedside might , by a proper use of his reasoning powers , infer from the symptoms and physical signs what changes were taking place in the unseen organs of the body . From this time forward , therefore , physicians began to place before their mental vision ? in every case which they were called upon to treat ? a picture of the anatomical changes that were taking place in the patient 's body , instead of symptom groups . In the words of that distinguished Tubingen physician , Wunderlich , " Rokitansky was endeavoring with untiring zeal to convert pathological anatomy into an anatomical pathology . " The reader will , I am confident , agree with me when I say that there are very few instances in the history of medicine where an advance toward a better knowledge of the art of diagnosis is more clearly revealed than in the work which Rokitansky carried on so patiently , so conscientiously and so successfully during the early years of the nineteenth century . Compare the record of the work accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it will be quickly appreciated how little fitted the former searcher after truth was to carry out successfully the advance which Rokitansky effected and which I have tried to describe in these pages . Rokitansky 's earliest contributions to medical literature consisted in quite a large number of memoirs which were published at different times in the " Medicinische Jahrbiicher des Oestreichischen Staates . " They deal with topics like the following : " Incarcerations and Intussusceptions of // the Intestines " ; " New Formations of Bone on the Internal Surface of the Skull in Pregnant Women " ; " Spontaneous Rupture of the Aorta " ; " So-called Duplication of the Uterus " ; " Strictures of the Intestinal Canal and Other Abnormal Conditions that give rise to Constipation and to Ileus " ; " Perforating Gastric Ulcer " ; " Contributions to our Knowledge of the Different Forms of the Curvature of the Spine " ; etc . Subsequently he published in three volumes his great work on Pathological Anatomy ; Vol. 3 appearing in 1842 and Vol. 2 in 1844 . These last two volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the series , which deals with general pathological anatomy , was not published until the year 1846 . In these volumes , which are rich in newly discovered facts , the author keeps constantly in mind the needs of the general practitioner ; and how great was the importance which he attached to this feature of his work may be inferred from the frequent reference which he makes to it in other parts of his writings . Thus , for example , in the Preface to Vol. 1 he says : " In regard to the manner in which I have planned and constructed the present treatise I will briefly remark : I have tried from the very beginning , and all through the work , to look at the subject from the viewpoint of the practicing physician , and I believe that , in adopting this course , I have accomplished a thing which was most urgently needed in our time ; and I also believe that I have utilized the gigantic mass of material that was at my disposal in a worthy manner . ' " Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The first attempt to treat the subject of pathological anatomy in the manner which I have just described , " ? an attempt , by the way , that was crowned with brilliant success , ? " was made by Laennec in his discussion of the subject of diseases of the chest . " In strong corroboration of Rokitansky 's belief in the importance of pathological anatomy stands the statement attributed to the celebrated anatomist Vesalius , to wit : " I am very sorry not to have devoted to pathological anatomy the large amount of time and strength which I spent on physiological anatomy . " // Rudolf Virchow calls Rokitansky the " Linnaeus of pathological anatomy . " It was my original intention to furnish at this point a few brief extracts from the original text of Rokitansky 's great treatise , in order that the reader might learn , from this pathologist 's own words , just how he managed to teach pathological anatomy in the manner best adapted to subserve the interests of the practitioner . After looking in vain , however , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that it would be better to abandon the attempt altogether and rest satisfied with a simple enumeration of the captions of some of the more important subsections that treat of alterations in bone . Here are those which I selected : " Bone Deficiency and Bone Excess " ; " Anomalies in Size and Shape " ; " Bone Atrophy " ; " Anomalies of Bone in its Connection with other Bones " ; " Anomalies in Consistence " ; " Break in Continuity and the Manner in which Healing Takes Place " ; " Callus Formation and New Joints " ; " Healing of Bone by First Intention " ; " Healing of Bone through the Medium of Suppuration " ; " Healing of Wounds in Bone with Loss . of Substance " ; " Inflammation of Bone " ; and " Bone Caries . " Not being specially interested in pathological anatomy I have read only small portions of the text of this celebrated treatise ; but , judging from this superficial examination and from the unanimous testimony given by men who are expert judges in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory answers will be found in this great work to nearly every question that may arise in a physician 's mind concerning the pathology of some part of the human body . It is a book , however , that is intended for reference purposes , and not for reading as one would read Trousseau 's work ; and this undoubtedly explains why , so far as I am able to discover , no English version of this treatise exists . I may here call attention to the fact that the first edition ( 1842-1846 ) of Rokitansky 's treatise contains no cuts , but that of 1855 is well furnished with illustrations . After Rokitansky had held for ten years the position of f // Professor Extraordinary of Pathological Anatomy in the University of Vienna he was promoted in 1844 to that of Ordinary Professor . As an evidence of Rokitansky 's popularity as a teacher I will mention the following fact . In my student days at the College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , my father , the late Dr. Gurdon Buck , frequently referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead-house instruction which he received from Rokitansky during his stay in Vienna ( about 1833 or 1834 ) . From the statement made by Prof. Alfred C. Post of New York , I learn that he and my father were Rokitansky 's first American pupils . Rokitansky 's death occurred in 1878 . JOSEPH HYRTL was born at Eisenstadt , Hungary , in 1811 . His father was a professional musician ( Capellmeister ) in the service of Prince Esterhazy . He received his medical training in Vienna , and in 1833 , while he was still only a student in the university , he was given . the appointment of Prosector in the Anatomical Institute . Two years later he received his doctor 's degree , and in 1837 he was chosen Professor of Anatomy at the University of Prague . According to Puschmann " Hyrtl handled his pen with the same skill as he did the scalpel , and also in his spoken lectures he manifested to a wonderful degree the gift of making dry facts interesting to his auditors , thus keeping them fascinated by his remarks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The remarkable manner in which the teaching in the Vienna Medical School increased in popularity at this period of its history was in no small degree due to the fact that Hyrtl had , a short time before ( in 1845 ) , been called to occupy the chair of anatomy in that institution . " In confirmation of Puschmann 's estimate of Hyrtl 's power to write entertainingly upon anatomical and physiological topics which are commonly classed as " dry " I will furnish here a few extracts from Hyrtl 's General Treatise on Anatomy . And , if the reader will pardon me for referring once more to my father 's interest in those who // played a part , either as teacher or as simple friend and companion , in his student life at Vienna , I will preface these extracts with the statement that , more than once in the early sixties , I surprised my father reading with evident pleasure , after the day 's work was over , this very treatise on anatomy . In his preface Hyrtl says : " A general treatise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this branch of the science of medicine , but should also inspire the students who read the book with a love for this science and the ambition to make original investigations . " Speaking about the behavior of an artery after it has been divided with the knife Hyrtl explains why , in the living body , the complete division of such a. blood-vessel produces a narrowing of the lumen at the point where it has been divided , whereas a similar division of the vessel , if carried out upon the dead body , results only in a retraction of the tube in the direction of its length ; in other words , in the corpse the diameter of the lumen remains unchanged as a result of such division . From these and other facts ( which he mentions , but which the lack of space compels me to omit ) Ilyrtl draws the inference that the contractility of the wall of an artery is a phenomenon that occurs only in the living vessel . Then he goes on to remark : Beginning at the point where the ligature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and below the site of the ligature , as far as to the spot where the next collateral branch is given off . At first this distortion of the vessel 's shape is due simply to the fact that its calibre is filled with clotted blood ( provisional obliteration ) . Later , a solid plug takes the place of the soft clot . It is composed of plastic material that , becoming fused with the clot ( thrombus ) , gradually undergoes organization and permanently attaches itself to the wall of the artery through actual growth of tissue ( definitive obliteration ) . Thus there is formed , as the final result of all these changes , a firm and solid cord the circumference of which is smaller than that of the artery from which it springs in direct continuity . The ligating of one of the larger arteries ? as , for example , the brachial or the crural artery ? does not interfere seriously with the circulation in the parts located below the point where the ligature // has been applied ; for the blood continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that it is obliged to travel through roundabout channels ( anastomoses ) .. . . I once owned a dog upon whom , in the days of my youthful sinning in the domain of physiological experimentation , I performed , within the short period of a single year , the operations of tying the innominate artery and both crural arteries ; and , notwithstanding the fact that the blood needed by the adjoining regions was thereby forced to travel to them by unaccustomed routes , the dog 's health did not seem to be in any way affected . Among the anatomical remarks which Hyrtl makes at various points in the course of his formal treatment of the subject under consideration I find several that seem to me to be worthy of reproduction here . In one place , for instance , he makes the statement that voluntary movements of the auricle of the ear are by no means a rare phenomenon , and in support of this statement he quotes Haller as mentioning ( " Elementa Physiologiae , " Tomus V. , p. 190 ) many instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albinus ( 1697-1770 ) , the greatest anatomist of the eighteenth centary and a colleague of Boerhaave at the University of Leyden , was in the habit of removing his wig whenever he wished to exhibit to the students how great was his control over the movements of the auricle of the ear . In another place Hyrtl calls attention to the not uncommon error of giving , to the structureless membrane which Descemet described in 1758 , the name of Membrana Descemetii . According to him it was first described by the Englishman E. Duddel , twenty-nine years earlier , in his " Disease of the Horny Coat of the Eye , " London , 1729 . In addition to his famous general treatise on anatomy , of which , in the course of 38 years , no fewer than 17 editions were printed , Hyrtl published in 1845 a memoir on the organ of hearing , and in 1860 a " Manual for the Use of Dissectors . " His death occurred in 1884 . CHAPTER XI BAGLIVI , MORGAGNI , SCARPA , SPALLANZANI , TISSOT AND GALVANT ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAGLIVI , the most distinguished Italian physician of the seventeenth century ( 1669-1707 ) , was probably the first medical author in that country to lay stress upon the importance of studying disease through direct observation rather than from books . In his treatise on the practice of medicine , which was first published in Latin at . Rome in 1696 and afterward translated into several modern languages ( London , 1704 ; Paris , 1757 ) , he makes the following remarks : There are several obstacles which have hitherto stood in the way of a more general adoption of the maxim that direct observation constitutes the best method of studying disease . They are the following : the widespread contempt for the authority of the physicians of antiquity ; the false opinions and prejudices to which men became attached as if they were idols ; the habit of making erroneous comparisons and of drawing hasty conclusions , as well as the formulating of analogies that are based upon untrustworthy reports ; reading books which have been unwisely chosen or reading without exercising a discerning judgment ; incorrect interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a system ; and the abandonment , by authors , of the habit of expressing their thoughts in the form of maxims . GIOVANNI BATTISTA MORGAGNI , one of the greatest anatomists of the eighteenth century and the prince of anatomopathologists , was born on February 25 , 1682 , at Forli , an Italian town situated about forty miles southeast of Bologna . The death of his father when the boy was only seven years old made it necessary for his mother to assume // entire control of his early education . She performed this duty so faithfully and with such excellent judgment that , by the time Giovanni had attained his fourteenth year , he was so thoroughly familiar with the literature of Italy , and also of European countries generally , that the Academy of Forli unhesitatingly accepted him as a member of that organization . Two years later Giovanni went to Bologna and began the study of medicine under the guidance of such distinguished teachers as Hyppolyte Albertini and Antonius Valsalva ; and three years later ( in 1701 ) he was given the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about his personal traits of character and about the manner in which he spent the larger part of his time during the early years of his professional career . His published writings , however , make it perfectly clear that almost from the very first his chief interest was centred in the study of anatomy as revealed to him by dissections of the dead human body ; and , as the years rolled past , he evidently grew more and more strongly interested in the changes which take place in the organs and tissues of the body as the result of accidental injuries and of disease . From these same writings one learns further that he was in the habit of writing down , with the most painstaking minuteness , all the various departures from the normal standard as fast as they revealed themselves to his critical vision . He left no opportunity for the occurrence of errors due to a defect in his memory . In 1706 he published a treatise bearing the title " Adversaria Anatomica . " It was this work which first laid the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Anatomy at the University of Padua , and he continued to hold this position up to the time of his death in 1771 . Relatively late in life ? that is , in 1767 ? he published his treatise " De Sedibus et Causis Morborum " ( on the seats and causes of different diseases ) . This work , says Rokitansky , stands for all time , notwithstanding its defects , as a monument in honor of its author , by reason of the great industry and perseverance which it displays , and because of // its wealth of detail , orderliness of arrangement , acuteness of reasoning , and excellence in the choice of methods , ? in short , because of its originality . Theophile Bonnet 's great work on the same subject ( " Sepulchretum " ) was published in 1700 , but , like its successor , its usefulness to-day is limited , at least in large measure , to that of a huge museum of pathological specimens . Rokitansky , of Vienna , was in reality the first anatomist who appreciated at its full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons in the theory and practice of medicine . LAZARUS SPALLANZANI was born in 1729 at Scandiano , a small town in the northeastern corner of the Apennines , about fourteen miles from Modena , Italy . At the age of fifteen he began to study physics , mathematics and philosophy at the University of Bologna , under the guidance of his relative , Laura Bassi , one of the most . distinguished members of the Faculty of the Bologna Institute of Science . At the same time he cultivated a knowledge of Greek , Latin and French , as well as of his native language . As his father was anxious to have him do so , he also studied jurisprudence for a certain length of time , but he abandoned this study when his father , who had been persuaded by Antonio Vallisnieri , Professor of Natural History at the University of Padua , that the lad was much better fitted to follow the career of a biologist than that of a jurist , gave his son full permission to adopt whatever line of studies best suited his tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted himself with increased zest to the study of mathematics and the dead and living languages . In 1754 the University of Reggio ? a town which is only a few miles distant from Scandiano ? elected him to the Chair of Logic , Mathematics and Greek ; and this position he continued to hold with credit to himself during the following six years ; and during this period he devoted all his leisure hours to the observation of Nature . In this way he was able to make a few discoveries concerning the animalcules that are found in infusions ; and it was not long before these discoveries attracted the attention of those distin94 THE DAWN OF MODERN MEDICINE guished Swiss naturalists ? von Haller , of Berne , and Bonnet , of Geneva . In 1760 Spallanzani was invited to occupy a chair in the University of Modena , and he taught in that institution for a period of eight years . During his term of office at this institution he published two memoirs ? one on the animal nature of microscopic animalculi , and a second on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of running water . In 1767 , the Empress Maria Theresa decided to render the University of Pavia more effective as a scientific institute , and with this purpose in view she established certain new professorships , and among the number one on natural history . As the first incumbent of this new chair she called ( in 1768 ) Spallanzani , who by this time had acquired a great reputation in the scientific world as a biologist . His extensive knowledge in a variety of departments was associated with a remarkable genius ; his methods were simple and easily understood , and ? to speak figuratively ? he took his auditors by the hand and led them to a clear understanding of the truth , or to the point where they could appreciate that the truth was not far distant and was certainly attainable in the near future . He possessed the art of interpreting Nature by her own methods , and by this art he was able to render wonderfully clear all the subjects with which he dealt in his lectures . All those who heard him speak gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space will not permit me to furnish more than a few details of the original investigations which he made at this period of his career . Although at first glance it may be thought that Spallanzani 's work had very little to do with the science of medicine , on closer examination it will be seen that a study of the vital processes in the lower forms of life ( which was Spallanzani 's chief occupation ) are largely the same as those which characterize the higher forms , and therefore ? since great difficulties attend the study of the same processes in man ? it is of the very greatest importance that the search for light on this subject should be conducted on the lower organisms , even on // the minute organisms which are found in stagnant water . Spallanzani was therefore engaged , in a very direct manner , in laying the foundations of the true science of medicine . Von Haller , the great Swiss pioneer in biology , was fully aware of this fact when he dedicated the fourth volume of his " Elementa Physiologiae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom credit is due for the fact that , although he had already explored the most minute and inaccessible of Nature 's pathways , he still sought to learn whether the existing limits of our knowledge of the truth might not be extended . ' In 1780 , during his residence at Pavia , Spallanzani pub lished two new volumes containing memoirs on vegetable and animal physiology . In one of these he discusses with great thoroughness the subject of digestion , and describes the difficult experiments which he made , largely upon birds , in order to ascertain the nature of this process . In this manner he ascertained that , in a very large number of animals ( insects excepted ) , digestion is effected by a juice or fluid which dissolves the alimentary substances that have been introduced into the stomach . " One is filled with ad miration , " ? says his biographer and friend , Jean Senebier , of Geneva , Switzerland , " as one peruses Spallanzani 's account of this series of experiments , and notices with what scrupulous care he formulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes of the phenom ena observed . " And yet , in 1786 , John Hunter , the dis tinguished English anatomist and biologist , published a memoir ( " Observations on Certain Points of the Animal Economy " ) in which he dissents ? somewhat sharply , says Senebier ? from these conclusions . In 1788 Spallanzani published his reply to the observations made by Hunter and in this he points out , " with a logic so clear and con vincing that it permits of no reply , " the errors of the Eng lish physiologist 's criticism . // In several other published memoirs Spallanzani deals with the problems of generation , the circulation of the blood , the respiration , etc . To this very brief and imperfect sketch of one of the greatest biologists of the eighteenth century , I will simply add the statement : His death occurred , after a brief illness , February 11 , 1799 . In the parish church of Scandiano there has been erected a magnificent mausoleum in honor of Spallanzani . ANTONIO SCARPA ( 1747-1832 ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his medical education at the University of Padua . He was particularly devoted to the study of anatomy , and , already in the second year of the course , he had made such progress that he was allowed to act as one of the prosectors . Morgagni , who was his teacher , became very much attached to him and did everything in his power to advance Scarpa 's interests . While he was still in the student stage of his career Scarpa went to Bologna and devoted himself for a few months to the cultivation of surgery . On his return to Padua he passed successfully the required examinations and was given the degree of Doctor of Medicine . Not long afterward he was called to fill the Chair of Anatomy and Surgery at the Medical School of Modena . After eight years of service in that institution he resigned and then visited France and England for the purpose of gaining further knowledge in those branches of medicine in which he was specially interested . In 1783 he accepted a call from the University of Pavia to occupy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twelve years . In the year 1796 , however , at the time when Pavia became a part of the newly founded Cisalpine Republic , Scarpa was asked to take the oath of allegiance to the new government , an oath which was required of all the functionaries of the university . Not being willing to do this he was obliged to resign his professorship . In 1805 , Napoleon , after being crowned King of Italy at Milan , passed through Pavia on his way back to Paris . On this occasion he asked to have the university // professors presented to him , and , failing to find Scarpa among those who attended the reception , he asked what had become of him , for his great reputation as an anatomist was well known to him . Then he learned how Scarpa had been compelled , by reason of his unwillingness to sign the oath , to resign his position in the university . " Well , " replied Napoleon , " what if he did refuse to take the oath , and what have political opinions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University and upon the country which I now govern , and I wish that he be restored to his former position . " He was accordingly restored to his professorship and during the following seven years ? that is , up to 1812 ? Scarpa continued his work of teaching anatomy and of conducting the surgical clinic . During the later years of his life he was a great sufferer from calculous nephritis and chronic disease of the urinary bladder , and these diseases finally caused his death on October 31 , 1832 . Dezeimeris , in his estimate of the part played by Scarpa in advancing the science of medicine , lays particular stress upon the following two things : first , lie was very active and persisted in his efforts to impress u on surgeons the importance of considering a knowledge 4f anatomy as affording the only safe and sure route to p ogress in the surgical art ; and , second , he furnished a number of beautiful examples that showed the necessity ; of throwing additional light upon the different di.sease'by the employment of demonstrations in topographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? aside from the value of the text ? chefs-d'oeuvre of iconography . ' Such , for example , are the following : " De Structura Fenestrae Rotundae Auris etc. , " Modena , 1772 ; " De Gangliis et Plexubus Nervorum , " Modena , 1779 ; " Anatomicae Disquisitiones de Auditu et 0lfactu , " Pavia , 1789 ; and " Opuscoli di Chirurgia , " Pavia , 1825-1832 , 3 vols . **26;286;TOOLONG TISSGT ( 1728 ) . The Tissots are of Italian origin . Alessandro Tissoni , the youngest son of one of the first families of Spoleto , accompanied // Prince Louis on his crusade to the Holy Land in 1147 , and , after escaping from the disasters incident to the siege of Damascus , he managed to regain his native land along with the forlorn remnants of Louis ' army . As he had joined the expedition contrary to the wishes of his parents he felt that it would not do for him to return to Spoleto . At first , therefore , he was a homeless wanderer in his own country . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms bequeathed to him all their property just before they died from their wounds ; and consequently one of his first cares , after he returned to Italy , was to gain possession of his legacies . In the case of one of the three men there was a sister living , and so ? partly from love and partly in order to escape any unpleasant legal complications ? Alessandro married her , and the couple took possession of the deceased brother 's landed property . Some of this property , it so happened , was located in Franche-Comte , near the present city of Besancon , and it was while he resided in this part of France ( 1152 ) that he changed his name to Tissot , thus putting an end to the possibility that his relatives in Spoleto would ever be able successfully to claim any part of his property . Samuel-Andre 's father , Pierre Tissot , a land surveyor who resided in Grancy , not far from Lausanne , entered his son 's name ( May 15 , 1741 ) at the Academy of Geneva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he received the degree of M.A. , and on the fourteenth of the following month of September he started on his journey to Montpellier where he was to study medicine . Four years later he passed all his examinations creditably and was given the degree of M.D. He chose Lausanne as his place of residence , and was successful , at the end of one year , in obtaining the position of Physician of the Poor . Early in 1745 he made the acquaintance of Albrecht von Haller , the celebrated physiologist of Berne , and about the same time he became deeply attached to Dr. Theodore Tronchin , a native of Geneva , but engaged in active practice at Paris . These two men were the most distinguished Swiss Physicians of that period . Eynard , Tissot 's biographer , says that up to the end of // his life he preferred to carry on his epistolary correspond-ence in Latin ; and yet at the same time he was the author of several medical treatises that were extremely popular . One of them in particular ( " L'Avis an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was translated , in the course of the next twenty-five years , into all the leading European languages . Strange as it may appear to us moderns , this book was not written originally for the general public , but only for the peasants of the Canton de Vaud , who were constantly falling victims to charlatans and itinerant quacks ; and yet the universities of Goettingen and Giessen recommended the work as proper reading matter for their students . In order to show the high degree of esteem in which Tissot was held by his fellow citizens of Lausanne , the authorities conferred on him the rights and privileges of citizenship " on account of his praiseworthy efforts to improve the condition of its inhabitants " ; and as , in the course of time , the limits of the city were extended , the name " Avenue Dr. Tissot " was bestowed on one of its finest residence streets . In 1765 Stanislas Augustus , King of Poland , invited Tis-sot to accept the office of First Physician of his Majesty at Warsaw . Although the invitation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to leave his beloved Lausanne . All sorts of influences were brought into play by the King to make him change his mind , but his resolution remained fixed . In his reply to the letter Tissot said : My first reason for declining your highly flattering offer is this : I am very much attached to my father and mother and to my uncle , who have brought me up from infancy with the tenderest care , and who , owing to their advanced age , are likely at any time to need my aid and advice , and who would be heartbroken if I were to go far away from them . My second reason consists in the sentiment that I am not in any way fitted to fill such a position with entire satisfaction to all the interests concerned , for it involves many important duties beside that of watching over your health ? as , for example , the superintendence of the different institutions in your kingdom which are devoted to the preservation of the health of // your subjects ; the duty of reporting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion of such new measures as are likely to remedy any such deficiencies ; the promotion of the efficiency of your schools of medicine , surgery , midwifery , pharmacy , etc. ; and , last of all , there is the important consideration that my position here in Lausanne is in every respect most satisfactory to me . Why , then , should I abandon these surroundings in which my life is most happy , for a position in which I might easily lose a large part of this happiness ? Notwithstanding Tissot 's decided refusal to accept the flattering offer made by King Stanislas , the latter did not give up all hope of persuading him eventually to accept the position of First Physician . Three times in succession , at short intervals , he sent him a renewal of the invitation , each time adding some fresh inducement in the hope of overcoming Tissot 's objections ; and , just as the latter had nearly made up his mind to yield to the King 's urgent request ? the death of his much-beloved uncle a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of his acceptance ? the ruling authorities of the Academy of Lausanne notified him that a Chair of Medicine had been created by them and . that he had been appointed its first occupant . Stanislas then at last recognized that he must definitely abandon his cherished project , and he accordingly sent a fine portrait of himself to Tissot , with a charming letter in which he said : I am truly afflicted by your decision , but I take comfort in the thought that probably my persistent efforts to bring you to Warsaw had something to do with hastening the decision of the Berne authorities to establish the Chair of Medicine at Lausanne for your benefit . I congratulate you on your good fortune and your compatriots on their having had the wisdom to appreciate the value of your services to Switzerland . I pray God , Monsieur Tissot , that He may have you in safe keeping . STANISLAS AUGUSTUS , KING Warsaw , March 5 , 1765 . Lausanne in 1765 , it should here be stated , still recognized the Bernese Government as its overlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it acquired entire independence . // In closing this brief account of Tissot 's correspondence with the King of Poland , I ought to add that it was largely through the intercession of Albrecht von Haller , the distinguished physiologist and himself a citizen of the Swiss metropolis , that the senators at Berne were induced to found a Chair of Medicine at Lausanne for the express purpose of preventing Tissot from leaving Switzerland . I also should state that Tissot himself was entirely ignorant at the time that von Haller had been instrumental in effecting the establishment of this new professorship at Lausanne . Here is an anecdote which is told by Lantier in his book " Les Voyageurs en Suisse . " While it relates only indirectly to Tissot it furnishes an amusing illustration of what may easily happen in the experience of any physician who has a large office practice : A certain Adolphe D. called at Tissot 's residence and rang the door bell . An elderly female servant , who opened the door , said that her master , the doctor , was not at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have come to consult him about some malady , I warn you that you will lose your money and have nothing to show for your trouble . For the past twenty years I have had a pain in my stomach , and the doctor has not been able to cure it . " Tissot , to whom I related the incident , joined me in a hearty laugh over the affair . In November , 1779 , Tissot was urged to visit Paris in company with his adopted son , who was studying medicine . Believing that the young student would be greatly benefited by such a visit to the French capital he at once decided to undertake the trip . But , very soon after his arrival in Paris , he discovered that he was to have no rest so long as he remained there . His celebrity brought him almost at once many people who wished to consult him about their ailments . Often , says his biographer , the Rue des Petits Augustins , where his temporary residence was located , was filled with a long line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to interview the great physician from Lausanne . This sort of medical practice was not at all to his taste ; and when he was not busy with professional work he was attending an endless series // of dinners and receptions . At the end of a few months he returned to Lausanne , and would have been well pleased to remain there permanently ; but he soon recognized that , in the interest of his adopted son , he should take up his residence in some German or Italian city where there was a university . Just at this juncture of affairs Borsieri , the distinguished Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine at the University of Pavia , Tuscany , a man well advanced in years , sent in his resignation . Whereupon Joseph II. , Holy Roman Emperor and King of Austria , immediately urged his brother Leopold II. , Duke of Tuscany , to offer the position to Dr. Tissot . The latter took the invitation seriously under consideration and in due course of time accepted . His honorarium was fixed at 3000 German florins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was accorded various important privileges ? such , for example , as a suitably furnished residence ; a ward equipped with six beds and arranged in such a manner that clinical instruction might be conveniently given in it ; and the right to carry on private practice in the district of Milan and also outside the limits of that district whenever this could be done without interfering with his duties at the university . Further , he was permitted to resign his chair at the end of two years if he should so desire . Finally , he was reimbursed for all his traveling expenses , and was absolved from attendance upon any functions or ceremonies that might conflict with his conscientious scruples as a Protestant . For a Government that was strictly under the control of the Roman Catholic Church these terms were remarkably liberal . Tissot appears to have been very successful , both as a teacher and in his social relations with the people whom he met during his short stay of two years at Pavia . In a letter which Spallanzani wrote on December 31 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva , he speaks of Tissot 's arrival at Pavia in the following terms : He seems to be pleased with our university , with our colleagues , and with our students . Everybody in Pavia likes him . His lectures are most instructive and well adapted to the character of our // young men who have come hither from every part of Italy to profit from the teaching of this Swiss Hippocrates . Apart from the knowledge which he possesses , and which certainly is very extensive , Monsieur Tissot is the most polished , the most amiable man I have ever met . It would be a pleasure to furnish here a resume of the detailed account which Tissot 's biographer gives of his lectures and of his most practical clinical instruction , but I perceive that I have already drawn out my sketch to an inordinate length , and I must therefore stop at this point . I will simply add one more item of information . Early in 1783 Tissot publicly announced his intention of resigning his professorship at the end of the period of service that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on June 12 of the same year , at which date the academic year ended , he delivered his farewell address to the students of the university . To perpetuate the memory of this occasion those students who were permanent residents of Pavia set up in one of the lecture rooms a suitably inscribed marble tablet ; those who came from other parts of Europe ( 72 in all ) prepared their memorial in the form of a small printed volume ( 104 pages ) of sonnets written in Latin , Greek , Italian , German , French and English , and grouped together under the title : Sentimenti d'Affetto e di Riconoscenza Degli Studenti di medicina Verso it Loro Immortale Precettore , it Signor S. A. D. Tissot . On the 21st of June , 1783 , in company with his nephew , Tissot left Pavia for Switzerland by way of the Simplon Pass . Already in 1794 his health began to show unmistakable signs of breaking down under the influence of a progressive pulmonary tuberculosis , and it was not long afterward that his death occurred ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALoYsIus GALVANI , born at Bologna , Italy , on September 9 , 1759 , and appointed public lecturer in anatomy at the university in 1762 , published in 1791 a treatise in which lie announced his discovery of a new force to which he gave the // name of animal electricity , but which subsequently received that of " galvanism " in honor of its discoverer , ? a name which it has retained ever since . By a mere accident Galvani discovered the fact that when two different metals ? iron and copper , for example ? are brought in contact with muscular tissue there results from this contact a force , seemingly an electric current , which causes the muscle to contract . Six years later ? that is , in 1797 ? the Cisalpine Republic was formed by the joining together of what were known as the Cispadane and the Transpadane Republics ? two political organizations that occupied respectively , as their names imply , territories situated the one on the north side and the other on the south side of the river Po , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon Bonaparte . When the professors of the University of Bologna , which was located in the Transpadane territory , were called upon to swear allegiance to the new republic , Galvani was the only member of the Faculty who refused to take the oath , and as a consequence he lost his professorship . His death occurred in 1798 . BOOK V SMALL-PDX , ONE OF THE WORLD 'S GREATEST SCOURGES CHAPTER XII MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE CONTROL OF SMALL-PDX I. INOCULATION About the year 922 of the present era the Arabian physician Rhazes wrote and published ( in MS. ) the earliest known report of the malady now called Variola or SmallPox . From this fact the inference should not be drawn that the disease first came into existence in the time of Rhazes , for it can scarcely be doubted that it had already existed in the East for ages before the period mentioned . Since the thirteenth century it has appeared repeatedly in epidemic form in widely separated countries , causing , especially among the eastern nations , a fearful mortality . Sydenham , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method of treatment that in some degree diminished the mortality of this affection , at least in Great Britain . It was , however , in no sense a preventive procedure , and the spread of small-pox continued unchecked until Jenner , in 1796 , introduced vaccination ; and even then the efficiency of this method was not promptly acknowledged by the Medical Profession ; indeed , several years had to elapse before even the best London physicians , the men who possessed the most complete facilities for ascertaining the whole truth with regard to Jenner and his new method , llecame convinced that a great and most efficacious protection against small-pox had at last been found . In the meantime ? that is , for almost half a century ? the procedure known as " inoculation " was accepted by the upper classes of the community in all parts of Europe as affording the maximum amount of protection attainable against the disease . // There were in Europe , during the last half of the eight eenth century , two physicians ? BARON THOMAS DIMSDALE , an Englishman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? who obtained considerable celebrity as inocula tors . The first-named , BARON THOMAS DIMSDALE , was born in 1712 and began to practice his profession in 1734 at Hert ford , twenty-four miles north of London . Already as early as in 1741 he had acquired so great a reputation for his success , both in performing the operation and in carrying the patient safely through the resulting infection , that is , through the attack of small-pox thus artificially produced , ? that he was sent for to inoculate first the Czarina of Russia , then the Grand Duke Paul , and subsequently the children of many of the first families of the Russian Empire . Shortly after his return to England he was made a member of the Royal Society , and at a still later date the city of Hertford chose him as their representative in the House of Commons . In 1781 , on the occasion of his second visit to Russia , he inoculated the Czar Alexander and the Grand Duke Constantine . His death occurred on December 30 , 1800 . Among Dimsdale 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive special men tion : " The Present Method of Inoculating for the Small-Pox , " London , 1766 , 1767 and 1772 ; " Thoughts on General and Partial Inoculation , " London , 1776 ; and " Account of a Voyage to Russia and Report of the Procedure Carried out in the Cases of Catherine and Paul . " Baron Dimsdale , it seems scarcely necessary to add , was not the inventor of the practice of inoculation but simply the individual who revived and made popular , first in England and afterward on the continent of Europe ( more particularly in Russia ) , a practice which long before had been employed in China . THEODORE TRONCHIN , the second inoculator mentioned above , was a native of Geneva , Switzerland , ' and was highly // esteemed in France as a practitioner of medicine during the period that is now under consideration ( 1750-1785 ) . Fur-thermore , it was widely known that he was the family physician of Louis Philippe , Duke of Orleans , as well as the medical adviser and intimate friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining popularity among the members of the fashionable set of Paris . It is therefore easy to understand why , when he espoused the cause of inoculation , he should have so rapidly attained celebrity as a successful inoculator , not only in Paris but also throughout Europe . On the other hand , it is not at all clear why the inoculation method should have been looked upon with any favor by the educated classes , for it soon became increasingly evident that the operation was attended with considerable risk through the danger of introducing other infective agents into the system ; and , in addition , no satisfactory evidence was forthcoming that these inocula-tions possessed the slightest degree of genuine protective power . To-day we are unable to discover in this procedure any other advantages than the following : The patient is thereby enabled to select the time when , and the surround-ings in which , he or she will submit to an attack of small-pox ; for , it must be remembered , no well-grounded hope was held out by the inoculators of the eighteenth century that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is acquired accidentally . And yet some such hope was apparently cherished by the people of that period , for Benjamin Franklin , writing in 1788 , makes the following remark in relation to this very question : In 1736 I lost one of my sons , a fine boy of four years old , by the small-pox , taken in the common way . I long regretted bitterly , and still regret , that I had not given it to him by inoculation . This I mention fox the sake of parents who omit that operation , on the supposition that they never should forgive themselves if a child died under it ; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way , and that , therefore , the safer should be chosen . These bitter regrets expressed by Franklin show plainly // that he , like others of his time , had strong confidence in the efficiency of inoculation . II . VACCINATION EDWARD JENNER , the discoverer of vaccination as an effective means of protection against small-pox , was born at Berkeley , Gloucestershire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of his parents while he was still a mere child , Edward passed under the guardianship of his eldest brother , the Rev. Stephen Jenner , and was brought up by him with affectionate care and judicious guidance . At a very early age he showed a decided taste for natural history ; and after leaving school he began to receive instruction in the elements of surgery and pharmacy from a Mr. Ludlow , an eminent surgeon of Sodbury , near Bristol . As the next step in his education he spent two years under the direction of the celebrated experimental pathologist , John Hunter , of London , in whose family he resided for two years . He was about twenty-one years of age when he went to London . Already at this early period he showed unmistakable evidences of being a close observer , scrupulous and accurate in his examination of the objects of his studies . He was also gifted with much enterprise and perseverance , characteristics which greatly aided him in mastering difficulties that would have seriously obstructed the progress of an individual possessing an inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the prime of life , completely won the affection and respect of his pupil , who particularly admired the boldness and independence of his teacher 's character . Jenner was peculiarly alive to virtues of this kind . After completing his professional studies in London he retired from Hunter 's house , but the intimate relations which had been established between these two men persisted up to the time of the latter 's death in October , 1793 . Immediately after his return from London Jenner took up his residence with his brother Stephen , at Berkeley , and began his career as a practitioner of medicine . At the same time , as opportunity afforded , he continued to pursue his favorite studies in natural history . Thus , in a comparaTHE // tively short period of time , he accumulated a series of specimens illustrative of comparative anatomy , and sufficiently numerous to form a museum of no inconsiderable magnitude . In describing the manner in which Jenner 's attention was first seriously directed to the subject of cow-pox Dr. Baron , his biographer , uses the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of his master at Sodbury ; a young country-woman came to seek advice ; the subject of small-pox was mentioned in her presence ; she immediately observed , " I can not take that disease , for I have had cow-pox . " This incident riveted the attention of Jenner . It was the first time that the popular notion , which was not at all uncommon in the district , had been brought home to him with force and influence . Most happily the impression which was then made was never effaced . Young as he was , and insufficiently acquainted with any of the laws of physiology or pathology , he dwelt with deep interest on the communication which had been casually made known to him by a peasant , and partly foresaw the vast consequences which were involved in so remarkable a phenomenon . He was the more stimulated to meditations of this sort by frequent opportunities of witnessing the ravages of small-pox ; and by retaining the most vivid and painful recollections of the severe discipline which he himself had not long before passed through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " ? to use his own words ? " bleeding till the blood was thin ; purging till the body was wasted to a skeleton ; and starving on vegetable diet to keep it so . " The possibility of averting such evils could not arise in a mind like Jenner 's without possessing it fully ; and he resolved to let no opportunity escape of acquiring knowledge on so important a subject . . . . It was not till some years after his return from London that he had an opportunity of examining into the truth of the traditions respecting cow-pox . This was about the year 1775 , a date which corresponds with the period specified IT him in his tract on " The Origin of Vaccine Inoculation . " Although during the following five years Jenner 's efforts to learn the full truth about cow-pox brought him very little nearer the goal which he was aiming to reach , he nevertheless pursued with zeal and vigor his studies concerning the nature of this disease and concerning its relations to // small-pox . Among the facts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention here : ( 1 ) There are several different diseases to which milkers are liable when they handle infected cows ; but ( 2 ) only one of them possesses the power of furnishing protection against small-pox . The discovery of these facts made it easy to understand why vaccination with the virus of what was commonly called cow-pox not infrequently failed to protect the individual so vaccinated from genuine small-pox . As a result of still further investigations Jenner felt warranted in drawing the conclusion that small-pox , cowpox and swine-pox had a common origin , ? in fact , were varieties of the same disease . Dr. Baron mentions the following incidents or experiences as affording a strong corroboration of the truth of the statements - just made : In November , 1789 , Jenner inoculated his eldest son Edward , who was then about one year and a half old , with swine-pox matter . The progress of the disease seemed similar to that which arises from the insertion of true small-pox matter when the disease is very slight . He sickened on the eighth day ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their progress and small . Subsequently , at five or six different periods , variolous matter was carefully inserted into his arms without the slightest inflammation being excited in the part . On April 7 , 1791 , variolous matter was again inserted by two small incisions through the cutis . April 9 , parts evidently inflamed . April 10 , an efflorescence of the size of a shilling spread around the inferior wound . April 11 , the incision assumed a kind of erysipelatous elevation ; the efflorescence much increased . April 12 , still further increase in the efflorescence ; a vesicle about the size of a large split pea , and containing a brownish clear fluid , had also formed close to the superior incision ; and a still larger one was visible near the edge of the inferior incision . The erysipelas extended to the shoulder and then quickly subsided . The child showed no signs of indisposition the whole time . In March , 1792 , a fresh inoculation was made . A well-marked inflammatory reaction followed . At a later date Jenner learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow-pox broke out among // cattle at a dairy and was communicated to the milkers , even they had subsequently contracted small-pox . The discovery of this fact perplexed him greatly . Indeed , in the case of most men the discovery would probably have led to the abandonment of all further experimentation . But Jenner did not allow himself to be discouraged . It occurred to him that the virus of the cow-pox itself might have undergone some change whereby its specific virtues were lost ; that , in this deteriorated state , it might have been capable of producing only a local disease upon the hand , but no such influence upon the constitution as is requisite to render the individual unsusceptible of contracting small-pox . In other words , he believed it possible that the same cow might one day communicate a genuine and efficacious preventive , and , the next , nothing but a local affection that would exert no beneficial influence whatever on the constitution . This most ingenious and forcible reasoning , supported by analogies drawn from the well-known properties of the virus of small-pox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the basis on which some of the fundamental rules for the practice of vaccination were founded . It was ascertained that it was only in a certain state of the pustule that virus was afforded capable of imparting to the constitution its protecting power ; that matter taken after this period might excite a local disease , but not of such a sort as to render the individual proof against the effects of variolous contagion . In 1796 Jenner had an opportunity to carry his investigations a step further . " Hitherto , " says his biographer , " he had only observed the casual disease and investigated its laws ; it yet remained to be proved whether it was possible to propagate the affection by artificial inoculation from one human being to another , and thereby , at will , communicate security to all who were liable to small-pox . An opportunity occurred , on the fourteenth of May , 1796 , of instituting this experiment . Matter was taken from the hand of Sarah Nelmes who had been infected by her master 's cows , and inserted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy boy eight years old . He went through the disease apparently in a regular and satisfactory manner ; but the most agitating part of the trial still remained to be performed . It was needful to ascertain whether he was secure from the contagion of small-pox . This point , so full of anxiety to Dr. Jenner , was fairly put to issue on the first of the following July . Variolous matter , immediately // taken from a pustule , was carefully inserted by several incisions , but no disease followed . " Shortly afterward Jenner wrote to his friend Gardner You will be gratified in hearing that I have at length accomplished what I have been so long waiting for , viz. , the passing of the vaccine virus ( the virus of cow-pox ) from one human being to another by the ordinary mode of inoculation . . . . I was astonished at the close resemblance of the pustules , in some of their stages , to the variolous pustules . But now listen to the most delightful part of my story . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I ventured to predict , produced no effect . I shall now pursue my experiments with redoubled ardor . My readers can easily imagine with what deep anxiety mingled with an intense desire for a completely successful result , Jenner , from this time forward , prosecuted his labors . Unfortunately , he was not able , owing to the disappearance of cow-pox from the dairies of the region in which he lived , to resume his experimental work before the spring of 1798 . He was also not willing to make a public announcement of the important results which he had obtained until he should have amply confirmed their accuracy by further experimentation . It was therefore not until during the early part of the summer of 1798 that he issued a printed pamphlet of a little more than seventy pages , in the quarto form , and bearing the title " An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae . " On April 24 , 1798 , about two months before the publication of his pamphlet , Jenner repaired to London for the purposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of his assertions . Although he remained in the metropolis nearly three months he was unable to procure a single person on whom he could exhibit the vaccine disease . Some of the cow-pox virus which Jenner carried with him was consigned to Mr. Cline , a London physician , who , toward the end of July , inserted it by two punctures into the hip of a child . A few days later he reported that " the cow-pox experiment had succeeded admirably . " As happens in practically every important discovery in // therapeutics , there arose soon in many quarters serious doubts as to the prophylactic powers of the method advocated by Jenner . Some men even went so far as to question the accuracy of his statements and to impugn his authority to advocate the practice of vaccination . On the other hand , there were many , and they too of the most learned and respectable , who immediately did justice to the merits of Jenner , and who cordially acknowledged the many important consequences which were involved in the subject that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter which Jenner wrote to one of his friends only a few weeks after he had published the " Inquiry " it appears that already at that early date he foresaw the probability that there would occur , in the further evolution of vaccination as a prophylactic measure , those very complications which , from that time to the present , have interfered so seriously with the universal acceptance of this procedure as a measure of vast beneficence to the human race . These so-called complications were , in the great majority of instances , manifestations of septic infection , brought about by carelessness in the handling of the inoculation wound ; but this fact was not at all appreciated in Jenner 's time . During the years immediately following that in which the discovery of the new procedure was announced to the physicians of England vaccination made fairly rapid progress in public favor . Already as early as in June , 1800 , Jenner , while on a visit to Oxford , was there presented , by the leading physicians of that city , with a testimonial in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the small-pox. , Two years later the English Parliament voted Jenner a grant of ? 10,000 as a reward for the very valuable discovery which he had made and for his prolonged labors in rendering the procedure of great utility to the public . Strange as it may appear to those who are not familiar with the lives of the most meritorious and most unselfish physicians of bygone centuries this bestowal of ? 10,000 by Parliament upon Jenner did not add materially to his comfort ; in the long run it rather detracted from it . Some of // his friends , shortly after he had received the Parliamentary grant of money , induced him to give up his country practice and establish himself in the fashionable part of London ; they maintained that his widespread reputation as the discoverer of vaccination and as the physician most capable of conducting this operation in the safest and most effective manner , would speedily bring him a large increase in private practice . Such , however , did not prove to be the case ; and Jenner ? who , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lapse of three or four years , and appreciating the fact that his income was not large enough for such a style of living , removed his residence , first to Cheltenham and not long afterward to Berkeley . He died of cerebral apoplexy in the spring of 1823 . A medal commemorating the discovery of vaccination is pictured in the figure which faces page 108 . BOOK VI AWAKENING OF THE CHEMISTS , PHYSIOLOGISTS AND PATHOLOGISTS CHAPTER XIII THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH CHEMISTS CONTRIB-UTE THEIR SHARE TOWARD THE ADVANCE OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE During the latter part of the eighteenth century the chem-ists of England and France manifested a new and decidedly stronger interest in their branch of natural science ; indeed , they seemed to have suddenly appreciated the fact that observation and experience afforded the only route by which they might secure a genuine and useful increase of their stock of knowledge . In the departments of physiology and pathology , for exarnple , ? not to mention also that of thera-peutics , ? there were at that period many questions which still remained unsettled and which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the existing knowledge of chemistry . Hence the great importance of the movement to which I have just referred . To cite only one of these unsettled questions I will mention here that relating to the nature of the change which occurs in the blood when it loses its venous hue after passing through the lungs , and also , vice versa , when it loses its arterial color after passing through the tissues in other parts of the body . Harvey 's discovery had gone no further than to reveal the pathway of the blood in its winding course throughout the , body , but now physiology demanded an explanation of the changes which this fluid undergoes in its travels along that pathway . The answer to this last question , as will now be shown , was not gained through the efforts of a single individual but by the researches that were made by several very able English and French scientists , more particularly by Joseph : Priestley , the English chemist , and by Lavoisier , the French biologist and chemist . During the preceding fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
