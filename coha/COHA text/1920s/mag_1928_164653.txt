One day last week the front page of the New York Herald Tribune , prominent G.O.P. elephant-hide-bound organ , bore the following headline : <P> CRIPPLED BOY 'S DEER IS SEIZED FOR SMITH ZOO <P> The next " deck " of the headline said : <P> Conservation Board Accused of Taking Fawn from Child to Make Nomination Fete Gift . <P> The last , least conspicuous part of the headline explained : <P> Parent , Saying Son Weeps for Pet , Sure Governor Had No Part in Action . <P> Non-partisans , recalling that the Herald Tribune had printed something sportsmanlike about Nominee Smith the week previous ( TIME , July 9 ) , concluded that now the score was evened . Facts of the **40;12896;TOOLONG story were these : <P> The Herald Tribune had not only the parent 's belief , but Governor Smith 's secretary 's word , that Governor Smith knew nothing of the case . <P> Not the Conservation Board of New York State , collectively , but its chief game protector , one Llewellyn Legge , and an underling inspector named Morgan Leland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Mr. Legge is a Republican . <P> Legge and Leland did not know there was a crippled child involved . <P> Their obvious intent was to please their Governor . The obvious intent of the Herald Tribune 's headline was to blackguard him . <P> When Governor Smith heard what happened , he said : " If the Conservation Department has taken that spotted fawn which he had named First Ballot from a crippled boy , I 'll send it back to him so quickly , you wo n't see it for dust . Yes , I 'll send him back another one with it and a dog if he wants it . "
