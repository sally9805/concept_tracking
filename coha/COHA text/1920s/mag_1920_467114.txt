Englishman who had been living at San Remo , but was about going to live at Monte Carlo , urged me to go , too , because of the pleasure , if not always profit , of the gaming-tables , and the prevailing gaiety of the place . " And then , " he added , " there 's a very nice little church . " I suppose he meant an English church , but I did not think it necessary to note that there was a very nice little church of that communion at San Remo , and that we had just opened a casino where you could enjoy the risk of as much as five francs at a roulette-table , where I saw , among other people , mothers with babes in their arms the first night , lending the risk a domestic charm . Many nights after that , when the manager came into his flat over ours in the same villa , at twelve or one o'clock , he broke my sleep by rolling a wooden ball for his dog to play with on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaming kept on at the Casino , and I thought the manager might have had a bad conscience from it which he was trying to ease , but I have no proof of the fact ; he may have been merely trying to relieve a nervous strain . We had opera as well as gaming at the Casino , and I went the first night ; but I much preferred going to the Teatro Principe Umberto , a vast , kind , old barn , which I had almost to myself in ? one of some rather Spartan fauteuils , which I paid two francs for and was shown to by what seemed the whole force of ushers . I never would put these to shame by looking round to see how nearly I was the whole house ; and in fact the playing was so good that I did not wish to take my eyes from the stage . I saw several of the best modern plays CXL. ? No. sal. - 41 and the very last of Ibsen 's plays , which was not one of his best . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a thrilling moment when a bolt of conscience which was visibly shot from the breast of the protagonist , but as realized by the mechanician of the theater had the effect of a squib such as I have seen fired through the air of a Fourth-of-July night . Well toward midnight I used to enact the part of crowding my way out of the theater , and I walked home a mile or so in clean , wide , empty streets , past many of the little foot-and-hoof-ways of the Old Town , climbing the mountain-side from the sea and staying its house walls against the earthquakes with duplicate and triplicate arches . These alleys were all as silent as the modern street , though not noticeably lonelier ; but I preferred the modern street , where I had no company except my thoughts of the plays I had seen , yet I left it gladly enough when I reached the lane winding up to our villa , which I knew in any dark by the pepper-tree in white bloom , waving me a fragrant good night from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many centuries I traversed in crossing those foot-andhoof-ways , but I will let the reader think as many before the Christian era as he likes . It once took a town many years to grow a population of twenty or thirty thousand , though towns do it very quickly now , when they begin far enough west . By day , I could have got as far down as one of the early eighteen-sixties , by help of the electioneering cry of " Votate Mombello , " inscribed upon the sidewalk in behalf of the Socialist candidate who had just been chosen our mayor , fifteen hundred years after a Genoese bishop had notedly died in San Remo soon after the Saracens had destroyed the town . His election might attest our extreme modernity , though I do not suppose it expressed more than a mood of the native population , from whom the large contingent of consumptives from England and Germany was separated by a wide neutral zone . The English invalids lived at the western end of the great range of hotels and the Germans at the eastern end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Town held itself against the earthquakes by those arches binding their walls together . The election of a Socialist syndic might have been supposed to attest extreme civic opinions in the people , but I do not know that it did . I had the pleasure of making Signor Mombello 's acquaintance , and I found him a very matter-of-fact citizen , a banker by business , and disposed to regard himself as not at all phenomenal . When I spoke of my friend Bellamy and his book , Looking Backward ( which I liked less than him , though it was noble-minded , too ) , he said , dryly , though kindly , " Bei sogni , bei sogni , " and passed from the question of those fair visions to more practical phases of socialism . He did not approve of the universal strikes then occurring in Italy ; they alienated the " little bourgeoisie , " and Signor Mombello otherwise evinced himself a true politician . But the citizens of the Old Town scarcely form a majority of the population of San Remo in the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , through those miserable centuries which the Pirate State of Algiers rose to power and held the Christian world of the Mediterranean in terror , ravaging all its shores , Italian , Spanish , French , and once , so late as 1631 , landing two corsair crews as far off as Ireland , where they sacked a town , and carried off many of its people into slavery . The unwarlike little city was the frequent prey of these sea-vultures ; and it is not impossible that these continued their ravages well toward that early decade of the century when the bold Stephen Decatur of our own navy attacked the pirate capital and destroyed its fleet under the defenses of its harbor . The state itself was not destroyed till 1830 , when the French took the city and ended its Long tale of atrocity . Up to that time the great European powers continued to pay tribute to save their people from captivity , but our doughty young Republic refused to do so after Decatur 's victory . It is a shameful passage of history , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness of the great Cervantes , who was five years a slave in Algiers , how the Mohammedan masters of the Christian captives made them suffer every cruel punishment of chains and stripes , with impalement and crucifixion as frequent forms of the death inflicted . The winter sojourner at San Remo will not think of such things , in his villa or hotel in either of the beautiful suburbs at the west or eastern borders of the little town which climbs the Alpine foothills , with its narrow ways , but he may easily fancy the innumerable forays of the Algerian corsairs , robbing and killing , and carrying off to their abominable metropolis the miserable men , women , and children of the ravaged homes . The present invaders who have brought the world 's affliction to San Remo have not swept overseas from African coasts , but have descended from every northern land with the infection of their white plague by every luxurious means of travel to the beautiful villas and stately hotels of the New Town . The purest air of their own winters , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more modern refuge of such sufferers , but the soft climates of the South are still the consumptives ' insidious hope , and one saw them in the pleasances and palm-sheltered paths beside the drives and public gardens and heard them feebly coughing their lives away . Others fought for their lives on as much the terms of the fight in the pure northern cold as they could make with their southern conditioning . I met , on every day that seemed to find him victor , our brilliant young American novelist , Harry Harland , who had escaped from the winter of his beloved England , and always found him full of the American gaiety , which is unknown to all the other world , and of the temperamental humor of his fiction . The condition of his convalescing , which preluded his final relapse , was that each of his bright , brief days must end before sunset , when the cold of the Alps , which stores the winter away from the Riviera , began to steal down upon San Remo . Then he kindled the fire laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed . As the time passed , this condition was lifted , and he began to go into the pleasant society of the place , almost wholly English , but mixed with Amer .. icans Italianate by intermarriage with Genoese families as old as the land itself . Apart from society , you were quite dependent upon nature for the pleasure which the arts so richly supply elsewhere in Italy . It was strange to be in Italy , and have no painting or sculpture and little architecture of note . There was one sixteenth-century palace in the Old Town , which the handbooks justly invite the traveler to view , and there is a church which I must have visited , but I can not make so sure of this as of the votive chapel on the heights far to the eastward which had a very touching appeal in the waxen symbols covering its walls to commemorate the afflictions alleviated by its patron saint . There were not only the waxen arms and legs , hands , and hearts which incrust the walls of other votive chapels , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorated the peril and rescue of the seafaring worshipers . Some of the saint 's miracles must have been wrought in sight of the chapel , and all were of the experience of the mariners whose homes looked out upon the perilous rocks and waves he had saved them from . The attractions of San Remo were its climate and its society , and the society was the better for being almost entirely English , as the climate was the better for not being at all so . Once , indeed , the weather , if not the climate , was worse than the worst . English weather I have known . On the afternoon before New-Year 's , while I was still going about in my summer gear , the soft wind that blew so hillingly from the southeast was preparing an act of stiletto treachery worthy of the Italian tradition of melodrama . The cold fell with the dark , and when the sun rose it shone upon our world of flowers frozen stiff . The icicles hung a foot long from the spouts of a neighbor 's drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze ; the bananas shrank in the wilted blades that clung about their stalks in rags and tatters , and the fans of the palms along the promenades clashed dryly against one another . It was a fortnight before Nature began to trick her beams , and to smile on the visitors from the north in the advertised promise of the region . Then the climate sometimes proved everything that the weather of our first months promised . There was a sky of a blue so liquid that it seemed as if you might dip it in your hand ; and at the horizon the sky melted into the sea , where the fishermen 's boats hung like things in a dream . I will not characterize the fisheries of San Remo as one of its industries , but I suppose they were as much so as the culture of the pinks and roses or of the fruits which we knew only in the oranges . Perhaps the fish caught were mostly sent to distant markets . I only know that the hotels exhausted the supply of our own so early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sardines , which are better for having been canned in olive-oil and eaten far from their native sea at American picnics . The fishermen 's craft were not so numerous in their picturesqueness as to be in the way of the Hamburg-American steamers which seemed always sailing to Genoa and probably began their voyage from Marseilles . There was every day a sunset in the east , and a sunset in the west whose coloring defies my ink . It was a French sunset , and only French art could impart a sense of it . In the retrospect it seems to me that we had one of those sunsets every evening , but I suppose that there was now and then a clouded evening . What plainer or simpler industries , such as other places practise for a living , remain to San Remo from her tragical past the encyclopedias and handbooks do not now remind me of , if I ever knew them ; but there are sources of livelihood , a gentler and gracefuller sort , peculiar to her present . Oranges and olives abound everywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but if it comes to those fields of pinks and roses , harvested throughout the winter months and sent to the capitals of the north , one has something native , if not exclusively characteristic . I have never seen fields of pinks and roses elsewhere , though they may be grown in Florida or California , and the sight of them is a little incredible , though they are matter-of-fact enough , I suppose , in having their markets like other agricultural products . I can not say they are very impressive ; they do not seem quite in earnest , like wheat and corn , and not even like grapes , where these are grown for wine . To be quite frank , I will own to a greater surprise in the excavation of an olive-tree than in the sight of the largest fields of pinks or roses . Excavation , I say , for when they cut down an olive-tree in San Remo they also dig it up , going to the bottommost roots of it , which they burn , as well as the uppermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished lodgings . The olive roots burn very well , in a soft , persevering sort , something like turf , or something more like coke , till nothing remains of them . The climate , it must be owned , is open to specific criticism , not only for its fifteenth-yearly excess of frost , but for its far more frequent droughts . Wearrived in a dash of rain , the first in eighteen months of drought , and this shower broke the drought , which began again and lasted through our winter . From first to last the dry beds of the torrents which in other seasons must roar down the steeps of the Old Town under the picturesque culverts , were without a dream of moisture . But the drought seemed not to matter to the rustic year of the region . When I went to Taggia to revere the home of the patriot R.uffini ( who wrote Doctor Antonio , one of the most delightful novels ever written in English , and who was chief of those wonderful Italians who wrote at will in his native or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fields were dry clods that looked like lumps of iron-ore ; but the potatoes seemed not to mind that . They had come duly up from earlier planting , and would no doubt come from that I saw ; but I suppose agriculture was not so much the strong point of the region as horticulture . When I began taking my walks on the Berigo Road in the autumn , I looked down on many peach-orchards still in the crimson foliage of the season and as many orchards of persimmons . The guide-books assure one that the great crop of the region is olives , but my memory perversely refuses a sense of their profusion . Perhaps the illimitable olive-forests of Andalusia , seen later , now blot the infinitely scantier olive-groves of the Riviera , or perhaps I racall from personal knowledge only the scattered instances of olive-trees growing near San . Remo , where they seemed to be fertilized by felt hats and old boots , as if these formed their favorite nurture . They may have been wild olives , but wild violets , when the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounded in the open air all the winter through , and overhung the villa walls on the Berigo Road in bloom unbroken by any relapse after the savage frost of New-Year 's . For the most part the weather was often charming after the return to its constitutional mildness , though the coughing continued from the walks and benches of the public gardens and the approaches of those hotels which the invalids were supposed never to reach . The hotels seemed to me all very uncommonly good , whether cheap or dear ; but they were all bad in their want of public warmth . If they had central heating , as it was called , their fires fell with the closing day , when they were most needed ; and then people had to make the best of the hearth-fires , or the oil-stoves in their rooms . There was no household warmth of the American quality that I knew of , and I do not believe there was one hot-air furnace in the whole place . In all this am I giving the impression of rather frequent cold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The truth is it was oftener cold than , warm there , and for mildness the climate was not comparable to that of Florida , from St. Augustine down ; it was not as soft as that of Savannah , or even Charleston . There was one amiable American family very generous of their hearth-fires ; but I must not . invade their privacy so far as to quote their opinion of the climate . No scruple , however , need withhold me from the impression of a public character who visited us in a professional character . He was an adoptive citizen from Chicago , and he made a brief stay in a tent on one of the quays where he was advertised to appear in the full uniform of an American major-general . It was long before the time of the khaki which has reduced all military ranks to one effect of simplicity , but I was struck . by the extreme modesty of an American majorgene7al 's uniform as it appeared on the vast person of this citizen . He was eight feet high , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast bulk ? three epaulets on each shoulder would not have been sufficient for the effect of one on the person of a major-general of the normal size , and his sword-belt , which the head of the average spectator scarcely topped , was of almost unnoticeable splendor . For a giant he was by no means forbidding in his manner ; he talked freely , and even amiably , on the topics usual among strangers , such as their respective healths and personal impressions and experiences , but when asked how he liked the climate , he said , " Well . I do n't think much of ut ! ' I did not always think much of it myself . Sometimes I blamed it for being too cold , and very often for being too dusty , but I never had to criticize it for being too rainy . There were moments when I thought I preferred Bordighera , or some other point on the Riviera , but upon serious reflection I am very content to have passed my winger in San Remo . At least I never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I was often seeing interesting people among the residents or sojourners , but quite the most interesting and important Englishman I met was the great physiologist , Sir Michael Foster , whose judgments of life I found so sane and clear , SJ frank and just . He came to San Remo twice during the winter , and once I walked up the hills back of the Berigo Road by one of those paths which climb the lower Alps . It was in the lovely weather before Christmas , and we had the joyous company of his two little grandsons , who ran before us barefoot . A month or so later we trudged in the snow up through a lonely village which struck me as one of the gloomiest abodes of men I had ever seen . It was so secret , so mute , so remote , there within rifle-shot of those smiling hotels and villas , that if one had some black regret , some unpardonable sin on his soul , he could not hide it better than in one of those bleak stone huts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great brooding Alpine horror never oppressed me more than in this bleak solitude . I do not remember the name of it , but if I should sometime meet a miserable man who needed such a refuge , I think I could recall it for his sake . Probably it thawed out from time to time , but it had an effect of perpetuity , of " aged snow " like that of the " silent pinnacles " in The Lotus Eaters , and of a grim derision of the mock-summer of the sea below . Society in San Remo was distinctly English , as it always is where the English stay long enough to implant their national manners and customs in the alien circumstance . They had their lunches and teas in their friendly villas and hotels ; I suppose they chiefly sustained the tennis and golf of the Sports Club ; and , above all , they had an admirable lending library which the ladies daily managed in turn , and kept supplied with the best books which were not necessarily the newest . It was open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shelves himself , and take his choice among the books to the desk where the managing lady for the day recorded its title with his address . It was in the enjoyment of this hospitality that I made the acquaintance of the Austrian princess , who was not less simply useful in her turn than the others . She was by race one of the princely families whom Napoleon had mediatized in his rearrangement of his conquests , depriving them of their sovereign rule , but leaving them in the enjoyment of their sovereign revenue . One saw her at the teas and lunches of others , where she was quietly equal with the rest , and she gave lunches of her own at her hotel , where no form but that of democratic society was observed , and the talk was of literature and the other real human interests . Sometimes one met her unaccompanied on the paths climbing to the Berigo Road , when she stopped for a moment 's chat and then passed on her way , not sovereignly staying or urging the parting except as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her lost state that was worth keeping , in the society where she surpassed only in the qualities of mind spirit which distinguished her . She was a very memorable presence on the sort of grand stand in the little piazza reviewing the procession of the carnival , which was better at San Remo than I ever saw it elsewhere in Italy . It went by in all the terms of grotesque and burlesque , and people from their different vantages threw little bunches of violets into the floats and out of them . Poverty was there as well as jollity , and I recall one poor man with a tray of flowers which he vainly challenged the imaginably prosperous to buy , or offer to buy . At last some one offered him , perhaps in joke , two francs , and he gave a wild cry of , " Oh , my God ! " and plunged through the procession to the bidder where he stood on the other side , and thrust the flowers on him with the effect of escape from the direst need . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , as the behavior of one of the masks was an effect of the wildest carnival comedy . He wore a Mother Hubbard wrapper and sun-bonnet , and as he passed a very dignified young lady among the onlookers , he leaned over and drew his hand under her chin , with the salutation , " Alt , be/la piccolo ! " ( " Ah , pretty little one ! " ) and kept serenely on his way , as if it were a natural incident of daily life . Most of the masks seemed to be in carriages , and I have the impression that the affair was largely under English management , as most other social events were in San Remo . There was no mingling of the English society at the west end of San Remo with the German society of the east end , though it was ten years before the war that sealed their natural enmity in blood . Outwardly the German quarter was as handsome as the English in its hotels and villas ; it was of even greater beauty in the many pergolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then still pathetic from the beginning of the long death-agony of the good Emperor Frederick , which ended on the throne at Berlin . The street is the highway to Bussana , a village destroyed by the earthquake of 1887 , when the arches staying the house-walls of San Remo hardly saved the Old Town . Bussana was a rustic mountain town , stone - built like all Italian towns , and before the earthquake it could have had nothing but the appeal of its simplicity and poverty for the stranger from the world outside , but disaster had lent it tragic dignity . The humble houses stood roofless , with empty windows staring like sightless eyes , and with walls broken where yet standing , or fallen and choking the impassable streets . One found one 's way as through the rubble of an abandoned quarry to what was left of the structure which had been the heart of the place and which stood least harmed among the dwellings that had made it home to the vanished people . The comparative preservation of their church might well have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite gone , but the cornice hanging unsupported by much of the wall rested on the summit of the high altar and contributed to the effect of refuge which the shrine seemed to offer in its immunity from the common disaster . It seemed as if the worshipers escaping there from the ruin around them might have come for a solemn thanksgiving at that altar ; but not a soul haunted the solitude except some chance traveler ; if any of its people ever afterwards returned they made no sign during our stay . They had built nearer the sea a New Bussana , where they had gathered in not imaginably greater safety from future earthquakes , but at least not within sight of the desolation the last had left . I wish I could have talked with one of the citizens of Bussana Nuova , but the traveler is always deceived by that expectation of another day which his convenient sojourn promises . It was such a little way from San Remo that I could easily have gone any other day to hear the story of Bussana Vecchia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one came when I left San Remo itself , and then , of course , I could not go to Bussana Nuova.
