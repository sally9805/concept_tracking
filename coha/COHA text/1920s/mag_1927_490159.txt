WITH not quite alarming fre- quency , five-dollar gold pieces have turned up recently in telephone coin boxes . To the authorities they represent the telltale Tragedy of an absent-minded customer . To us they represent the abortive effort of some silly dreamer trying to get London . CONSIDERABLE interest has been aroused by the announcement that the French Republic is going to erect a thirty-five story building on Fifth Avenue . As usual the man in the street got it wrong . The sister republic 's building is not the French building at Forty-fifth Street . We wish also to say further for the benefit of the American public that the holiday called St. Valentine 's Day is not in honor of Rudolph Valentino , IN ORDER to serve their public most completely , our metropolitan newspapers , veritable hotbeds of mis- cellany , each maintain an elaborate Ming system for clippings and photographs . The Times , we are told , tersely calls its bureau " The Morgue . " The IV oriel , with an eager academic twist , calls it " The Biographical Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wondrous of all , the Graphic 's bureau , where lie catalogued the sins and shinbones of a nation , is the single word , beautifully inscribed , " ARCHIVES . " THOSE ELEVEN lawns in front of Cottage Row in the Village , which have turned up mildly green these many years and brought spring to Seventh Avenue , are doomed . An apartment hotel will be erected on the site , between Twelfth and Thirteenth streets . This , besides scrapping the lawns , several trees , several tulip bulbs , and a nice old wooden fence , does away with the famous group of dwellings known chiefly to the present generation because they ( the dwellings ) sat back forty feet from the Avenue and had porches and balconies almost as French as anything in New Orleans . We read that John Rogers , father-in-law of William C. Rhinelander , bought the tract in 1799 for $5,000 . The lawns will he missed . Fortunately there is another set of them right around the corner on West Eleventh . CIVIC purity  --  never quite secure ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds of soft-coal smoke issue from stacks here and there and smutty up everything . Along both river fronts the nuisance is most flagrant , with the big power plants , the New York Steam Company and the I. R. T. plant chiefly at fault . When the latter cleans its furnaces the immaculate beds of the Roosevelt Hospital nearby are blanketed beneath a coverlet of fine black cinders . We are in a position to report that approximately three tons of soot per square mile fall in a year on the Island . This is strictly contrary to ordinance ; and , although the health authorities , as we have previously stated , will investigate all complaints , the evil can not be completely rectified by law . Every once in a while a power plant is arrested , but the courts listen sympathetically to its statement that if it did n't make the smoke it could n't make power , or keep up the steam pressure , or keep the lights burning on dark days . The Health Department was pleased at one time to arrest the Berengaria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including battleships that belong to the government . Despite all this the city officials say that training and education would make an appreciable change in the atmosphere . Thousands of oil-burning furnaces are not being stoked properly , for instance , and janitors of upper east-side apartments sin daily from gnorance . Guest of the several good cymbal players in New York is Hans Goettich , of the New York Symphony . The other evening a lady found her way backstage to do a little private beaming on the musicians toward whose support she contributes . She picked out Hans to talk to , obviously seeing in him a possible soloist for a party she was planning . " I enjn ) ed your playing so much , " she said . " Do come to the house next Tuesday evening for a little supper and bring your instrument with you . Evening dress , you know . " When you ask Hans about this party you learn that he went . " Oh , yes , " he says , " I went to the lady 's zooper . Und @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAURINE WATKINS , who wrote " Chicago , " is still a member of Professor Baker 's dramatic class at Yale , but one must conclude that she is finding it a little difficult at the moment to get her tuition 's worth , for we are told she is engaged , for one thing , in dramatizing Samuel Hopkins Adam 's open thnist at the Harding administration , called " Revelry . " Not only that , but she is being sought and lionized by interviewers to such an extent that her afternoons are seriously cut into further . The popular opinion is that she is one of the prettiest unmarried girls who ever wrote a successful Broadway play . Miss Watkins is twenty-six , blue-eyed and so bland of smile that one might take her for a mere student in a dramatic class if he had n't seen " Chicago . " She was born in Kentucky , reared in Indiana , educated at Butler and Radcliffe and had planned to devote her life to the classics . She suddenly decided , however , to be a newspaper reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks she had ridden in a taxicab with Al Jennings and was a complete success . Later she interviewed Leopold and Loeb and twenty-eight other murderers , and she now reports that she retired from journalism because she was becoming too fond of writing about murderers . It was after her retirement from journalism that Miss Watkins conceived the idea of spoofing the ladies who kill . She decided to write such a play but , having had one rejected by Leo Ditrichstein while she was still a sophomore in college , she felt that she needed technical training . She came on to Professor Baker 's class , picked up the knowledge she sought , did the play as homework , received a grade of 100 , and sold the script to Mr. Harris , the present producer . ?

" Virtue AN EFFORT to purchase playing cards at Wanamaker 's brought to light a touching sprig of rosemary . The young lady at the counter which looked as if it might be the place to obtain them called the floorwalker and the latter explained that the late founder , Mr. Wanamaker , had promised his mother that he would never sell playing cards in any of his stores . Poker chips are sold and checkers and even cocktail shakers , but , to this day , no cards . Narrative NE of the younger members of Isei the Metropolitan Club confides that he started in a taxi one night last week for a dinner on the upper East Side , having forgotten to transfer his wallet to his evening clothes and having but forty cents in his change pocket . He discovered this as he entered the cab and decided that the simplest thing to do was drive uptown thirty cents worth and walk the rest of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to stop . After driving two blocks the cab hit a rut , the young man hit the top of the cab , and when he came to his senses he was in a neighborhood of tenements and delicatessen stores a few blocks north of 125th Street . Dazed , he managed to attract the driver 's attention and requested that he turn south again . The chauffeur stopped the car , looked his passenger over critically and replied , " Like hell I will ! You had a bottle of gin with you when you got in , and you been drinkin ' all the way up . You get out here . " The story ends with the young man entering his host 's home forty minutes late , with his collar crushed , a large policeman at his elbow and the cab driver behind him demanding $3.70 . Those interested in the moral are referred to the Commissioner of Traffic . Chips and Cherubim ' THE GREAT manufacturer was I- showing some goggle-eyed guests over his Long Island mansion . There were vasty corridors , swimming pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs . But he rather deprecated them . After all , they represented the taste of the fellow who had been the previous occupant . They did not express his own personality . Indeed , only one room in the great house was of his own designing . Would they care to glance at it ? Would they ? He led them then to a shy nook  --  a sheltered chamber reproducing in its murals a wonder in Rome . These had been copied there and brought overseas to the waiting frames . It was the Sistine Chapel in miniature , reborn in West Egg , Long Island . One local variation did rather catch the eye . The furnishings were bridge tables , chips , poker greens , spittoons . It was the card room . Visitor NIR . FRITZ KRETFLER IS in town - again , making his - usual polite excuses for not attending formal parties and leading his usual simple life . He is at the Madison . If you see him emerging from that hotel around luncheon time he is probably bound for his favorite restaurant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him returning , he is most likely bound for an afternoon of reading in that part of his large library on philosophy and art which he has been able to bring with him . He never brings as many books as he would like , however , for his road trips are long , and frequently he complains of being deprived of his library ; but he loves travel too , and he confesses that this partially makes up for his loss . At such small gatherings as he attends the violinist blossoms out as an excellent mimic and raconteur . One of his favorite topics of discussion is Rhine wine , of which he is a connoisseur , and one of his diversions is talking classical Greek when he can find a scholar to converse with him . This is the language he uses with his accompanist , Carl Lamson . His most noteworthy professional hobby is to pick out forgotten melodies and bring them back to life . Once in an Italian palace he saw several yellowed manuscripts in a glass case . He bought the entire collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glasgow , he heard a blind violinist playing in front of the concert hall in which he was to appear . During the first part of his program he was haunted by the melody he had heard . Later he sent for the blind man , had him play the tune and took it down . This is the " Londonderry Air " which he now plays occasionally . It is perhaps not known to everyone that Kreisler Pere , a famous doctor of Vienna , gave up the violin when Fritz put him to shame and then , having mastered the ' cello , abandoned that because of the phenomenal proficiency of a second son , Hugh , on that instrument . He then mastered the viola and , having no more sons , remained content . MIXTURES REPORTED : Applejack cocktail  --  equal parts applejack and gin , colored with grenadine .

" That guy 's a goof , " she murmured sagely . " Why do n't he take less money and book longer engagements until he gets well known ? " Mail VIVIDVIVIDLY azure language that has LY from Park Avenue this winter is due to an unseemly scourge of advertising " literature " which has descended upon the residents  --  recordbreaking hillocks of devastatingly uninteresting mail consisting largely of hospital appeals , automobile allurements , lists of expensively expansive apartments , and other ballyhoo essays disguised as bank books , certified checks and even wedding invitations . The highly irritated settlers have been inclined to blame the Social Register and the Telephone Book , now in its new edition , but investigation , we are able to state , has absolved both and involved instead the Park Avenue Association . This organization , it appears , is providing " exclusive lists " to its membership -- which is less exclusive , apparently  --  at $50 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of mimeographed double columns , newspaper length ) along with the information that the compilers have eliminated " each and every name not logically assumed to be of a class able and likely to purchase the highest grade of merchandise or service without restriction as regards price . " There are really two of these lists . One is called , rather unimaginatively , " Latest M a n u-script Listing of Park Avenue Residents , Including Telephone Numbers , " and the other , with a tender touch , " Prominents of the Near East Side . " Both are classified as " Extremely Wealthy . " Figures THE winter shift of scouts reports I- that skating circles have just passed through a bloodless revolution , two clubs now growing where one grew before , the more exclusive of the two having taken possession of that most modern of rinks , the carefully frozen pond on the roof of Madison Square Garden . It is interesting to chronicle that it is with this latter group , the Skating Club , that Mr. Irving Brokaw , long the dean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue his undimmed passion for figure skating . The members of the Winter Sports Club , the other offshoot , will g , ve themselves to the carnival spirit in the old Iceland Rink . Mr. Brokaw , by the way , is now fifty-five and as unusual a figure as any he ever cut in the ice . Coming into a fortune estimated at $8,000,000 amassed in the clothing business , he has made skating his principal life interest . He began at the age of seven , on the Central Park pond . At Princeton ( class of ' 93 ) he developed remarkable speed and considerable skill at figures . Two years after his graduation he won second prize in the national figure skating championship , and in 1906 he won the championship . It was then that he decided something was wrong with the American skating method , so he took himself to Berlin , became a pupil of Bror Meyer , confirmed his suspicions , and learned a complete new skating system in a month . With the confidence born of this experience he entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year later he improved his skating one hundred per cent by ' changing the style of his skates and his subsequent triumphs  --  all the way from St. Moritz to Ottawa  --  have led , we are told , to the adoption of his method by the International Skating Union as standard in figure skating . MR . BROKAW was one of the founders , with James A. Cruikshank , Paul Armitage and Henry W. Howe , of the St. Nicholas Skating Club , thirty years ago . Twelve years ago he and others , including Otto Kahn , Kingdon Gould and Frederic Coudert , revived the old New York Skating Club , originally started in 1860 . In those days it was a fashionable affair , with a clubhouse on the banks of the Central Park pond furnished with red carpets and a piano , and a meteorologist to foresee skating weather . It later moved to MacMillan 's pond , site of the present Hotel Plaza . Jackson Haines came down from Albany and showed its members how to waltz on the ice and do other incredible things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skating and dancing figures . Two years ago he completed a canvas of a girl on the tip of her skates with arms outfiung , and six months ago came word that it had been hung in the Luxembourg in Paris . This he dismisses as a miracle . He is , by profession , a lawyer . He plays , among other things , polo and the banjo , and has written several books on skating as an art . The Skating Club , of which he is ? now honorary president , is to be closely limited in membership . The Winter Sports Club , on the other hand , already has 127 members and is growing rapidly . The two factions are thoroughly friendly , and some skaters are members of both  --  as well as of the New York Skating Club , which still exists on paper . Without Cost WE FEEL that we are being really helpful in publishing the fact that there are several aluminum companies in town which will provide dinners right in your own home free of charge . One need but telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send food and cooks to cook it and waiters to serve it . The only catch is that just after the half-cups are served a young man in a dinner jacket appears from the kitchen and ? delivers a ten-minute lecture on aluminum kitchen ware . Our advice to the hostess who takes advantage of this opportunity is to remark , in introducing the young lecturer , that she " thought it would be so interesting . " Gone West THERE seems to be little question that the beautiful Rosamond Pinchot has left the stage . There is Mr. Morris Gest 's tear-stained testimony that she spurned his offer of $1,000 a week to resume her role of the nun in " The Miracle , " and there is Miss Pinchot 's own declaration that the theatre just did n't happen to be the right place for her . That much having been decided , Miss Pinchnt appears to be taking life pretty much as she finds it in a 1923 Buick in California . We are now in position to report authentically on her adventures there and to deny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , a cherry picker . The real story is as interesting , however , It all began , apparently , with a plan to go ' West alone and see how she would get on with very little money and no friends . By way of starting , she assumed a name that sounded noth ing at all like that of the former Governor of Pennsylvania and obtained work in a cannery in San Francisco . Although during her first night on the job she ate so many peaches she found it difficult to look at the fruit for days and days , she held the post for six weeks . She worked among some six hundred other women , filling cans and , we are told , was deeply impressed by the gaiety and friend iness among the workers . WHENWHEN peaches lost their charm for her , Miss Pinchot moved on to Los Angeles , where , for a time , she served as assistant to a photographer . Here she purchased the Buick and finally drove off to Fresno , arriving there during the raisin season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with such diligence that her fingernails have not been the same since . Here , too , it seems , the workers were congenial , with the possible exception of two Armenians who labored near her , and who , whenever her back was turned , stole her best clusters of raisins . It appears that raisin-packing is piece work and that each of the Armenians had six children to support . Here , also , Miss Pinchot was threatened with discharge because she rolled her stockings and here also one of her fellow workers offered to find a husband for her . Miss Pinchot , apparently , did n't even consider the offer . Instead , she returned to her Buick . She carne East during the holidays to see her parents but , returning to California , has resumed her touring . Authentic ONE of the most reliable bootleggers we know tells us that the most embarrassing moment of his career came while visiting , for business purposes , the cellar of a Long Island householder to whom he had been referred by a third member of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cased bottles marked with a wide variety of the best trade names . As at Ovingron 's , there was a $30 section , others at $20 and $15 . The prices were so reasonable that they worried our friend . " I 'll have to have it tested , of course , before I let it go out , " he remarked . " Tested ! " exclaimed the other . " Listen , sweetheart , I 'm not selling you liquor . I just deal in bottles and cases , with labels and seals included . "
