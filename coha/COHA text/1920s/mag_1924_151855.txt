William E. Wickenden , director of investigation for the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education , wrote an article in the Tech Review of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . <P> He declared that the greatest problem of higher technical education is the quality of the students . " Not more than 40% of the men admitted to engineering schools complete the courses and are granted degrees . There is the problem of how to get the right kind of young men into engineering colleges . For the 60% failure he blamed the lack of adequate training of high school graduates . He suggested that the engineering school should either close its doors to all save those with bachelor 's degrees in a college of arts and sciences ( " Undemocratic ! " ) , or should lengthen its course to six or seven years , to be divided into a four year training course for deficient high school graduates and a two or three year course for adequately prepared students .                @ @ @ @ @
