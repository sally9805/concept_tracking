Looking daily fatter and persistently genial , President-Elect Hoover last week visited Uruguay and Brazil . The night before **26;10601;TOOLONG he sailed on the U. S. S. Utah from Rio de Janeiro for home . <P> " All the Same Age . " The morning after Mr. Hoover had left Buenos Aires , La Nacion ( potent daily ) printed an exclusive and somewhat effusive interview with him . Some new Hooverisms : <P> " The idea has persisted for a long time that among nations , as in families , there are younger and older brothers . One deduces from this idea that the function of acting as tutor , at least in spiritual matters and many times in matters of policing , is exercised by the older brothers with the supposed younger brothers . <P> " I absolutely disapprove such sentimental or political doctrines or views . There are no young , independent sovereign nations , there are no older and younger brothers of the American continent . All are of the same age from a political and spiritual viewpoint , and the only difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " I see in each nation of the continent a friendly nation and each of the same age , friendly and equal States of a great continent in which great nations progress along an even line as a group of friends as friendly , or more so , than brothers with similar ideals , which lead in new directions to new purposed , all close together and all at equal levels . <P> " The fear of some persons concerning supposed intervention ideas of the United States are unfounded . . . . " <P> In Uruguay . It was dusk when the Hoovers steamed into Montevideo from Buenos Aires . Lights flashed on the city 's tallest tower : " Welcome to the successor of Washington . Welcome to President Hoover . " <P> Cannon crashed in the harbor forts . <P> President and Senora Juan Campisteguy of Uruguay were at the pier . Seora Campisteguy to take Mrs. Hoover to the Parque Hotel where an entire upper floor was reserved , President Campisteguy to have a half-hour with Mr. Hoover at the National Palace . The populace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in most of the South American cities visited , were heard cries of " Viva Sandino " and " Down with imperialistic America ! " <P> <P> The Montevideo police and correspondents of the U. S. press dutifully reported that such shouters were " identified as belonging to a Communist group . . . . " <P> Twenty-one guns were fired again by the harbor forts . The Hoovers went out to where the U. S. S. Utah lay in waiting . The harbor was not smooth . U. S. newsgatherers following by launch were thoroughly seasick . The Utah sailed for Rio de Janeiro with the Hoovers installed in admiral 's quarters , the same quarters that General Pershing occupied when the Utah brought his mission home from Peru 's centenary celebration in 1925 . <P> It was decided to omit Venezuela and Cuba from the Hoover itinerary and proceed , after 60 hours in Rio , direct to Key West .
