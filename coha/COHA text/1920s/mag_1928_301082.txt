To National Biscuit Co. there came last week Shredded Wheat Co. ; to Uneeda Biscuit and other famed National Biscuit products was added Shredded Wheat . Holders of Shredded Wheat stock will be offered one share of National Biscuit for two shares of Shredded Wheat . Shredded Wheat had been for some time a rumor centre , one story being that the breakfast food company would be acquired by Gold Dust Corp . <P> It was 35 years ago that the idea of Shredded Wheat was first conceived . At that time ( 1893 ) one Henry D. Perky , a dyspeptic lawyer , was trying a lawsuit in a small Nebraska town . Breakfasting one morning at the community 's only hotel , Lawyer Perky noticed a fellow breakfaster eating what looked like a saucer of whole wheat grain . He would take a large spoon and break up the cooked whole wheat , add milk and cream , and consume . Curious , Lawyer Perky asked questions : <P> Perky : What are you eating there ? <P> Wheat-man : I am eating boiled whole wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat ? <P> Wheat-man : It is the only food I can digest . It seems to agree with me and give me a lot of strength . <P> Interested , Lawyer Perky tried the boiled wheat , liked it , found it readily digestible . He realized , however , that the average breakfaster would not find boiled wheat particularly palatable , would not go to the trouble of breaking it with a spoon . So he consulted a machinist and worked out a process for drawing the cooked wheat into shreds , forming the shreds into loaves , and baking the loaves in coal ovens . After peddling his biscuits in baskets around Lincoln , Neb. and Denver , Col. , Mr. Perky acquired some money , moved to Worcester , Mass. , started a Shredded Wheat factory . <P> By 1900 Shredded Wheat had progressed from a Nebraska hotel to a Worcester factory ; the next step was the move to Niagara Falls . This transition resulted from the enterprise of William B. Rankine , who had built power houses on the Niagara River but had no factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited Mr. Perky , persuaded him to move to Niagara . Here Mr. Perky built a two million dollar plant , which , however , got him into financial difficulties . Thereupon Mr. Rankine interested various capitalists from New York City , Buffalo and Niagara Falls in the formation of a ten million dollar stock company , one such capitalist being Mr. Alexander J. Porter , now Shredded Wheat President . Mr. Perky subsequently retired from the business , which had become a Big Business , bought a farm in Maryland , near Baltimore , and started establishing a " boys ' and girls ' republic . " The " republic " was to have an agricultural college and a school of domestic science . But Mr. Perky died before his Maryland Utopia could be brought into being . Meanwhile Shredded Wheat continued to expand , has now five factories-two in Niagara Falls , one in Canada , one in California , one in England . <P> It would be difficult to trace National Biscuit Co. back to a saucer of wheat , though its ' original baking companies presumably started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1898 , from a merger of three already large baking companies. *
