If a man be ridden with a great weight of sleep , as one who has tasted mandragora , so that his eyes glue themselves together , and all his functions are dried up in drowsiness , the blood of a rat poured into his veins may avail to remove the curse and call back the soul into his body . <P> This is not a quotation from an archaic book on medicine . It is a theory put forward by Dr. W. H. Taliaferro of the University of Chicago , who has been experimenting with rat blood as a cure for sleeping sickness . " Rats are immune to sleeping sickness , " says he . " There are evidences that they produce certain immune bodies in their blood which will have an important bearing on the eradication of the disease . "
