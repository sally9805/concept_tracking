txt Taxes and Land Speculation . Mr. Bruno Pinkney is right when he Wattles the increased cost of living largely on unrestrained real estate speculation , but there Is a far better cure that he suggests . Apply common sense to taxation and it will effectively abolish this evil . The Supreme Court has said " the power to tax is the power to destroy ' we are foolishly using ft to hamper and destroy legitimate business Taxes today prevent the production of food , of clothing , of houses which we need , and thereby greatly increase living costs . If we will take In taxation only the land values created by the community as a community and abolish all taxes on production , on labor and capital , on houses , on farms , on orchards and on factories , we will destroy land speculation and relieve business of a crushing weight .
